rating,review
bad,Worst company to work for. Management do not appreciate no one but themselves.  Company went down hill after new CEO took over. They work you like a dog with no appreciation. In your team everyone knows your stats instead of being private with management only
bad,A typical day would be coming to work singing in on the phone and making outbound calls through the automated dialer. You are required to make atleast 150 calls a day
bad,"In general the insurance business is terrible, little compassion the owner of the agencies only care about working you hard be there all the time with no respect or gratitude about what you do for them."
bad,I am not one to complain about companies but State Farm was one of the worst companies to work for. It is the biggest bait & switch company i have ever seen. This company is suppose to be the cheapest insurance for local customers and honestly when customers switched to our office it was like they never existed but only when a bill was over due and yearly reviews. The people i worked with were nice but it was just an uncomfortable environment.
bad,training is not the same as the work you will be doing on the floor. They are all about numbers and not the customers. Work will get missed and overlooked cause there is not enough time to get it done.
bad,One of the worst work environments I've ever been in only beat by the United States Postal Service. They value quantity over quality. Their supervisors were mostly college grads who did not have a clue of what they were doing. They say it's an inclusive environment and you should feel safe reporting bad behavior but that is absolutely false. They will gang up on you like a swarm of cobras.
bad,"When interviewing for the position of Claims Specialist - Property Complex, there was absolutely no mention of it being a call center environment. I even directly asked and was told that the call center only applies to the claim specialists in the Express department. This was a lie! It's absolutely a call center where your call times are scrutinized. State Farm values quantity of calls over quality of calls despite customer and employee complaints."
bad,You will just end up making endless calls for an “agent” who benefits from it all! While in the mean time promise you this great further to keep you working for these goals that are pretty much unobtainable and senseless. They say they want to provide need based insurance they don’t they just want to see out going call volume regardless of actual business wrote. There are other options commission is scary but they keep you on the hook offering a salary with crumbs of commission. stay away
bad,"There are departments that are treated well but most departments are overworked, underpaid and over disciplined.... no work life balance or value of employees. I’ve seen mothers cry "
bad,The culture of the company has dramatically changed. The company once was a company that was all about work life balance and very big on family. That is no longer the case. I would say that they have aligned themselves to be more competitive at the expense of employee satisfaction.
bad,Management is horrible. They never show you anything about their operating systems at training. Your first day in your office will be the first time you see their software. Most outside candidates have no chance for success.
bad,Not all offices are the same but the office I was in had a very high turn over rate. They did not pay well and they did not value the workers they had.
bad,"Insurance is a zero sum game, it's miserable work. State farm doesn't care about their employees, only results. Offices are shark pits, no one cares about the customers, they only care about adding policies. It's awful, it's degrading, and the pay is too low to deal with garbage and poor culture. Please, if you value your sanity, stay away!"
bad,they were constantly adding to your work load but the salary never increased. their goals were not reachable and you are micro managed by people who have no clue what it takes to do the actual job.
bad,"tate Farm Reviews | Glassdoor"
bad,"I am a licensed property & casualty agent been in business over 25 years."
bad,n/a State farm took a turn for the worse. I do not recommend working there. No work life balance and managers have more freedom. No morale left in the company.
bad,"The culture is very strict and not conducive to a good home-work life balance. The atmosphere is very eye pleasing but its almost library like in the office. Like anything louder than silence is not tolerated and frowned upon. The people that worked there were "
bad,"Pay was TERRIBLE. Pay was constantly changing and when time came to pay us what was previously discussed, we were told “oh that isn’t in effect until this time” and that time never came. Yes they would buy you the lowest life insurance plan but it was only to boost their numbers. They would buy “leads” and give the good ones to his wife and then get mad when we weren’t getting any response with the list he gave to us. Most of the people I called were DECEASED because the list was so outdated. We would do community events and raffle to win YETI but really it was a scam.  Plus if you didn’t work the event, you still got paid the same as someone who didn’t and split leads from event. However no one ever won unless they bought multiple large policies and even then, they wouldn’t give them away. When my coworker and I tried talking to the owner and his wife about feeling like scam artists, the wife ripped me a new one about not caring if it seemed fair or not because it was their money. Then after that the tension was even worse and I was getting retaliated against. By the way don’t work in an office where the bosses wife also works there because it’s constant yelling and door slamming and no coaching or asking questions because it would cause an argument between them.  We both quit."
bad,They love to micro manage you and treat you like you are not even a person. To them there is no real life only Statefarm and their needs exist. There is no work life balance with the hours that they expect you to work. You get a point for breathing at this place.
bad,"I worked there for almost five years and they didn’t care about me or anyone else whatsoever. I saw the writing on the wall when they wouldn’t hire anyone else that quit, retired or got fired. But they just kept lying and lying. Wanted me to work weekends, Bid for holidays and until 7 pm even though I stated multiple times I couldn’t work that late. They just want bodies in a seat and don’t care about you, your family or anyone else"
bad,"Enjoy the work but Management have poor skills and lack insurance  and key underwriting skills.  And they feel intimidated because you know more than them.  They could care less about life, balance and mental health as long as you get you month numbers."
bad,The agent I worked for did not offer training opportunities and would not allow me to shadow agent's associates at another office to further my understanding of my job function.
bad,"Management is not reliable, to many people working for the company that do not have experience, because of being located in Bloomington, Il.  No loyalty to people that have experience."
bad,"I'm sure working for state farm can be rewarding and fun, but the agents management styles and personal life can affect your quality of work significantly."
bad,My agent was terrible. I hated each day and regretted taking the job. It was not being a true CSR as little value was placed on customer service. Only sales/new business. Especially if it has multiple lines of business.
bad,"For those that are saying this place is okay to work you probably are the ones given the favoritism and nepotistic treatment over others. State farm is a joke. Management  in this company is a joke. They use metrics to harass, embarrass ,and abuse employees. Favoritism and subtle bigotry is the order of the day.  I had a manager who was promoted  from some department and she thought she was above every lower tier associate. She harassed me and bullied me under the guise of performance reviews. The sad thing is that her supervisor and her so called peers backed her up. Supervisors are treated like the most righteous entities you will ever run into but they are abusive and most unethical and no-one including Human resources holds them accountable.  I endured  psychological abuse and bullying  which was done under the guise of  performance management and  coaching. While other associates who were just at the same level in performance  were given promotions while  they had been employed  just for 2 months only because of their racial background.  State farm has high turn over rate. If you are a masochists' and you love  punishment of all sorts, you love being  demeaned  being and closely  monitored by all means this is the work place for you . Other wise it is nothing but a glorified call center which gives you an insurance licence."
bad,Pretty much any independent agent you work for is going to be a shady character out for their own pocketbook and not yours. Unrealistic sales goals mixed with a bad work environment.
bad,"This was a job at an agents office where he was like a dictator.  He monitored computer screens, listened in on phone calls and you had to turn in a point sheet to make sure you were selling.  I wouldn't recommend working here."
bad,I found that my time here was a learning experience. I appreciate the time spent at State Farm Insurance Company. I built great lasting relationships.
bad,"Don't do SFPP. Insanely complicated billing system that takes a whopping 6 months of training to learn but only pays $15.50 per hour. They are closing contact centers  and need bodys, they couldn't care less about the people in the contact centers which is why turnover is high.  This is not a place for people with advanced degrees , you will want to split your wrists. They don't care about any aspect of you, your needs or your life. Please never get sick, it's a hassle to take off to go the doctor. Favoritism is rampant and stupidity reigns. Stay away."
bad,Coworkers were fine but this was the most stressful job I have ever had in my life. Every day was filled with nothing but complaints and problems from the minute the office opened until it closed. That is the nature of the insurance business though and I am not the right personality for this type of work and would never ever consider going back to a job like this.
bad,"If you're looking for an exciting company full of prospect for your future, with management that cares about you...look elsewhere. The CEO changed a few years back, and the new one only cares about money. Hacks and slashes everywhere created huge brain-drain, and the Claims experience results show how bad this is. I strongly encourage you to apply anywhere else you can."
bad,Each office varies and depending on who you work for depends on the outcome and expectations. The insurance adjusters classes that I had to pay for were very beneficial for my future plans but i did not use the class to advance at State Farm
bad,The department is going through A LOT. The customer nor the employees are positively affected by these changes. The workloads are ridiculously high. The knowledge level of some management is ridiculously low. The pay does not support the amount of work is expected as the department is understaffed. Employee expectations are unrealistic. If you enjoy not thinking about work and truly enjoying your vacations (without having to come back to piled work) then don't come here.
bad,Would rather not elaborate. This place was an awful place to work. From the sexist attitude of the owner and his wife to the gossip between co workers. One of the worst job environments I've ever been in.
bad,"The Agent is hardly ever there and they expect you to sell many products to push car loans, credit cards, life policies, bank products plus all the insurances on top of it all for minimal pay."
bad,Was not the job promised or compensation and did not  help with leads.  If you didn't  sell life and health your were looked uppm badly.  Three differenr management systems
bad,"Workplace culture is consistently at a low, agency reps are underpaid and overworked with no consideration for work/life balance and commission structures that are never clarified. Agents prioritize premium over customers, customers over staff, and staff over general well-being (rarely will an agent provide benefits). I regret giving this company 5 years of my career to have been taken advantage of. Great for upcoming experience but be wary of job duties and pay/benefits as they still change during employment as agents are their own business owners. You are NOT a State Farm employee rather a worker bee for the agent while they demand high sales figures they themselves do not meet. It is a consistent revolving door of staff due to poor agency culture and agent morale. Customers are abusive and the behavior is normally overlooked as the agents are typically more concerned with keeping the premium on the books as they get paid on a renewal basis. In the 5 years I ""worked"" for State Farm I have worked with 4 different agents and colleagues have repeated identical issues and concerns as well as confirming no commissions for sales reps on renewal policies as the agent collects at 100%. Expect to go home with about 30% of your sales commissions by the end of it and no time or energy for yourself. Insurance fraud galore on top of it all."
bad,"Horrible experience, immature inexperienced young punks with attitudes run the place. Someone was ALWAYS calling out sick , coming in late. They would come to work high , always spoke in Spanish with their little group . They had little concern for customers, the agents were never there . It was more like high school hangout than a job ! Revolving door of employee’s"
bad,If  you think it’s for you doent find another company or another job to work for this is the worst and stay fair away or you will be living in a box soon
bad,"Toxic envronment and cult culture. Sweat shop. Happy to escape. Still stuck in the 1950s, still cutting heads, still have no clue how to positively engage employees. Still no forward strategy other than increase customer premiums to offset losses."
bad,Horrible place to work. All they do is push life insurance. Stressful sales quotas. Agents are completely incompetent with the systems. Agent's wives act like they are the first lady.
bad,"Our agent was scattered and unorganized. She couldn't train and she changed her daily way of doing business every day."
bad,The computer software always had an issue at least once a week and the agent had no real structure to how he ran the office.  He never really spoke to his office staff and he'd constantly change the commission structure without telling his staff and he never did any marketing for the office business.
bad,"Very stressful environment with lots of pressure put on sales producers to meet quotas -especially selling life insurance - poor management, low commission scale as compared to other companies"
bad,They could be more open to people friendly changes in management and staff.  My experience has been hostile territorial powered caved individuals.  They staff from internal connections and this fosters the behavior and work place atmosphere that I have experienced.
bad,Was bullied by co workers. Managers didnt care and viewed me as the trouble maker because the person bullying me had been with the company for a long time. I have degrees and experience but they would not let me advance but hire people with absolutely no experience into positions. It is all who's buddies with who. Become a favorite and you will go far.
bad,"Worst experience of my life the manger and agent treated you like trash. They were unethical and disrespectful. There was contract bullying in the work place. They would illegally write you up for take your sick time that you earned, which of you didn’t know is illegal and can cause them jail time. They would give you 30 days to pass your exam with no study time. They would write you for the littlest thing. She would see all day on her phone and earring Ford at her desk. She always asked for us to sell and never paid us. They still never gave my my  Commission from 4 months ago. Yet they ask so much from you this is the worse possible place to work."
bad,"There's a lot of fundamental flaws within this company, I personally wouldnt reccomend this to a friend. However, if you prefer a call center; then apply."
bad,I was hired on to State Farm as an office manager. We had a wonderful team that works for the company for my State Farm office that I work for. The office was not even open for over a year and the agent I work for did not get her State Farm license which we were all unaware of what's Happening. Worst place ever to work worst business scenarios ever I've ever dealt with worst customer service I had to deal with and make feel right ever.
bad,Endless computer updates and continually changing software make this a very high stress job when coupled with sales quotas.  Not a very employee supportive company.
bad,Gave notice to leave my position as most responsible adults would do and the agent loses it. I would have been better off not giving any notice at all. I endured negative behavior and nasty and sarcastic emails from the agent as a result of doing the right thing. Do not recommend working for this agent he is very judgmental and sees things one sided in his favor. He has no respect for his employees and talks bad about past employees to other employees.
bad,"If you want to be overwhelmed with lazy agents not doing their job and customers getting upset with you because you can't really help  since State Farm is agent base, then this is the perfect job for you. Also, if you get bored very easy you will get burned out quickly because you're repeating yourself over and over."
bad,Intolerable..Stressful..Unrealistic...No benefits...No respect...No advancements...Greed....Unorganized...Ratrace...Debilitating....Sucks....Sucks...Sucks..Gossip...Just plain ol yuck
bad,"Very unstable environment."
bad,"This is a horrible company that has changed over the years--its great to have on the resume as they did provide extensive training to FT employees, but I would never return,"
bad,"Too demanding for complex claims. BI adjusters have around 300 pending claims and have to handle every aspect from liability, property damage, bodily injury settlements, arbitration and litigation. Compensation is low for demands and hours required. Unable to work only a 40 hour work week"
bad,Claim handlers are encouraged to not spend a lot of time on the phone  and to not thoroughly evaluate the liability decision in an attempt to handle more regardless of quality.
bad,Save yourself a lot of time and aggravation and find another job. This place is a horrible work environment. There are 2 agents in this overland park office. One is worse than other. They will lie and cheat to get whatever they want. I also wouldn't buy insurance from them. I've seen how they treat customers. Please just move on.
bad,My agent was horrifying yours may not be.The staff was a mixture of family. They only bought leads for the family and expected everybody else to make the same amount without leads.
bad,State Farm corporate does not care about its agents and staff members mean even less. Horrible company to work for. It use to care about its customers now it only cares about the money. They also do some questionable ethics with customer information at the corporate level
bad,Stressful environment with lack of benefits and compensation. The better you are the less time you have to work there due to management not wanting to pay you.
bad,This company is not focused on work life balance and basically view everyone as a number. There’s no support and the benefits aren’t great. You have mandatory 10 hour shifts which leaves no room to be a parent or wife.
bad,"Classic bait and switch. My question during the interview process was: ""Do you promote from within?"" I was told they do. I was hired and not promoted while they hired from outside and then had ENORMOUS turnover. If you need a second job, it's fine. It will not pay enough to meet MINIMUM expenses in Dallas, Texas. I worked with some excellent people over my time here. LOWEST PAY IN THE INDUSTRY."
bad,"The culture here is terrible. The point system is a joke. Management act like they’re doctors and we’re  nurses, when really we all have the same qualifications.  It could be a OK place to work but the egos from management make this impossible to happen.  It’s really them who cannot work under pressure so they take it out on the secretaries. I would advise you to run."
bad,"This place is no good. They stink and are not for their people. All they care about is numbers and fast pace. They push their people out the door. People give two weeks and State Farm ask them to leave early. "
bad,"I never loved my job here, but I tolerated it. This was until about mid 2016-2017 when things took a drastic change and now I almost hate my job. They no longer care about the employees, the processes are outdated and unorganized, management isn't great, and it seems like even Human Resources leaves you out to dry when you have true issues. It's very stressful and for certain areas the outlook for advancement is poor. You feel trapped looking at a screen and maybe tethered to a phone all day. The morale is low and no one in the higher positions seem to care although they frequently hold meetings to ""listen to your concerns."" There is no true employee appreciation and it feels like you can get fired at the drop of a dime for nothing. There seems to be no balance when it comes to professionalism as you are belittled by management, agents, and peers and there is nothing that you can do about it. We are expected to juggle several different roles and responsibilities with no raise in pay (for instance, quality). As of right now, unless you are looking for a quick job, I wouldn't recommend State Farm especially if you are looking for a lasting career."
bad,"Had lots of promises given to me that never happened, It was a constant battle with the owner/agent. Never received any training or help. It was basically hurry and get certified and make me money. What have you done for me today situation."
bad,"An absolute joke of a company.  They would expect 12 hour days as you were not allowed to take your laptop home with you. On my first day there in December of 2015, no one knew I was coming, thus it was a complete waste of time.  I sat there for a week while everyone else was on Christmas vacation.  I finally escalated the issue and another Release Lead was assigned to me and he developed a a Introduction Plan to take me thru the different areas of my work day.  I worked with him off and on for 5 weeks.  There was NO steady flow.  It was all start and stop."
bad,"They treat you like a robot and get mad when you have to use the restroom, etc. They set unrealistic expectations for the line of work you do. They fire and hire within the same day."
bad,"Does not support family/work balance, though they state that they do. Poor management and unfair metric expectations. Highly stressful as monitoring of schedule and work load is micro managed."
bad,"sounds great until you work there. they have unrealistic metrics and absolutely do not care about you unless you're a manager. be prepared to be either fired, laid off or the building closing."
bad,"Horrific and stressful, Management and Metrics are too much for the pay. If you’re ok with micro managing and meeting a different metric the ENTIRE time you’re there as in every SECOND, then this is the job for you.  The calls are back to back, and in between calls (which is a mere few seconds) you’re expected to do other “tasks”, which are also measured.  45 minute lunch, when MENTALLY, you need 2 hours. Attendance policy is unreasonable, even for a call center, the turnover is even more horrific and Management seems to pride itself on getting rid of people, no-sense of security overall. Your livelihood means nothing to them, regardless of the faux initiatives and engagement. "
bad,"I was hired as an office manager, not sales, however I was told that I needed to get my insurance licenses so that I would have an understanding of the business. Once I was licensed I was forced to sell life insurance if I wanted to keep my job. I spent thousands of dollars of my own money on certifications that I would never have needed. My employer was not honest with me about what my job would be."
bad,"Do not work here. Horrible place. Agent freaks out all the time. Young staff who want to do well, but not given the opportunity. Stay Away. Too much red tape."
bad,"The owner hired me for a part time position, but then before I was trained he had to have surgery so I was expected to fill in full time hours.  When he was there, he listened in on my conversations with customers and ran into my office to correct me in front of the customer.  When he returned from a 2 month absence, he put me back on part time hours which then caused a financial hardship.  My sales were where they should have been, but I was told sales were not enough."
bad,"Management does not care about nothing but them self , they took off when ever brought there kids to work took actions and doc appts but by lord you better not"
bad,"- Extremely poor treatment of associates"
bad,They don’t consider employees and people. They are all about numbers. My work was great. Customers loved me. Even my stats were above the charts but unfortunately I had a couple of medical/dental related mishaps and they are very strict in regard to attendance.
bad,"Keep in mind that each agent you work for will be different. With that said, this specific agent I worked for was terrible! (I have worked for two.) He made promises he couldn’t keep to customers and they would come in the office and throw a fit. Our office had a very high turn over because the sales team was always upset about the dead leads. The commission structure was a complete joke. My agent was constantly yelling at employees for customers canceling their policies because SF rates increased. The agents all compete for sales goals and are very nasty to one another."
bad,"Stressful place to work, no job security going through a lot of changes. Do not recommend this as a place to work for any type of long term employment."
bad,"I only worked there about 10 Weeks, I seen the boss about 5 times, a young girl that worked there was to busy completing her on-line classes on her lap top with her feet on the desk, some money was missing, and she conveniently found the money when the customer complained that her cash payment the young girl took was not posted to her account a week after she made the payment."
bad,Horrible agent. Horrible - non existant mgr skills. Low commission. No benefits. Agent would golf and yell at us to sell more. Paid $16 which is nearly minimum wage in Cali. Just a nightmare.
bad,NEVER AGAIN! The employees are treated extremely poorly and unfairly. Everyone that I knew personally has quit and has the exact same opinions about this company. Working here was Absolutely Terrible!!
bad,"State Farm is plagued by dysfunctional leadership. None of the leadership is expected to actually know the function that they lead. This causes frustration as many of the metrics, rules, and procedures created and enforced by clueless leadership aren’t realistic."
bad,"The workplace culture is awful and the turn over is high due to the way people are treated. Tenured employees are terminated or quit due to new management. The job is not enjoyable and difficult to watch people come and go for no reason. A typical day at work depends on where you work, manager, and the team. State Farm operates daily regardless of your tenure or skill set using threatening management techniques. Employees walk on egg shells daily in fear of losing their job."
bad,New leadership is not focused on current employees which has an effect on  how the policyholder is treated. I worked at the Jacksonville Operations Center.
bad,"Love my job and working with customers to assist in accidents. Try to figure out what happen in the acciendent by speaking to both parties and making update to repairs vehicals."
bad,The job itself was a joke.  My agent was new and very wishy washy.  Never knew if what she said one day will be what we should do the next.  Would not reccomend.
bad,State Farm has changed a great deal in the years I have been employed here.  This company is no longer concerned with their customers but due to poor management and lack of direction are now only concerned with churning out poorly handled claims as fast as they can.  Leadership at all levels are actively attempting to protect their jobs and place blame for the problems their claim department are suffering upon the employees.  This company is to be avoided by anyone other than those trying to begin a career in claims.
bad,"Horrible company, don't recommend it. Working for state farm, there was no room for growth and when there was, you needed a degree which was ridiculous and you are super micromanaged"
bad,"If you think your Agent has your back like they say they do, think again. If you haven't had any sales experience but you want to grow, find an agent that actually WANTS you to grow. My agent played favorites amongst their salespeople. So the minute that I  wanted to succeed and help build the business, the agent ripped the rug from under me and gave all the sales to (shocker!) the salespeople. This agent only cares about sales. But little do they know, service is JUST as important as sales. If you don't have professionals with customer service experience, your office will go down faster than your salespeople can manage. Because no clients want an office where there are mistreated and misunderstood but sold everything blindly."
bad,I was thrown out to the wolves once I got my license. No guidance just lectures. There was no opportunity to grow and no one to advise. Most of the time you had to call another office to get help and they didn’t want to help because it was taking away from their sales.
bad,Agent is a snake and wolf in sheeps clothing. She treats her employees awful. When you walk in her door it's all bubbles and smiles from her. But once she has had her full with you out the door you go. Many have come and gone from her office.
bad,I was promised a lot of things from my agent that he never followed through on. He lies constantly to where he can’t remember what he says from one minute to the next. He is never in the office. I will never work for StateFarm again.. and he called my coworker stupid and degrades her constantly when he is in the office or if he calls. We are both looking elsewhere for employment.
bad,"nothing good to say, other than I get a paycheck. I know so many people whom are out of leave (stress, medical) they dread coming back to work. It's a slave plantation, no matter what they  (management say), they are right and you my dear are wrong."
bad,The worst job in 20+ years. The lack of professionalism from management was rampant and the environment was completely toxic. That said experiences may vary as it's based on the agent you work for.
bad,"I'm in the top 10% of my field as far as sales is concerned. I have a 62% closing rate. Even with my great closing rate, i couldn't afford to feed myself or pay my bills on what state farm gave me. I changed agencies to another state farm agent 3 times to see if i could get a better package. i was never able to survive without credit cards. They also give no benefits. It's the worst company to work for. I've never worked for a company that needed a union for their agents so desperately. I feel awful for the poor people that are still stuck working for them."
bad,Associates are paid the bare minimum and not compensated fairly.  After working there for a year without any issues my son was hospitalized with serious medical conditions and I was told that I could not miss any more work to be with him or I would have to make it up by also working nights and weekends.  Soon after this experience when my son was home and healthy again I found another position with a different company immediately.
bad,"Its an ok company, but to be honest if you do not have a bachelor's degree then there is no opportunity to grow or advance. State Farm keeps everyone that does not have a degree on the bottom."
bad,this place lacked professionalism and integrity to communicate how to become successful in this business. There was no training or coaching to better yourself for success. Terrible structure and leadership!!
bad,"Change is always consistent which isn't an issue.  However,  when changes are made they don't adjust everything to fit that change. They change one thing and expect everyone to fall in line with it while keeping up with the same old metric set for the old processes."
bad,"Terrible company that is shedding its people and breaking its promises. It really isn't what it seems at first, but after they have you job locked than they proceed to make your life difficult."
bad,"This company has horrible management, work life balance, and pay.  The company does  not promote a healthy work life balance.  Many employees suffer from anxiety and depression."
bad,It was very low pay and very stressful. The manager was hard on me and I felt like I could not advance and according to her my performance was poorly.
bad,"I worked for an agent(in charge of two agencies now in Las Vegas) and it was TERRIBLE. All the agents did not care about their clients. The work environment was HORRIBLE. The office was DISGUSTING(always filled with cockroaches). Very poor training, expected me to know everything without proper training. If you think you can take a lunch within a 8 1/2 hour workday, that is a big no no! They expect you to work through your lunch and still not pay you for your 30 minute “lunch break”. Also, if you enjoy getting yelled/cursed at, this is the place to work at!"
bad,Horrible experience for more than 10 years.  At least I didn't kill myself.  Poor management made it as hard to pay claims and take care of policy holders.  They give you so much busy work to distract from writing a complete estimate and helping people that have been hit by Hurricanes.  Several managers had SF Trainers assigned to follow me on inspections and tell me not to pay for storm damaged because the policy holders are probably not going to renew.
bad,"Work hours that are beyond flexible and hoops to jump through to use your PTO. Seasoned employees are leaving there in drones, so this should say a lot about how they treat their employees"
bad,work environment was horrible.  worst paying job ive ever had. my coworkers were just plain stupid. definitely didn't like this job at all. too much for too little
bad,"For this to be the ""#1 insurance company"" they do not value their employees. Management is condescending. It is impossible to move up in the company. They do not show appreciation."
bad,"You are paid low hourly rates no commission, and worst micro management I have ever seen. Everything is for the Agent, it's like working for a fast food restaurant, Worst job I ever had, in reference to pay"
bad,"greeting new people, making payments, taking bill payments, management was terrible, the boss was terrible spoke to employers nasty , collegues were great"
bad,Working for State Farm I didn't make enough to support my family. The work life balance was fine and management was nice. I didn't have any benefits needed insurance and position that offered more income.
bad,"No work life balance, horrible shift bid options, poor management, minimal training, sever micromanagement of not only floor employees but of managers by upper management."
bad,I worked in three different departments. The company really changed once the new CEO came aboard. It was ALL about the numbers and not the quality. They could care less about taking care of the customers. State Farm had changed too much. I had to leave.
bad,"They are making too many changes, and they are using agents money for marketing. Once you  run out they are quick to recruite another for the same cycle."
bad,"Stressful, no benefits, long hours, insanely low pay "
bad,"I did not like that rules applied to some, but not all.There were double standards.  It just depended on who you were. It sucked!  You start out in the CRC and you can only get out of the department by team leader approval."
bad,"Currently abandoning older employees ,no respect,.no security. Dictator management. Used to be good company. All has changed to a sad sad end. Stay away from a guaranteed heartbreak"
bad,"Over worked, low salaries, micromanaged, horrible office moral, management lacks in office policy and pushes workload to others. Company continues to take benefits like activities, Christmas gifts, etc. Overtime is not acceptable unless you are a favorite employee."
bad,Recent changes and management decisions have made it a less than desirable place to work. It is not the same State Farm that it once was as the company no longer cares for it's employees or customer. It is all about metrics and numbers.
bad,Agent was very disrespectful and rude. Very conniving and did not respect her employees. Did not compensate very well and only looked out for herself.
bad,"•	Identified customer needs, and market appropriate products and services."
bad,"Seriously don't work here,  just trust me.  there are a lot of insurance companies to work for and this is the worst.  they dangle the idea of a lot of money but they can cancel your contact at any time for any reason."
bad,"Work place abuse, degrading, and angry woman.  Worst work environment I have ever been in, I wouldn't wish this State Farm office onto anyone.  She should have her license revoked."
bad,"Just awful...Ive never seen a more unorganized outfit. Contractors were treated like they didnt exist. Everyday was dreaded and ""management"" was abhorent."
bad,Run don't walk away.  Don't even consider it.  I earned no money and got no recognition.  My Agent kept talking about process yet could not articulate prove or define what should be done in any given situation or context.
bad,"did not working there, company went downhill after hurricane Ike.an agency owner I was expected to spend tons of my own money for marketing for the company and did not receive  any support in return."
bad,waste of time and resources. do not become an agent aspirant. its is a ploy for the rookie to do all the work and the agent gets rich. poor system and should be illegal.
bad,"they don't tell you you have ti find your own leads and having to make more then 200 calls a day every day."
bad,Save your time and go with a company that values you. They continually show that they care more about the cash than about their employees and will do anything for the bottom line.
bad,The management was terrible. The agent changed the commission requirements often so that it was nearly impossible for anyone to earn commission. It was NOT a good environment and I do NOT recommend it for anyone.
bad,Hated working there. Management was not receptive accusations every where and the people who actually worked are the ones who arent there now. They pick people who are in cliches.
bad,Turnover rate is high due to no leadership and no management. Goals are unrealistic and there is no training when onboarding which makes it hard to really know what you need to do and what you cannot do unlicensed.
bad,"As a 19 year employee, I was told that the company didn't need me and if I quit the company wouldn't miss me.   I was told that there was no guarantee that I would have a job tomorrow.... the only guarantee was if I worked today I would be paid for the work.   I was a productive employee and received great reviews every year.   The company sees their employees as disposable."
bad,"This company has no empathy for its employees. You're made to work outside the limits of your schedule. This company used to feel like a family, it once was a fun place to work at. Once you become apart of the farm you will work twice as hard and be paid less than any other person in this industry."
bad,The less than two weeks of classroom training is not sufficient enough for the high demands they place on their employees. The expectation is to be immediately successful with very little support. In my time there they consistently cancelled one-on-one's with Supervisors due to Service Levels. Instead of working with individuals in the center the director of the department instructed the Supervisors to put every employee not meeting ALL metrics on a warning. They then changed Quality metrics with very little notice and began culling out employees.
bad,Mundane tasks with very little training. Spent most of my days in meetings and the workplace culture was very isolating. I felt as though my contributions didn't really make an impact.
bad,"When I first started there almost 20 years ago, it was fun.  The. They started to change.  It has been stressful and a lot of us employees were put on antidepressants.  A lot of good people have left the company including me.  Management sucks. They don’t have your back.  It’s all about the numbers not the customers."
bad,"Miserable experience.  Would not recommend anyone ever going to work there. The supervisors are awful.  They are robots. The job is restrictive. Staff is treated like we are stupid.  Every word said to a client is monitored and critisized if you go off script. If you try to empathize for a members loss, you are scolded and reprimanded."
bad,Being laid off due to massive downsizing from the tons of money they keep losing every year with all the new terrible ideas being implemented. Failing miserably. Employees and customers don’t matter. Only the bottom dollar matters. Terrible transition.
bad,soul crushing environment with lack of support or proper training to preform the basic functionalities of job with absolutely no respect for work life balance.
bad,"It's a sinking ship full of confused drones. No real advancement in anything but cut and dry insurance work. My boss was a micromanager and I could never seem to get anything right, no matter how hard I tried and how much passion I poured into my job."
bad,I worked for State Farm for over 3 years and did not find it to be a pleasant experience. Most of my time was in correcting the work of others and dealing with dissatisfied customers. They are too large to be efficient and each time a customer calls they are speaking with someone different and they have to repeat the problem and be sent to another department . Their main concern is to spend as little as possible while charging overly high rates. I would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,Agents are the only ones that make any money on your hard work.  State farm treats you like dirt just wants life insurance and New auto.  Agents are the ones that make the money and don't care about sales staff.  State farm corp are a bunch of Bullies and will not respect you.
bad,They tell you two different things to do and get mad when you do it and nothing is ever good enough for the office manager. Worst work environment I’ve ever been in.
bad,The goals are not realistic when you are bouncing from one agents office to another and starting over every few weeks. your success also greatly depends on the team you are working with in a local agents office.
bad,"Typical day at work: high call volume"
bad,"This company used to be a great place to be. Slowly but surely they took all personal feelings the company used to have, and you promptly became a number. I couldn't leave soon enough!"
bad,"Your entire day is scheduled into 15 minute increments and they allow 10 minutes for ""personal time""m i.e. bathroom breaks, unexpected personal phone call, etc. The actual job role is fairly easy and straight forward. They discourage any sort of positive workplace moral with high-walled cubicles facing away from one another. Management is constantly breathing down your neck and publicly display your metrics for anyone to look at, whether you work in that department or not."
bad,Managers are hard to work for. The SR teams are overworked with  a lot of mandatory overtime. People are put in jobs and left to flounder learning new things.
bad,"Rough environment to work in. Nothing is ever enough. Always have to push for more and more everyday. Lot of politics in the office, basically who kisses up the most is the favorite for the day ( teachers pet) LOTS of sucking up and of course the famous back stabbing was really popular. Will never work for State Farm again. The Company has lost their vision and mind with all the changes implemented within the past couple of years. It's a shame, used to be proud of the company that I elected to insure my life and belongings and also represent. Now the company is an embarrassment."
bad,"State Farm easily the worst call center. This company is so unfair to its employees, select service shops, tow/salvage vendors, and rental vendors."
bad,"Terrible working environment, and no room for advancement. You must be an agent or work for corporate to get anywhere with this company. Would never recommend anyone to work for this company."
bad,Agents don't care about their employees. State Farm is not well monitored by the main company leaving the agents to treat the employees however they want. They expect you to put work before family and punish you for needing to take care of children when needed.
bad,"A typical day at work started with reviewing any telephone calls received prior night and returning  those calls to customers. Internet leads were reviewed and calls to potential customers were made. Telephone calls were answered from clients and potential clients concerning quotes on various insurances."
bad,"Horrible Management, bad pay, no advancement, no benefits. Everything started out fine until the Agent showed a rather racist side and started making things unbearable."
bad,This company under pays their employees along with expects that you can sell insurance when your not licensed to do so. Would never work for them again
bad,"If you value your mental health do not apply here!"
bad,"Not only is the work life balance awful, the management believes they are gods. They treat their employees as if they are lesser beings, abusing them and forcing them to break the law if it means following a script. I would never recommend this company to anyone who wanted to afford to have their own place to live, a car, a vacation, time away from work or a decent job. If you like abuse, though, by all means. Work here."
bad,just bad leadership all around. Did not like the quality of the people that I worked with. The training was good but that is about it. Agents are put thru a bad time.
bad,Management does not support their employees. All they wanted to do is micro manage. Work environment is horrible and stressful. The team members are great though.
bad,The agent I worked for did not keep her promises.  Ii had the pretenses of a good working environment but was not.  Hard work was not rewarded according to the promises that were made.
bad,I feel like there was no management or direction in this office. I was left to fend for myself. I was never given the tools to succeed in the position I was hired for.
bad,"if you want a life in sales, talking to people about their worst nightmare with crushing sales goals to motivate you...go work for your local state farm agent"
bad,"Never work here. Especially for an agent. The agencies are small businesses so if you can find someone who actually cares about you they might decide to pay you what you are worth. Benefits are slim to none, I had to work overtime to get paid time off (regular pay because overtime pay ""wasn't allowed""). Management is horrible because the owners don't care about actually being present. They are too busy frolicking Africa and Bora Bora."
bad,I was told I would receive health benefits but I did not.
bad,terrible work place... very stressful.... no appreciation of the work I did for the agent or the effects it had on my family life or my health at the time.
bad,"Unless it's your own insurance office and you're the agent, working for State Farm is very unfulfilling. You don't even receive discounts for working at state farm. Often times the agents do not pay well unless you sell life insurance or state farm credit cards and thats commission based. Customers are always stressed and frustrated and take it out on you when you're just doing your job."
bad,"Don't even waste your time. There is nothing worse than working 6 days a week every week just to get paid pennies. If you are a gluten for punishment and a miserable life, by all means knock yourself out."
bad,"My job was impacted several times. Had to relocate and was impacted again and given severance. Company cannot guarantee stability anymore. The work environment is not so good anymore since everyone seems to talk about leadership, daily metrics and the dreaded point system."
bad,"Wasn't treated very fairly, wasn't very comfortable working environment, micro management, discriminative, not lgbtq friendly, benefits were ok, vacation was ok"
bad,"Completely insane company to work for. If you want to come to a place where you wish to be productive and supportive, and you want to get things done, look elsewhere."
bad,"Awful micromanagement, they are always breathing on your neck and put too much work load on their employees with a low salary. Employees are only a number, and they tell you lies from the beginning to the end. All that matters to them is the metrics: they don’t care about anything else. Not a great place to work at. Don’t waste your time in a deceitful culture of fear, stress and cut throat: not worth it."
bad,terrible management very unhappy very cut throat.  Benefits were decent.  New way of doing things made things very stressful no training and no incentives.
bad,"Start Farm need to access how they pick their leadership."
bad,"low base pay, no advancement, poor culture."
bad,"I encountered severe episodes of racism and discrimination.   Unfortunately, I do not recommend this organization for any African-American or other minorities."
bad,Most new agents have poor management skills and it's basically a revolving door of employees. If you don't sell enough your treated like garbage and most of the work falls on the customer service employee.
bad,"You can apply over and over and not get an interview even though you have the skillset that they require.  They are looking for the ""perfect fit"" which in reality does not exist.  Don't bother applying as they will not hire from the outside; they tend to hire from within until that person leaves."
bad,"The worst company i have worked. The owner was not aware of the policies he sold, numbers nor invested time. The manager had no managerial skills. I completed my job and everybody elses"
bad,Manager has no management experience. Wants you to come in early and stay late and to not take your scheduled lunch break. Will not pay overtime. No commission on the 1st $1500
bad,"When you are an insurance producer for State Farm,  you are actually working for the agent who owns the franchise.  They generally fall at the under 15 employee rule.  You have no employment rights or benefits.  Its a bitter sweet combo.  I did not like it because selling insurance is just not for me."
bad,n/a It was not a reliable job. It was seasonal. The manager was not good. The training was awful. I learned a lot dealing with different things with ITT.
bad,"I used to love working at State Farm, but over the past 3-4 years, it's gotten progressively worse. Just when you think it can't get any worse, they introduce a new regulation that makes the job more and more unbearable. Currently, there are no sick days and getting a vacation day is like pulling teeth. If you do get sick and need to call in, you will be forced to use a vacation day and they are scarce."
bad,The morale is so low that people are like zombies and treated like robots.  This company is restructuring and do not know what they are doing so the workers are treated like lab rats.  The metrics are unreasonable and management is unreliable support for employees.  It was like working in a prison and people are leaving in droves.
bad,"Auto department is not as bad as Fire, but company as a whole under this new CEO is horrendous! You are not treated as a person and you will be in constant jeopardy of losing your job. They purposely run the company this way so that employees feel like they need to walk on eggshells."
bad,"State Farm has now become one of the worst place to work since the new CEO arrived, The whole company is a joke, please do yourself a favor and not traumatize yourself by working here."
bad,This company is only for themselves and how much they can get from employees and customers. They do not care about people they only care about profits!   They squeeze and squeeze until it's all gone!
bad,"I worked for State Farm for five years in Bakersfield, CA."
bad,Office was always busy but I was hired to be a receptionist and then was forced to get my license when their was not agreement on that. Office has HORRIBLE customer service. Employees are not treated equally. With the experience I had at the office I was working at I would not recommend any one to join that team. Office owner is not fair and has no idea how to train or help employees when necessary.
bad,The people I worked with in the office were always very negative. I was new to the industry and the offered little to no training. My co-workers were mainly about doing stuff for themselves and it became a place I didn't like to work at.
bad,"Once you understand insurance that part is easy, but selling State Farm is hard. Rates are triple what other companies are charging and the agents are confused why no one wants to buy our product. No opportunity for growth unless you want to put yourself in years of debt with State Farm to become an agent. To me this company is not great. They pay ridiculously low and there are NO benefits. You would think an insurance company would maybe give their employees options for life insurance or discounted rates on their insurance but nope."
bad,"All I will say is I was employed for two years there and enjoyed the culture. New manager came, file a harassment claim against her and was let go the same day... Life goes on.."
bad,You work 40 hours to receive 3 hours of PTO. There is no sick leave so if you are sick you have to use your PTO hours. They pay the lowest of all insurance companies.
bad,"Job was very stressful and cut-throat.  Unreachable goals and charge-backs beyond your control.  Work load increased with every sale as you had to manage every new account along with the older accounts.  Management was a joke at best with constant passive-aggressive emails, snarky remarks, and public humiliation in front of the entire team.  Unfair treatment due to other associates in office not meeting their goals (which would prevent incentive pay) but everyone paid commission but me for missing the same goals.  Also was hired as a salary employee but management told us to fill out time-sheets from 8:30 - 5:30 M-F no matter how many hours we actually worked to get out of having to pay us overtime.  No one in the office knew whether they were hourly or salary despite several attempts to have it explained.  Kept getting answers that didn't make sense and to just fill them out.  Very sketchy agent so be cautious of whom you choose to work for."
bad,"Customer service based work is usually about the customers but the manager just seemed to care for himself, customers would come in with issues he would basically ignore their needs/issues, worst job i have ever held"
bad,"Since recent restructuring, employees are now ""micro-managed"" robots. As a claim specialist, the role involves decision making on a daily basis. Under the new model, decision making is expected but not allowed. Local management's ability to lead their teams has turned into daily/weekly meetings reviewing reports with metrics set by ""higher-up's"", who have been away from reality of the job for quite some time. Expectations are not realistic. Every aspect of the job is driven by these reports and data. The industry itself is based on relationships, which have been depleted from all roles within the company. ""ReMarkable"" customer service previously set the company apart from its competitors, and is now very, unremarkable. I would not recommend anyone pursue a career with the company as long as the current, ""new"" model is in place."
bad,"It's a scam,  I hated it customers were constantly lied to because we were lied to was awful.  Tons of complaints not worth the money felt like we were taking advantage of people the list goes on and on...  I hated working there.  Not worth the stress that about sums it up.  I got nothing else to say..   .............."
bad,Bad place . Negative people . Owner did not provide tools we need the. Had unreasonable goals for us. The pay was low. He cut commissions. He said we were salary and we never got paid for all of your hors worked . No benefits. Paid us late on pay day. No direct deposit. So on and so on
bad,"been with agent since they opened their office, agent has no sales experience. not a go getter. not motivated. out of the office even when short staffed."
bad,"While I don't believe the company wide culture is detrimental to a balanced work/home life, I do believe that certain agents really don't care about their employees.  The last agent I worked for was uncaring of hours worked, lack of time off for lunches or time needed off for sick children, etc.  There was a complete lack of support from management and a total lack of responsibility.  Everything was blamed on staff, while any credit was taken from staff."
bad,Regardless of what you do it is is never enough for this company that takes advantage of its employees as well as their clients. Stay far away from this greedy company.
bad,"For years my family was members of the State Farm Family. I was the last to join the fold in 2012,"
bad,Very disappointing place to work for. Not about the employees at at all dont offer help if your sick they dont have sick days you have to use your regular pto. Horrible company
bad,Run for you life. You are not valued as an employee. You can be dying and is rushed to the emergency room you will get points if u leave. Horrible place. Horrible environment. Very Stressful
bad,"Company terminates employees for no reason, micromanages and no work life balance. Company breaks many laws regarding customers and employees and gives criminals access to social security numbers of both."
bad,"when i worked for state farm it was a dog eat dog mess, i didnt enjoy the business of sales and how most agents kept their books not did i like the way the cfo ran off the office and got things done. there were alot of changes going on and i was involved in it and really didnt like it"
bad,"cold calling mostly even if they say it is not, not a fun job too much competition between state farm agents, little pay lots of calling and getting cussed out"
bad,a typical day at work is doing whatever you have to do to get the job done.  management was really bad in communication.  The hardest part was when we were short staff.
bad,I found this experience to be very frustrating.  I felt after a few months in the Agent Intern role that all SF cared about was having me invest my entire life savings into a franchise that they may not contract me for in 1 year.  And I was to have a list of 500 friends and family that I could immediately sell Life insurance to in order to secure my agency.  I do not recommend unless you are tied to a church or organization that will allow you to mine many contacts for sales opportunities.
bad,"wouldn't work here ever again if my life depended on it. Unorganized, stressful and extremely competitive. Make sure you work for an agent that isn't a liar or a dictator. If you want a desk job where you're begging for 5pm to hit, this is the job for you. If you want a job that holds weekly meetings in wee hours of the morning to discuss numbers that have absolutely no real importance to you, this is the job for you! There was absolutely no part of this job that I enjoyed. Lasted 4 months too long in my opinions. I can never get that time back."
bad,Not a friendly environment. Typical day is very busy.  I learned for the first time no teamwork and management is weak.  The hardest part of the job was to get someone to answer a question when needed.
bad,Company makes promises they cannot fulfill. Management is very unprofessional and has no empathy for their employees and agents. I do not recommend leaving your current position for this opportunity.
bad,"At one time, State Farm was the premier company to work for.  But over the last 3 years, they have made changes that make it an impossible place to work.  It is hard to get time off and overtime is constantly demanded.  There is not work life balance considerations."
bad,"You start with an unneeded meeting every morning, you go over the past day - what's coming up you are scored on every aspect of the phone interaction, everyone."
bad,"clean and professional, willing to pay for good quality, facility is closing in one year due to technology, large company restructuring to four major hub areas for claims"
bad,"They make the rules.  you do not get the benefits of a large company and the benefits sucked.  it was also based solely on the commission, so not hitting only led to termination."
bad,"Drastic changes that have been implemented recently has created a tense working environment. Many of the employees have quit and/or retiring. Some of the changes are:"
bad,Management awful.  Treated terrible.  Training awful.  Use old DOS system.  Favoritism.  Like being in a jail atmosphere.  Negative work environment.  Nothing good to say.  My manager was awful as were all of the other managers.
bad,Horrible way the company is heading and the treatment of their employees. No work life balance exists. Horrible management. way too much gossip and unrealistic expectations
bad,Hundreds of offices closing and thousands of people losing jobs with no warning. They don't focus on keeping good talent. I have worked here for over five years.
bad,"A typical day at work includes defending yourself against a hostile work environment, dodging verbal harassment and watching people get paid to dodge the phones and customers. I'm positive not all agents allow their office to be ran this way but it shows poorly on State Farm overall"
bad,"Horrible company. Keep looking.  Micro management, strict schedules .Very difficult to  take time off but you  get  penalized for calling in sick . ts very easy to lose your job"
bad,25 year career of claim service and agency ownership and the company has ruined most of the good people I worked with.  They steal the best of you and only care about branding and trying to act like they want to be competitive in the market place...it used to be a great family oriented place...shame on them!
bad,I greatly dislike this job and department. I don't feel valued as an employee. Management is constantly changing. Your opinion is not valued. Hard work seems to go unnoticed and unrecognized. It's nearly impossible to get a break for a promotional opportunity. It's more difficult to get promoted from within the company than it is to get hired outside of the company. Training is very poor & does not prepare you for your work role.
bad,"No life/work balance. Micro managing. All about numbers, not quality. Vacation time can't be used as we are needed at work due to short staffing."
bad,Great place to work. wonderful team as well as atmosphere. loved working with the people and aiding them in their endeavors to complete work and work work work
bad,"Poor Management, No benefits until after 2 years, no real training."
bad,I rarely saw any of my coworkers because you are set up in  back room alone with just a phone and a list of numbers that you are supposed to call. I had to call over 300 numbers daily to ask if they wanted a free estimate on their automobile or home insurance. Not to many people are friendly when they are called around dinner time.
bad,"High volume call center, T2 time management system that micro manages every single second of the day. Antiquated computer systems that have not been updated to handle the volume of work or  incoming calls. Very little room for growth within the company as many departments have been downsized or removed completely. Days off are difficult to get because available time is never on calendars even if you have the vacation days. Over the last 10 years of working there it has gone from a fun family oriented company, to nothing but number crunching. And although they are a call center, they are not competitive with other call center pay scales. All supervisors are brought in from different areas but none are required to learn the very same Job of the employees they supervise, so they have no clue of the job we do, and If someone wants a supervisor, we have to explain what the issue is and they approve or disagree."
bad,"I was hired on January 1st 2016 and told that it was safe place to make mistakes and that there wasn't a mistake that hadn't been done before or couldn't be corrected. Being completely new to everything, it took me a little while to catch on and I was told it would take time. However, then I was told within three months of my hire I had not progressed and caught on enough. I realized it took me a little bit longer to catch on to things than others with high stress and little direction. I was told how to do something once, wrote down my instructions, and then expected to get it even though they said to come with questions if I had any. But when I did have questions I felt like I was encroaching on their time. I suppose the managers could not be bothered to direct the new hire. It did not help the co workers were highly cliquish for older women."
bad,Ok company to work for if you do not want a strong management team. Staff members seem to know more about policies and how to get the work done more than management. The work is easy to understand and coworkers are helpful.
bad,"If you cant force bank products down every person's throat who calls in, then dont bother working here. Every time someone calls in to ask a simple question because they trust their ""agents"", you must force them to get higher limits of liability or sign up for some other product. If the customer is in a hurry, too bad."
bad,The agent I was working for was extremely selfish. She spoke to people in a manner that was definitely degrading. The pay was horrible. You would get emails for stupid things.
bad,"This company used to be an excellent place to work. Over the past 7 years, it has devolved into a soulless corporate sham of a company. I wouldn't recommend applying."
bad,Great place to work if you have no experience or self respect since you will be treated like a piece of equipment that needs to be run full speed until it burns out or blows up.  They really just want you to be a computer program with a human voice to fool their policy holders that they are speaking to a real person.  I have been in this business over 20 years and this place gave me the creeps. I suppose  it would be alright for someone that has nothing to compare it to.  If you have been around awhile let the kids take this lesson  and keep looking for a company run by human beings.
bad,not the place you want to be. pay was awful. management was deplorable. only good thing i can say is i met some nice people in neighboring cubicles.
bad,This company use to care about their employees.  We are 90 years old.   A new person took over and he does not care about you as an employee.  I do not recommend this company.
bad,I was hired as an office representative. the agent was very unprofessional and after spending several weeks finishing my state farm training to be qualified to sell all state farm products I was fired for very frivilous reasons. Dont waste your time with working for state farm you will regret it.
bad,"This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. I would much rather work a minimum wage fast food job than to work at StateFarm. I was immediately lied to about the starting wage, They will tell you starting wage starts at 12$/hr, then when you accept the position they will say that starting wage is 10$/hr and 12$/hr only when licensed."
bad,"Call Center, Shift Bids, Bid to be off for Holidays, Metrics driven, Overtime required, Nice facility, great co-workers, Extended hours, Multi-state license"
bad,"Very BUSY!! High volume office, I love my co-workers as well as my agent. I love being able to work close to home. You are always learning at this job due to it changing on a daily basis."
bad,"bonus is horrible"
bad,"State Farm became more strict as the customers became more difficult. The job did not pay as it should have and most of the people working in my department did not go to college, so I felt like I should have been in a better position."
bad,"State Farm Agent Aspirant Sales Representative							      Provide sales and management to local office. "
bad,"He was not a good boss and he was drinking in the office while business hours. You would have to continuously call the same people until the boss felt you could have a different stack. I really never learned anything. Management was awful. My co-workers were nice, and very helpful. Hardest part of the job was trying to get quotes for people. The most enjoyable part was when you get quotes."
bad,Confined to a desk all day taking inbound calls. Management requires calls to be rushed so you can meet daily metrics requirements. They don't care about their employees.
bad,Lots of cold calling and is mainly commission based. The company itself is good to work for. A typical day would be cold calling potential customers in hopes that they need auto insurance.
bad,"One of the worst jobs I have ever had......incompetent employer, interoffice turmoil and drama, illegal, underhanded and unethical practices. I don't even like State Farm anymore due to this experience. State Farm is an excellent company but whoever made the criterion for Agents really needs to do follow ups on how effective their leadership and skills are,......and not those online quizzes or tests because they can have someone do it for them. Duh!"
bad,"Many opportunities are established with so much overhead that it is difficult to turn a profit until 6-7 years into business. You are often told that you can start a business for $30-$50,000. However, no intern should consider this opportunity unless they have 5-7 years worth of their prior salary saved to cover your personal finances."
bad,The office was very tough to come back to on a daily basis because of the negative attitude. There was little to any training - much of the culture was developed around a sink-or-swim mentality.
bad,Horrible place to work. Was hired to sell insurance but was made a service agent to handle everything that the owner did not want to do because he was never there. I was hired with no experience in insurance and was given no training at all so learned everything on my own.
bad,high pressure sales environment. salary is temporary. given little or no tools to succeed. agent  was out golfing all the time.
bad,This was by far the worst place to work. The agency owner was incompetent and greedy. He tries to scam employees who wish to leave out of their last paychecks and the company as a whole is flawed and one sided.
bad,"Going on my 5th manager in 9 months. Have been declined for several other positions that I have applied for. Have great results and a great background and skill set but they punish you for any thing they can pick at you for. Never miss work or you will not even be able to apply for other positions within the company. Half of my team has quit and the other half, myself included, are looking for other jobs outside of state farm. Low pay and you are treated like children. I dread coming to work."
bad,"State Farm is a great place to work, but not for advancement.  I have enjoyed working at the company and my co workers.  The hardest part of my job is knowing that someone is hurt or was possibly killed in a car accident.  The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to put a smile on people face and let them know that I care."
bad,"One auto estimatics inspector told me that the claims department had a high turnover.  Obviously he had been a claims associate before because he was 100% right.  The metrics are impossible to reach, especially the average handle time.  If you control the call as the managers demand, they say that you're browbeating the customer.  But if you let the customer talk, you're letting the call control you.  Managers are fake and play mind games with their associates.  The co-workers don't care if you sink or swim; it's every man for himself.  It is a sweatshop that is even slow to pay claims to its own insureds.  They are behind the times and will soon go the way of Blockbuster Video and Kodak."
bad,I am a licensed professional was working with a life insurance company traveling between 300-400 miles a day and needed a change. came to an agent in Fairview park ohio that had no idea how to drive business into the office and limited my opportunity to drive business. he had no Idea what he was doing bringing a sales rep in. state farm in general didn't provide much support to his office that I noticed. my advice would be to very particular in what agent you get hired on with. different agents have different experiences. my rating is low due to him.
bad,"They are more focused on you having low call times versus you taking care of each customer, you are always told what you are doig wrong versus what is right. Management is always flakey and act unprofessional. When you take a sick day they automatically give you grief and threaten you with promotion opportunities. They continue to add more of what you are required to do during each call but continue to lower the time you should have each call handled in. I was promised so many amazing things in the 4 weeks of paid training and was so disappointed when I actually got to the job."
bad,No benefits. Not for any good for hourly employees. The coworkers are wonderful to work with. The hardest part of the job is the pay.
bad,"Company isn't that old, and I started here when they first opened shop. There was no on the site job training, I was kind of thrown to the wolves."
bad,"Works as a State Farm independent contractor agent providing quality service to State Farm customers. Experienced leader in customer service, computer software & knowledge of personal lines insurance products.  Prepare forms, policies and endorsements when required. Provide service to the public and policyholders in a pleasant and courteous manner."
bad,"Very poor management and training, hostile and unfriendly work environment.   No program for training, unanswered questions when you need help. Manager never in office always out on personal leave."
bad,This job is overly sensitive about the way people carry themselves. They do not care about their employees and are quick to write you up.
bad,"Call Center"
bad,Worked very hard cold calling for little money and no benefit.  I worked for two different agents and one was as bad as the other.  Not a good job I would not recommend this to anyone.  You can make more money at Mcdonalds.  I did not like this job at all.  was a good place to learn sales however
bad,"assisting agents and staff with questions regarding their clients insurance policies."
bad,"Claims Department is run by genuinely hostile, spineless fools."
bad,"I worked for a very short period of time with the school"
bad,"This was a strange place to work.  The boss would come in looking disheveled, hair a mess and slurring words.  The boss was on a variety of pain medications that would make the boss stay in bed most days and not come in to the office.    Co-workers would talk badly about the past employees and the boss.  Co-worker had an affair with a customer which was difficult to deal with because of the spouse.  The spouse of the boss would handle claims incorrectly.  When customers would call the spouse would say they had coverage and come to find out they didn't - the boss would cover for the worker.  It was a difficult and very, very dishonest place to work.  I would never work for them again."
bad,I helped my mom and her boss file paperwork enter things onto the computer and take payments.
bad,"Employer needed an agent ASAP. One employee left for family reasons and another was covering for a temp office. Agent needed someone ASAP and said a lot of untrue things in persuading me to come work for him. I did.. 2 months later when employee covering for temp store came back to office i was let go."
bad,"Typical day at work- go in the plexi glass office room with computer and empty desk. Answer phone on 2nd ring and take messages. Retrieve emails by computer and send to Insurance Agent. Some filing. Some xeroxing. "
bad,"Management-Micro managers "
bad,"Bad service"
bad,"A typical workday at this particular agency I worked at consisted of this: calling disconnected numbers aimlessly, being told misleading information by the office agent, having to school said agent on how to do things since he has far less experience in the field than I do, the list goes on. Not to mention, the rates are NOT COMPETITIVE! State Farm is trying to leave Houston due to the increased risk! "
bad,"Heavy work loads for those who are licensed and very, very low pay. Very small office and coworkers were great to work with. One manager who does not know how to manage the office nor employees. The training is bad, hours not good and manager does not know how to talk to employees with making you feel horrible. The most enjoyable part is when you go home."
bad,"Performed data entry, other clerical duties and  administration processing with speed and accuracy."
bad,"A great company, slow to change, low pay and little support.  Currently going through a ton of change to stay competitive with Geico and Progressive.  The companies loyalty to old, bitter field agents is killing them.  Nepotism is rampant throughout the company."
bad,"I would never recommend State Farm to anyone. I worked there approx 6 years and even though there is room for advancement, you will not moved if you are not liked. It is not based on your abilities. They have no compassion for employees even though there trade mark is to provide remarkable service to clients. It start with the employees."
bad,Absolute micromanagement and will push you to a point of no-return resulting in total financial disaster!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"Did not like, treated people badly, was a harsh hostile environment."
bad,"This agent is not ethical. First he hired me for an Account Representative position and then demoted me to a non-sales role without even giving a chance to sell ! Then he tells me that his original job agreement that he signed no longer applies ! And the death blow came when he signed an agreement that he would test my performance for 30 days. Then after two weeks into signing the agreement, he says that it no longer applies ! On top of that he accused me for under-performing in goals that he had not even set of for me. Then after hiring me back for a sales position, he gave me just 3 days to sell and concluded that I can't sell ! EXTREMELY untrustworthy and manipulative guy. STAY AWAY ! "
bad,"Sales and Service of Home, Auto and Life Insurance. Assist customer with claims  process, apply payments to policies, make policy changes, help walk in customers sales of insurance, Cold calling-insurance sales. "
bad,sales and customer relationships se;ling and cross selling
bad,Micro Managers
bad,very stressful. My boss would not let us take any time off or work anything less than ten hour days for 20 a year. Too much stress to barely pay bills
bad,You are a number here not a person. They do not care about you at all.
bad,"The people are phony and will stab you in the back any chance they get. Don't get me wrong, there are some decent people in the ranks, but the overall population is terrible. The pay vs work is not worth it. Look elsewhere unless you like being miserable."
bad,"Long hours, 6 day weeks required and not recommended. Company has no appreciation for the employees- temporary or not."
bad,I would call three hundred people in two hours and ask if they would be interested in having a free auto quote. This job taught me customer service skills and how to be pleasant to those who are not very pleasant to us. The hardest part of the job was working with my boss. She was not the nicest person. The easiest part of the job was taking the information from the customers to do a quote. I enjoyed this job because sometimes you could make someones day.
bad,Backstabbing women and grueling manual labor assembling policies. 1/2 lunches and they want you to account for every single minute! They even time you if you have to go to the bathroom! Completely ridiculous and they act like they own you!
bad,"Please do not waste your time with this company. The management is very poor, and there is no structure."
bad,"If your looking for a low paying office job, and cold calling all day, then this place is for you. You are a telemarketer with a insurance license. Use your license somewhere else, and actually sell insurance and make money."
bad,So after getting my license and looking. Started at a local Colorado springs office. Just know you work for the agent not the company. My experience was the agent was not interested in training. Her husband was office manager and he plopped me in front of a computer said to make cold calls. Their little toddlers in the office while the agent hit the gym. Some are bad places beware.
bad,You are not garuanteed a career just cause you get hired. Many agents are very picky about who they work with. And go for who they personally get along with rather than who can get the job done.
bad,"The agent I worked for did not care about ethics. He only wanted sales on the board. He also talked bad about all of the employees to other employees and kept instigating arguments to ""peak their competitiveness "". He would scream and curse at employees to ""motivate "" them. Also, would threaten to fire employees if they allowed customers to know that he was in the office."
bad,"They're good at extremely micro managing employees.  Never call HR even though they have an open door policy,  this will lead to your demise.  You can be terminated for call avoidance with no proof.  They hand pick who they want to allow to advance and seek higher education.  They will tell you they're all about diversity and inclusion,  but they would prefer you model your white coworkers if you're not white yourself."
bad,State Farm software makes every policy almost impossible to write.  They're stuck in 90s technology.  They still have paper applications.  It's an incredibly inefficient system to work under.
bad,"Metrics and numbers Driven, despite not understanding we are not a manufacturing company. Low salaries, that are not competitive. Reorganizing and layoffs which effectively pushed away talent and didn't cut the unnecessary employees who contribute nothing to bottom line. Too afraid to ever take risks. Thus always late to the game, vs. the rest of the market. Overwhelmed with bureaucracy and red tape"
bad,"They micromanagement everything, Everything has a time schedule. Keep adding duties but the time frame to complete call to after call work has not increased."
bad,Did not like it as there was no family atmosphe and soooo corporate. Forms for everything no atmosphere it was being and outsider and it was not comfortable
bad,It was a horrible experience.  I would not recommend anyone to work there. I think it was more of the agency than the company. There were so much in-house competition over being the owners favorite and one was actually sleeping with the owner. If I could name everything that was going on there I would be here all day.
bad,"Was very excited to work with state farm then after a couple weeks started to see favoritism, cattiness and bullying . How they trained was terrible , would get yelled at every week for making errors that I never received training for . Once I was settled in and kinda knew what I was doing I was given millions of tasks plus everyone elses that they did not feel like doing. Management would make you feel guilty and awful for requesting a day off and  god forbid you ever became sick    "
bad,"The last Manager I was under was incompetent and did not follow protocol. She had many days off. During the time I was there I had 4 different managers. When you’re hired they tell you how great the company is and how you can move up. Then your manager yells at you for posting out to another position with the company. "
bad,"Morale is absolutely low. From the beginning you’re told about all of the opportunities there are, and that you could be promoted in 6 months — wrong. It’s honestly all about what manager you are assigned and how much you’re willing to pucker up. There’s also always a release freeze aka stabilization, meaning you often get pulled from the candidate pool if you apply to another department. Express is a complete mess and I wish I could get my 3 1/2 years back."
bad,"All smoke and mirrors. First week on the floor you will notice depressed under tone of senior employees. Extremely high turn over due to T-2. As glorious as Statefarm sells themselves to the general population, Their attendance policy varies by department. No one policy for the company.Also, Statefarm is the lowest paying company across the industry. Get your licenses and go to a company that will appreciate you and pay you a living wage. Everything varies by department. That doesn’t show value to every employee. Your value is based on your department. Bottom line people are continuously applying to other companies. Statefarm is a sinking ship."
bad,I was new to the industry I didn't get much help in how to go about the calling and selling and the maintenance of customers. I was basically hired and sent to the wolves. I probably would have had a better experience had I been a more seasoned professional. I do not recommend for new people looking to break into the industry.
bad,State Farm has negatively changed and continues to do so. It’s not what it was. Micro management is the norm. Depending on your position and who you know determines your level of happiness. Flexible schedule is untrue in many areas.
bad,"State Farm was great but thanks to current CEO, the company is not what it once was. Benefits are being slashed more and more everyday. I will not retire from there like I once had hoped."
bad,"Executive leadership was ill-equipped to manage such great organizational change. "
bad,"Behind it's well known name is a whole other story--a scary one.  Micromanaging managers, with their cliques....stand over you while you work.  This company cares less about their employees than it's policyholders."
bad,"At first I enjoyed working here but quickly found out the agent who owned this branch was a nightmare. Shes lazy, unpredictable, HORRIBLE at training people, lack of communication. She expects her other employees to do everything while she does whatever it is she does in her office. The pay was horrible also. No benefits."
bad,The managers don’t want to see you succeed and progress. The new CEO is destroying the company. It’s so sad because it used to be a great place to work.
bad,"Managers gossip, start unnecessary drama. Pay is the lowest in the insurance field. Company expects robots. There are set polices that managers disregard and even though they are within the policy, HR says it’s still managers discretion. The company is a joke."
bad,Massive turnover and subscriber losses. Need I say more? Everything bad about call center work was manifest. As shutdown looked massive back stabbings ensued.
bad,"for over 90 yrs it has been a family run business. the last couple of years the company has left family hands and is being micromanaged by a ""corporate type"". SF no longer considers it's employees as assets, does not provide the types of benefits it once did. the biggest notable loss is what they had previously marketed and promised employees in work-life balance.  you are micromanged down to how many minutes you go to the bathroom, if you help a team member and even though it's for the benefit of the team disciplined for it.  SF has consistently fired employees who have FMLA protected medical conditions on basis of excessive absences in right to work states to free up positions in order to retain employees with tenure after eliminating thousands of jobs.  SF would rather pay the unemployment to the FMLA protected workers. If you have any medical condition sever or minor they will harrass you, if you report any company violations anonymously or openly you will be retaliated against ... every dr in this community who has severley sick patients or patients who need regular weeks of for mental health recovery will tell you their primary clients are SF employees. believe me I have inquired persoanlly of many offices obviously not of personal info. but #'s/ correlation to specific employer"
bad,"I really don’t want to go into too much detail because the owner and family are nice and they were friendly. However, I must say that this was the most uncomfortable office environment I have ever worked in. The interview went really well. I met with both the owner/agent and their spouse. The conversation was easy and we laughed a lot. My very first day of employment, in the first 15 minutes of being in the office, without any warning, question, or hesitation WE PRAYED. I have no problem with peoples religion or how they want to practice but I do believe that is a personal choice and a stranger (as I was) should not feel pressured to join you in your practices. My rights were violated daily. Most everything else about the job was fine but the owner was obviously a first time manager. They listened to every single call we made and had a habit of continuing to talk the same lessons into the ground which only takes up more time which we could use to sell. We spent most of our days cold calling. Anyone who is experienced in sales (like me) knows that cold calling is the worst. You won’t get any real support or guidance at this office. Proceed with caution."
bad,"While you could earn extra commission for sales, you had to work hard to reach the numbers to be eligible- this was not that big of a deal as no success comes easily.  However,  the agent would try and discredit whatever he could so he didnt have to pay you your bonus money. He was also very rude, mean, degrading, disrespectful,etc. to his employees. I have never seen people get treated the way they are in this office,  its absolutely horrible. Agents are self employed,  not employees of State Farm so they dont care that he treats them this way. He  only wants to talk to customers that he thinks have money so he can try and get them for retirement products. Some of his sales practices are very shady. Hands down the WORST experience at a job I've ever encountered,  absolutely not a pleasant person to work for. Staff turnover in his office is crazy."
bad,"It sucks to sell insurance and State Farm makes it way harder than it needs to be. Rates are too high, too many people can't get it, and that is all on the company."
bad,"The agency is no longer in business.  The agency was poorly operated.  The Agent lacked people skills, and did not want to work with all customers.  This was a good learning experience."
bad,"State Farm started off as a great company, but it has changed a lot. First, we are underpaid for the amount of work we do and other companies will pay a lot more for this particular position. In addition, management is not helpful at all. They cannot answer your questions or assist you when in comes to career advancement. They are only worried about numbers. They know people purposely enter through cases without properly updating the policies, but will not do anything about it because it will effect the team's numbers. Therefore, the policyholders are charged incorrectly and will send in multiple requests to have the right changes made, but usually nothing is done. Tenure employees even admit how much this company has fallen off and only stay because their so close to retirement. Managers won't correct the problems on the team, but want to gossip about higher ups sleeping with each other; so unprofessional. I would not recommend this job at all."
bad,"Overworked and underpaid. Terrible work life balance. Zero respect for employees. Mandatory overtime or loss of paid time off. Job freeze, so unable to apply for other positions in company."
bad,about four years ago tipsord took over as ceo and completely changed the company.  Now all they care about is profit.  SF makes 5-10 billion in profit a year but keeps cutting pay for employees and agents.  They have also changed the culture.  SF used to be #1 in claims now below average.  It is so sad how one man can ruin an amazing company.
bad,"There is always a bait and switch.  Avoid working for an independent agent.   They don't care about their customers or their workforce.  The will hire you in sales and then load you up with service issues so you can't make any sales calls.  Agents hide in their office.  Most agents can't keep people for very long because they are so bad at being honest and receiving feedback.  Many are young and immature.  I've met many narcissists in this company.  If you accept a job keep applying elsewhere.  They ALWAYS bait and switch and under pay you.  It's a very dishonest company that way,  Each new hire is upset.   They will hire Aspire candidates even though they know a person will never be an agent and it's only to farm leads.  The agents also get payment from SF to have an Aspire employee but don't be fooled, you're just a telemarketer and service rep.   Remember they are using you,  Just get licensed, learn the job while you keep applying elsewhere, or marry the agent."
bad,Horrible.........Micromanaged ......dogmatic management style of Leadership. This could be an incredible company if a shift in perspective toward a growth mindset v.s. power of title leadership/tenure driven ideology.
bad,The current status at State Farm is that employee morale is down. More work is demanded at low pay. Cost of living goes up yet salary does not. The unfortunate management style of ridiculing employees is heightened everyday.
bad,"The way quotes are done is no different from doing it online."
bad,"Open age discrimination and cheating so employees can meet their metrics and the ones who cheat get promoted. "
bad,"Worked there 4 years ago, things may have changed. Management had favourites which impacted if you moved up in the company. State Farm has been bought out and management has changed, therefore things may be different currently."
bad,"I was told i would be making $40,000-$60,000 a year... WAS THAT A BUNCH OF YOU KNOW WHAT. "
bad,"Do not work for SF. They work you to the bone, low pay, no benefits, staff is crazy.It was the worse experience of my life. The stress level drove me right outta there and straight to the hospital."
bad,"State Farm use to be a place to retire from. However, the current CEO has changed everything about the company.  No work-life balance, no flexibility, created a culture of micro management and no room promotions."
bad,"Micromanagement, Metrics impossible to hit, unhappy employees, point system, low pay, not enough recognition for hard work, always changing environment,"
bad,I would never recommend anyone to work with this agents office.  The agent is all about building his status with State Farm and has zero concern for his clients.
bad,Poor company to work considering nothing works for the company that has been in business for almost 100 years. No room for advancement unless you kiss butt.
bad,"my experience working for SF wasn’t good. the management team i was with, not the best, and lacked professionalism.  i wasn’t getting paid on tome and if i was i would only receive half of my pay and then it would almost an IOU. wasn’t happy and decided go leave when i did."
bad,"I would never recommend working for this company. They do not care about their employees and only care about the numbers one can put on the board. It did not matter that almost every call I took was rated at 90% or better. Since I did not take as many calls as the rest of my team, even though I filed the same number of claims, I was fired. My call ratings were higher than much of my team as well. The manager would say, ""you're doing really well with the customers but you aren't fast enough and I don't know how to help you get faster."" So basically I was fired for being too personable with the customers and listening to them when they spoke."
bad,Many departments have had lay offs and have taken to the habit of finding any reason to fire people. Or they make things so unbearable with the micro management that many people quit and go to competing companies.
bad,"They literally had me file physical paperwork the entire time.  I was supposed to answer phones or create a payroll maybe but they were ""busy"" and probably just didn't want me to butt in.  The teacher was upset as well.  This job let me know I definitely don't want  desk job and physical labor is in my blood."
bad,I was warned when I took the job that the manager had 90% turnover. But I had worked with a variety of personalities and thought I could handle it. I was wrong and quit 5 months later. Worked temporarily for another State Farm office but found I didn't care for a captive agency.
bad,"No chance of advancement, I got locked into a department where everyone was miserable and they wouldn't let me move out of that department.  I tried very hard and had superb scores by the agents I advised and assisted.  The only thing State Farm cared about was how quickly you got off the phone call whether it was resolved or not."
bad,"The culture is horrible and the moral is very low.  The supervisors there have very little knowledge of exactly what their employees do, and they spend most of their time spying on their employees by timing how long they are away from their desk, asking visitors to leave your desk if they come by to say good morning or hello. We only get a 30 minute lunch break, and no sick leave. You only get accrued PTO which is to be used if you are sick, or using it for vacation.  new hires and employees who have been there less than 5 years accrue 5.98 hours per pay period.  They use an attendance point system or time clock where you must clock in and out of which gives you a 5 minute grace period to be late for traffic but anything over 5 minutes or (6-15 minutes) you earn 1 point 16-30 minutes 2 points 30-1 hour 3 points, and anything over 1 hour 4 points.  4 points for a full day absence and once you get to 8 points(8-10 points) it's a write up, 10-14 points a second write up, and tour bid privileges are suspended, and 15-18 final warning, and 19 and up termination, no exception.  We have a facility assessment every quarter where we meet in a room w/the entire department and all the supervisors, managers and VPs to tell us whether or not this is the quarter we will finally close.  The answer we get is Jacksonville facility will remain open for up to 1-5 years.  Basically that means it could be 6 mos, 1 year, 2,3,4, or 5, We will continue to have these assessments as needed. No job security, and micro managers.  This is not a place you want to work.  I advise anyone get out while you"
bad,I would not want to go back. It was the most stressful place to work. I hated every day I went there and had horrible head aches. I was expected to sell sell sell.
bad,"I had the worst manager I have ever had in my life, while I was working at State Farm. That woman insulted me, publicly disrespected me and played mind tricks with her direct reports."
bad,"come into work login in to the computer and turn the phones back on, make sure that everyone had the papers they needed sent out, copied, faxed, and ect."
bad,"Improper training, micro managed, unrealistic expectations, false opportunities, an overall terrible place to work. I wish I had read reviews before wasting my time with state farm. Have been a state farm customer myself for years, but after working there and witnessing how customers and employees are treated I canceled my policy and had family members cancel theirs immediately."
bad,I worked in ILR & it was without a doubt the worst job I've ever had. The big wigs had an EXTREMELY unrealistic expectation for us phone agents. This job greatly affected my mental well-being while I was employed there... Got to the point that I hated waking up every morning knowing I'd have to go to this place.
bad,"Under new Leadership - changes taking place no longer provide the excellence in service to customers or support loyal high performing employees."
bad,"Recent layoffs displacing 4,200 employees nation wide.  Arbitrary disciplinary procedures and poor work / life balance.  Training is sub-par and expectations far exceed capacity achieved through training methods."
bad,This company will term you if you don't drink the corporate koolaid and sing their motto. They want someone that will be a puppet. best of luck to you
bad,Too much micromanaging meaning you can barely go to the restroom w/o them asking you where you are going or asking where were you during this time and that time. Do not give you the option to bring in doctor excuses to vouche where you were that day and points get accessed. No longer a family oriented place to work.
bad,"The environment is toxic, changes the commission chart constantly, very moody, if you are not physically working on your computer and are not in a meeting that she approves she will not pay you for your time."
bad,This is a terrible job because you are deceived in the interview process about commission and raises when you receive your license. This business is not going to last much longer with how management turns potential business away with their lack of care and motivation.
bad,Low work life balance.  The company is going backwards in how it treats it's employees and has no idea how to create a good work environment for today's employee.
bad,"Very busy day on Mondays ,I learn to listen and have compassion for others , if not sure about something me and my co- workers share information ,not being able to get off the phone on time , knowing that I made someone's day better."
bad,"Under surveillance by agent.  Everything you say is scrutinized. Email and instant messaging read by agent .Very unprofessional tone in the office from the agent speaking about past employees in negative manner.  Employees did not feel safe to just conversate on the floor even with customers for fear of their job.  Awful working atmosphere and this agent on Meadowbrook in Fort Worth, TX hires to fire and is notoriously known for this.  You have one month to prove your self in sales agenda the agent parades around the office stating that she will not pay any commission. No wonder there was human bile left at the back door of this office."
bad,"Every office with State Farm has and Independent Contract Agent that pays the employees.  We have to be licensed agents with the Bureau of Insurance but appointed with State Farm.  Each owner sets his/her guidlines.  I prefer never to work at this location due to the unfair expections that has been inposed.  Some received better treatment than others.  "
bad,"Goals (expectations) are dumb. You are expected to sell every single product. Way too pushy. Pay isn't the greatest. Sounds good at first, not in the end. Non flexible hours."
bad,If you are a big suck up and back stabber - this place is for you.  If you suck up enough you might get somewhere because it isn't about the work you do.  If you stand up for yourself you can forget ever getting a promotion.  They love to play favorites and you can forget about anything being fair. Be care ful of the downsizing going on - they are cutting jobs and no one knows it most of the time.  They will scrutinize spending the money on sticky notes in the copy room but spend ridiculous money on other things for their execs and management.  I am looking for a new job.  Stressful doesn't begin to describe it.
bad,"so stressful because the sales. clients focus in price not in benefits, so it is hard to be competitive with so highs gap price differences mostly the times"
bad,The manager was the owner and she would not pay overtime but gave you gifts instead. She would not give you a paycheck stub. She would tell you that if you ask for one she would but at the same time she would get mad.
bad,State farm was a temp position that started early in the moring which was good and the day was over before you knew it. The hardest part of the position is the managers treated you like you were temp but because it early getting off made the position seem even better.
bad,Upper management does not really consider honesty as a value. they are only concerned with the bottom line. They are not able to make helpful changes and their policies are out moded .
bad,There is a lot of work and not enough people or time to complete. Unrealistic goals and more responsibilities with pay unlike other companies that are higher for the same amount of work.
bad,Company works hard at ensuring their employees are miserable and made to feel insignificant. Great time off benefits available but their scheduling doesn't permit you to take the time.
bad,Would not recommend working for an insurance agent that has not been in business for longer than 25 years. Sales pressure is intense and work stability is too volatile. Management and leadership is unusually lacking.
bad,"Their team building was mostly arts and crafts, I was expected to make hand turkeys for thanksgiving and color pumpkins for Halloween, was I in kindergarten?"
bad,"State Farm appears to hire ongoing because...No facts but... I believe that possibliy they  recieves Grants from outside sources to hire and retain employees for a minimal of a year to obtain grants monies."
bad,"All about numbers. Nothing else. A lot of work for below average pay. You may like employment at state farm if you are single, no kids, and no life outside of the company. They claim it's all one company, but all every one does is compete, location against location. No real growth opportunities. Raises are a joke. Excessive monitoring. It's like working with a gun to your head."
bad,"I worked here for about 2 months, honestly I wouldn't consider it a bad job but the person thats running the Trenton office is very strict, sarcastic  and not very understanding which can cause good candiates to lose focus/hope in this field.  "
bad,Managers yelled at you if you didn't hit the numbers. Griped about bathroom breaks I was told to apply for ADA if I needed to go to the bathroom on other my breaks or lunch. . A horrible experience. Stay away.
bad,"If you are looking for a career job, don’t work for any agent’s offices. I was promised a lot during the interview process but I haven’t gotten much of what was promised to me. From day 1 I was left by myself and had to teach myself the job, agents are often never in the office. No promotion opportunities in agent’s office, terrible commission percentage, very few leads, when you do get leads, finally, they’re often ineligible or lacking a contact #."
bad,"While at first it seems like a nice company, the problem is in the world of insurance if you aren't able to provide your services cheaper than the guy down the street sales to customers will be more difficult than it's worth. This company charges it's customers too much for the same quality of services than the competition."
bad,"No place for advancement. Compensation would be changed every month, this was with a new agent in the company. Not an insuring employment at all. Would not recommend"
bad,I’ve never worked at a company with this level of employee dissatisfaction. There is no work/life balance. This place will suck the f*ckin life out of you.
bad,"“Sounds like someone has a case of the MONDAYS!”"
bad,"State Farm does no get rid of problem managers they promote them. When I first started the 20 plus years ago, I absolutely loved the company. At that time they treated their employees excellently. Now it’s about money management and State Farm “nice”is gone. Stressful environment, no work life balance. Pay increases are tiny."
bad,"Just look how thirst all the agents are in your area; there will be 4 postings named different things for the same position. There is all this talk of “passive income”. It’s just something to hook you into making 200 cold calls a day. There is worse things you can do with your life, but if begging people to switch with a lie that your company is better is your thing go for it"
bad,I’ve worked here for a few months now and just recently got a new TM who is not fit for her current role. She is unprofessionally close w/her other team members but singles me out for things. I guess on every teams there is one guinea pig and I’m it on this one. I sit at my desk on the phones all day while she chit chats w/her group or sits on her cell phone all day. She pulled to her office to say I showed up on a wrap report. Unbeknownst to me what that was I asked her to except pain. She said it means you were hanging up on customers. I advised her I have never hung up on anyone and was perfectly fine w/all calls being pulled. She did to proceeded to say oh you were on there because you were in wrap up for 3-4 minutes keep In mom you get 7 minutes of wrap up time. Then I was told if i show up on the report again I was fired. I was in shock and couldn’t believe it as my entire team spends their time walking around chatting as she puts them task all day but I I get up to use the restroom or stretch my legs I’m threatened w/ being fired because everyone else on her team she is really close w/ when I haven’t done anything wrong. I have never worked at a more stressful place in my life. This has the potential to be a great work place but the favoritism is definitely shown. My old TM was amazing though.
bad,"Statefarm hires mostly kids and others that they can pay as cheap as they can. If you are buying Statefarm insurance you will pay the most exorbitant cost in the industry but if you file a claim you will be talking to one of these Dallas independent school district twits. In a word , Embarrassing"
bad,"Very, very stressful. There was too much work.It is a work pool environment so the people who actually work when there will end up doing it all.  stressful"
bad,"Worked at SF for 3 years and the culture is unlike any I've seen during my 25 years in corporate management with Fortune 100 & 500 companies. "
bad,"Workplace environment across many departments is considered hostile by employees and complaints to management and HR are regularly dismissed. Harassment and discrimination complaints are not uncommon. Changes are made quickly to job procedures and systems with poor training and planning, sometimes no training or notification at all. There is very little room for advancement within the company and zero ability to move up without a four-year degree. Mandatory overtime is common in many departments with poor work-life balance. Supervisors have ultimate control over subordinates, so if you have a poor supervisor there is no possibility for growth or support. Help can be requested from training or higher-ups but is usually unavailable, leaving reps unable to do their jobs and properly assist customers."
bad,"One job for at least 2 people. Asked too much for one person to do all the reports, answer the phone and nobody else would help answer the phone so I could do my job."
bad,stressful working environment with no career advancement and very little compensation/ pay benefits. There is no structure & systems & processes were never fully functioning.
bad,Everything based on the bottom line -profit.  Get rid of all the experienced personnel and hire people off the street for minimum wages-with no insurance knowledge.  Quite pathetic.
bad,"Manager was in a different state, worked there a almost a year and spoke to her one time. Watched employee pool shrink weekly as they moved people out of state and back filled with contractors. Job was not fun, was not fulfilling, felt like a cog in a machine that had little purpose. Management completely disconnected from reality of operations."
bad,"Change in president caused very negative emoloyee morale.  Those with enough time retired, quit leaving most departments with no seasoned employees.  Management in most departments have adopted an us against them attitude.  Sad to see a company whose founders moto was ""take care of you employees and they will take care of your customers"" fall into such ugliness."
bad,"Micro managed through technology. Very strict time Management. Management able to eavesdrop at any moment. No work life balance. No opportunity for advancement.  Very high turnover rate and always having massive hiring events. Point system is very unfair.  Company not concerned about employees. Most social events in office are done on break or at desk. Example ice cream social- Management came to your desk and passed out the ice cream.  Ice cream was child size and had to be eaten at desk, between calls or on your own time. Not social at all more like all alone. All office events were provided by employees with no contributions from managers. "
bad,"I feel so sorry for the poor folks that work there now."
bad,State Farm's systems are out of date and are practically stone aged.  I have worked for an independent agency in the past with access to over 20 companies and State Farms systems are by for the worst I have ever used.  Their rates are terrible as well.  There is a lot of pressure on you to make sales and it is very difficult considering your rates are about 20% higher than the competition on average.  Their snowmobile rates are great but besides that their rates are terrible.  The State Farm Bank side of things are just as bad.  They are charging thousands in closing costs and high interest rates.  I feel like I am robbing customers whenever I take a mortgage application.
bad,Company has been doing major changes to every department for the last 4 years with new CEO.  The CEO has forgotten what has made the company so successful and is running it in the ground.
bad,"State Farm is a very inconsiderate company when it comes their employees. They treat you just like a number, they have no fight for you and to top it all off  they will willing put you in a position where you’re standing on pins and needles even if you’re sick, or any other reason. I remember coming to work with the flu because if the time isn’t planned you get 4 points which you max out at 20! So imagine recieving 4 points every other week , watch how quickly you max out. They can’t keep employees because that reason also because they tend to treat their customers like royalty but my saying goes if you’re employees aren’t happy how can you expect them to be customer service friendly. Everyday I walked into the job I had a headache, I was stressed out, face started breaking out, literally sitting on the phone 10 hours a day back to back calls with only 45 minutes for lunch and 2 15 minute breaks. This was the WORST COOPERATE CALL CENTER IVE EVER WORKED FOR! period they will make you feel useless, unwanted, and unstable walking on eggshells! If you have applied or thinking about joining this company look deep into your options because this isn’t the place.....you can take that with a grain of salt! Try your luck!"
bad,My expired with state farm was horrible. I am sure it depends on management and not every office is the same.  I would never go back to work  with the same agent.
bad,"Poor management, limited bathroom breaks, your input is never taken into consideration, favoritism, point tracking system for absences and tardies, the more effort you put in your job is never enough for a good evaluation. The manager never seems interested in any challanges the team faces and doesn't take any action to keep employees happy and satisfied."
bad,"SF used to be THE company to work for. "
bad,Claims/Express department is the worst place to work.  The point system doesn’t allow you to have any time off for any family situations. You start with no pto. The management makes work a complete drag
bad,"I’ve worked at State Farm now for more than 2 years. The supervisors can be extremely petty and micro manage you even if they’re not your direct  supervisor. Supervisors are always on their phone ,but as soon as we look at ours it’s a problem. I watched people be fired just because their supervisor didn’t like them or would dig up stuff from a year ago when they were under another supervisor. State Farm needs to update their systems.Their rates are always going up  so you have to deal with angry customers And idiotic agents and their staff who are never held accountable like CCC reps are. The supervisors are unprofessional and gossip. They do nothing but baby sit so it’s an easy check for them. They dont get points or unplanned activity like we do and they act heartless when it comes to our situations. Oh and another thing watch out for your co workers they will snitch on you for the smallest things and your supervisor will keep it secret like you can address hear -say without knowing who said what. The benefits are the swap board and VTO to leave The trainings they offer are pointless and rushed."
bad,"I worked there many years, always trying to make changes for the better and never realizing my hopes.  In fact, it consistently got worse.  More top-heavy, more controls, less interest in the actual business, more fear and domination from upper management, fewer incentives.  Autocratic and bureaucratic leadership structure destroys the ""SME"", ie, value add employee, leaving an empty house of cards ready to cave in on itself.  No core value left, nothing but an empty brand name for inane commercials."
bad,"No work/life balance"
bad,"Company has changed so much it is no longer a pleasant place to work."
bad,State Farm went from a family-oriented company to one who does not care about their employees and sets them up for failure with their metrics systems.  Truly heartbroken with the downfall of this company.
bad,"I left great benefits and salary pay from BB&T to be let go during Hurricane Florence because my roads were flooded and I couldn’t make it. Sent pictures to the boss. As did other employees that were out. I was working on getting my license for P&C almost completed. I have a family with two boys to support unlike others that where employed within the firm. Just very unorganized and unprofessional. Their are a lot of things I can say but I will not. If you are or were a former policy holder you know why this State Farm is not the right company for anyone. The owner is very well taken care of unlike his employees. He does not appreciate the ones he should, that goes for employees as well as ALL policy holders. He has a handful of his picks and that’s it. I went above and beyond for our policyholders and they will tell you this. Out of others I was the one let go and this sickens me daily. Oh yeah, he only pays from 8:15 to 5:15 even if you have to stay late to finish things up."
bad,"It is a very, very stressful environment. At the end of the day it is all about the numbers, no matter what.The focus is all about the numbers. You have to compromise the quality of the work that you do to try to make the numbers required."
bad,"Management is not consistent. Managers make up rules as they go. Many do a lot of work but get no acknowledgment. Their excuse as to why certain reps are not acknowledged or don't make a lot is ""the role is being reviewed"". It's been 3 years now. If  the same rep goes out for a higher position they are shut down for reasons like ""you answered questions slow, or ""you don't have enough experience"". The expectations of work to be completed is definitely not equivalent to the pay CA's make.  People are closing claims with no integrity and being praised for it."
bad,"Poor pay, nothing but cold calls, unrealistic expectations with no support, have to come out of your own pocket to be able to work, passive-agressive to the extreme. All in all, I would rather go to prison. They have standards at least."
bad,Very stressful environment and you are treated like a number not a person.  They only care about making money and not about people anymore.  They are in the process of cutting the workforce in just about every department.
bad,Unstable environment and company on a steady decline.  High turnover due to company being unorganized and uncaring about employees best interest. Typical company that cares about themselves.
bad,"Work is not hard, but backed up in most claims area. Board and people they place in higher positions to make changes do not know what they are doing to assist employees which will benefit policyholders. Its been very stressful and they constantly give ultimatums and push you to entry level positions where they are backed up or quit. Dont recommend working in claims at State farm but if you need a job and can put up with thw mess then go for it."
bad,my position was moved across the country. the pay would have been lower and the areas that the company moved to were not safe areas. lots of traffic issues so the commute was over an hour.
bad,"They were about the employees in the beginning of ILR , Management wasnt well trained more a stepping stone to the next occupation , pay wasnt great when i was there i believe there has been an increase"
bad,working here honestly felt like glorified telemarketing.  I was forced to start at a phone number and cold call people increasing the phone number by 1 each time>  Promised commission never happened.
bad,"I liked the job at first until I was let go for knowing someone who they had fired prior, I had nothing to do with the other rep I feel as though I didn't have a fair chance to show what I had to bring to the company"
bad,If you enjoy being micro managed with no opportunity to get time off and told to work mandatory overtime every week with no work.life balance then this job is for you
bad,"I would recommend the company, but not my old employer/office. The company seems great and allows room for growth, benefits, and good pay. But, that all depends on the agent you work under."
bad,Terrible work environment currently.  Tremendous fears about job security. New CEO too focused on reducing expenses.  Making drastic changes that are unnecessary.
bad,"Got hired heard so many good things was really excited to be part of such a great company. A few changes in upper management and all of that changed. Now its not a great place anymore. Employees are treated as a number. If that! No value in you as a employee, now you are micromanged. Received a higher work load. My entire team is currently seeking other employment."
bad,Poor Leadership. Many changes within Claims Dept that simply do not make sense. Lack of reasonable Work/Life Balance. Reduction In Force. Company is losing many Insured Policies
bad,"I am not there anymore so I choice not to speak about them any longer. I wish everyone there the best. They started out explaining how things were to work with the company, but just never lived up to the things they said. I found myself very unhappy at work"
bad,Not a place for work life balance. Management is sneaky and don’t care about their employees. The schedules are not for people who have families and def not single parents
bad,"The company at one time really cared about it's employees but now every thing is about the bottom line.  The company is currently going through a restructure and laying off thousands of people. Which is fine, companies need to trim fat and keep expenses down but the company is not trying to retain talented employees."
bad,"A typical day at State Farm were speaking with customers and going over there claim. Ensuring that customers understood how repairs, and estimate for their vehicles worked."
bad,"Lack of compassion from management, promised positions never happen, favoritism, rude, full of lies, not a good place to work so i moved on to bigger and better opportunities."
bad,"I was an individual who excelled in stats month to month since employed, but was terminated for "" call avoidance"" with a few calls where i DID NOT get a chance to actually listen to, and was asked what i did in wrap from 2 months ago. "
bad,Maybe I just worked for a bad agent.. But the pay is terrible Best part about working here was the one hour lunch and the window in my office.... Agent was never there so you work by yourself most of the time.
bad,"Worst job I’ve ever had at State Farm Bank. Very political, most managers are unqualified but they have a connection to an executive which qualifies you to do any job. "
bad,"With the recent changes, the Executive leadership has forgotten about the employees. Employees are over work, the buildings are under staffed,and impossible to get time off"
bad,"I will never work for a company like state farm again. I have no benefits, no training, and lower pay than what I deserve. State farm changes their policies so much that I will never see a commission check."
bad,"There is room for advancement if they like you, performance & attendance are important but liking you is there number 1 driver. The parking and time it takes to enter the new facility is ridiculous."
bad,"Horrible restructuring, many employees left over past 2 years"
bad,As a high school intern working in a sales driven work force is not always fair. I felt as though I was taken advantage of because of my age. I was restricted from doing many things with the company because of my age.
bad,They were not a company that encourage growth nor feedback that would help the business. It was a stressful job working at State Farm. My manager was the worst.
bad,they don't care about you.  will reassign you to a new job or a new office with no notice.  You get no choice.  If you aren't mobile you are garbage.  Don't work for them.
bad,"A Company with a 95 year history with many years being the industry leader, has fallen from being the leader and is now trying to re-brand itself from insurance into banking,  I was with the Company 15+ years and at the time I left there were only 2 people left from when I originally started.  Everyone I knew has either quit or been fired for not fitting into the new culture.  Example: A 50 year old person with 20+ years experience working inside handling injury and medical claims was terminated for not accepting a position to climb roofs to do estimates.  Rules are not applied evenly, Example: If your Manger likes you they allow rules to be bent, but I know of a Team of 8 people where 4 have been written up within months.  HR Dept states the Managers are correct to apply rules 100%. Another is a Team of 8 with 6 people quitting within a month.  When I started training was 3 months in a classroom and now its down to a day or two depending on the State of policy."
bad,"Depending on agency, no benefits and low pay for what you have to do, licensing obtainment, and responsibilities. Great starter job however not meant for career."
bad,"The owners is a terrible manager and choose terrible managers.  He is impulsive and inconsistant, has a terrible temper he can't control, likes to create drama within the office between employees and treat women terribly."
bad,Just your typical corporate america. You are just a number constantly being watched.  Management only cares about its numbers and not you. Feels like you are back in middle school.  I honestly think it was a good place to work at one point but has gone through many changes over the past couple of years and has really gone down hill.
bad,"I have never written a bad review on an employer until now. For this to be a big company I thought it would be nice to work for them. Before I started training I explained that I would be starting school in August, I was told that as long as I had a school schedule then everything would be fine. 1week after training I witnessed my manager telling a colleague to choose between her job or her child, she was fired later that day for picking up her sick son. A week after that manager told another colleague that SF was not in the business to care about our personal issues to them our job trumps everything including our families, she was fired for leaving to visit her sick mother in the hospital. 2 weeks later I was told 2 days before school started that I had to choose between my education or my job, I chose my education and resigned. I pray that this never happens to anyone I entered this company with excitement to work with one of the biggest insurance companies in the world and was treated like ""a worker"" nothing more nothing less."
bad,"I worked for SF for over a year and let me tell you, it is the most stressful place you can ever work. The management makes you feel like less than a person and don't value their employees. I felt as if I escaped jail when I left that place. If you don't mind unlimited stress, this is your place. I would not recommend this place to my enemy. Micromanagement is at a all time high. Very limited advancement opportunity as well."
bad,"State Farm used to be a great company to work for.  However, over the past few years, they switched to a call center and the work became monotonous but extremely fast-paced.  You did not have time to do quality work.  They employ EOM which made it seem like you were working on an assembly line rather than being the ""Good Neighbor"" the company represents itself to be."
bad,"Run from this one.  The only good thing is the benefits.  The raises are lousy but, the management is awful.  Does not listen only wants you to work not have any suggestions or changes.  Management will fire you if they do not like you or your facial expressions."
bad,"Worked here for over 20 years.  It once was a great place to work.  There was a work life balance and your family meant something to State Farm.  This changed about 10 years ago and is no longer the case.  Family means nothing.  You are no longer able to talk to co workers you are to do nothing but look at your computer and type.  If you are on the phones that is all you are allowed to do is talk on the phones.  In between calls you are to wait.  It seems like a prison.  Going to work my stomach would be in knots.  Most everyone I know would constantly drink when they went home to deal with the day.  It wasn't worth doing this to your health.  I wish the company could see what they are now doing to their employees for the all mighty dollar,"
bad,they need to get out of the mortgage business and stick to insurance. very difficult management staff old boys club. lack of listening to staff disrespectful.
bad,"Overall bad employment experience. Some managers are great people and really care about you, most don't care and have very poor management and people skills."
bad,Pay is low for the workload and there is a lack of recognition for doing a good job. Always micromanaged. Supervisors and Managers don't know how to do their jobs or hire accountable people. The customer service is awful and all managers care about is being productive and making money so they don't care about the customer.
bad,State Farm cares very li8ttle about their agents.  That would explain why nearly 15 of us just in this area have left the business within the past 5 years.  I have nothing positive to say about the company at all.
bad,"I enjoyed learning the ins and outs of insurance, and State Farm has a wide variety of help and answers a click or phone call away (Thank you ASR/Underwriters). Make sure you do your research, if you are to work for an Agent. This was my experience, but our Agent was all about trying to please the eye, appear to be there for our policy holders, but in reality they would talk trash about policy holders openly, add things to policies with out knowledge. My agent would promise me hours, then the day of take them away, never paid me overtime, and wouldnt pay me all of my comission, this resulted in a lot of extra hours double checking their work which made them mad because it took time away from my sales. They often would go on vacations leaving just one person in the office and expect everything to be taken care of and then would criticize when they were back. I enjoyed talking to the policy holders and had many many wonderful experiences with them. Just make sure you talk with the employees how it really is in the office before working there!"
bad,Very stressful job and a lot of overtime. No time for paid vacation when you need it. Training is terrible they only give you 2-4 week and that is not enough. Management are never around when you need them. Section Manager is not friendly at all and she is very condescending when speaking to you.
bad,The company has been going through a major reorganization for over 5 years. They continue to make work/life balance difficult and rarely take employee needs into account. Micromanagement is a part of everyday work life culture and upper management rarely has recent experience in the position.
bad,"27+ year employee. Used to be a great company to work for. Cared for employees who then cared for customers. Current executive ""leadership"" does not care about employees even a little bit. It has become a terrible place to work. I have meetings with management and it is only about numbers. They don't care about doing a good job or customer service anymore. I'm embarrassed to say I work there now. I presently have about 300 claims assigned to me. A reasonable number is more like 150 - 180."
bad,"The first week out of training, I was walking down the hall.  Two managers were laughing about how over 120 employees were fired, but that a new training class were to work the phones.  That is the culture at State Farm Express in Atlanta."
bad,"I worked for SF for 23 years & loved the company.  We were the best at what we did, they took care of their employees, which motivated employees to work harder than was expected.  But the last three years SF took everything that made them #1 & threw it out the window.  Now everything is measured by #'s.  How many phone calls you take a day & how long you stay on each call.  Employees get shamed if their numbers are not high, meaning if you actually take the time to help someone & stay on a call too long, its considered a no no.  Everything you do is timed, even how many times & how long you took to use the bathroom.  I was told it should only take me 4 minutes.  They no longer train people on insurance policies, the new training consist of where & how to read a word track.  So if a customer gets a new employee & their situation is not in a word track, the customer is basically SOL.  Because new employees are not trained well, it causes everything to be behind all the time, thus long hold times for customers & a backlog of work.  Mandatory OT is always in place.  Employees are working 7 days a week & still can't keep up.  This has lead to hundreds & hundreds if not thousands of employee to leave for better work environments.  This company has lost so many tenure employees its not even funny.  They will continuously be training due to the high turnaround they have now.   They just reported a 1.2 billion operations loss for 2016.  This was not due to any big catastrophe because there were hardly any in 2016.   This is due to poor training and employees paying claims that are not"
bad,State Farm used to be a great place to work but has drastically changed in the last 5 years. There is no work life balance. You are assigned off shifts and have to fight to take legally earned personal time off. There is absolutely no room for advancement unless you are connected to someone higher up in the company. Really sad to see this company failing.
bad,You are a corporate slave. There is absolutely no work life balance. I have had 10 managers in over 12 years and there is really no place to grow or move on.
bad,Liability claims was very challenging.  Management was very abusive and not constructive.  Co-workers were highly stressed.  The stress of the job and dealing with insensitive management was the most difficult part of the job.  I enjoyed the interaction with our company attorneys.
bad,it sucks. the compensation is horrible. nothing for employees. I would not recommend anyone. your studying for all these licenses to get cheap pay. go to another company.
bad,"Worst company I've ever worked for, hands down!!! Pay is worst in the industry for such a big company; policies, processes, and performance metrics are ancient and nonsensical, lower level managers are incredibly unprofessional, partial, and lack any sense of the management profession, upper management is nowhere to be found, employees are treated like high school kids, no wonder attrition is at 50%! Incredible!"
bad,"I've worked for State Farm for about 2 years and I have to get out! This company is awful. I work as a service agent for customers waiting on a new agent to start in 2016. State Farm is by far the worst company I've ever worked for. Upper management could care less about their employees. I've had 3 instances where upper management should have corrected mistakes made against customers and employees, and they've dropped the ball each time. The pay isn't worth the job. The hardest part is being the messenger between corporate and the customer. The billing system takes months to catch up on any changes made, customers get charged for $1-$3 service fees even if they have paperless billing. The processing system for quotes, changes, policy management is ancient! The IT department needs to be completely fired and rehired. The company systems need to be rebuilt to better accommodate employees and customers. I experience at least 3-4 conference calls a week about topics that do not pertain to the betterment of the company. I'm often micro-managed by superiors who get the luxury of working from home. State Farm also increases rates once every year to weed out lower cliental on purpose. The company is so large that it is split into at least 5 different departments who refuse to communicate with one another, which ultimately delays billing and customer satisfaction. Some real changes need to be implemented to better how this company does business. Unfortunately, State Farm is so large that they could care less about their customers."
bad,"When I first started it was great, but things quickly went down hill within the first 6 months. The salary was already not desirable for the position, but I took it for a foot in the door and promises of advancement. Well those promises were broken, and although the starting salary was already low, employees became more frustrated when additional job requirements were added to our already growing workload with know review in salary. After doing some research I found that this company pays the industry low when it comes to insurance, which is surprising since their such a big name with a lot of policy holders. Work, life balance was non-existent, especially when every six months your schedule and manager would change.  Most managers treat you like you're a child and they also micro-manage.  Employees feel under valued, therefore the morale is very low.  Managers are never available to speak with customers on demand, leaving the associate in a position where their yelled at. And it's a metrics driven environment, which feels that it's more so about your numbers and less about the customers. The only positive I can say about this company is that the benefits are awesome and they have a pension."
bad,"This used to be a wonderful place to work.  We were trusted, professional employees.  It was like family.  Now we are nothing but a factory.  Take your break now, take your lunch now.  Do the work you know best, this way because someone needs a significant business result.  I worked in a factory and now I'm back in another factory.  A bad job is better than no job but this hasn't gotten ridiculous.  I haven't been with the company a long time but I see what it is doing to those who have and it is breaking my heart."
bad,Apparently the Co. does not really care about the different offices it seems to me all they care about it the almighty dollar. I used to believe that I worked for a good Company. Not so much in the last 8 month.
bad,"I found I was more knowlegable in certain areas, so as far as learning most co-workers came to me with questions. I didn't have a problem with that as I am very helpful but was surprised at the insurance problems they could not answer. (IMPORTANT - this does not reflect on State Farm as a company, just the agency I worked for). I have no comment on the management. There wasn't really anything about my job that was hard. It was a friendly environment. Auto/Home/Commercial Lines/Life."
bad,"Log in, look at my schedule which is broken down into 15 minutes increments. Managers walking around every 10-15 minutes checking on your work. If you like feeling that you are a child taking a standardized test in school then this is the place for you."
bad,State Farm offers stability but if you don't have the right click you will not move up.
bad,"Cons -Very stressful and micromanage place to work . Very hard for promotions due to everyone else trying to leave department. They  don’t care about employees or customers really.All they care about is metrics and not providing great customer service."
bad,Poor support and training. Not a positive working environment. Promises were not kept on compensation plan.  New agent and owner did not provide support for a new employee.
bad,"Just because you know something doesn't make you a manager. Leadership can be taught in conjunction with additional skill sets that would benefit managers. The leadership needs a lot in the way of direction and support. Productivity suffers when the work force is delivered unrealistic expectations. The standard of work ethic and the ability to teach and foster development falls by the wayside when there are quotas and numbers to reach. Job opportunities are afforded and sometimes there isn't clarity on the expectations of the duties and requirements. For field employees, the need for connection and better communication and resources are needed. Hardest part of the job is the unrealistic expectation that you wont work weekends and get overtime. You wont. Most enjoyable part of the job is the communication and connection with the policyholder. I learned that you lose much more than a good employee when you dispense them and have little value for their hard work and integrity. The turnover is very high and it doesn't take much to understand why. Very sad."
bad,I have worked for several state farm agents in my area and all of them are pretty much the same. It was a decent staff to work with most of the time but merely worked there until I found something better. Agents weren't willing to train you to help make you an agent.
bad,My day depended on the mood of my boss. Some days were great and others not so much. We were either being treated like children or praised and told how amazing we were. This could change within a matter of minutes.
bad,"I had high hopes but this has been one of the worst job I've ever had. The systems are old and are constantly being updated but bugs are always there so you have to find some random work around for something simple as ""copy&paste"". Management is nice but they will not tell you that you're doing a good job, it's always about where you need to improve and what you're doing wrong. I was told that I should know I'm doing a good job and that should be enough. I've made changes to certain procedures and have received no recognition while other coworkers, who have done the same, have received incentives. It's very clique like, and this job is as mundane as watching paint dry."
bad,"At first I was excited to work for the company, learning my job.  But then as time went on I was bullied by my manager so much that i became sick with anxiety which led to me resign. I've never in my life been treated so unfairly, i went through the proper chain of command and still was refused a different manager/team.  I believe i would have still been an employee at State Farm only if someone had my back and helped me through this horrid experience."
bad,What once was a respectable career choice has now become an unbearable job with extremely high turnover. The job has become less about the customers and the culture and is solely focused on meetings metics.
bad,They did not have a good long term idea and ended up eliminating positions only a couple of years after hiring.  They have made changes but would still not recommend.
bad,Company is behind the industry curve on organizational management and customer facing experience. In addition their tools and equipment is out of date.
bad,"Since the onset of Michael Tipsord, the company began it's downward spiral. The company realized this too late and I doubt it will recover. Customer service was forgotten and, numbers became important. Any doubt, take a look at JD Powers."
bad,"They don't stay consistent with their own rules and regulations. They will change a rule as needed. Supervisors have no idea what they are doing in their department. Supervisors are moved around ""as needed"" to cover departments even though they have never worked in that area. Too much hiring by friends who already work there. Promotions are done not by seniority, education or ability but by who you know or recommends you. Raises are based on your performance level. If you don't reach a specific level, you don't get a raise."
bad,"State Farm Claim is drowning because they're grossly understaffed. Working in their call center is tiresome and emotionally exhausting. Good luck, State Farm. You're going to need it."
bad,"A company with a great name but unnecessarily stressful work environment. Opportunities for advancement is given to the manager's pets opposed to actual qualified employees. The team managers usually have limited to zero knowledge of claims yet have the audacity to critique experienced reps' work. The pay was NO WHERE NEAR worth the headache you had to deal with on the daily. Whether it comes from management, lazy coworkers that you have to correct or do extra work for, or the consistent change of daily duties due to the constant consolidation of departments. The benefits are cool."
bad,When I first started working at SF they had a heart.  Sorry to say someone ripped the heart out of the company and they ripped it out of there employees.
bad,This company used for be a great place to work. Now they expect more and more with less and less. There once was room for advancement but now the company would rather outsource.
bad,"It's a tough job in agencies.  Customers take out rising premiums and service issues on you directly and they may not even be your fault but that of the company.  Since the job is not directly working for state farm there are no corporate benefits but one is expected to represent the corporation with loyalty, pride and professionalism for a small hourly wage."
bad,It’s hard finding a place that you can move up in. But when there is no support or motivation it makes you feel unwanted. If I could I would have stayed where I was because the manager had no clue of how to manage or communication.
bad,"Process overkill stiffles progress, advancement and progress.  Thought and logic are suffocated by procedures and endless wasted red tape, meetings, etc. Projects more frequently die from age and over analysis than are ever completed and implemented.  If they survive, they are so watered down, they are no longer effective at anything, much less the original intention.  Poor morale due to restructure which has also resulted on poor company loyalty and quality employee retention."
bad,"This job has changed significantly over the last 3-4 years.  Environment is practically a call center environment. Little flexibility when to comes to requesting time away from the office.  Attendance is judged on a points system which incur to give them more reason to fire you if you're late, even by 5 minutes.  You are judged heavily by metrics with unattainable goals.   Everyone is stressed because of this and it makes it an unpleasant place to work."
bad,"This is the worst place to work. The management cannot make up their minds about anything.  Four years ago they decided to move the Forms Design work from Bloomington, IL to Dallas, TX. A few Bloomington folks relocated to TX but the rest of the team was recruited from all over the US. I was called out of the blue and ""invited"" to come to work for SF. I was living in Austin, they relocated me and gave me a signing bonus. Now after 2-1/2 years they changed their minds and sent all the Forms Design work back to Bloomington, IL. This affected some 20+ people that they had paid to relocate (not inexpensive) some were given new assignments that they had to be trained for, a handful moved to Bloomington, some retired and I was laid-off and now I'm stuck in Dallas instead of beautiful Austin. They have zero regard for how they waste the premium payers money, this is just the tip of the iceberg of the poor decision making and horrible waste of the client's money."
bad,"The job contradicts itself with every phone call you take.  We were told to be personable with customers and that handle time did not matter.  But, when you become personable and more conversational it does make for a long call.  The two do not go hand and hand.  We are just numbers and it really doesn't matter if you do your job right as long as you meet metrics.  So much for first call resolution.  Paid  time off is ridiculous.  You accrue your vacay time, sick time, and pto per paycheck.  It use to be you would get 10 days and still accrue additional time.  Finally, to add the icing on the cake I worked in an Operations Center in which they decided to close so that they can focus on building up our other facilities in Dallas, Phoenix, Atlanta, and Bloomington."
bad,"When you start the day is nice and you drink the cool aid but there is little room to advance unless you relocate to a central hub. The raises are horrible, my 1 year raise was less then $0.20 and the management as some bright spots but don't actually help with anything. State farm will continue to go down hill if they don't change alot to remain competitive."
bad,When they performed their layoff of Business analysts they did a very poor job. I had 18 years on the job and they made us wait 4 months to tell us we were laid off. The environment is toxic
bad,"State Farm is a company that finds you highly disposable. They do not invest nor value their employees. They don't believe in competitive compensation but want you to perform at a competitive rate. Their raises are lack luster and management stress you out for no reason at all. You're better off working at any other insurance call center, at least they pay you for the daily headaches they provide."
bad,"Able to learn alot about financial products and how they can provide a benefit,"
bad,This place has the potential to BECOME one of Dallas' premier workplaces however that will also require a change in management an leadership mindsets!
bad,"Worked for State Farm for over 5 years. Upon starting this was a great place to work, until they no longer cared about employees and only about pushing claims through as quickly as possible. Work/Life balance no longer existed. Over worked and under staffed and they made no intent on changing the situation. The customers and the employees suffered. Only focused on their bottom dollar."
bad,"Time clock tied to phone system for lots of their employees (Workforce Management) and they are serious about it. Probably because it is something they can actually track versus your ability to handle claims (or agent) calls well. Very stingy with time off and you are assessed points if you are more than 5 minutes late. They also have fits if you end up with 30 minutes of extra time on your time card at the end of the week - overtime is not allowed. You also get points for unscheduled absences although they do give you 2 grace periods in a 6 month period. Not a good place if you have small children. Most of the workers are nice but the low pay and time clock / phone system are not good for employee morale. They do have excellent health benefits and a Pension Plan, almost unheard of anymore but I can't recommend it as a good place to work. Open office layout and at times so loud you can't hear yourself think. They have an enormous number of seemingly pointless trivial rules and harp about ""compliance"" constantly. At first I thought they were talking about compliance with state and federal regulations but they include such petty items as the colors / fonts used on internal SharePoint sites. Most companies would call that branding and I find that it cheapens the word compliance."
bad,"No signs of advancement thus far. Probably just smoke and mirrors. Work somewhere else if you can.  Job role is monotonous, supervisors range from very rude to pretty decent."
bad,State Farm is a very stressful place to work.  You are given more work than is manageable and then given poor performance reviews if you don't work overtime to stay caught up.
bad,The company is constantly make changes that continue to negatively affect outs customers and employees. The leadership of this company are not focused on helping it's employees to focus on the customer. It's all about the #'s and that's it.
bad,"Terrible, just don't. "
bad,Do not work here...runnn. the only thing that matters is the numbers. Work life balance is terrible they act like they (management ) don't understand anything
bad,The company has changed drastically over the time I have been here.  They use to really care about their employees but don't know.  It seems like there are just so many rules and numbers that need to be followed or met.  The moral stinks in this company
bad,"My coworkers at the office where I worked were very helpful and super knowledgeable. The agent was focused purely on sales goals. She expected my coworkers to train me, thus taking time away from their sales. "
bad,"While working at Gail Williamson State Farm I learned that some things aren't really what the seem and even though this is a professional position, the work environment is far from professional.  If you like being talked bad about, yelled at, talked down to, and humiliated, this is the place for you."
bad,This this a great place to be if you want to be in a sales environment. They need to hit certain numbers so you must be able to provide your agent with any sales quota he gives you.
bad,compensation was not well. workload is not sustainable.  a lot of their good perks benefits at state farm were taken away in 2017.  managers at state farm could be very inconsiderate and rude.
bad,"Team members are grossly underpaid, while the agents are making well over 150k+.  No sick days and no PTO.  Nowhere to move up unless you're willing to become an agent and have about 50,000 of liquid capital to invest and even then State Farm can choose to terminate your contract after a year.  Very backwards thinking company that doesn't value emerging tech and is stuck in the stone age.  Auto company has serious revenue problems and will continue to lose marketshare to Geico and others who consistently beat their outrageous prices."
bad,"The management creates a very hostile environment focusing on a factory type workplace. They continually push for more productivity with less workforce and pile on unreasonable expectations. They don't care for there employees, you're just another cog in there company."
bad,After years of good service the company posted a loss and immediately started cutting their higher paid employees with made up reasons that they could back up.
bad,"Company wants you to work late weekend shifts every week. "
bad,"No salary offered, tough place to rely 100% on commissions for right after graduation. Management was poor and the agency offers no training whatsoever."
bad,"State farm is not the company it once was. They do not treat employees fairly or even like they are human. Employees are treated like robots. You are forced to track every minute of your day, including BATHROOM. Horrible, horrible place to work."
bad,"Unfortunately the company has changed into its new ""EOM"" model and everything has changed for the negative. The company no longer cares about its employees. Pretty much everyone is unhappy at my level. Those who were lucky enough to get into Trainer positions before the change are happy. People are leaving the company in masses because of the negative environment and heavy workload. You are expected to reach Service Level Objectives that are unobtainable without working overtime. So if you opt out of working voluntary overtime your numbers will look bad. Meanwhile, your peers who worked overtime will get promotions because their numbers look good. The company pays it's licensed Claims Associates practically nothing. Sales people at AT&T are making $45K a year while many of the licensed Claims Associates make less than $30K at State Farm. The customers are calling upset because they can't get through to the person handling their claim. This is due to the unbelievable amount of claims they're assigning to us. All management can tell us is that we need to work harder and that we are overstaffed. Lies and insulting! The entire management team is very unprofessional. How dare they blame the employees who are working like slaves for low wages instead of acknowledging and addressing the actual problem! Your EOM model stinks! It is really sad that the company is going in this direction. I am actively looking for another job. This is no longer a great company to work for."
bad,This was decent for part time work but I couldn't see myself working here full time at $9 per hour.The work was monotonous. Easy but not something I could see myself doing long term so I left. It's not easy dealing with angry people who do not want to talk with you.
bad,"Don't buy the idea that you need $50k to start your agency. Running your agency requires closer to $150k. You will not make any money your first 4 years (I mean, you will break even). So you will need a financial support system or spouse to pay for household expenses while you commit your life savings into the agency. When given a book assignment you need to assume you will lose 30% of it to other agents and customer moving out of the agency after their agent retires."
bad,"Took inbound calls, filed auto or home claim for caller. Environment was not friendly, the company only cares about results not the employees. Employees are definitely expendable."
bad,"Managers have no idea or desire to learn the actual job function that they are ""leading.""  Training is non-existent and I will have a heart attack if they say ""flexible and adaptable"" one more time.  Computer system is ancient and do not care about customers at all."
bad,I worked for State Farm for 7 years. I only got 2 small raises during that time. I never received raises or compensation even when I moved into sales. I would not recommend State Farm to anyone.
bad,I worked for an agent that had just taken over a retired agent's book of business and opened her own agency. The training was absolutely terrible. You were required to work evenings 2 nights a week and place cold calls!! I would suggest working for an agent that has been in business for at least 5 years.
bad,"I feared daily that I would lose my job, they were unkind, they set rules for example like using profanity and then used it while they either were talking or disciplined the employees."
bad,"Overall I loved the things I was learning there and challenging my mind with. I was promised a lot from the agent there and she was unable to produce any fulfillment of those said promises. I was very saddened by the dismissal of my employment since I had left a very good paying job to be with this company. I enjoyed a few of my co-workers and the others were well let's say I found out many ugly truths. I very much enjoyed knowing that I was there to help the people that came to the office, but the hardest part of the job was doing the agents job for her. She was never in the office and yet was able to take the credit for the happenings of the office."
bad,"Great place to work 10 years ago but now it is just another overworked call center. The demands are high, no work life balance at all. Some managers are great but most just micromanage."
bad,This place wants you glued to a desk your whole shift and soon as you hang up they don’t give you much time to finish wrapping up everything they want you back in the queue. Some of the female managers are rude and not friendly and look at other women with the “stank” face and they say they’re professional but after a couple weeks you will see the floor after training isn’t professional. They monitor screens and phone calls without you knowing they sit beside you and plug a headset into yours and listen to calls right by you they don’t make you feel too smart or secure in what you are doing
bad,"The agency owner has extremely high expectations for new sales employees. They expect top results in sales, with little to no training in Sales. The agency owner would always wait for something to go wrong then scold you for it. The agency owner talks terribly about past employees,  and revealing all staffing issues with the rest of her staff. Not a trustworthy person to work for."
bad,"You a promised all the money in the world but if you are not the head agent, it's not likely to happen. You learn good fundamental skills. The software is the top of the line. Not much flexibility if you need to go to the doctor, etc. HQ is not professional and only cares about an instant result, not long term. They care about quantity of clients, not quality so the turnover rate is pretty high."
bad,Was hired as a new agent with no experience. Was promised training and received little to none. Was promised compensation for policies written and for benefits and received none.
bad,"Accepted a position as a Claims Specialist. Never told the position was actually working in a call center environment. Job is not hard by any means. However, training leaves somewhat to be desired, you really have to know what you are doing and pick up the job on your own. Most Team Managers are helpful but at the end of the day, they have to meet metrics as well so watch out if you don't meet yours. Culture is like any other Corporate Culture good people, but negative people also. The job is so alluring because of the compensation and benefits...but that does not make the pressure to meet metrics and poor culture and no work/life balance worth it. Consider other options first. State Farm is much better for their customers than they are to their Employees."
bad,While working with archaic systems it was a constant sense of belittled achievement. Though the customers loved me the other team members were often harsh and judgemental. The head agent was also not very approachable.
bad,Agents expect much from staff.Daryn Farmer agent very rude to employees and not supportivtive to new customer service staff. I had a horrible experience at this agency.
bad,"Writing is on the wall - Management is cutting tenured & skilled employees for raw, new talent at half the cost. Workloads are almost double that of industry standard (borderline unethical business behavior), claim quality is suffering and customer satisfaction was the lowest I’ve ever seen."
bad,"Worked there for about 1 1/2 years management tells you to make decisions for yourself, No help on saturdays when questions need to be answered. If you do ask a question, you get 3-4 different answers."
bad,"“I work for Statefarm” used to be a statement one would make with pride. Unfortunately, someone at the top decided the bottom line(cutting costs no matter the consequence) in the name of customer experience was more important than any employee. This in turn trickled down to apathetic employees who would only do the bare minimum as going above and beyond would only hurt you in the long run. It happens to be an unfortunate trend in the industry and most companies won’t be able to correct the ship due to hubris."
bad,"State Farm introduced a new salesforce platform software, but failed to train the field personnel. Field offices were left to train without any direction, but were supplied training videos.  With busy office activity, time was not allotted for training purposes. Many Agents continue to struggle with the software!   Being a State Farm client, I called for a quote, but my Agent had problems with the software!"
bad,Micromanaging is horrible. You are treated like a child and watched like a hawk. We used to always be rewarded for our achievements and little by little they are taking that all away. They have no concept of work/life balance like they used to. Our bonuses have been decreasing each year and I'm sure will be non existent soon. They are way under staffed so you never have a second to breath.
bad,"(My personal experience ) I applied for a job position advertised that I would make at least 50k a year, Lies even with commission I’d be looking at about 25k. From what I have heard Pay varies agent to agent, However I feel like I invested time and money to get my P&C license to make if not less or equal to my previous job in sales. Definitely not worth it. The agent I worked for provided little to no training, I am commission driven and never cared about the base pay as-long as the commission structure was good, However the fact that a big company like state farm takes it upon the agent to train new “specialist” and doesn’t offer a training program definitely interferes with the ability to succeed. You also don’t get any benefits of any sort like 401k, Dental or Medical."
bad,"Structure study removed over half the staff. Promises of advancement are rarely fulfilled, and are completely subjective. If you need a temporary position, a job here will pay the bills, but try not to get stuck here, you will never advance."
bad,"Bosses are very understanding when it came to family and vacation."
bad,"If you want to become a better salesperson work here."
bad,If you like to sit while working you can and if you like standing you can adjust you desk. The manager's are far from the best. You will be judged! Good luck!
bad,"I never dreamed I would leave State Farm, but it is not the same culture I am use to and I no longer enjoy my job.  I have tried to adjust to change per their request, but nothing I do is good enough."
bad,"Great agent to work for, but there was no training once I started the job.  I worked really hard to pass the State requirements for my license to write policies, but no training made it very stressful."
bad,"As a customer service bank rep, you will start out at $17.25 per hour which is really good. I started in the new Tempe, AZ office by the ASU campus and the facility was superb. However, management was not experienced. I left after a warning, write up, and a final occurred within 1.5 weeks. I took a break 1 min early and got written up for call avoidance. My PTO was denied when my father was sick in the hospital in a different state due to my write up. Overall, a bad experience."
bad,"Working in an independent agency was my first job out of college. My first boss was a nice guy, but he paid me a base commission of $12000 annually - this, plus bonus came out to around 32,000 a year. I hit sales goals and stayed there for two years before going to a new agent who offered me a $32000 base salary. This was a mistake. When I decided I wanted to go to graduate school my new agent terminated me the moment she found out. When I applied for unemployment, she lied and said I broke the rules. After an unemployment hearing and a lawyer proving that I was fired without cause, I was granted unemployment benefits (which she denied simply because she didn't want her insurance to go up. Oh, the irony)."
bad,We got hired on and did months and months of training to end up only doing about 6 months of actual work before the company announced that they were scrapping the department we were hired on for and only a small fraction of us had any opportunity for rehire in a different department. Waste of my time and I wish I hadn't even worked for them.
bad,"After 10 yrs with this company I am making less than $50K per yr. This is after having over 2 yrs experience as a Claim Specialist and over 5 yrs in a claims role altogether. Getting promoted is very difficult if you are not an extroverted person who can make jokes and entertain your Team Manager. There are people who have much less time with the company than me who are able to work the 7-3:00 shift while I am on the late shift. They have us bid on shifts based on our sonority and performance but apparently they don't go by this. My performance rating has been a 2/2 every single quarter, every single yr since I've worked here (I've definitely deserved higher). My manager told me the other day I am an average employee (not true). There is no chance for development. They have a hold on releasing people from departments for other opportunities since they have failed to properly staff - they're calling it a stabilization period. You will not be able to reach your financial goals with this company. The pay is soooo low. Well below industry average which is $55K per yr for a Claim Specialist. They had us on 3 months of mandatory OT. The culture is depressing. Everyone is overworked and underpaid. Also, the micromanagement is insane. You will spend every waking minute trying to monitor too many things all while trying to work a claim. It's ridiculous the amount of things they have put on us for the low pay. And if you do less in the claim, you are seen as a good employee since you were able to meet their numbers (metrics). If you spend too much time (they give you 12 mins after call"
bad,"State Farm encourages infighting among their agents. Company engages in ""chargebacks"" or taking back commissions on policies that aren't on the books a certain amount of time. Saturates geographic areas with agents."
bad,"I worked for State Farm for many years and planned on retiring there.  It was a wonderful place to work when I started, most employees had been there 20 years or more.  After that acting CEO retired and the new one came on, things changed drastically.  It was no longer a place where people felt valued.  We became numbers.  The morale in the work place changed drastically as well.  Some people were so stressed it seemed for a time at least once a month someone was taken out by ambulance.  There are only a few people left with longevity who have stayed on, everyone else has either left or taken early retirement.   I truly loved State Farm, and I'm sad to see the state it has become."
bad,"In the last few years, this company has taken a shift toward bending over backwards for agents and customers, but ignoring employees. Pay is below industry average, and the company keeps cutting benefits. Employees are expected to grind through the daily workload, but aren't rewarded on the back end. Management has made it clear that employee well-being is at the bottom of their list of priorities."
bad,"No worklife balance. No flexibility in schedule. No team building. No job stability. Cold and cut throat climate. Employees just numbers, not people. Workplace environment not conductive team work and freedom to grow and to learn from others."
bad,"State Farm does not have a good culture and the turn over is high due to management, pay, hours, etc. The benefits are great, but employees are micro-managed and do not have any job security. Employees can be sitting by you one day and the next day gone. Here today and gone tomorrow without any notice or reason for leaving. Employees are on a strict time schedule and use a time clock, which accrues points. I highly recommend running not walking away from this company. Life is too short!"
bad,The current trend is to replace the knowledge base with lower paid and entry level that only need to follow a word track. It can be very frustrating for the customer.
bad,Caused mild depression and was basically forced to leave. Caused weight loss and several miscarriages due to being stressed out. They continued to get me to come back after I left.
bad,the worst company to work for. they treat everyone just like a number. your life doesn't matter only the numbers matter. customer service doesn't even matter
bad,"There is no work/home life balance. Your schedule changes every six months or so and so does your team. You can't just put in for time off, you have to bid and hope that there aren't a lot of people wanting the same days off as you. There are blackout days where you can't take off. They micromanage your every move. They base everything off of stats, how long you were on a call, how long you had a call on hold, did you say the caller's name twice..... and so on."
bad,After 3 years of great CIR evaluations I transferred to a new manager that was selected according to shift bid results.  She called me in her cube 4 times a day nit picking and caused me to have a panic attack.  I complained to HR and was fired two days later.  There is no open door policy with no retaliation like they expressed there was.
bad,"Statefarm is not a good place to work, environment is unprofessional.  Statefarm management is unprofessional & unfair.  Statefarm is unorganized and pay is not good.  Statefarm pay is not keeping up with the rising prices of the economy."
bad,Everyone is forced to focus on numbers.The new model focuses so much on numbers that it hinders how you handle the customers. There is no work-life balance because you can never get days off.
bad,"If your considering State Farm, be prepared to work alone, supervisors are never available, always are goofing off and only there to breath behind your neck about your metrics. "
bad,You are micromanaged on everything even if you have to go to the restroom. You are treated like a # and reprimanded about everything you do until you are discouraged. Management will stab you in the back for no reason at all. Company is more focused on metrics than actual performance. You are quick to be written up and you cannot go and talk to management about if you need help or they will belittle you. NEVER make a mistake here even if you are brand new and just walked in the door or you will be fired. Job was continuously threatened even though my metrics and everything was up to part. Management walks around trying to find something to get you into trouble. The morale is very low.
bad,Constantly changing teams with new managers.  Hard to build team morale.  Everyone manager had different expectations. Not knowing what they were until on the team for several weeks. Micro managed and not able to work independently.
bad,"Before State Farm started trying to save money instead of taking care of customers and employees it was a great place to work. But now State Farm is closing offices putting their employees who were the heart of the business out of a job who has been there for 10+ years. Only concerned about how not to pay customers, non-existent managers whom would not take a call for a complaint but yet put it back on the employee or have employee take a message for a poss callback."
bad,"nothing to say, constantly changing policies and procedures with no chances of additional training to better skills on new changes and updates. benefits are great"
bad,Just Terrible! The job culture was very hostile because management would have their pick of favorites. The beginning pay for customer service representative was 13.50 an hour
bad,The new agent threatened to take my paycheck from me just because i have decided to leave. which is entirely not fair and now i dont have money to provide for my family. what an evil woman.
bad,"The State Farm brand is very competitive in comparison to other companies out in the market, but internally there is very poor management, and very little hands-on training is provided to new employees. It is not a company that provides an opportunity for growth from within, and the office environment can be very cut-throat. It's an environment that creates an ""every man for himself"" kind-of atmosphere. Personally, what I enjoyed was meeting with clients in the community and growing in my customer service skills. Other than these benefits, State Farm doesn't offer much more to their agent's staff and customer service reps."
bad,no advancement. compete with co workers who don't want to help you learn as you become competition to them. I don't believe anyone should have to work here it is mentally draining and the abuse from all customers is not worth the pay.
bad,A terrible company to work for.  Very stressful and micromanaged at a level I didn't think existed.  Lots of politics and abuse of the new metric system used to determine productivity.
bad,"I only enjoyed working their because a girl friend of mine worked their. She made it really fun. I learned how to get coverage, and why I am getting the coverage. It is very important to know. Also, helpful because you can get multi line discounts."
bad,"A typical day of work is likely standard for the industry, consisting of reviewing and evaluating bodily injury claims in Ontario. Some field work included, which is travel to mediation's or pre-trials in the province."
bad,"State Farm used to be a great company, but has since gone through a reorganization. Everything is documented--everything down to bathroom breaks. No time off available. Don't do it!"
bad,"The pay increase was great , teammates were nice ,and bonus was nice , always had potlucks , and benefits were nice , they also need a 401k match, but the constant verbal abusive from agents didn't really outweigh the pros of the company."
bad,"State Farm makes it very difficult for you to balance the work place and home life. The shift schedule assigned to you is by random and not choice. If you are unable to work the shift assigned to you, then you are told to find a job else where."
bad,"Log into Phones at 3:30. From there we had 30 minutes of "" development time"" then at 4 the phones go live and from there we speak with customers in order to change and review policies."
bad,"The agents are cheap no benefits ,no sick time . No raises , it's a revolving door.  The only con is a work balance life. It's a revolving door for the company. The agents only care about themselves"
bad,"After many years with State Farm, the changes in customer service, how the employees are treated, and managements lack of support is awful.  The customer is not treated as they should. Employees are micro-managed. Your work is never good enough.  Mandatory OT most of the time.  Unable to use vacation time as the dates are blacked out with no capacity to use your time.  Management is not there to support you and cannot be trusted."
bad,"A typical day at work is answering call from people all over and getting micro manage by a knocked kneed supervisor who been a supervisor for a year and does not know what she is doing. All the favoritism is noticeable. Supervisor and their friends just meets at each other cubical all day and gossip. The  hardest part of the job is meeting you numbers and being compared to the segment and site and everyone else. They fire you as quick as they hire you. Constantly reading word tracks and if you miss one word its a call fail.This job is setting people up for failure.Too many changes.IF you thinking about making this a career good luck! State farm expect you to be off the phone with the people and for us to hurry up and file a claim fast.In a timely manner.15 minutes. Not possible majority of the time. Co workers cool for the most part. High Turnover rate! But i did learn to be patience and let customers vent,"
bad,No benefits Commission based salary. Some agents are good to employees. Lots of outbound cold calling.  Vendors bring lunch and lots of candy.  You meet lots of people for networking.
bad,"The company is supposed to be about working towards becoming your own office.  Brakefield State Farm does not promote employees into proper programs and the owner actually comes up with excuses why it ""isn't time yet"" to do so.  Other local State Farms try to help agents into the programs immediately.  The turnover rate at this location is absolutely insane (10-18+ people over the course of 2 years).  The boss did not seem to care very much about employees and didn't understand many crucial elements of the company which often resulted in excess work and frustration for employees."
bad,researched claims to verify the correct processing. advised teams of areas of needed correction on claims
bad,work atmosphere stressful with no upward mobility; cut-throat mentality amongst most members of management; company wants to maintain the same business ideals as when founded
bad,"Very manager specific, be careful ....insurance is extremely competitive these days which effects growth potential."
bad,"The Most unique part of this job is the work schedules provide , however it only applies if you get the shift you desire. Management is HORRIBLE in every way! Any one in upper management only sees you as numbers. Oh yeah if you have any issues aside from work they only listen if you have great numbers . So if you like to work in corporate prison its the place for you !"
bad,Managers do not care about your well-being. They stick about 200 women (and some men) into one room with cubicles and you work in 4 person teams for sales leaders. The sales leaders are cruel and racist and you are supposed to just ignore that.
bad,This company really Micro Manage and the pay is very low to their competitors. State Farm say they are a family based company I beg to differ their anything but that.
bad,This was a collection call center where you didn't know from day to day whether incoming or outgoing calls.  Call monitoring did not give constructive feedback.
bad,"I Always arrived early, and clocked in exactly on time. I gained so much experience, every call is different.  Everyday I appreciated the wealth of information State Farm provided and I learned something new every day. I liked working for State Farm.  It is rare though to find a manager who genuinely cares about you. Your team mates become family. They are the ones who offer support when needed."
bad,"Low pay... stressful telemarketing calling.  No benefits. Agents are independent contractors... benefits.  "
bad,"As, I write this State Farm will work on hiring Wave 5. So, in other words they hire and fire you, people come and go their. Management only cares about themselves and they put out these impossible numbers for the claims department. Their is no positivity at all, only the negative. Majority of people in my class either were fired or just flat out quit. They will promise their are promotions and all of that. But you're manager will not let you leave and it takes the act of God to move up."
bad,"It is a disorganized and hard place to work as someone who has worked in customer service for as long as I have. Hardest part of the job is trying to satisfy customers complaints and competing with other insurance companies pricing.. "
bad,"Trainers don't have patience, managers don't support staff, very stressful. Micro management. Lack of training and managers in position and have no knowledge of the job and unable to assist reps.  Lack of support, morale."
bad,"Don’t work here. It’s a horrible environment and the managers don’t care about you, all they want is the high quota reached. It’s an absolute toxic place to be and I have panic attacks whilst being there."
bad,Due to recent changes at the company it is hard to move into leadership roles. I have not worked for State Farm for some time now. Hopefully the company will move in a more positive direction.
bad,"NON OPTIONAL OVERTIME FOR OVER A YEAR.. Terrible management. No plans to get you to advance."
bad,"Some of the local agent offices are full of crooks that mishandle sensitive information. I left due to my morals. Word to the wise, do not ever sign up for companies to run multiple quotes for you...all the local offices will forever hold your contact info, as they've purchased it."
bad,"The company has changed in recent years and has become less focused on providing a work environment that supports a work/life balance. The upper management has set unreasonably high demands on the front line employees, creating a very low moral amongst many employees."
bad,"State Farm used to be a great place to work.  Over the last 6 years, the company had gone through rapid change, understaffed, micromanage employees.  Employees are very unhappy.  Claims is way understaffed and customers are not being treated the way they should because of the moral.  It is a shame.  10 years ago, I would have HIGHLY RECOMMENDED State Farm as a great place to work."
bad,"The company structures itself top down religiously.  Instead of investing in good workers the company focuses on cutting costs."
bad,"The workload far outways the employees. The job itself is perfectly fine and even rewarding most days. State Farm ruins this by enforcing ridiculous metrics which take away from the quality customer service they claim is the primary goal. "
bad,"The current direction that State Farm is going is caring less and less about the employee.  Although they continue to have good benefits compared to other companies, they have sincerely cut their benefits from what they used to have five years ago.  Just over the five years I have been at State Farm, it has changed drastically. "
bad,The management staff is awful and the company does not seem to care about its employees. A typical day was taking phone calls from insurers and claimants and making a liability decision. Co workers are great and is really what kept me at the company for a year and a half. Management makes it beyond difficult to advance in this company even when your number align properly with the metrics.
bad,"State Farm used to care about their employees, but this is no longer the case.  They have made a series of poor decisions which have had direct negative impacts on their employees.  Poor management and a lack of support for employees through HR have led to many people seeking employment elsewhere."
bad,"State Farm provide great training. The salary is sub-par, 10 hour shifts with 3 days off. 75% chance you will work weekends and holidays. Absentee / Late arrivals policy is the downfall for many employees. Great place for training. Get you experience thru training, get you property casualty license and if happy stay with State Farm, if not, spread your wings."
bad,Management is horrible. They have a high turnover rate so they don't care about the employees. No perks. High school culture The blind lead the blind.
bad,The company is going through many changes right now and is an extremely unstable place to work. The work atmosphere used to be fantastic and everyone enjoyed working there. In more recent years the company has turned away from having an enjoyable workspace; to being only about efficiency and making profits. This has led to a high turnover rate and most jobs being consolidated only to central locations. It has also meant a decrease in pay-grades for many employees.
bad,I cant complain much. I was pregnant during this time and wanted a desk job because I was high risk. but the insurance industry is tough period. non tangible sales is the hardest type of sell
bad,Answered 60 plus calls per day from agents and their staff members.  I learned a great deal abt the underwriting process.  Management was horrible.  No real direction.  Tried every day to plug the leaks rather than fix the overall problems.  My co workers wer polite and supportive.  The hardest part of the job was listening to every caller complain about how so many of the processes had changed and were wrong.  Talking with folks and helping educate them on fixibg their issues.
bad,"Good place to work, great employees and work hours.  Care about employees.  Everyone is very helpful and equipment is up to date, technology is new."
bad,"In any other segment than claims, the company is great, However if you work in auto claims be prepared to work about 12 or more hours a week in mandatory overtime, work non traditional shifts that are assigned by seniority,  that are not family friendly hours, and be micro managed to the point of having to report your bathroom breaks... VERY high pressure!"
bad,Used to have work - life balance but now non-existent and very low morale.
bad,"Dear State Farm,"
bad,"Working for State Farm Catastrophe (CAT) was very unpleasent because management was very poor. If you are from Bloomington IL, related to someone that works for ""the farm""  and/or pass continuing eduacation test you can be a manager. If you actually know how to do the job and actually have a life outside of CAT you can forget becoming a manager. I had one great manager the four + years I worked for SF CAT. The rest of the time I had a ton of managers that did not know how to manage people. I know what a good manager is like b/c I have worked for a Fortune 50 comp before as well as small and medium size companies. Lastly, the company talks alot about ""work-life"" balance but they really don't care anything about it. Maybe working for a different part of State Farm not CAT would be different. My favorite part of working for SF CAT was quitting.   "
bad,"Not a great position for those that seek advancement or any variety day to day. Good pay and benefits, but the environment is unpleasant and interaction with coworkers is discouraged."
bad,"When I started working for State Farm in 2001, they were extremely family friendly, with flexible work hours. They considered their employees their greatest asset. Unfortunately, they have moved from being a great work environment to only caring about their bottom line. Employees are replaceable, and benefits are quickly diminishing. There is little opportunity for advancement or personal development, and good luck getting time off approved for doctor's appointments or other personal leave that wasn't preapproved in November of the previous year."
bad,Great place to work if you like all work no life balance environment. Everything is on a points system and metrics.  You are monitored for every step you take and every move you make.
bad,"Awesome benefits and awesome people but not the place to work or feel accomplished in your work. They throw you to the fire, have poor training skills, and upper management was required to say three different lines to us and if you had questions, only quizzical looks in return or a another line."
bad,"I worked for State Farm in large operations centers as a claim specialist and team manager for nearly a decade. It was a great place to work until the company began the push to the hubs in 2015-2016. Slowly they are pushing experienced people out and anyone who made more than the minimum.  My most recent office hired new employees at the same rate as experienced employees (talking 8-10 years of experience) because they don't give raises. "
bad,Very corporate environment if you don’t kiss up to the right people then you won’t advance. If you make the wrong person upset or challenge the rules you will be targeted and fired. Don’t get comfortable you are disposable. Use everything they offer then get a better job
bad,"I was in Auto Claims. Either they are trying to force out their long standing employees, or just don't give two cares about them anymore. I dealt with at least 12 metrics, half of which were counterintuitive to the other half. Most weren't even directly related to my job. EVERY conversation you have is about these numbers. PTO accrual is slow.and you are not given very many allotted absences. The process for requesting time off is convoluted and they have a tendancy to change it so you can never really plan for time off. It is a hellish place to work. Their systems and processes are just backwards, to the point that it was embarrassing, being that they are a Fortune 50 company."
bad,This company wanted a lot of work from all employees but wasn't willing to pay the employees for that extra work. The benefits was good but the pay was horrible.
bad,Great job at first but little to no advancement opportunities. Try to pigeon hole employees into call environment jobs. Management is a bunch of morons
bad,The pay is great and for a reason.  This was the most stressful And demanding job I've ever held. That training was useless and then you're thrown into this world of claims with no clue to what to so.  Then the metrics are impossible to meet
bad,"It was clear from the moment I started there the Project Manager did not want me around. She played games the entire length of the contract, saying I didn't turn work in when, in fact, I turned it in early and picked up work that others had neglected (I volunteered)."
bad,"The job is simply about expecting people to abuse me (as if I need more people in my life to abuse me) and act as if there were nothing wrong with that. On top of that, it became very clear very quickly just how State Farm was/isn't/won't be truly customer focused, since half the time I wasn't even allowed to help the customer, even if his/her agent's office royally screwed them over. I am grateful to have never been a customer with State Farm, and I never will be after working for them."
bad,you have to work a year and not take any time off to earn 5 days off.you have to work a month and a half to earn a work day...……………………………………….........…………………………………………………………...
bad,"Job is not for everyone, I everyone I was in training with is having a hard time. I would definitely suggest talking with someone who works there before going through with it."
bad,I’m a CS for 17 years. Used to be a great company not anymore. I make good money but again I’ve been an employee for 17 years. No room for growth. Only certain people get groomed for advancement. Work/life balance sucks. No flexibility.  Company no longer cares to have happy employees. In turn the company would have satisfied customers. The company’s ever changing position on handling claims seems somewhat unethical but you won’t find it in writing. TMs only verbally tell you.
bad,"It's on MARTA easy to get to, not much direction from leadership. Not the most creative environment. A lot of nepotism. Good coworkers. Management is indecisive."
bad,State Farm gave us 8 weeks of training but we only actually took calls in real time for a week. We were given module after module and got no real education on the actual SF data base. This led to constant dissatisfied customers due to lack of knowledge about the actual job.
bad,"You bid for your shift which means you're likely to not work the shift of your choice because its usually 15-85 to choose from. Their point system is outdated. You could leave out on a stretcher and you'd still get points towards your attendance. Every manager has different managerial styles but you swap teams and managers so much everyone should be on the same page, unfortunately, they aren't. Agent Staff members misinform customers all the time which causes confusion and dissatisfied customers; and in most cases Staff members attitudes are worse than the customers.  State Farm doesn't look at your work ethic or dedication or DRIVE. So if you get into a car accident and FMLA doesn't approve your days off or you don't have enough Paid days off, you're getting fired. Life happens and unexpectedly, so if you're not prepared, do not expect a great support system from SF. Oh yeah and everything is to managers discretion, so some managers will approve days off if you don't have PTO and others will deny them.  Calls are monitored and recorded so they will nick pick your call and provide feedback. Some managers will actually listen to the call and provide good points but most of the time, the call flow and professionalism is perfect and they'll still rip you.  Other carriers laugh at you because they're getting paid more to do less than you are. Keep that in mind."
bad,High pressure job with little opportunity to advance. Inadequate training for job position. Unpleasant place to work. Seniority ranks above knowledge.
bad,"Working in claims is a lot of work. The great part is you become licensed, the company pays for it (if you past the first test). You are able to attain a lot of claims & insurance knowledge that you can take  anywhere. If you can make it in claims you can make it anywhere, that’s if you can develop a tough skin. The bad part is State Farm is too old fashioned. They pay lower than other insurance companies for the same position. They are not fair in how they choose people to move up in the company, it’s based off who you know and who they like, not seniority or experience. They allow the agent office staff to talk to you like you’re a piece of trash, and the claims rep are supposed be respectful, while the agent staff has no repocussion for their disrespect or actions. You have outrageous metrics that make it stressful to work and are to work from the time you get to work until you leave regardless of how difficult a call could be. It’s like a plantation and you’re simply a number to them. They have a points system where you accumulate points for being late or missing days, 4 points per occurance and 20 points equal termination. A horrible benefits package with no vacation days. The claims dept is unorganized and upper management makes decisions that do not best benefit the customer & blame you for not behind able to explain things to customers or follow through on their new procedures. I like to say State Farm claims gives you a monkey wrench when you need a screw driver to get the job done & say figure it out. They use you for projects and leadership roles and sometimes you’re"
bad,"State Farm would be my choice if I were able to work in one of the new hubs. It appears that many jobs are leaving my area and as a result, managers and employees are looking to other companies for employment."
bad,"I had a written contract in hand, and they withdrew it after they had already agreed. No.... I am competent, sober, law-abiding, and highly educated. They had buyers remorse, but there was no way they had enough data (nor experience) to make this knee-jerk action."
bad,Too much overhead and expenses for a new agent.  You will spend a lot or all of saved cash to keep the doors open. You spend a lot of your personal saving in advertising and marketing.
bad,"I do not recommend working for an Agent. In my case the Agent was never in the office and when she showed up, it was to put pressure for sales. She did not care mentor me but relied on my ability to pick up things quickly."
bad,"good work/life balance"
bad,In Atlanta the leaders are bad examples. The pay is minimum. Do not have set guidelines for selecting people for promotions. There are no check and balances in place for leaders so there's a lot of favoritism and room for racism to be known. HR do not address major concern which causes for a danger zone given the temperament of the country.
bad,Agent is never there. He is very condescending.Manager is mean & rude. She makes everyone feel like a 2yr old & she says she does everything. When agent leaves so does she and she lies a lot! I learned a lot about insurance and obtained my license. Culture of office is not family friendly. It’s all about the agent & making money for him and to make sure he gets his trip. And in return the staff gets nothing! Except the office manager. Agent makes sure she is well compensated.  The hardest part of the job are the rude mean spoiled insureds. Rates keep going up & insureds get even more angry. The atmosphere in the office is very tense & negative.   The best part of the job is an hour for lunch.
bad,Unqualified management was constantly criticizing and shaming employees as well as poaching sales from staff.  Managers did not lead by example and would change the rules and in my opinion bully some employees.  There were also many cases of harassment of employees in my time at this office.
bad,it pays the bills barely is all I can say at this time. I manage it also helps with tuition reimbursement for education. Not much room for advancement it all depends on who you know and the things you are willing to do. it doesn't go by job performance in no way shape form or fashion.
bad,"Great benefits and pay.  However, Management that has been in their position for years, is overbearing, show favoritism, and very hypocritical. Coworkers were rude and immature."
bad,"They had to many favorites. Job advancements were given to their  pets not to the employees that were qualified, management was all about numbers, did not take into account the time you needed to be on the phone to help customers resolve their concerns."
bad,"Selfish, clickish, unfair initial immediate supervisor lacking management skills. "
bad,Acting like if you meet the # of tasks in a set amount of time is being a good employee and equals being productive in resolving claims. When in reality no one really does anything in the claim file and customers get lip service.
bad,"During training it seemed like a great company, but they care NOTHING about employees. They only care about NUMBERS! Everything was learned in training was totally different that what we actually had to deal with on the phones. Calls were not that bad, but with constant change keeping up with the procedures were difficult at times. Sometimes you wouldn't even be notified about the changes. Calls were score by random people, some weren't even at the same call center as us and it was basically graded by personal judgement. One person evaluating the calls may give you a 100 but another may give you a 50 because they FELT like something was wrong. There was nothing you could do about it. The manager could send it in for reconsideration but that rarely ever happened. They are just there to tell you what your numbers are and let you go if you don't make them MOST (not all) of them were NO help.. Advancements/Promotions (in my opinion and experience) were very personal. To me, there wasn't a fair shot for everyone to move ahead. The only good thing about working there was the pay and benefits lol.. Leaving that company was the best decision I could've made."
bad,State Farm has done a terrible job transitioning to a new model in Auto/Farm claims. People are running out of the door. I think this would be a great fit for call center personality types that like every move they make monitored. Be prepared to explain that you need leave your desk to use the restroom. Does not feel like a professional position. Management is even struggling to stay positive.
bad,"Working for a company for seven years and not being rewarded for what you do is hard but I came in everyday and did my job.  The typical day retrieve  the messages and return all phone calls, greet the customers and make sure that their needs were taking care of. Do the daily bank deposit and various other job duties.  The co-workers made the job worth coming in everyday because we were like a family and had each others back.  We pulled together as a team and got the work done.  The hardest thing is when i got laid off and had my daughter to raise and unemployment  was not enough.  That was a really rough time for me but i kept my head up and made it through that storm."
bad,Do not have very much to say about this job. Made the best of it while I was there and showed the best customer service. That is all. thank you.
bad,Can not trust.  Unprofessional and unethical in their conduct.
bad,all you really do is work on the computer and type all day you have to want to be in a computer all day to like this job
bad,"High call volume. This company is numbers-driven only care about how many minutes you're on each call, how long in between calls, how long you're in not ready for the next call. Management watches your every move and they go off a point system. The schedule is always changing (days and hours). You have to bid for time off.  The pay is very low. Benefits are good, good training, nice building, and opportunities for advancement."
bad,"very busy"
bad,"Leadership does not care about the mental state of their AA II's. The stress level is through the celiing, which is mostly okay. You are on time-clock with a point system. You get points for anything. "
bad,"The agent that hired me know me through my position with Acceptance Insurance. I was hired immediately because of my experience and abilities however, the managing agent was rarely around to train me in the programs necessary to be a SF agent. She was rarely in the office and left me to train myself. I was initially informed that I would have 4-6 months to acclimate myself with the programs, yet was discharged after 2 1/2 months. The information I received during my interview and my first 2 weeks of training was not accurate to what transpired."
bad,"No advancement placing employees on hiring freezes and no work life balance. Poor management as it is to each managers discretion how each employee is reprimanded. Low morale for ""bottom"" employees."
bad,"Agent was rarely there to train us. They expected us to have $30,000 saved up at the end of the 18 month program and nobody told us about that prior to hiring on."
bad,"Historically a great place to work. Due to recent changes, the environment has shifted drastically. With a pending office closing and an increase in the emphasis on metrics over customer service, many have decided not to remain with the company."
bad,I worked at State Farm for 12 years and since year 2 it has continuously gone down. The family culture that State Farm pushes in their commercials applies to customers not employees. The pay is ok. Not competitive compared to other companies in the industry. The new attendance system which is based on points is ridiculous. If you’re sick you pretty much have to plan off to be sick. If you call in you’re deducted points. If you come to work and have to leave early for a family emergency you’re deducted points.
bad,Company has been surpassed by competitors due to poor management and no preparation or involvement in technological world. Once promised career resulted in lay offs
bad,State Farm was a great place to work. Motivated team environment and excellent Team management was readily available to assist with building your level of expertise.
bad,"Constant Upheaval and Operations Center Closures, systems are ""upgraded"" implemented before ready, everyone is stressed out.  There is no work life balance."
bad,"The company appears to be on a never-ending goal of doing more with less people. As very talented, experienced people walk out the door for other companies, the workload builds for those that remain. Hiring help is out of the question. Not a good situation at all; would not recommend. It's unfortunate."
bad,It appears State Farm was all about the employees numbers but once started working there found out differently. It was about length of call; work tracks; how many claims you processed.
bad,"This company completely strips the humanity away from people and is impossible if you have a family/life outside of work. "
bad,"In a perfect world agent's team members would be unionized. We are grossly underpaid, overworked, and have beyond high expectations. It's not an entitlement, it's the fact that we are put to solicit products for a company that has BEYOND high expectations and requirements to even qualify for said products. I could rant all day."
bad,State Farm has turned into a number driven environment not a customer driven environment. They don't care about the employee at all either. There was no work life balance.
bad,"Company provides developmental courses for certification but it's very strict on attendance. You get penalized for the smallest infraction even though it could be an act of God or a car accident. Very stressful environment. You can be a great employee but the minute your points accumulate to a certain amount you're shown the unemployment line without notice. Compensation is the lowest amongst the insurance industry nationwide. Advancement is few, far and in between. You may qualify to move up but if you have points or a manager has a negative opinion then you're stuck with no timeline of eligibility. Work life balance is non-existent. Employees with kids are backed into a corner because of circumstances which can create more points. You may or may not see your kids especially if you're a single parent forget it. Child care issues with time constraints is your problem not the company's. It's either you work it out or get the boot. Calling out especially if you're sick must be made 24 hours in advance. Overall does have developmental opportunities but with everything else your whole life is basically state farm."
bad,Fun place learned a lot about insurances. Hard to get  licenses to work here. Felt the exam were hard and could not really study for them
bad,"Great company to work for. I was hired in the wrong department. The ""supervisors"" didn't know what they were doing. Everyone started applying to other departments and all of the sudden the one year rule came about. After one year, they started picking out the slightest error in your performance and telling you that you will not be able apply for another position at that time. I eventually found another job and quit. It was just too unorganized."
bad,"Taking phone calls sell auto insurance, love talking to people, working closely with co-worker creating a great team."
bad,N/A N/A they will promote. But if you get in a position they want to keep you in then you aren’t going anywhere. They pay for your schooling off the top.
bad,"Simple, there is no management. It's strictly sales driven. Any arising issue within the staff or customers, will be pawned off to a team member, instead of being handled properly by hiring management. Decent pay, wouldn't say it's worth putting up with the bullying work culture."
bad,"Then just apply for a job at State Farm Bank. Make no mistake, State Farm is first and foremost an insurance company. And over the last year of my time here, it has been made abundantly clear that the bank side is an afterthought, with a severe lack of training, support for heavy workload, low pay, extremely and utterly unprofessional treatment by State Farm agents that you interact with on a daily basis. On more than one occasion, I was reduced to a unprovoked screaming match with an agent, due to their utter demeaning of me as a professional in my field. These were frequent because we had far too much work, couldn't get things done properly, and most importantly, customers were appalled by the process. I would sympathize with them knowing that there was nothing I could do for them. The treatment by these agents was so bad that I have considered cancelling my personal homeowners and car insurance with them. If these are the types of people they employ, I want no part of it. And now on to the moral of the story. In the mortgage industry, if you leave one company to go to a competitor, they are REQUIRED to walk you out THE SAME DAY as there is no option to work a formal 2 weeks in order to protect State Farm's interests in the mortgage industry. Its company POLICY. One would presume you would still get paid for this, right? Wrong. Not only did I not receive pay when I formally and professionally resigned. I spoke with others that left under the same circumstances and not only were they paid two weeks, some received above and beyond this. One received nearly double and was technically"
bad,"State Farm is a great place to work however policies and procedures change very quick therefore you have to be able to adapt to change, fast paced plenty of training and easy to be promoted from within. Management is all about production,policies, and procedures. There are some great team members and managers within the company. A typical day consist of 60-75 calls dealing with payments, billing, verification and issuance of policies, ID cards etc."
bad,"I worked for SF for four years. I was a great experience and learned a lot that I never knew regarding insurance. I was promoted one within my four years of working there. It wasn’t always easy to move up due to high demand in my department. Pay, Work life balance and No having the ability to promote like the shared at the beginning would not make em recommend sf to anyone for employment. No place is perfect. Management was awesome, work relationships with peers where as well."
bad,"Very stressful job! Expected to meet certain sales quote on life insurance in order to receive commission for other insurance (auto, home, etc.) all while being micromanaged."
bad,The sales goals are not realistic because of the high rates. Lost most sales to the competition because of the price. Agent was amazing but the company is not a money maker.
bad,Management was filled with the worst kind of kiss ups/kick downs. Raises were kept low so most people worked overtime to compensate. I wasted 13 years of my life.
bad,"It is difficult  to adapt to too many changes, no stable management, Bemefits are great, flexible PTO, overwhelming call volume, it is difficult to promote, more focused on metrics rather than customer experiences."
bad,Management is horrible. Your unable to balance home and work life. The benefits are great though. I do miss the great relationships I’ve build with people at the company.
bad,No Comments as I would not like to say anything. Colleagues were very helpful but managers were not at all. They will tell you to ask your colleagues for help but they will still say you are wrong
bad,Worst experience in my professional career.I have never experienced  such unprofessional behavior from the sectional managers to the team managers. their is NO room for growth because upper management wants the talent to remain and kept to keep the dept numbers up float . SF would rather hire out than to promote within.
bad,"filing claims, talking to customers, go over metrics during huddle. Sitting at a desk, typical call center job, 45 min lunches"
bad,"I liked the call center environment, I was able to talk to a new person during each call. I am a people's person so I really enjoyed that. I learned how to multi task at fast pace, while making sure my  job was done efficiently. Management was okay. My manger was new so sometimes it was kind of hard getting concrete  answers from her. My Co-Workers were great! we all got alone just fine and always had lunch together. For the most part the job was easy, nothing too hard.  Most of challenges came when we had an update in our job aids. I enjoyed talking to customers knowing that I help through a stressful time."
bad,"I used to enjoy working there, but it went downhill fast. Corporate doesn't have a clue about what really happens in any given day, and our jobs changed several times in the past few months. I was stressed to the point of high blood pressure and insomnia, and I had to sit in my car and talk myself into walking into that building every day."
bad,"Responsible for assisting current policy holders with auto insurance information. "
bad,State Farm is a great company. The Southfield CLC office is not a great place to work. They are extremely unorganized and have an office manager that micromanages to the point that you are unable to efficiently get your work done. Stick to an out-of-state office if you can as State Farm is a great company.
bad,Unless you consider watching videos for 8 hrs a day for 2 months adequate training I would say it is poor at best. Support from management was lacking and fell upon deaf ears. Once you complete training you are put right into production and it is a recipe for failure. Policy language is also unclear and the poor insured's suffer because of it. I would go so far as to say the management has now enacted what can only be perceived as unethical and deceptive practices. There is a reason why over 90% of in-house employees are new. I can only reference this company as like the Titanic...it is sinking quickly!
bad,State Farm is not organized very well and doesn't do much to get you working on important tasks. Management doesn't really seem aware of what is going on or who is responsible for what duties.
bad,"Company had too many re-organizations, lots of favoritism, but at the end everyone lost their job.  Work was boring same ole same ole.  Close to home."
bad,"The current design of the claim model has greatly reduced efficiency at my job level due to inaccuracies in the initial intake and claim handling."
bad,"Fast paced environment, good training, positive team environment in which sharing ideas and claim handling information is promoted."
bad,"Productive company helps you advance in the workplace."
bad,"Instead of fixing processes, mistakes were blamed after each audit on new employees who were summarily fired for incompetence."
bad,The team was great but state farm as a corporation is awful. Treats agents like they’re disposable and does not compensate fairly for the work done. Not worth working here
bad,"1. Perfect place for those that don’t mind holding the hand of some frustrated  customer over the phone and saying the exact same thing dozens of times a day. If you want to just keep your head down and bring home a check this is it. You must really know what type of work environment you excel in.  If you are family orientated, want fluid timely growth, and are sensitive to regular performance criticism- its not for you. "
bad,"long hours on the phone very little breaks allowed, couldn't do anything but answer phones non stop. i would never go back and would not recommend it to anyone."
bad,Super mean coworker and owner. A lot of time you are working hard and getting paid very little. And the commission structures are a joke.  If you like seeing your family forget about it.
bad,"Working for an agent is really hard, they only care about meeting their quotas by the end of the month. My experience was horrible, my agent had no experience in the industry nor knew how to manage the team, he would change his mind consistently. Got to the point were he would threaten us to fire us, back to back. That’s when I decided enough is enough."
bad,"you are just a number here.... dont waist your time. They dont care about their workers, they dont care about anything other than money. They push you to your limits and then some. Easy job, bad managers."
bad,All the State Farm agent that are hiring here they have you work as their agent staff which the teal State Farm HR does not even know who you are. So you ending up work for that agent not the company. There is no benefit at all not even maternity leave. My girl friends who work for the same agent ending up better with liberty mutual with double the pay and commission with full benefits. While the other services manager at the same agency end up with different agent for a bit higher pay but still no benefit. Next time they should let people know  their prop other than the conpany
bad,"The first thing you have to know is that the agents are all independent so they all have their own rules, regulations, best practices and things like that. Having said that my particular agent was very hypocritical, would change how he wanted things done and claim he told you when he didn't, and despite saying things like ""I'd yell at a customer before a member of my team,"" he would go off on you in a heartbeat, making you cry and hyperventilate. He only cares about himself and does not treat everyone the same. If you need to ask him a question I would do it in writing so when he tells you he doesn't know, or makes an assumption that then turns into a mistake you can prove it was his mistake. working for this state farm agent had a directly adverse affect on my health both physically and mentally."
bad,"State Farm is one of the worst companies I have worked for. The pay was good yes but, they lack in any kind of leadership and understanding of their employees. I am someone who has epilepsy and had a seizure before work and couldn't come in. Because of this I was targeted constantly. The managers threatened to fire me due to me missing work days due to my illness."
bad,"not for me. i did not want to work only commission, and this office is a great place to work if u do only want commission. state farm is a great company"
bad,"Average hours were staring at 8 am, the office closed at 5pm but there was never a day that anyone left before 7pm and most people would work until 9pm or even later. The job was salary so there was no payment for any overtime worked. I was working over 125 hours every two weeks but would still only receive pay for 80 hours of work. You could never request for time off or you would be considered selfish. You would be guilt tripped for taking your lunch break. Managers do not have any manager experience and do not know how to effectively train and continuously put you down and make fun of you. The boss will only show up if he has an appointment and does nothing when asked to make the work environment more pleasant."
bad,Worst job ever! My manager was not honest with me about things that were occurring. There was a plot against me after I had been involved in a conflict between another supervisor that got upset when I asked him to help with my computer which was having technical issues.
bad,"Nice and quiet building to work in, very fast paced and deadlines have to be completed  on time.  Manager was very harsh and not understanding of what was involved in our role to complete their deadlines"
bad,I had a negative experience at State Farm due to my direct leadership. I would still say that State Farm is a good place to work for most but I left with a less than favorable perspective on the organization.
bad,"The following comments are based on my current experience.  When I started 5 years ago, the company and culture were very different.  "
bad,"I enjoyed working for this company.. great hours as well as benefits. Management was awesome! Unfortunately, I had to relocate which is the only reason I resigned in my position."
bad,Job wasn't fulfilling or satisfying. Lack of growth but there was pretty good management (at least the manager I had). They did close down an office and looked for ways to fire people. Any minor slip-ups they could fire you for.
bad,As a receptionist I worked for many bosses they saw me as an investment. They worked with me so that I could improve as an employee without any errors
bad,"State Farm was a great place to work. But overtime changes in job requirements, workload and environment have made it a less than desirable place to work."
bad,do your homework on an agent before agreeing. Different offices have differing approaches. An agency with a high turn over rate is a red flag. Some agency are run well.
bad,Used to be a great company.  The recent changes have made it difficult to maintain and work/life balance especially if you have a family.  Company used to be very family oriented and seems to be getting away from that. Customer satisfaction does not seem to be a priority.  The main focus is numbers.
bad,"State farm use to be a great company now it has completely changed! No work life balance, management not interested. over work and under paid"
bad,State Farm Is a great company. The Raytown Agency was unsatisfactory and a poor representation of State Farm Insurance. Very faced paced negative energy environment. This particular agency is openly more sales focused than quality consumer satisfied focused. The sales staff is uninformative and unprofessional. The owner is incompetent.
bad,This was a great work environment and I learned a ton from management. My boss was very helpful and I learned a ton from her.
bad,"Would be good place to work, everyone does their best but it's just not good enough. one way communication, his way period."
bad,"Customer service, trouble shoot issues. finance and all other questions. I think that this job is a value, however for the telemarketers it is a very exhausting job. You will take upwards to 500 calls."
bad,any other state farm agent in America would be better. Its shocking that state farm would even choose a man like this to represent their company
bad,Heavy claim volume; not enough staff to handle them; heavy phone calls.
bad,"Utter chaos in this ""virtual"" environment.  Run the other way. Way too much responsibility and workload for the pay. They are ALWAYS in need of CAS workers because of the turnover."
bad,A typical dy would make sure that all tehdocumentation has been recieived so the each student that is elgible can get a scholorship
bad,"Terrible core values, smaller office are ran by individual owners with little to no insurance experience. Pay is low and there is no stability to promise you will maintain a job."
bad,Employees tried hard but atmosphere in the office was not at all motivating.
bad,"Worse place in the world. Please stay away from this company they will take all your money then spit you away, Do all you can to speak with people that have left the compny before you invest a niclel. There are enough to write a book. Beware and run the other way"
bad,"My typical day of work includes making contact with insureds, claimants, attorneys, witnesses, etc. I am responsible to investigating potential fraudulent claims until conclusion. I investigate NICB (National Insurance Crime Bureau indicators and attempt to resolve them. My immediate supervisor is very open, honest and approachable. I couldn't ask for a better supervisor. My team can be described as helpful, consistent and fun to work with, we work very well together to achieve the common goal of ""customer satisfaction"". The hardest part of my job would be having to make tough decisions that the customer may not always agree with. What I enjoy most about my job is the flexibility I am given to get the job done."
bad,"Extreme Stress. I started in 1995 and planned to retire from State Farm in 2028. I left after 22 years as a Claim Rep due to a series of bad upper management decisions in my last 2-3 years (2014-2017). Many people left, including many with 20+ years’ experience. We took early retirement. The company priority shifted from unmatched quality customer service and claims processing to quantity, quantity, quantity. We were micromanaged by great managers caught in the middle, and we had every single action we took recorded by computers and phones routed through computers. Claim handling became a crazy call center environment. Daily team meetings were held so management could show everyone how poorly we were doing with all kinds of numbers in red, yellow, and green on huge dry-erase boards for everyone to see like group-shaming 3-year-olds. The youngest recruits were leaving in droves along with those of us who had the most experience. Others are stuck in their jobs until they can take early retirement at 55 because the pay and benefits are great, but not worth it now. Half of the auto claims employees in the Austin, TX Operation Center were under  a Doctor's care and taking some kind of prescription drugs for the stress - I was on Prozac and Buspar at the same time. I had to get out before it killed me. I was a complex auto claim rep at the end, meaning I was trusted to do the hardest job in auto claims. I handled lawsuits, death claims, serious injuries, multi-car collisions, disputed liability, and coverage questions. I never had a poor performance review, and I was making $80K plus"
bad,"Was a wonderful place to work until a change in management decided to force hundreds of dedicated employees out of their careers, some had been there 40+ years!!"
bad,No support from this agent only. Not speaking on other offices. Her management style made it difficult for me. Her favoritism and constant bad mouthing customers after they left the office was very unprofessional. I needed her assistance to help me with my difficulties dealing with irate customers but her response was more of a caddy and high school approach and I felt left out and targeted in our office of 3 employees.
bad,Nice place to work management is superb and cared much for my individual success. The people i work with are all verh nice and are willing to provide a helping hand when needed.
bad,"	Prepares new sales representatives by conducting orientation to sales process; developing individual coaching plans; providing resources and assistance; scheduling orientation drive-along with senior representatives."
bad,company was great just didnt have job security great pay and ect over all the comany was a great comany and would work for the in the future
bad,"State Farm released me and took my credentials.  My grandson was just born and had a life threatening illness.  I contacted my Agent and notified them that accepting this contract at the time isn't a good idea because of the health of the infant and his mothers mental health. State Farm released me and took my credentials. I never thought State Farm could be so cold when it comes to "
bad,"I was promised the world and they talked me into becoming an agent.   Everything went ok during the training, but it was very clear that the expectations were to invest in your staff and marketing budget if you wanted to earn your lifetime contract.   One of the trainers mentioned that no agent who had at least three staff members did not achieve their lifetime contract.   Bottom line is their management wants you to go deep into debt, they don't care if you take care of clients, and the amount of premium soldbisbirrelevant.   I resigned as their ethics was terrible and I wanted nothing to do with it."
bad,"Less pay, Long hours, no help from agent. Very difficult to sell insurance to tabacco users, unhealthy people, agent has no will to work, puts less than 20 hours in office per week."
bad,"Nothing like what people may think. Cheap company. They don’t treat their employees fairly, the employees are overworked and not trained properly. Low wages compared to other insurance companies."
bad,No support from the company itself agents are lost just as well as the team members. Working in an agents office you better keep a resume handy you never know when you’re agent will retire and you will be without a job. Systems are a hot mess nobody knows what or where things should go or do
bad,"Skills don't matter if you don't hit their arbitrary and constantly changing numbers. I got many, many rewards for stunning customer service - but they get fussy about schedule adherence (86% or better) when a great deal of that is out of the employee's control. "
bad,"I worked for two different State Farm agents the first was good at training but strict about he would never show you something twice. My commission structure changed weekly and so did my salary. I would be reviewing my commission statement and wonder why it was so low and he would say ""oh I changed it again"". You can never work from home, no training I figured everything out myself, and only get one week of PTO and sick days. They also don't provide life insurance so I had to pay for that out of pocket. The base salary is $30k with ""uncapped commission"" although my base salary would change weekly between that and $20k. The more commission you start making they will bump up the minimum amount you have to sale in order to make commission making it harder. The agent's also refuse to talk to the insured's about coverage questions. The second agent was new but offered the same thing as the first no PTO or sick days no medical coverage. You will spend all 8 hours of your day cold calling leads only for 95% to be fake."
bad,"learned how to deal with people when it came to sales and doing coal calling. my sales pitch was the skill which allowed me to make money. the level of care and stress, or the lack of care far outways the pros to working at an insurance firm."
bad,"There is no 401k, no health, dental or vision insurance. The agent I worked for went through 12 employees in 3 years. I was the 13th employee that left."
bad,"I do not recommend working here unless you already have some insurance and banking knowledge. They do not allow for proper training and when given a task that you aren't sure on how to complete you become unworkable. Also, a lot of cold calling to dead end numbers or numbers that have been called multiple times over multiple years."
bad,"There is no loyalty,or stability. The account reps are treated like trading cards. It does not matter if you meet your quota, or even if you surpass your quota. It is never good enough, and They look for ways to cheat you out of your commission."
bad,"phones. the team leads are so focused on meeting metrics that they micromanage everything. some even abuse FMLA and TPLO laws. they write you up for silly stuff like breathing to hard on the phone. the feedback system could be a good learning exp for the claim handler, but the team leaders use it's punishment to pick apart everything the claim handler does. the ""coach"" you on things they even they do on a regular basis. they write you up for a shield letter if they feel you do something wrong. "
bad,"There was no way to move up in this agents office, the hours would constantly change and would also become late at night.  No consistently or job security."
bad,"I would not recommend becoming a state farm agent, unless you have about 50K to invest. I know this is not what they will tell you, but it is the truth."
bad,"This is an awesome company to be apart of, but it desperately lacks room for growth, work/life balance and the pay is horrible as compared to its counterparts in the industry."
bad,"This is a metrics driven environment with very little wiggle room. Though feedback rich, it is dated and highly stressful due to very little autonomy or ability to take off."
bad,Agent allowed his friends and family to work there that were not licensed. I also witnessed unethical behavior. Was fired for reporting this behavior.
bad,"i was fired for being a mother, because my son was seriously sick and i requested time off so that i could take care of him. no understanding that at any time my son could go into emergency surgery. i had a weeks worth of sick leave that i was refused."
bad,A typical day at work is dealing with customers and assisting them with their claims or any insurance information they have in mind.
bad,Unpleasant management did not enjoy position. Claims and collections were difficult. No room for advancement except sales.
bad,"for the most part, the job is heavily based on sales, retaining existing customers as well as acquiring new ones."
bad,"Not a very good company. Gives false hope during training. Sucky management. Does not provide ""24 hr good neighbor service"" as promised in the commercials."
bad,No Job Security agents need to keep up with changing times and update marketing and selling skills.
bad,let me go due to medical reasons. Poor management and human resources.
bad,"Pay is low compared to other companies and no benefits.  Late nights and Saturday’s not a good work/family balance."
bad,I enjoyed most of my co-workers. None of the managers knew how to do the job of their employees. Lots of overtime. Overtime required. Not many jobs in St. Louis now.
bad,The StateFarm Insurance Work Culture Is Out Dated. Cold Calling &  Chasing Old Leads Prevents Agents From Focusing On Sales! StateFarm Agents Do Not Value Experience & Education Of Seasoned Agents!
bad,"I was excited to work for a reputable employer such as SF. After completing training, I realized that it was not what I had imagined. Managers say they are there for you but that's simply not the case. 7.75 hr workday. There has not been a day where I left work thinking wow that was a good day. Not all jobs are a slice of heaven but you shouldn't dread coming to work either. Its a job not a career."
bad,"I thought I had a great thing going until I learned that the agent wasn’t willing to be honest - with me, others, and especially to himself. I was not in an office culture of positivity and support; more like atmosphere of scape goats and blame; along with a lack of transparency (thereby creating a way for them to keep your commissions). and an experimental software system that was over everybody’s head.  Poor guy. "
bad,"Each agent is somewhat franchised. The corporation will deny any involvement if the agent does something unethical or against the law. "
bad,"I was misinformed about the income and expectations. I did not have a good experience with co-workers, some were aggressive and easily annoyed with questions related to the job duties."
bad,"They do an awesome job at presenting you with opportunities; however once you sign on the mask comes off (so to speak). There is NO work/life balance, you are merely a number to them, & if you dare voice your opinion you will quickly find yourself in the unemployment office!"
bad,Everything about this place is terrible from work life balance to pay. They work you like horses and no employee appreciation.  The pay is so little and it takes an act of Congress to get a raise.  Good luck on trying to get promoted or move to a different role because you they always have departments on a freeze but hire off the street.
bad,"No benefits and stuck fixing underwriting issues. Agent was bizarre and only cared about making us reach goals and did not contribute to helping, never was enough. Not worth the stress for the little pay."
bad,Allow yourself to be trainable.  They are the leader.  Once you have experience get out!!!!  Move on somewhere making more money.  There is no loyalty
bad,Too much autonamy. Not enough actual work. I think I would have been happy in the long run. But it was just unrealistic sales goals. Managers who make excuses for every incompetence. Then pretend that their experience is why you should listen to them.
bad,"This company is in transition as such everything is up in the air with almost daily change. "
bad,No benefits or paid time off. I was hired as salary but if I worked less than 40 hours my pay would be deducted and if I worked more than 40 hours i wouldnt get compensated.
bad,"I was hired in with a new agent, my coworkers and I had no previous insurance experience but were told we would get all the training we would need. This did not happen at all we were left to sink or swim. We were not allowed to ask questions of our agent or for help. In her 5 months of being open she has already had 4 people quite or be fired. I will soon be leaving as well due to being underpaid for my position. No one in the office has made commission as the requirements are set to high. Would not work for another state farm ever again."
bad,"Company Policies and Values are not consistent from department to department, especially for Military members."
bad,"I worked for State Farm for 12 years. It was a great company many years ago. Unfortunately, they no longer value their employees. Management can be very sneaky, there are definitely clicks. They are making it impossible to advance, unless you are willing to uproot your entire family and move across the country on your own dime. I have witnessed long term employees be let go due to outsourcing, while other departments were hiring for the same position. There is extreme lack of communication and care for work/life balance. It is a shame to see a great company turn into such a nightmare."
bad,I was excited to be a part of this company when first hired. It has gotten so bad my mental health is declining. Under constant stress and threat of loss your job over metrics. Emergency situation aren't allowed and you will be penalized if you have them.There NO exceptions. The constant micromanage is stressful. Who needs that everyday?
bad,"Negative environment.  The trainer was very curt, rude, and impatient.  Only one other agent in 4 agent office made attempt to assist and/or review or provide information to assist in furthering my knowledge."
bad,"Every office manages different but the office where I was located at was terrible, no advancement  opportunities, long hours and after more than 2 years I never received a raise, my boss hired a new girl and she started making more hourly than me, where she starting has no experience nor the licenses I have at this time"
bad,Poor work environment micromanagement by all supervisors and managers and no real opportunities for women or people of color also the office was toxic and depressing
bad,The hub in Dallas is severely mismanaged. It's all about the metrics not customer service. I was actually reprimanded for spending too much time on the phone with customers! Making first contact is the cornerstone of quality claim handling. Quality is no longer a concern to state farm. Beware potential employees and customers.
bad,"Bad rates, bad agent contract, not the company that you think it's going to be when you first get involved. Opening your own agency doesn't provide the support initially promised."
bad,It all depends on the agent. Bad agent bad experience. They are too busy wanting to be a bank not worried about being an insurance agent. It is what it is.
bad,"Unrealistic demands on its employees.  45 min lunch break, 5 years to become vested. Reduced OT. Close to 300 claims in an ownership environment......"
bad,"This job did not give its associates the opportunity to advance. The manager were never available. since it was a fast paced call center, most times you were unable to check emails or voicemails."
bad,aslkdjfa;lkdjfasdf a tyoical day at work; the money was good but that was about it; they needed better management; the job was not challenging enough for me
bad,Communication is very lacking in their customer care center. I did not find that SF was very organized and had issues constantly. Resources are not updated and it's hard to get the swing of things.
bad,"Number driven, focus has become solely about the external customers. Value of an employee is based upon productivity."
bad,"This job will make you want to rip your hair out! Sat in a back office every day for a year before I couldn't take it anymore. You either stay for 10 years or can barely make it past 6 months, when I left 3 other employees quit weeks apart."
bad,"I wish I can tell good things but I prefer not too "
bad,"You can put your heart into most jobs and expect to be compensated for this. Not the case with State Farm where I worked in an Agents office. He was strictly out to use and abuse every one of his employees to the point that they quit, finding relief. Promises of raises and great benefits that never happened. "
bad,I learned administrative skills. Management could be a lot better. Need to look out for employees future more and include benefits
bad,"You are told when to go to the bathroom, insurance benefis are high and not affordable, so you have to work overtime to get a decent paycheck. No work/life balance, crazy work schedules. No flexibility with a weekend schedule, work every weekend instead of 2 out of the month. Management only cares about numbers. Recruiters fool you to think the express job is not a call center, it is."
bad,"Unless you know how to sell, and are willing to slowly make money this isn't for you. The office I was at had a big turn time with employees who wasn't making any money. There are no benefits, and depending on what agent you work for and your fellow employees the work environment can be a nightmare. Well it was in my case, I'm sure State Farm is a money making machine but only if you own your on branch other than that good luck, not very beneficial for employees."
bad,I didn't enjoy working for State Farm as the work environment was very chaotic and stressful. There was little training and no respect for employees. I didn't see it as a professional place to work. I had a terrible experience working with my agent. I had never been treated so poorly in a job in my life. I was glad to move onto other career opportunities.
bad,Spend all day getting hung up on by senior citizens. No benefits and minimum wage pay. You can't afford the insurance you're trying to sell.
bad,Did not work out for me.not a good fit.Great helpful employees.
bad,"9 to 5pm"
bad,I worked for several agents in this company and they got worse as I moved on. The agents didn't care about what was going on with me all they cared about was making a sale. I don't ever want to work for a company who doesn't care about the employees.
bad,"State Farm has completely changed the way it does business within the past year, which is bad news for any prospective new employee.  The company recently relocated several major departments to Arizona, but this is NOT good news.  State Farm is only here to capitalize on Arizona's low wage job market.  They pay far below industry average for claims professionals.  State Farm has staffed 2 huge (new) departments with thousands of these low wage jobs - claims professionals making a non-living wage of $12/hr.  So if you are looking for advancement and career opportunities as a claims professional, don't look at State Farm, especially in Arizona.  You will be competing with thousands of these low wage employees for a relatively small number of advancement opportunities.  And you probably will not be moved to a different deparment if you do qualify for advancement.  You will also be forced to work in an environment which promotes illegal conduct such as harassment in the workplace.  Stay as far away from this  company as possible."
bad,"With the position I was able to utilize marketing skills. There were only three agents in the office, which made it a quiet place to work. The hardest part of the job was working on commission which was new to me. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employees"
bad,"Great atmosphere,"
bad,"Working inside some agency can be more than what the agent sell you . There is little to no help . You will be better of utilizing ccc support thru State Farm for help. Advices is to work for a newer agent vs a older one . Reason.... most older agents are stuck in there old way of doing business. New agents are more willing to offer training, help you set goals , purchase leads to help you produce. Interview with several agents before you make a decision"
bad,"I asked repeatedly for help and every time it seemed like I was bothering whom ever I asked, like they had something better to do. You earned no pay ($0.00) while you are cold calling just trying to get a nibble from a potential client. To me, this is a dead end job unless you have money in the bank or a spouse who can pay all of your bills while you try to get just one client. It was a total waste of time. I could have gotten a different job in the time I wasted trying to make this into a real job."
bad,They only seem to be interested in selling to people. They don't seem to be concerned in the best interest of the client. They don't seem to appreciate the agent and agent staff.
bad,"I started with State Farm in 2000 and left in 2018.  The company in 2000, culturally, from a benefits perspective, and leadership direction, have evolved for the worse over the course of those 18 years.  Salaried positions became timecard posistions.  Flexibility with your schedule disappeared.  Development of employees has evolved into a ""let's develop them as necessary for the role, but play favorites for who we want to promote"" mentality.  Furthermore, time off you earned was literally slashed in half in 2018.  Additionally, accrued sick leave that you earned as an employee was eliminated and never discussed or addressed with employees.  Salaries were effectively frozen in 2018, and if you did/do get a pay raise or bonus now, it is tied to company performance.  Ironically, senior leadership sets the benchmarks which they can VERY effectively predict, thus enabling them to control employee bonuses and State Farm's tax strategy long before the year is completed.  Company first, people last."
bad,It was good at first and then suddenly became a bad place to work at really fast. There was too much leeway for team members to act inappropriately and they were not corrected
bad,"The agent I worked for started off really nice. Then things started going down hill fast. The agent spoke to the staff in a very rude, unprofessional manner. Because she/he owned it! Belittle people all the time! Very toxic work environment."
bad,The owner was very pleasant to be around. The manager and his girlfriend who is the receptionist was part of the issue on why I left. Overall I excelled with the outbound dials and quotas. I worked very well with the owner and the other agent during the work hours.
bad,"Each location is independently owned, so based on each Owner the experience could be different.  The overall State Farm Corporation makes the job itself very difficult, they are always changing rules without notice to the Staff and it is hard to help customers"
bad,"New office manager is unprofessional, lacks management skills and made my employment impossible. As employee you don't get any State Farm discounts :("
bad,I would not take back my experience for working for this group. The knowledge I gained was extremely beneficial and I still utilize the skill set to this day.
bad,Would not recommend working here. Management is terrible and will treat you like a number. I did like my co-workers and they made work enjoyable. Plus side is OT.
bad,"State Farm used to be a great company that was built on keeping its customers and employees happy. Those days are GONE.  The only thing they care about now is how many new policies they can get. They treat the call center people like slaves instead of employees, which shows in  the poor customer service that is given to customers. The employees and customers have been putting up with this treatment for far too long. The company used to be true to their word, but that is no longer the case. Hundreds of customers have left based on the way they were treated in the claim handling process. They are no longer the good neighbor."
bad,"State Farm is not a place for everyone. Without going into too much detail, the job itself isn't bad, it's the company backing it. Rather than lose your sanity, leave when you realize it's no longer for you."
bad,"Terrible morale!  Everyone who can retire or has a better job has already left.  Management does not value its’ employees at all.  It is overly quota driven, and extremely stressful, so much so, that we sit in 5’x5’ cubicles but don’t even say “good morning”.  That is the level of stress we are under.  "
bad,"State Farm can do better! As I write this post the only thing I can think of that I’m satisfied with is the benefits package. That alone is not enough to keep employees happy. Not like employees are utilizing benefits constantly.! This company has not adopted  the philosophy that happy employees equal happy customers. Employees are forced to work 10 hour shifts (mandatory overtime occasionally) due to inadequate staffing. Management is not concerned about addressing the issues that contribute to extremely high turnover.  They just overload current employees. Calls holding constantly. Rather than address this, management will put in place hiring freezes that keep current employees from career advancement. "
bad,"It's a great company to work for if you are a top seller, they treat you like a dollar sign not a person. It's unfair and agents get away with a lot. It's always great in the beginning and they are great interviewers."
bad,"Very stressful job,  company's work life balance is completely off. They roll all your time off into one.  Vacation...sick days are all the same days. You have to kiss butt too advance. Management micro manages you. Your on the phone's 90% off the day even tho the company tells you it's not a call center. Customers  curse you out and constantly belittle you. They have consistent unlimited overtime meaning they can not keep any employees. They never have enough to complete job duties. They work you to death and continuously add job duties but never give any raises besides your annual. Work load is extremely heavy with no wiggle room for error or your getting disciplined"
bad,Depends on the agent and compensation formula/salary. Not a fan of a changing compensation structure and a limited base salary. Long hours and many inconveniences for social functions.
bad,"The business has to adapt to change; the company made changes without explaining why.  No consideration for experience or tenure.  "
bad,"was lied to about compensation, pay and benefits, when I brought this up to the agent, he asked me if we were wasting each others time. absolutely horrible experience, I do not believe this is the industry standard of behavior for state farm insurance company."
bad,"The executives were completely disconnected from what was needed to be done. What was once a customer service focused environment became essentially a factory. Overworked and underpaid staff, management who only wanted to look good in front of higher up executives, and the training was abyssal. Time clock system that gives points so management can fire you for no reason."
bad,I enjoyed my job and what I do just not for State farm. The managers are incompetent and treat employees unfairly that they don't favor. Some managers are great and will help you move forward or there deny that advancement.
bad,"Due to changes in benefits, it was clear to all which employees received good ratings and we became targeted by work bullying from those who tried to get better EPR’s but lacked work ethic. Instead of management addressing it correctly, they tried to “keep the peace” and say to the parties involved what they wanted to hear without having truth behind it. It became too stressful and many people were isolated by peers for doing a good job and beyond."
bad,"When I was hired at State Farm I was so excited. State Farm is an industry leader and their reputation is stellar. After training, I started in Enterprise ILR. It was ok, except for the schedule. You don't have much of a choice in the schedule you work. It was an evening schedule and off Thursday, Friday and Saturday. That is actually a good schedule if you consider not many of the day shifts have consecutive days off. "
bad,"Over the recent years State Farm has taken away a generous bank of sick time from their employees. Now employees only have a limited bank of PTO to use for sick time and vacation time. This to me is unrealistic if the company wants to attract loyal employees. It is almost impossible for parents of small children to build up a decent bank of PTO.  This is just one of many changes the company has made in the 5 years I have worked here. Sadly, the company is more worried about metrics than they are about the wellbeing of their employees."
bad,"A typical day at work was  making calls to clients and collect mileage and missing information for underwriting answer phones and assist clients by taking payments. "
bad,My current company has turned into the typical management greedy company that no longer cares for it's employees.  While the company looses millions the CEO and president still receive big bonuses.  They no longer want the farming community as people they serve and only want the big city customers.
bad,Typical 9-5 day with weekends off. Culture around office had little to no morale. Manager acted as unprofessional and was very difficult to work with.
bad,"1) This job does not pay enough to keep up with the cost of living and does not have any health benefits. 2) The particular employer/Agent I worked for, does not provide sick leave for full time employees."
bad,"Terrible, Nasty Co workers, Not Friendly Management Catty and Gossipers. Lots of Assumptions without facts. Very Stressful Environment. I wouldn't recommend!"
bad,"The company culture was adolescent at  best.  This was not a place for adults looking to advance their career, but one that was designed to be a joke."
bad,"Not worth the pay and lack of benefits or time off. Rates are really high and policy sales are almost impossible. Agent did not buy leads, current book of business were are unhappy clients hard to cross sale."
bad,"There are not  enough hours in the day to tell you about this company and its rapid decline of quality and services. State Farm is reducing or rewriting job positions and at the same time increasing work down the line, without consideration of the extra amount of time needed to complete tasks. The typical day at work is stressful and worrisome.  Complex calls are not taken into consideration when calculating time limits. Good Team Managers are often doing the work for many Team Managers who take several long breaks and are unavailable for support for their own team associates. There is very little ( if any) credit or recognition for an employee who goes above and beyond the average services and keeps another customer from leaving State Farm. I learned a lot about the corporate job culture. Each team associate I worked with were professional and supportive. The most enjoyable part of the job was when a customer felt better at the end of the call and said Thank You. That was easy. Or, "" I feel much better now."""
bad,I was a temporary contract employee.  There is very much a culture of employees vs. contractors at this company.  The contractors are not considered viable contributors to the daily running of the business.
bad,you will be doing lots of outboard sales calls and have to meet lots of sales quotas.  There is some service work but sales quotas are the biggest part of the job.
bad,"Our office Agent was very mean and vulgar. He had no respect for his employees. The job itself was very fun however, if he caught us having a good time, we were wasting time even if it was on our lunch. We were expected to be there 10/12 hours at a time but did not receive extra compensation and I never saw any commission."
bad,I did not like the constant observation of me doing my job by my supervisor or the State Farm monitoring service on my computer.  I felt as though the work schedule is not a good fit for family life either.
bad,"The agent I worked for required mandatory bible study at work and was very degrading to female employees. As a company, I love State Farm and still recommend other agents to my friends, but State Farm should quit protecting this particular agent."
bad,"They cared very little for the opinion or experience of their employees, contrary to their ""Philosophy they refused to listen to their front line staff and constantly made them feel inconsequential."
bad,Lot of empty promises... Insecure management stalled any advancement. Was told after one year you could advance and make more money. Complete lie... They protected Associates with 20 plus years who did not have the skill set for their job... They knew they would never get fired so their output was nil.
bad,Claims has a lot of mandatory overtime because they don't want to hire more employees. Not a good balance. I did not feel they cared at all about employees.
bad,There is a lack of consistency because Everything is managers discretion. Keep your fingers crossed that you get a fair manager.  The point system is thee too... set you up to fail. And that too is managers discretion. She/ He can go in and approve/deny points. Time off requested can be approved/ denied by manager.
bad,"Struggling firm that couldn't afford to hire more staff. The hours were long, and there was no raise in pay. Training was thorough, and morale was positive."
bad,The Agent that I worked for is the reason for my poor review. Agents and their staff are not direct employees of State Farm. The agent that I worked for would change the commission on a monthly basis to suit his needs. I would not recommend working for this agent.
bad,"A typical day at work requires that you sit at your computer and operate like a robot. You are not allowed to talk at all. I learned many things about insurance that I did  not previously know. Management is very sneaky. They act sincere but when it's time to take action on things that you thought were covered as your benefits, they use the information you gave to them in hopes of compassion against you. It is very hard to move up in the company. People have been there for years and are given more job duties but not an increase in payment. The job is very complicated and the metrics are not realistic. They claim to care about the employees ideas but will continuously make excused as of to why not, just as any other big business. The PTO is very hard to obtain and you receive very little per check and so easy to use when ANY need to be off is needed."
bad,The job itself is very difficult but State Farm adds even more stress.  It is not a healthy environment.  The job involves hours of sitting at your desk working on computer and talking on phone.
bad,"My agent was NEVER there, i mean like never ever!! Clients would call multiple times and only wanted to speak with him. We would relay message but agent would never call them back. Causing client to want to take business else where."
bad,"State Farm's new direction includes less training, micromanagement and horrible work environment.  I would not recommend any seasoned professional not apply with State Farm."
bad,No real work/life balance. Highly stressful environment. The training is adequate. They use to be more family oriented and now they are not. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you help someone when they needed you to guide them thru something they may not have ever experienced before.
bad,No advancement Oppurtunities Poor training low pay Horrible commission and bonus structure poor leadership poor training no benefits Monday through friday
bad,"task oriented company"
bad,"Not the best place to be. Horrible management with mandatory overtime, unattainable expectations, unreasonable metrics, high turnover, they will fire you for placing a customer on hold for one minute too long."
bad,"they don't offer benefits, the agent I worked for was terrible, the after hours people don't do much so you have to take care of horribly done work"
bad,"This company expected you to be available 24/7, drop everything you're doing outside of work schedule, work long hours in extreme conditions and use your own vehicle for hauling trash.  They do not invest in their employees."
bad,"Overall pretty bad experience. I did not enjoy many parts of my job as an intern. Though you may not be selling the best product, they will ask you to deliver the pitch as if you are."
bad,"I only did three weeks of training for claims associate when I realized the job was not for me. The micro managed environment would have been brutal for me since my background is  counseling & teaching. The training instructors motivate you to believe you can work in the call center environment even if you never have. After doing a side by side training and talking with a few ILR associates on staff, they expressed exactly what I perceived.Theres stress about numbers, concern about managers attitudes if you aren't making the numbers. This affects your ability and opportunity to move to a better position. In my view this breeds an unhealthy work life balance. Although you will be ""remarkable"" to customers the relationships with peers & staff can go awry. Backstabbing & gossip live in this environment."
bad,"BEWARE!!!!!!!!! Not a good company to work for "
bad,"I have learned a lot about managing and finding a solution to problems. However, that office lacks teamwork, everyone turns there heads when there is a problem instead of helping each other to solve it."
bad,"Overall, there is a lot to learn, and not much time to learn it. Mostly trial and error, then fixing the problem down the line. They really want to empower and educate, to help people make good choices."
bad,"State Farm is the #1 auto insurance company. They should pay better than this. All these licenses I have, but the commission is not consistent. We are second fiddle to the agents. We are doing way too many service calls and not enough quotes. All they care about is service level. We don't get paid for replacements and are forced to sell things we cant bind!"
bad,"This company treats its employees like cattle. They stress attendance so much that they do not respect their employees rights to take off work if their sick. Sick or not they want you there. They watch everything that you do, every minute you take for breaks. Its an awful environment."
bad,"There was never a dull moment, at State Farm. However, the actual compensation security was not stable. My job contract and compensation contract was constantly changing. I do love working in an office, but as a mother and soon to be wife I need to find a position that will give me compensation security."
bad,"Pros: none"
bad,"This is a typical call center environment."
bad,"micro managed, cumbersome database, hard to get days off especially around holidays since tenured employees get first dibs, rotating shifts,  hard to make it out of the call center unless you have the right connections.  Yo receive alot of sick days, but no STD, and you indirectly will be penalized for using ""questionable"" sick time even though it is alloted to you."
bad,"Enjoyed meeting new people every day and traveling. However, i wasn't passionate about the product i was seeling... It's a crucial compenant in the sales cycle."
bad,"Very busy, heavy phones, HeavyCustomer service witth customers calling in, walking into office no appointments,"
bad,As with most agencies pay is minimal to acceptable. It's a job...always asking for more without additional compenstation.
bad,Poor atmosphere...management and agency owners have no concern for employees. Strictly about the $$$$.
bad,High school like environment gossip and lies.Lack of communication and understanding throughout the office.Crazy man lurking area harassing worker vandalizing office.
bad,"The common has great benefits for long-term employment; however, it is difficult to move up in the company. Salary is not sustainable for young professionals."
bad,I worked at an agency in Glen Cove NY.  The owners were idiots. The office was filthy. They didn't   have  too many clients.  It was a fill in job until I got something else. I do not know how other agencies  run their business but thos one was just awful.
bad,"Serviced clients as needed, provided a needs analyst or pivoted other products, ran report which were disseminated to colleagues for cold call report to staff members."
bad,"No room for professional growth after being hired. Prior external experience, abilities not valued as transferable skills. New successful strategies are led/implemented brand new info-tech hires (comparatively exorbitant salaries), unfettered by indoctrination into historically Pyramid-style leadership. Decision-makers’ KPIs are incongruous with day to day low level objectives. objectives.unable to sufficiently respond to variables that directly affect profitability or sustainable growth of the company."
bad,Couldn’t depend on the leadership to fully train and or support me during my limited time of employment and always had to watch my back as backstabbing by coworkers was a common occurrence and no one could be trusted.
bad,"This company has really lost its way, take it from someone who was to be laid off after 29 years of dedicated service.  The once employee friendly company  has been taken over by a bunch of data crunching managers who have everyone on a short leash when it comes to production. They have ruined what used to be the number one insurance company."
bad,"Not the best company to apply to. No chance for advancement, Company uses Metric System to gain more production and seldom allows time off for holidays etc., Very poor Management team in Subrogation."
bad,"I worked for this company for a year. The benefits are good and the hours are there. The pay was fair as well."
bad,"State Farm has great training and is good for someone trying to get into auto claims or if you really need a job. The schedules, the phones, the managers will make your days very stressful. This is not the State Farm of old. Also, pay is below the market standard in Atlanta. Promotions are slow to come by so you make several lateral moves in order to get a promotion. In claims, you are on the phones constantly which makes it harder for you to handle the actual claim and maintain customer care metrics."
bad,The hardest part of the job is meeting customer expectations within the role of claim specialist at State Farm. Withing the work day requires your ability to manage the incoming volume with the need to be out of the office for inspections.
bad,My experience it was a very hostile work environment and management did nothing but blame the victim...It would have been a great place to work if not having to deal with the bullying
bad,Very stressful due to lack of time spent by management to train on using computer programs and lack of explanation training how the office functions.  Learned to not return to that field.  Workplace culture is competitive with no integrity due to commissions and sales. Most difficult part of the job was the management/owner integrity and lack of empathy. Enjoyed lunch time away from the office.
bad,I hated working here but its a job and I don't like working Saturday and its hard to get off. people are weird here and no culture but overall again its a job
bad,Agent office is no set benefits and  structure. There are good/great agents out there. Most do not offer benefits. If your a strong in sales then maybe you can negotiate. Most Agents have their office personnel and hard to get in. I consider these jobs for a second income not for the wage earner. You are at the whim of high and lows.
bad,"If you are going to work for an agent, find a good agent to work for. Very little room to advance your career. They always promise to give you your own office, and make you an agent. That's how they keep people working in an agents office. I worked with guys who had been doing it for years, still hoping to become an agent."
bad,"I like he hours, but management and co worker gossip and were very unprofessional in work and attitude, management did not care for employees in any tip  of way as an employee or personal."
bad,It used to be like a family. Not anymore. Lack of communication. The people are great but upper leadership gives no clear direction. Email is considered communication. They need to be out on the field.
bad,"If you like working with unprofessional people then this is the place for you. The trainer complained the entire time about how he did not like the training class. Dress code relaxed but people push the envelope and come to work looking as if they just got out of bed or came from the strip club. You are micromanaged and they are able to view your computer screens. You are not able to choose your schedule, when people quit and the desired schedule is available they still will not let you pick it. You have to bid for holidays off which was not explained during phone or face to face interview. Attendance and tardiness is on a point system and is easy to acquire. They have an extremely high turnover rate which is why they hire in groups of 100 or more."
bad,"Laid back environment on some days"
bad,"Employee morale is next to nothing.  There is more work than people and constant overtime.  Work hours are terrible and constantly changing. While this giant of a company was once a customer focused business that appreciated its employees, it is now all about the bottom line and the employee is expendable."
bad,"I worked for an agent so there are no benefits at all and it was difficult because when her clients wanted to talk to the actual agent her self she just told us to tell them that shes away or sick or in a meeting when she was sitting in her office talking about opening her other business, if your going to work at State farm make sure to actually apply to the corporation, not an agent."
bad,"Woeking here was amazing...at first."
bad,"The agent was not organized, too unpredictable with anger issues and was very unprofessional. The agent does not know how to run a business.  The agent lacks communication with staff members, and did not adequately train employees because they did not know how to run some of the programs themselves.  This made it hard to adequately serve customers and take care of their needs.  State Farm as a whole is a good company, just not working for this agent."
bad,"I'm so tired of hearing what the old State Farm was like. It is really sad that this company does not care about their employees any longer and totally focus on numbers and profits. Customer service is lacking for policyholders because all employees do is look for a way to cut corners to met unrealistic metrics. It is as if no one is truly focused on providing remarkable customer service. If this company does not change soon they will lose policyholders who have been with them for decades. Also, a company should never expect employees to give what they do not give back to their internal customers. State Farm has countless managers who do not take accountability and pass the buck and do not fight for their team because they are only focused on saving their necks. If no one speaks up and everyone continues to be for self and not look ahead this company will not be a huge competitor in auto insurance. It really sad to hear policyholders who have been with the company for over 50 years say they are looking for a new insurance company and we know they have multiple auto policies including home insurance. Employees are always stressed here."
bad,"The Claim Specialist is responsible for the evaluation, negotiation and settlement of insurance claims. Depending on the staffing model, one would have their own personal claim inventory via single-file ownership or share claim volume as a part of a larger team. Claims require direct contact with the policyholder, claimants and several external vendors. Being a part of a large call center within a much larger company often automates human resource functions such as processing time off based on task capacity; which limits the usage of your accrued personal time off benefits. Higher levels of management are usually centralized in hub locations."
bad,I have worked for several different State Farm agents and each have been bad for their own reasons. Agents were never there and left the work up to the employees with little help. Team members get snapped at by customers since the agents are never available. This job is mostly temporary if you are working with new agents as they reset their staff frequently. Overall State Farm is a good insurance company that takes care of its clients but each individual agent runs their office differently.
bad,They don’t pay enough to love. Raise numbers to ridiculous levels. Don’t give you time to reach the goal before they raise it again. Management is not empathetic.
bad,"The vision of the organization is poorly understood. "
bad,"worked for a new agent just past the 3 year business mark in the opening of the agency. They were not innovative to keep up with a growing industry. Ill developed mobile app and archaic insurance writing systems, horrible rates, and poor sales strategy will continue to have the agency and this company fall behind competitors."
bad,"I left because it was too difficult to manage work/life balance due to the vacation scheduling process, the lack of upper management understanding the day to day process of work, and the morale with the continued changes."
bad,Stick to the new hubs if you go to work for State Farm. Since the company has been assumed by the new person everything is changing for the worse. Benefits are being cut. Pay i sway below par for other insurance company's. Pay raises are practically non existent and there is a strong culture of the Good Ole Boy in place. I would not recommend this place unless you absolutely need a job.
bad,"Production based, churn out as many cases an hour as humanly possible, tomorrow your goals will be higher. Little to no thanks or appreciation for your contributions. No opportunities for advancement within your current location (need to be ready to move out of state at the drop of a hat). Workplace culture is catty and competitive and everyone is very stressed at the thought of losing their jobs with little notice. Poor management structure."
bad,"Over 4 years of distinguished performance in the insurance industry. Successful at multitasking and working under pressure to accomplish overall objectives within a fast-paced environment.  Experienced claims adjuster, and effective leader, skilled in enlisting the support of all team members in aligning with organization goals to motivate staff productivity, improve efficiency and promote organizational consistency.  Strong interpersonal skills; able to communicate effectively with all organizational levels."
bad,"Half of the time managers were in meetings and could not be found. They are too worried about diversity, and not having the appropriate people in place."
bad,State Farm was once a family oriented company that cared about its employees but not anymore. Employees are expected to operate like robots/machines with minimal resources. And forget about work/life balance that does not exist in this new environment
bad,"State Farm used to be the place to work.  The changes that have been made in the past 2 years has impacted State Farm to the point it is no longer a desirable place to work.  State Farm is not only losing good employees, but policyholders as well."
bad,"When I started 20 years ago, the company had benefits that made it a good place to consider and they were family friendly.  They actually cared about work-life balance.  "
bad,Your experience as an Account Representative all depends on the actual Agent you are working for and thier management style. It is an extreme cut throat business. Agents are out for themselves ONLY
bad,They don't care about their people and life. They say there's room for advsncement but there's not and compensation is horrible!.......................
bad,"Don't even waste your time, take my word for it. This company is a waste of time and energy, this use to be a great place to work. It is now run down and is being manage poorly."
bad,My experience with State Farm has been each time I moved to another position in the company the work was more challenging and more stressful each day.  I also did not agree with only having 45 minutes a day for lunch.
bad,"State Farm's training program is amazing. The material I learned at State Farm gave me the education necessary to move along in the insurance industry. It is unfortunate they restructured their entire corporation in a way which makes employees feel undervalued, overworked, and under appreciated. The work/life balance was completely overlooked leaving every employee fed up with their positions. "
bad,"If you like abusive bosses, this is the place to work. She only put in enough time to get money ahead for the next vacation and found fault with everything . A miserable work environment where some employees do nothing and others worked two jobs."
bad,"They don't care about their employees and openly view people as disposable. I sat near a manager's cubicle and would hear them talk about their team with other managers in a non-productive way. Ex. How annoying so and so was or what someone was wearing."
bad,"Overall it was a great place to work, but over the years they are looking more for more bodies in chairs even with lack of experience and let older employees go."
bad,"Management Has their favorites who get paid bonuses and commission behind everyone's' back, while everyone else is equally qualified (if not more) and perform the same exact duties. How is it fair for one person to get paid commission for every sale they make but not for the second person?? Very hostile environment"
bad,"My job would start out on the phones and this was all day long. We were made to do things like Copart (salvage} and other which took a long time to do, but were told later we were not suppose to do. Management was horrible when it came down to listening to the employee, they never wanted to assist. One of the hardest part of the job was being micromanaged/stress. Working there was a nightmare - the place is very ghetto. It's all micro management and metrics - set impossible goals, whip the employees daily and tell them how poorly they are doing. If you see a positive rating in claims - it was a lie. The place is a slave factory."" Another reason  I left state farm was due to my long commutes, My daily commute exceeded 3 hours per day. and increasing due to traffic, this makes it hard to maintain a healthy life/ work balance. The enjoyable part of the job was leaving the end of the day....."
bad,They no longer care about their employees.  Although we have time off there is never availability to use it.  We are micro managed on how much work we produce and even if we provide quality work they still focus more on quantity.
bad,"very competitive and micro managed promised a lot in training however very easy to get stripped of these promises, very strict attendance policy, managers don't care"
bad,"This was in a brand new Agent's office. Agent had no experience in Sales or management. Had me sign contract for salary and hours, Then tried to lower my pay three different times and actually offered to pay me $50.00 a day cash off the books. I refused telling her it was illegal and did not meet minimum wage requirements. I was told to skip all required corporate training and she took the test to get me through it. I would not recommend this as appropriate behave for working conditions"
bad,"Work load is overwhelming.  They have initiated a Metric Work System monitoring incoming and out going calls.  Task queques goals have been set and are unrealistic with the calls and work load. Immediate management has to go along with the goals established by upper management . Immedicate management have to montitor you and coach the employee not meeting their goals.   Daily huddle meeetings to point out who is not meeting goals so other claim handlers can provide input.   This would be a great idea if the work load wasnt so heavy,"
bad,"In the last couple of years they have implemented many changes which have negatively impacted the work environment. Its almost impossible to use your vacation time and people are being forced to work holidays, weekends, and late shifts. Benefits have been reduced and job expectations have increased. If youre more than a few minutes late or leave early you get points. If you do that a few times in 6 months then you're fired. Lets face it, with traffic, weather conditions, sick kids, and other factors, there will be times youre late, have to call off, or have to leave early. People come to work sick so they dont get points, and the stress it creates is intense."
bad,"Managers have a group technique wherein any activity engaged in by any manager even if it is strictly illegal is upheld as without oversight.  This renders any complaints or comments null and void."
bad,Limited pay or chance for commissions. You work for the agent so you are at their mercy. No health/medical insurance is provided. Very little training provided.
bad,"There was no opportunity for advancement with very low commissions of $10 per auto policy sale with no incentives or actual bonuses that were actually ever paid.  Unless you were a black employee, you were not treated well.  The black employees seemed to get to come and go as they pleased while the white employees were constantly under scrutiny."
bad,Company focus is all on the matrix and not on quality of service provided.  There is a complete disregard for quality of life.  It is hard to get approved for a week of time off.  Shift work where the shifts are rotated making it very hard to balance work life issues.
bad,"State Farm has changed.  Giving the customer the best service possible is no longer important.  Controlling the employees by giving daily phone and task counts and wanting answers when numbers are not acceptable.  Management does not appreciate the work of employees, but will continue to ask the employees for more.  It's so sad.  Work for State Farm if you want to live a stressful life."
bad,"Work life balance is awful, the salary is not even at the low end of the scale for your position. Mid level managers are pretty good; upper level management is not very receptive to employee needs."
bad,"Used to be a great place to work. You felt job security, that leadership cared about the well being of the employees... etc. "
bad,"The owner would blatantly lie to customers faces, treated employees like children and constantly changed the pay structure so that there was no money to be made. Restricted sales and was degrading to employees."
bad,"State Farm used to be a great place to work for... no anymore. So much that I would not recommend it to anyone, no as a place to work neither as an insurance company."
bad,"no communication in the work field. "
bad,"As a disclaimer, my experiences do not reflect all State Farm agencies, nor working directly for State Farm / Desjardins corporate. "
bad,"Run to another Insurance Company!  State Farm is the number one insurance provider to consumers,  yet they are number one when it comes to paying thier employees."
bad,My co-workers were the best part of this job! Management could've been more helpful. Hardest part was not being able to be personable on the phone.
bad,"Morale is low because of the benefits, they give you sick time but don't want you to use it, and team managers think they are dictators of the world.  Upper management on the other hand are better than the lower management. They make you jump through hoops to get an interview within the company. They give you candy for doing a good job instead of some real money and they work on the favorites system where only your managers favorites get a descent raise.  The pension is not worth it because you can't afford to put anything in it because the pay is low and the insurance is high and they use this as a selling point. They also treat you like a little kid in that you can't talk during focus or quiet time."
bad,You are overworked and underpaid. The amount of tasked required for you to complete each day is enormous and constantly on the rise. The amount you are compensated stays the same unless you are a corporate flunky who will do anything to get where you need to be. Not a place for a person who has great measures of dignity and self worth.
bad,"Must always have time in mind as every second of your day is micro managed by workforce management. There is very little time for breaks - if you are able to take one at all and lunch is only 30 minutes."
bad,The company is going through a lot of internal changes in order to meet the needs of the customer and to deliver the product at a lower prices.  This makes good business sense.  The overall problem in executing this endeavor is that middle management does not have the necessary skill sets to execute the outcome.  The result is that they use outdated methods such as top down control (or fear) to manage today's workers and it does not promote employee satisfaction and impacts the overall customer service provided.
bad,Low morale. Low pay. High turnover. Unsafe neighborhood. Lack of training. If you liked to sale there was room to grow if office support is your specialty you will be overwhelmed & under appreciated.
bad,When the Agent shops at the mall all day and has you lie to clients that she is in a meeting....well that's all I need to say.
bad,"Sales, inbound outbound calls. takiing payments, emails, alot of products to sell, auto home banking life etc."
bad,"From the tone of your voice to how long you use the bathroom- all of this and more will be monitored. Expect to stay at a desk all day constantly tied to a headset. Thankfully during times of high call volume the trolley cart of goodness and candy will come around. Choose quickly and wisely, one choice per person. Sure makes up for the paycheck, mmm M&M's or some other fine choice."
bad,The hardest part of working for State Farm is they have really bad underwriters and they always are rude to you when they are in the wrong. I think they need to train the underwriters way more as they do not have very good communication skills
bad,I was promised job specific training prior to accepting the position and only received training in the form of modules on the computer I was expected to complete while working. There was no orientation or training for the 3 different programs being used or how to maneuver the specific tasks.
bad,"Since implementing the new operating model,  employee morale has significantly dropped.  Many processes in claims are not necessarily, which creates more stress with employees.  Additionally, customer service has degraded significantly because the many of the processes, the customer has to tell there story many times, which delays the process."
bad,Rely too much on matrix and micro management. Schedule was crazy. Treated you like robots. Workload was too much for one person. Very strict on schedule and overall not the place for me
bad,"I was excited when offered the position at SF.The training was long, but once in the position, found that most of the training was insufficient for he position. After training , No assistance, just push the numbers and metric. Managers, at least the one I had, was little to no help. "
bad,"Worked for an agent. Pay was subpar and commission opportunities were a joke. Not many people want to talk about insurance or even switch companies when they’ve been with theirs for years or have no issues with theirs! The “leads” dried out after the first month. As for the office culture and agent, they were meh, insurance tends to make people negative.  Ultimately, you can be a dishwasher for Outbacks and be paid a dollar more and deal with less stress! Working for corporate is advised, do not work for agents! Don’t waste your time!"
bad,"I was hired as a receptionist but expected to work as a sales rep. I worked for a smaller office and was told I'd need to have my property & causality license just so I could answer quick questions if the sales reps were busy. This made sense to me so I agreed to go through the training and was reimbursed for my costs, which was nice. Answering one or two quick questions was not the case; once hired on, I was expected to work both as a receptionist and a sales rep, something I would not have agreed to had that been clearer in the interview. My agent expected me to learn banking products as well and cold-call credit card offers, something that was absolutely NOT brought up in the interview, and had it been, I would have refused the job. "
bad,"I was extremely excited to start my career at State Farm, Human Resources made it seem like a great department until you leave training and find out the real position and responsibilities. I worked in Express Claims, I didn’t have a 1 on 1 with my manager for over a month so I had no idea if I was doing great or horrible. When I was hired, I was told I would be off the phones daily for 1-2 hours, that was a lie but then was put on phones all day for months. My manager talks about his employees behind their back when they not there. I think this is a great company, just go into another department."
bad,"My office did no real marketing to get people to call us, we would only work off lead lists making cold calls.  The problem is it's mostly bad information, disconnected numbers, wrong numbers, people tell you they never requested a quote or the info is several years old.  You spend a lot of time not writing policies, so you're not making commission.  Base salary is fine if you're not a single income household, otherwise, you can't live on it."
bad,"Typical cubical city. Metrics driven work place. Incompetent management, poor pay, and few perks. Cost cutting all over, they want robots not people. Avoid State Farm."
bad,"Zero consistency has always been an issue.  Now there are so many office closings that Tulsa alone lost 5,000 YEARS of experience. "
bad,"The environment of State Farm Park didn't really fit well with me. I was older than all of my coworkers (most of them being in high school), which made me feel out of place. I liked the freedom that my old pool gave me, but State Farm Park and Ellis gave me no freedom whatsoever to do my job and they were constantly watching us. We had to stay back an extra hour twice a month to get re-tested on our lifeguarding skills, which I thought was a waste of my time. I regretted working at that pool."
bad,"I think working at State Farm would be great, just not the Agency that I was with. It's unfortunate that the information I was provided upon hiring did not come to fruition."
bad,"Direct management lacked the necessary skills and job understanding to evaluate employees."
bad,"You are encouraged to do something while the opposite is expected.  Good luck...  "
bad,"constant pressure to get new clients, lack of training, policy input was through 3 different systems. What you were interviewed for was different from the job duties."
bad,There are different from other companies and the pay is low. I would recommend you look into another company. The old State Farm in long and gone. It is a dog eat world with limited upper job opportunities.
bad,"I didn’t enjoy calling for hours and hours just to push insurance down peoples throat who don’t want to be bothered. For an insurance company, they don’t offer many benefits."
bad,"Working in the state farm Call centers are horrible. you are under appreciated, over worked and up held to unattainable standards. Either you are there for the customer or you up hold metrics, there is no way to to both to the extent they think. Also decisions about the over all functionality of the phone tree system is is horrendous. People who have never worked in the call center or even the Scope of each department makes poor decisions. Management is terrible. there are a few that are super awesome, but there are literally two."
bad,I have no further comments at this time. I do not wish to express my opinion any further on the atmosphere and work conditions at State Farm. Thank you.
bad,"This used to be a company that valued individuals and what they brought to the workplace in unique experience.  Now the company is mainly concerned with metrics and expense management. Most of the experienced claims people have left through forced retirement, transition plans or due to an oppressive work environment.  The ones who are left are carrying such a high claim volume it is impossible to maintain their sanity let alone manage the files appropriately. Corporate wants employees to provide a remarkable customer experience but do not care for their employees experience at all. Corporate is upper management.  Local management is in the same position as the employees and their hands are tied.  If you are looking for a great career, move on to the next company.  State Farm is only a job at this point, not a place for a long term career."
bad,State Farm became a company that did not care about their employees. Unreasonable goals were set so that you could not make any money. Treated people like robots.
bad,I currently work as a USA for commercial lines and this department is horrible! We're constantly busy not enough people. No room for advancement. They say that they are competitive with pay but I've found companies that pay more for the exact same role. Very unorganized. Steadily changing processes and procedures but it negatively affects the employees and customers. Systems are out dated. There is no moral on my team and its very number driven. Very stressful.
bad,"If you want to get into insurance claims, it's pretty easy to get in.  Management is stretched thin and tensions are high in Express. State Farm is a Fortune 50 company that can't even make a Top Place to Work For list. Morale is non existent and my department doesn't hang onto its good employees for long. I feel bad for new hires hitting the floor under the impression you'll advance without playing office politics."
bad,"Culture has changed dramatically in the past 20 years. Multiple restructurings and layoffs, this company now has too few people to get the job of automating tasks done. Desiring to be a top competitor,  shedding workers before our internal technology was developed has set this company behind our competitors. Doing more with less only works when the CEO pays attention to timelines and reality, rather than $$$ from the management incentive program."
bad,"I was a full time student while working here, and it became very stressful to constantly meet weekly sales quotas, while juggling school. A typical day started with checking emails, work meeting, and then straight to our designated tasks. The hardest part became meeting the quotas. It was difficult to obtain new customers. A lot of customers became frustrated because of the rates and left. The prices and rules State Farm has is very conservative."
bad,"No longer ""The Farm"" used to be a very good company that nobody wanted to leave, and it was trusted now seems to be wrong type of management is taking over."
bad,"High stress, heavy workload, and poor work-life balance... All of this and a paycheck can be yours if you take a job in the bodily injury department at State Farm. Moral in the department is low and the company is experiencing cost pressures so don't expect pay to keep up with inflation"
bad,"Inbound call center Extremely stressful call center work "
bad,Statefarm believes the customer is always right no matter how abusive they are to the service representatives.They need to honor the workers they have
bad,This is definitely a great place to come and get your foot in the door in which will open up various opportunities for you to become successful in the future!
bad,"The agency I worked with, the agent always avoided clients, would never speak with them, office itself was just run so poorly and he would always complain about how he isn't making as much money as the previous year. He's lost over 10 people this year already and won't listen to his employees when they tell him that something needs to change. Another issue with this agent is that his way of ""training"" his employees is to play either an audio clip or video of someone else doing a presentation on how to sell better and basically says ""Why aren't you doing what he is saying, Do it or I lose money"". When you are first hired on he will say that you are expected to make 40K a year and he advertises the pay as 45K a year, while on a typical auto policy you don't make more than $15"
bad,As long as your Agent in charge is on top of their game then everything will run very smooth. However if you have a lazy agent in change your job will get increasingly difficult
bad,"It was a very high stress job that included lots of micromanagement. They pushed sales goals that were next to impossible once you got your foot in the door. Asking to do things that weren't ethical in my book. Picked what customers they wanted to give good service to and what ones they didn't want to waste their time with. It wasn't equal. Treated badly by management and the agency owner. Talked a great game at first, like there was so much push for advancement and possibly owning your own agency. Then once you were in you were brought down by the goals and expectations that were unrealistic. It kept you from making commission. Commission structure changed at the will of the agency owner. Very unfair."
bad,"Too stressful, Management didn't care how you were doing, they did care if you were feeling bad they just didn't care about it. If anyone messed up they would get picked on."
bad,"My review of this office was stressful because there was poor on-the-job training, hardest part of the job was dealing with a lot of angry customers.  There was no happiness in that office."
bad,"If you're looking for claims training, I would try it out for 6 months to a year.  Then become an independent adjuster.  The pay is 3 to 4 times hire and the stress level is about half and your work-life balance is better.   "
bad,"As I am being laid off due to an office closure, State Farm is hiring temporary workers as I speak as workload and staffing has never aligned in my tenure"
bad,"New CEO changed everything that was good about this company.  He took upfront PTO, no PSL, terrible attendance policy, low pay.  Morale was DESTROYED and everyone is seeking new employment opportunities."
bad,"SF has become a company more concerned with meeting unrealistic metrics then efficient handling of claims.  They have installed call center practices in non- call center roles, such as claim adjusters.  They monitor length of calls when, in handling claims can often be very lengthy.  They want you to complete processing of claims within a certain time frame, again depending on the circumstances, this is unattainable, especially during times such as now when losses/claims are abundant.  "
bad,"State Farm as a whole offers wonderful benefits. State Farm is a stepping stone for someone who wants to start a career in insurance. My advice is learn all you can learn and then run for the hills and never look back. The environment is toxic and draining. You are trained to be a robot and to be honest the environment is similar to a plantation. If you want to be micro managed and told when you can eat, speak and use the restroom then this may be the place for you. I left the company due to the culture, lack of diversity and low pay. Now if you need a temporary job to get on your feet then by all means apply but State Farm is definitely not what it use to be. Just be expected to just be an employee or considered a number to sit on the phone all day and repeat the same thing over and over versus being a valued employee. You would also be put on a point system and you have to actually clock in and out for breaks."
bad,"Poor Manager.  I loved the clients, but the agent in the office I worked in went through 12 staff members in 1 year.  It was so bad.  After 90 days, I was done."
bad,"New changes within company. Focused on profitability. Laid off many departments, locations and denied many promotions because of budgeting all while earning over 4 billion previous year."
bad,The center itself is great...new and updated. The management is very cliquey and do not support advancement within the company. Everyone seems to be out for themselves.
bad,"New CEO has drug the company down very quickly.  I can't see how they can remain solvent with the loss ratio they have.  Used to be an excellent place to work, but now it's all about the numbers."
bad,"I received very low pay with almost impossible commission. I wouldn't say all offices are like this, but mine was. The schedule is the only thing that I can honestly say I liked."
bad,"Productive and fun work place for the first 24 years; then changed their policies and the way of handling things - closing offices - shifting employees responsibilities; no consistency in management - only concern was the numbers....not the care for the customer; lost the ""State Farm Family"" feel."
bad,"The only thing that matters now is numbers, they have a metric for everything, they want quality & quantity, u cant have ur cake and eat it too.  No work life balance anymore for example there is NO  time available to take off for the next 7 months, and if u call off u get points. The old SF had file ownership, flexible work schedule, lap tops, u handled 1 to 4 states max, u were valued and appreciated, now ur disposable, work at min 9 states, the people that get rewarded r the ones that click off on tasks and dont do anything to move the claim forward, so since that person didn't do what the task requires u get the call on that claim complaining that nothing was done, now u have to spend an hr fixing the claim, next thing u know ur manager is having a talk with u, telling u ur great at what u do but ur quality claim handling is affecting the numbers, therefore if u dont change he will be forced to give u a level 1 rating.. there is barely any investigation anymore, everyone is so overwhelmed they just try to get the claim assigned somewhere else. They want u to handle in between call task which is also another metric, but we r behind 4 month on calendars, because all they do is assign u to phones all day, which r people upset that we haven't called them nor done anything on their claim yet if u dont do those discretionary not so discretionary task, because they put ur name on it, although we aren't allowed to have ownership of files, u look bad if u dont get them done..  I could literally go on for days.. i am sure by now u get the point.. so I'll stop there"
bad,"The culture is very cut throat. Very few job openings that aren't entry level. You have to be related to or a friend of others in order to get promoted. Entire families and their buddies make up most of the employees. If you aren't part of that group you are ostracized. "
bad,Employees are over worked and understaffed. Management views your every move under a microscope and tends to micromanage you. The Job would be manageable if the company provided enough staffing for the amount of work they expect to be completed.
bad,It was a very stressful and micromanaging working environment. I would not recommend State Farm to anyone else. They watch you every minute that you're there.
bad,Good people but sales with State Farm is difficult and depending on how the agent is set up it could be difficult to make a good income. Good starting sales position but no room for advancement.
bad,The owner of the particular State Farm I worked at was inappropriate.  He did not pay competitive salaries but often travelled and did as he pleased.  Never again unless at the corporate level.
bad,I had 24 good years with SF and suddenly it all ended. Now I and hundreds of us are looking for jobs or retiring early. Not the company it used to be.
bad,"You are the mercy of your agent, some offices are better than others. In order to become an Agent, you have to be appointed. That is a very lengthy process and the pay is not good until you get to that point."
bad,You are constantly monitored both personally and professionally.  There is a saying  at SF if you don't drink the kool-ade you will not succeed which means you must  agree and do everything thing management says.  If you disagree with them even if they are wrong you are considered a traitor and will not receive high raises or promotions.  Quality work is not considered a necessity to succeed at SF.
bad,Very cutthroat and lack of knowledge from management and lack of raises and promotions. Very fast paced and there was lack of work/life balance. Training process was awful for certain depts.
bad,"The workplace is ok, management iso ok, workplace is ok. Hardest part about the job is the systems are old, the training is not good, and the pay is horrible. The most enjoyable part of the job is food day."
bad,"Great job, if your starting out in the professional world. Not if your looking to live on your own. Staff there were up tight and rude again i was working the Cios building in Irving."
bad,"- workload is unbearable. Do the job of 3-4 ppl "
bad,I have worked for State Farm for 4 years in 2 different departments and the company is no longer a family oriented company. When I initially started working at State Farm there was work life balance and tons of great benefits which made up for the low pay but now there are no real benefits. There is no work life balance its so much work to be done that there is no time off available so although you have the time you can't use it. If you do call off or come in late you get points and once you get so many point you can be fired. Management never stand up for employees they just pressure us to close claims and work on getting our inventory down. They ask us to lie on surveys to make them look good and try to bribe us with food to give better responses on company surveys. Many managers are unprofessional and they say on appropriate things
bad,"When I worked there, we worked in segmented groups, meaning one group supported hardware issues, another supported software, another supported Agency Business Apps, etc., and you were not supposed to troubleshoot or try to resolve calls/issues that would go to another group, but had to transfer the call the group that would support the user's issue f they reached your group by mistake, or had one or more additional issues that your group did not support."
bad,"Environment, pay and metrics are awful, Pre employment never actually gives you the truth about the job description and it is basically a bad call center job."
bad,This just was not the place for me personally. I do not do well in a call center environment. They also do not work with you if you have issues in your personal life that affect your job.
bad,Small office with lots of internal politics. At one point the boss forgot to process payroll and caused me some issues. I was made to feel guilty that I needed to be paid on time.
bad,"No work/life balance, Upper management does not care, first line managers no longer have say, point system is horrible. SF culture has gone down the drain. 7 billion dollar loss in recent years."
bad,"In prior years ratings and recommendations would have been “5s” but company is going through aggressive down sizing and management lacks integrity. They are strategically terminating older long term employees early to save on severance and pensions in offices slated to close by unreasonable work expectations they continue to ramp up to try to get people to quit and or fire them. Upper management intentionally misrepresenting plans to keep employees in dark and in fear so they will work harder. Hostile, extremely stressful and high anxiety atmosphere daily among coworkers. Sad toxic situation at present. Was great until about five years ago. Hopefully will regain character and integrity in future."
bad,No benefits and poor management depending on your agent. Not a good job unless you are a great sales person or you  are a student and just need a job.
bad,It's a good place to get your footing in the insurance industry but not much more than that. I know most of the agents in my city and there's a ton of drama. The agents can't afford to pay the producers a decent living and have unrealistic sales expectations.
bad,"Management does not stand up for it's empoyees. Extra work is piled on with no adequate compensation, and thousands of people will be loosing their jobs."
bad,"Could’ve had better management, and better training. The managers only took a week to train you in something that should’ve been taught in a months worth of time, and expect you to know everything"
bad,Could have been better but she made the whole experience bad. I was approached while working some place else and was offered and opportunity to work for a new agent that needed a team to build up the business. Started off cool but as time went on thinks started to go south. The ladies in the office had attitudes with each other also i couldn't learn tge things i needed to know to be comfortable and well as knowledgeable to sale the insurance policies.
bad,"State Farm has grown to the size that it works against itself and not the competition.  New corporate policies are going back in history to a time when micro management was seen as good and productive.  There is too much emphasis on falling in line rather than being free to be creative and being invited to help the company stay out front and continue to lead the industry. Time clocks, adherence, demerits are all things that bog managers and employees down with being and staying average.  "
bad,"Owner expected a lot to be done so she didn’t ever have to come in. However she only paid minimum wage, to an insurance agent, I later found out how much she was pocketing off barely paying me. She also would make a habit of going through my cell phone when I would be in he restroom or what not, that was my last straw with them and I left."
bad,"She was rarely in the office, yet she managed to criticize my activity.  I would answer the phone and listen to what the client had to say and she would come running into the office and scream in my ear ""What is that they want?""  I'd have to put them on hold to find out what she needed.  I would tell her I was listening to the client and letting them tell me what they needed, without interrupting them.  She is not a good supervisor and has poor people skills."
bad,"When working there I was constantly told I was gonna do great things, so I worked hard and efficiently. Was told I would never get full time unless I became a sales agent (I was a receptionist). Someone new was hired to do what I did only in the evenings then slowly they gave me less work until I was told that I did so well and got them to places they never thought they would be and then they didnt need me any more. But I could work one day a week for 4 hours."
bad,Team member and Sales Team Leader at three different agencies. The last two agency owners that I worked for started their agencies from scratch and didn't get their contracts renewed by State Farm.
bad,"The people and teams I have worked with at State Farm have been phenomenal. The technical infrastructure however and leadership (not all, but most) are seriously lacking. I have seen numerous(too many to list) seriously talented careers ruined by favoritism in down-sizing selection processes, poor leadership, and poor policy changes. State Farm leadership ""brilliantly"" decided to roll back most(99.9%) of their WFH flexibility and Remote Work employment options. The decision is baffling in that their HUB locations are ""weak"" and not competitive enough in their attractiveness to appeal to the much needed talent of the younger generation. The technical infrastructure works, but not well and is not flexible or modern. This technical weakness leads to slow and clunky adoption of much needed efficiency and progression in the tech and tool space. Weak leaders prosper and abound, choosing not to challenge the status quo, but instead to protect themselves. These factors, in combination with a lack of investment in employees and environment and the lack of vision for the company as a whole by upper (CEO and board) level leaders, contribute to a very ""old school"" and unpleasant atmosphere. The saving grace is the workforce. In general, I have worked with a lot of really cool people. That one factor is not enough though, I would only recommend working here if you are in desperate need of a job. State Farm needs a major leadership shake-up to turn everything around. I hope it happens soon."
bad,"Stressful job, micromanage you, treat you like children. management try to be your friend but will use anything you tell them against you. Everyone is unhappy about their job. Don't listen to the employees"
bad,"The CEO is killing the company.  The entire company other than the executives know how poorly the company is being ran. They make changes on the back of their employees that only benefit their pockets, not the overall company."
bad,Great opportunity for a newly licensed producer but hard work at first to build up a book of business and referrals.  Reputable company if you work with an experienced and fair agent.
bad,"Unfortunately with the change of CEO, the once family oriented atmosphere that everyone loved is now gone. The overall direction of the company has changed to numbers driven which in my opinion has taken the company downhill. They have lost number very driven, professional and experienced people. You are left with a company full of inexperienced people with a high turnover rate."
bad,"Corporate bean counting and work force managment driven environment leave little in work life balance. Expectations are given and dashed by reality of being process driven, not talent driven."
bad,"Added time clocks in addition to system log-in."
bad,10% of the staff can be out at any given time which includes sick & vacation.  Most Mondays & Fridays are booked off when they do vacation bidding once a year.  Salaries are uncompetitive compared to the market.
bad,State Farm was a great place to work when I started. I loved it then the moral went down. I intended to retire here but I guess things change. I hope they will get back to the old State Farm.
bad,"take payments"
bad,"This is not the same state farm I worked for as a temp in 2010. The position I work in is constantly changing. Since I started working in this position the work load had doubled. The timeframe allowed to complete the work has also decreased. Two positions are merging into one. For the employees that are coming from the lower paying position, their pay will increase. The employees in the higher paying position pay will remain the same while the workload increase. I would love to stay with the company but my mind and body cannot handle the stress. Employees are unhappy and the work environment is tense. The managers disconnect from the employees and are only concerned with good numbers. When your numbers are consistently good, they will continue to search for other areas of weakness. This work environment is all about numbers. They expected you to speak to the customers as if you have all the time in the world although you are limited and expect to complete a multitude of task while carry on a conversation with the customer. In between calls you are expected to complete 12 additional tasks per day. This may be impossible due to call volume or if there are things you need to wrap up after the customer hangs up. What end up happening is you stay behind after the shift has ended to complete the required work. If you are anything like me, you end up staying long because you spot all errors from previous claim handlers who were rushed, I simply correct the mistakes. They don’t value hard work or integrity, good numbers are valued. Bottom line, you are only as good as your number are."
bad,Very micro managed!!! Team managers could care less because its all about the numbers!!! If your not currently taking an anti anxiety medication you will be before you leave!!!
bad,"A typical day you are over worked, too demanding, not enough employees for demand, not a fun work place anymore, and no longer family oriented.  New CEO has made a lot of drastic changes and there aren't any perks about the jobs anymore.  The work environment now feels like a slave ship."
bad,"The company culture is family oriented but they lack the ability to promote their internal talent from within."
bad,"Job security. Great place for young adults. Fast paced, very numbers driven environment.  Unrealistic expectations, unattainable to achieve goals with the volume of claims.  Very low moral  and very little work life balance,overtime is a must to maintain your normal workload. Very little flexible to take off time you have accrued.  Benefits are good-pension, dental/vision, 401K, credit union."
bad,"Great co-workers, upgraded systems and equipment, fun area to work in, does not value their employees. One of the lowest paying insurance companies in the auto claim field."
bad,I'm here for the customers making sure they feel secure every single day. Knowing they can call and make sure they can speak to someone they understand clearly is the key to satisfying your clients.
bad,To many overwhelming calls and stressful environment. Clients are disrespectful and theres no professional standard in the office to say there's a balance.
bad,"Again not a review of the company as a whole, but of the agent I worked for. New agent in town, no management skills or leadership. He was a micromanager, and being new to the end result."
bad,"A high paced and multi task positions, this company is not for someone whom wants to do very little.  The offer very little for the employee to move about or up in the company.  Required to take many classes without being able to use such classes.  I would not tell someone to post for a position with this company."
bad,"I have worked here for 5 years, and I am currently looking for employment elsewhere. I loved the job when I started, but things have gone downhill ever since."
bad,"Too much work with not enough pay. They will work you like a slave and if you ever have a manager by the name of David Newlin you better run. He is a micro manager who is all about numbers. He will use numbers to turn the team against one another and is not considerate of his employees feelings of personal issues. He made my short time at State Farm very stressful. He does not have a very good reputation around State Farm and everyone who works under him wants to get off of his team because he will harass you daily with emails, constant meetings, and side by sides. The company could be great but they need to get rid of people like David and people would feel valued."
bad,"Not happy with this company's practices and how they perceive their employees. Claim handling goals are set too high which causes cheaters to get ahead with good numbers while those who do everything by the book are reprimanded for not being effective enough."
bad,"Felt like I was rushed through training."
bad,I became an insurance agent as a second career. I joined forces with State Farm upon my original licensing.   I gathered a fantastic base of experience during my time with State Farm.
bad,"A normal 40 hour a week job became a 60-70 hour a week job.  Management did not care how you got the work done, only that you got it done.  "
bad,"Only allowed to ask for 15 days off, even if you have 25 available. Management does not care about personal days needed. Unable to take time off for family"
bad,The leadership was terrible. They didnt train me to do anything. I was shown a couple times and thats it. They put you in front of a computer and let that train you. Bill Davis himself is a good guy. But as far as leadership. Is almost non-excistant
bad,"I was given several lists to warm call clients. These had been called numerous times prior to my employment. The Agent promised to personally train me regularly, yet failed to. Also my salary was lower from what was initially negotiated. WORST EMPLOYER!!! I was lied to, poorly trained, and strong armed into leaving."
bad,"Formerly a amazing employer, now they have just become numbers driven and continue to reduce services and benefits to both employees and policy holders. Simply another large corporation only interested in profits. No work life balance remains for employees."
bad,the 3 females that worked in office did not like having a male in and did everything to push me out.  I would not recommend anyone work for this office.  they did not train well.  expect more work out of you then they are willing to do and even during off season still expect unreachable goals
bad,I got my start here and was licensed thru State Farm. I learned all the basics and fundmentals of insurance. Compensation was the hardest part of job.
bad,"Express Claims is a misnomer!  Most claims are closed within 45 days so I guess that is Express, faster than more Complexity claims!!"
bad,"management was stressful, my manager had certain individuals that she helped more than others."
bad,"I left a good career in a different industry after being courted by corporate State Farm.  After taking the testing and skills checks for being an eligible candidate to have my own agency, I was put on halt more or less because you need to have access to $100k for start up!  At that point, I was working for an agent who was top producer in the area.  Well, the office was anyway.  The agent was never around.  I got very little training from them; all my training came from other office members.  I was told it was be easy with my work ethic and devotion to the job to replace my 75k salary within the first year.  That never happened.  40+ work weeks were expected.  I would say closer to 50 at least. There was little to no work/life balance promoted.  Now I am job hunting again and have to explain why I am after only a year.  If you are willing to work long hours for minimum wage, go for it."
bad,"The only thing I liked about working here were the customers. State Farm its self is a pain to deal with. It would take forever for any changes to get done and then take forever for the billing dept. to get caught up. Then I would have to explain to the customers why their bill was twice as much 2 months after they made a change. "
bad,"I had zero training on this job. The Agent (owner) made it very clear on several occasions that he didn't have time to train me and that if I had questions that I could call an other agent's office and ask them. Was paid minimum wage plus commission, but the compensations plan changed every month in an effort to make us sale more and make the same."
bad,Pay is terrible. Turnover is very high. No benefits. All SF agent owners are independent. You can't expect to be there long unless you are a robot and can deal with terrible pay and no benefits.
bad,I was a claim representative/adjuster that helped pay out insurance claims to customers that lost their home or personal property listed in their homeowner's policy.  I learned customer service and law that surrounds insurance.  Management is horribly prejudicial and favors women because women supposedly speak to customers in a better tone.  They micro manage you and keep track of how long you are in the bathroom!!!  Hardest part was talking to contractors who have been building homes for 30 years and telling them that we couldn't pay them what they want but probably knew better than we and dealing with the horrible management.  They are not like a good neighbor if you work for them!  I did not enjoy this job
bad,"Was a vendor that worked for State Farm. enjoyed the co workers, could have better benefits and management could have taken more interest in their employees rather than trying to find fault"
bad,"Working for State Farm was a great place to start an insurance and securities career. And now its time to leave. With disconnected management, no benefits, and a pathetic wage to work ratio State Farm provides a helpful learning environment for new agents looking to hone their insurance skills. But as soon as you learn get the heck out of there."
bad,The work is great. I love what I do. I get to interact with customers on a daily basis. The work load is not unbearable. However the pay is very low.
bad,productive work  place and I learn how to go  about insurance  my co workers were nice  and my hardest part of the job is Mondays very busy but I can deal with it my enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers
bad,"First of all, the benefits are great at State Farm.  Its a very nice building in Phoenix AZ.  Things change quick and I actually enjoyed working as an Initial Loss Reporter.  However, when I started there they spoke of advancement opportunities, personal development and how they would guide you through that.  Now, I am a hard worker and am always in front of the curve.  Within my first month I had completed an Individual development plan, completed all extra modules and was looking for a mentor.  I thought they would love that and I was excited.  When I shared this information with my team manager he basically said your going to fast.  After six months blah blah blah.  "
bad,"Its all about who you know.   If management likes you,  you will succeed.   If they don't,  well,  be prepared to stay in your job forever.   Politics have changed so much there,  and not for the betterment of the employee.   Worked there 15 years.... After all that time still only made 31k.  Only good thing was the vacation time.   The main office is toxic."
bad,"Very sneaky in trying to weed out ""undesirables"". They will ride you like an old rodeo pony to make you quit if you don't ""fit"".  The training was good, the work was interesting.  Not worth the salary sacrifice for the promise of advancement when I didn't have the family or community connections to have a future."
bad,"Poor management, no execution of guidelines, too much drama,fighting and distraction."
bad,"** Good job work"
bad,State Farm Benchmark is a division of State Farm where all payments are processed. I learned how the company proofed all of the payments that came in from their policyholders and how the company operated its payment center. Management were people who had been their for years so change was hard for them to accept. I had great hardworking co-workers. The hardest part of the job was making sure your 10-key was accurate. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers.
bad,"Antiquated sales practices and non-forward thinking management makes this a tough job. Everything has to be said and done exactly as State Farm has written it which again, makes working in sales extremely difficult because every customer is different."
bad,"you are taking on the job of 2-3 people. "
bad,The company doesn’t care about the employees or the moral- only about the metrics.  Most managers are their just to collect a check.  The ability to move upward is minimal because they are short-staff
bad,"The working environment is fun.  Lots of helpful resources.  Pay is not very good for the amount of time and work you put into it.  Can be demanding at times, with little time off."
bad,Every agency is run differently. If you find a good agent with a good work culture you can enjoy your time as a producer. Hard goals to achiever are the norm.
bad,"It isn't really State Farm that is the problem. In fact it was the best call center I worked at before getting out of that industry after college. Ultimately though it was still a call  center. So there were structured breaks for the bathroom, mandatory overtime, impossible metrics that were not friendly to customers or workers, the usual garbage."
bad,The management at State Farm were all recent transfers from other states and they didn't seem to have any prior experience in management. They lacked people skills and when I would ask my supervisor a question he always tell me to ask a co-worker.
bad,"The company has great structure, the office I worked in had too much estrogen, the women were very catty. Didn’t stay there long, because of the office itself."
bad,"lots of favouritism amounts management "
bad,The company has changed drastically over the years.  There is no work/life balance and management is only focused on numbers.  There needs to be a complete overhaul of the company.
bad,Corporate was a mess. Manager was horrible. Not a great culture from what I experienced. Didn't give much time off and the compensation wasn't up to par with the industry.
bad,A typical workday was answering incoming calls and working tasks. Metrics are high on the list. Always a freeze for advancement. The integrity of leadership is not so great. The moral is very low.
bad,"conflicting priorities and unrealistic metrics prevent employees from doing their best work for the customer or risk being unsuccessful.  The company has changed its business model over the last several years and is consolidating to hubs in Dallas, Atlanta, Phoenix and Bloomington."
bad,Learned a lot of interesting facts about insurance.  The workplace enviroment should have been more professional without the dramatics but overall it was doable.
bad,The company really needs to treat Tier 1 employees a lot better. Leadership seems tends to be unprofessional and rude. There are extremely high turnover rates in those positions.
bad,"If you enjoy cold calling, intense sales pushes and being meagerly compensated, in most cases, this is the path for YOU!"
bad,"Interviewed and was hired for a specific skill set, but never worked in that skill set.  The group I was put in had massive amounts of downtime.  Was bored out of my mind.  Tried to get over to the skill set I was hired for but found you had to move to Bloomington IL to work in that skill set. This was a complete wast of 14 months of my life."
bad,"The company was family run since 1922, ending in approximately 2014.  The changes since then have been vast.  They implemented a metrics system, which makes it challenging to make the numbers they want.  The metrics should only be a guide; there is too much importance attached to numbers instead of taking the time to do a quality job. "
bad,I not sure if all State Farms are created equal but the one I was at was not run correctly. The training was lacking in many aspects and the pay was even worst.
bad,"Managers hired to manage people but have no idea of the work or job youre doing. This causes over worked employees, with little or no compensation and this is the same conversations you will find out in every department."
bad,You truly never stop if you want to be good at your job you can never truly take a day off. You are rated monthly on goals and quotas if you do not meet those do not hope to have a job the next
bad,Not the best for new hire.  Lower starting pay and not enough training to complete tasks and assignments.  High production expectations.  Bosses don't seem to care about their employees unless you are in the click.
bad,"A typical work day would be me coming into work and doing the Beginning of the Day. I learned how somethings about insurance. The workplace is okay, until the boss's partner comes in and tells me what I do wrong and not my boss. Makes me not want to work here anymore. The hardest part of the job is when his partner isn't here and me trying impress her all day. The best part I enjoy about work is me being able to help the customers out with something."
bad,good place to learn about insurance. you can learn about quoting and other insurance stuff. But their system is hard to understand but you can learn it
bad,Ive worked at State Farm for nearly 2 years. I was trained improperly and the work environment was stressful because of it. There is no set way a State Farm agency is ran because each agent is differenet. However my agent seemed not to care about their agency and expected you to learn on your own and will make you feel incapable.
bad,Training is lackluster and done in a group session with little concern to actually perfecting necessary skills for the job.Group training also removes any one on one connection with trainees.
bad,"The demand of on the job knowledge and amount of information you are required to learn and know in a short time with minimal errors makes for a stressful environment. The time and resources needed for a claim handler to be proficient and meet State Farm standard are not given, and the work load only increases but no training is given and the metrics remain the same. The promotion system is based on your ""brand"" which is the sum of how well you are liked by your immediate Team Manager. No consideration for your personal life is taken into account for scheduling. Any changes are always presented as a need for employees to be flexible and in the best interest for the customer. Overall the moral of the company has been deteriorating with last years customer and employee retention at an all time low. The number do not lie the company needs an overhaul and how it treats its customers and employees."
bad,"If you don't have a knack for being a salesperson, don't bother applying. Sales is the way you're going to truly excel at this job. The ability to multi-task are tested to the limit."
bad,An ethical company with work/life balance has been turned into a monster that just wants more for less.  They care less about getting it done right and more about the bottom line. No time at home?  Stressed beyond belief?  Who cares?  Have you finished your work?
bad,It’s an okay company for younger people. Great way to learn the basic knowledge of claims. The facility was amazing. I really don’t have anything else to say.
bad,"High stress, high school attitude environment. Never knew if overtime would be optional or mandatory. If lucky enough to use your paid time as flexible, you were required to then work overtime to show your appreciation. Would allow you to apply and get into roles without being upfront about the inability to get out of the role for an undefined amount of time if it was the wrong fit for you."
bad,"As a agent, you are 100% responsible for everything. Even leading up to what employees do. All successful agents learn to delegate, unfortunately that can be turned on you by the company."
bad,"If you do not have a sales background this is not the place for you, must have system background , understand company polices regarding the sale and communication of various insurance policeies to potential customers"
bad,"I worked for 2 different agents at State Farm and let me tell you they were night and day. I had one that continually wanted to be in my personal life and business and the other who wouldn't share a thing with us. They both set goals for you to sell so they could pay you commission and at times they would pay you but most of the time they came up with excuses as to why they couldn't pay you commission for what you sold, so I didn't stay long in the insurance business. I do hear that Allstate does pay out commissions to their employees."
bad,"The company has turned for the worse over the past 5 years, environment is reports driven with no place for spikes in work volume. Reports are constantly changing and assigned random benchmarks of acceptable outcomes."
bad,My experience as a marketing assistant was very stressful. I didn't really enjoy my overall experience of working for this company. It involves a lot of cold calls and emails which people are very rude during . But honestly I don't blame them. It can be annoying when a stranger is calling your phone mid day and talking to you about insurance policies. Nevertheless I had a quota to meet for the day and week. So it was like walking on eggshells on my phone calls. Very stressful environment overall. At least  My boss was alright. I worked there one month and got let go. My numbers were too low. At least I can say I got the experience of working with a well-known insurance company. That has definitely helped me in my career.
bad,"Every state farm is different, as every office's infrastructure is based on the agent's preference.  My boss/agent continuously had absurdly high expectations, all while underpaying his employees.  The office manager cried at least once a week.  Turnover in the office was absurd."
bad,"The bottom line is sales. If you are good at closing sales, you will be fine and will make money. If you are not good at closing sales, please do not waste your time.  Period."
bad,"The Agents for state farm are independent contractors for the corporate company. Most experiences I had with individual agents were rather pleasant and they, for the most part, genuinely care about their clients. However, they basically have no power over coverage decisions, weather that be offering coverage to a potential new client, or if a claim is covered. That is all decided by State Farm algorithms and there's no leeway. State Farm as a corporation, does not care about its clients, they are nothing more than statistics, for a company that is not publicly traded they place far too much value in their bottom line and show complete disregard for their insureds."
bad,"After ""transforming"" the IT department into a more ""Agile"" department, the department still operates in a traditional waterfall methodology.  The upper management of the department feel better because we use terms like, Scrum, stand ups and retrospectives, but management still operates in a waterfall fashion.  The micromanagement culture is bad that AVPs take attendance in leadership meetings."
bad,The job was selling mortgages and insurance. A typical work day consisted of cold calling to see if customers would be interested in a mortgage refinance.
bad,"Claims is full of incompetent people. Prepare to have to fix other claims specialists' mistakes constantly. Certain claims offices are notorious for doing as little work as possible, and you are the one who will pay for it."
bad,"Particular office didn't provide proper day to day training. Wanted me to post payments, with saved credit card info, I wouldn't save credit card info"
bad,i worked in an agent's office for state farm. there was a ton of turnover during my three month internship. the only person who really earned a living was the boss.
bad,"This is a call center sweatshop environment. You're micromanaged and monitored by management. You get back to back phone calls and two 15 minute breaks and one 45 minute lunch. Any other time off the phone is considered unplanned and counts against you."
bad,"It was ok. I like the people I worked with, but I did feel overwhelmed at times.  It was great hours for single moms and great pay. I was also able to go to school to sell insurance."
bad,"State Farm is a good company to work for and grow in if you work with a great agency. I have experienced the company at all 3 levels (Bad, moderate, and great). While this job will provide you with great sales experience, it is not a long term career path unless you discover that you would like to pursue becoming an agent. Benefits vary between agency, but usually there really isn't much. Culture varies by office, research accordingly."
bad,"The company culture has changed from one that cared about the customer, the employees, and the salesforce to one that cares only about the almighty dollar. They now take it all for granted. They assume they can overload the employees and they'll keep working hard; mistreat their agents and they'll keep selling; screw the policyholders and they'll remain loyal. There are still some good-hearted folks in the service departments, like claims and agent-facing regional offices, but the management has turned to big data for solutions to running the company instead of those of us who meet with and know the customers best. It's a shame to watch a once-great company become no better than any other run-of-the-mill company."
bad,"Hired as an agent to manage a book of business that had changed hands 3 times in the last 4 years.  Other agents immediately poached business.  Management claimed I would make at least $80,000 my first year.  They waited until November to tell me they weren't renewing my contract.  I was forced to close the business that I personally spent $50,000 of my own dollars building.  Despite being a top agent for homeowners / renters insurance I still got fired because even though those policies brought in the most premium State Farm only wants to sell auto and life insurance policies.  Carried thousands of dollars in debt for years until I could pay off the loans.  If you really want to be an insurance agent go independent."
bad,Just stressful and racist. Mental games played. It was hard to be happy.  No breaks and commission schedule was unclear. It was awful.  There was no way to get ahead and  compensation was not equal.
bad,"If you are okay with an entry level job with few opportunities for advancement, then State Farm might be the place for you. However, the work is very repetitive and working in a call center environment can be very stressful. Do you enjoy talking on the phone all day either answering questions or talking with frustrated customers? If not, then you might want to look for employment elsewhere."
bad,"agent was inexperienced as i was, coworkers were clueless, no benefits, commissions were withheld... long hours, low pay, lead generators useless....."
bad,"you work for an owner agent, small business not state farm the company.  every job and office is a little different but still it working for a small business."
bad,Need to work on keeping your employees happy and creating a more work life balance. High turnover rate. Work a lot of mandatory overtime even if you have kids.
bad,Daily training. A lot of time at desk sitting.  Breaks and lunches are too structured.  Over the top of micro management. Most difficult part of the job was being positive.
bad,"State Farm provided me with a broad spectrum of insurance experience, which helped me to decide which area of the business on which I wanted to focus."
bad,While working at State Farm it was hard at time to have a complete work-life balance because what was required from you out of the job. The job at times could be stressful.
bad,"Rapid decline under CEO Tipsord. Micromangement, counterproductive performance metrics, understaffed to a level necessitating mandatory overtime nearly always, ample PTO if you're able to use it."
bad,"Low morale due to terrible office management. Managing attorney is passive and office supervisor runs over him. She has some type of personality disorder which manifests in power trip, micromanagement of staff and an altered reality. There is harassment, bullying and favoritism which is allowed to occur which has resulted in good staff being run off or terminated as well as the above-mentioned low moral."
bad,"It is like the walking dead there , people just stay because they need the money or are scared to make a change. Most are waiting to get paid to leave with a severance pay"
bad,Lack of executive leadership to properly manage departments. Severe lack of awareness throughout the entire workplace in regards to the direct correlation between quality work and office morale. Severe measures taken against employees to reduce spending and prevent financial compensation in order to offset the horrible performance of the company in recent years due to billions of dollars in losses. Would not recommend working here.
bad,"Be wary of thinking you can move up in the company if you work hard. If you are a knowledgeable claim handler with good customer focus, your manager might consider you an okay employee, but if you don't meet metrics, you will never be considered a high performing employee and you will sooner or later be pushed towards the door."
bad,"State Farm is a good place to start off your career in insurance as they are the largest insurance company (for now) There are many downfalls to this company to include the stressful, hostile, and metrics driven environment that leads to low morale and poor claim handling causing hundreds of employees to leave and hundreds of thousands of policy cancellations. You clock in and out four times daily to include clocking out for lunch as if you worked at a production plant. You receive points for being more than 5 minutes late or coming from lunch more than 5 minutes. Management, both upper and lower don't seem to know what they are doing and can't offer clear direction or feedback. Enterprise systems are old and dated and crash almost weekly sometimes daily.  Compensation does not match the amount of work that's required."
bad,"Poor Training"
bad,"Each agency will be different, but the one that I happened to apply for was a mess. The interview process was very regular, and I was excited to work there. I will also say that I wasn't licensed and the agent helped me fund my classes and test for licensing which was very sweet. "
bad,"Don't expect work/life balance. They are all about the numbers and not their employees. Depending on the season & ""customer demand"" you will work crazy hours, weekends, holidays and it still won't be worth the money."
bad,No real opportunity for advancement due to nepotism and cronyism. An environment of micro management which poisoned the work environment. No support for good employee.
bad,"handled commercial losses, poor management, no direction, no training provided to perform job duties, no positive feedback provided, adjusters work on their own."
bad,The leadership of this company was extremely dismissive of employees.  They only offered the open door policy when they felt like they could easily fix an issue.
bad,"You're just a number. Low pay, lousy benefits, and inept leadership. Just a regular day on The Farm. Lots of talk about valuing employees but little evidence."
bad,The work environment was very stressful and trying to keep on top of metrics was impossible. Management would always stress that the customer was important and that you should do everything thing possible to make the customer happy. And the constant changes to the way policies were implemented were not conveyed to the employees until the last minute.
bad,"State Farm used to be a terrific place to work and I thought I would retire from this company.  I worked here over 11 years and was told SF had deep pockets and does not lay people off.  Just about every dept has gone through a structure study and there are lots of layoffs on the insurance side and bank side.  Leadership and communication is lacking and it is very evident SF does not value their employees.  Layoffs happen, I realize, but the cold way it was done was cold and cruel."
bad,Tis use to be a great company to work for- we now have a bean counter in charge and the customer relationship and caring about employees has diminished. Other companies had record breaking bonus times this year- not us....I was surprised we didn't have to pay the company.
bad,I don't like sitting behind a desk. I don't like calling from old lead list clients that have said no already 5 times.  I like more of a networking type of sales job; so hence this just wasn't for me.
bad,"Employees forced to remain in positions, unable to promote or move to area that best suit their career goals. Work load was unstainable and created a very stressful and difficult work environment."
bad,You have to be very motivated to work there. I ran out of patience due to my co workers stealing my car insurance policies. The Owner did not have a good understanding of managing people.
bad,The environment was not for a person that was lokkkmg fur a career. It was for young people with no previous work experience that didn’t have a clue about the corporate world. I felt like I was back in High School.
bad,"Poor management and terrible overall experience - low pay for a lot of work, promised bonuses, no delivery, management was constantly lying and creepy"
bad,This company was very inconsistent with their goals and wants of their employees they are only number driven and do not focus on the needs of the customer as they claim
bad,stressful work place.The pay is average .There is a lot cut throat activities by contract management and contract management.I would work there again if it was my last choice available
bad,"It was impossible to sell. Most of my time was devoted to fixing past errors that had nothing to do with me. The internal system NECHO is ancient and is impossible to work with, it is hard to sell while trying to maneuver through an archaic program. "
bad,An ethical company with work/life balance has been turned into a monster that just wants more for less.  They care less about getting it done right and more about the bottom line. No time at home?  Stressed beyond belief?  Who cares?  Have you finished your work?
bad,"The insurance side of the company has a great culture, low pay but still good people and management. The mortgage side has terrible management, lowest pay in the industry, and is completely understaffed, you will find yourself working 12 hours a day because they can't seem to hire more people."
bad,"Training is 6-9 months. you have to stay in the current position for 2 years before even being considered for advancement, you do not receive a full 40 hrs per week and the pay is very low compared to cost of living. The agents that you speak with are very rude."
bad,"Florida Claims Mail sorting is a tedious time consuming job that is understaffed and underpaid. Management who has never preformed the job function determines the metrics in which you have to hit each day not understanding the full scope of the job duties. Document separation, claim number identification, making copies of the envelope to comply with Florida state law."
bad,Management has no voice in how things are done and the complete lack of business courage is frightening. The customers needs are not being met as they should be.
bad,"The processes, team leads and schedules often change. The metrics are cut throat and if you take too long on a task or call you spend the rest of the week trying to catch up. They also do a lot of micromanaging."
bad,Did not enjoy this career choice mainly because of the agents I worked for. It was a very stressful atmosphere and not very welcoming. I would not want to work here again.
bad,"Great company. Long hours, so employees stayed busy. A work place that allows for growth. Helpful and understanding management team. Management offered mentor-ship if desired."
bad,"management does too much micro managing and will force you to use PTO if you're a minute late, but gives you a 5 minute grace period. i would recommend for anyone to consider alternatives."
bad,"By the company deciding to move all operations to the hubs, it leaves the dedicated tenured employee's all over the country in positions to have to look outside the company for jobs."
bad,The agency had a horrible atmosphere with rude agents and culture had a lot to do with it because Agent thought not following state guidelines or labor laws was ok.
bad,"After being with the company for 20 years, I was able to see numerous changes. State Farm is struggling with being a top tier company in 2018. They are extremely conservative and not a champion of work life balance. The company just instituted a new time off policy and actually reduced the paid time off for short term disability (having a baby).  State Farm has also put families in the difficult choice of offering opportunities where both spouses work with the company, then for advancement, one spouse may have to move, then the other has to find another job with another company since State Farm has taken a black and white stance on remote workers."
bad,"State Farm used to be a fantastic place to work, and maybe it will be again. "
bad,"Independent franchises, they set their own goals, No HR to defend staff, commissions are changed when agent believes goals are to easy (which is anytime you make a commission sales, which prompts them to increase goals to keep you reaching and failing), then boss complains when you're not motivated to sell. No employee benefits, no incentives, bait and switch comp plans(First year did $45k boss tried to change comp 3 times, second year boss changed comp made $33k, and sold more), no growth...Dead End Job!"
bad,State Farm hires mostly individuals with o-1 years of any professional experience.  They use a very unfriendly time and attendance policy.  The managers are hired out of the ranks but usually don't have any leadership exoerience.
bad,The workload is unsustainable. Career advancement is limited because majority of the departments are understaff. Work/Life Balance is hard unless you have no one that depends on you.
bad,SF going through major changes and taking a lot away from employees.  Work/life balance concerns exist.  Cannot get time away from the office when it's convenient for your.
bad,"wonderful place to work  years ago; many changes have left morale extremely low, many people leaving. I am not certain why I have to include more detail"
bad,"To greet and and welcome customers either in person or on the phone was always a joy to be able to assist a customer.  Maintaining   log books which included sign-in logs, front desk expenditures, and call received. Picked up and sorted out daily incoming correspondence and delivered sorted mail to each department.  Maintained the president calendars by planning and scheduling appointments.  Managed front office reception area by cleaning and organizing desk and visitor lobby."
bad,This was a good job.  I enjoyed meeting and helping new customers every day.  Very competitive office and good working conditions.  Liked a lot..  I enjoy meeting the public and customers and love to address their issues to resolve.
bad,It's a blessing to have a Job. I will not complain about the Job because I am just thankful for the opportunity to work and get the job experience. I just be thankful to work.
bad,"I have never had a work experience like this place. The management did not know what their teams did, the metrics did not make sense, and the bonus compensation was penalized for things out of your control. No opportunity to expand business base, not good supervisors who cared about closing loans. A miserable place to be day in and day out. Never listened to employees ideas or cared that there was a collective of many years of experience. If your experience was not SF- they did not care.  AVOID at all costs."
bad,"As a corporation, State Farm is a great company. The most important thing is making sure you are plugged into a good agency. The leadership and management in each office is vital for a positive environment."
bad,Agent cut corners Wrote anyone to bind business regardless of the insurance was appropriate. I do not believe the State Farm I worked at in 1981 is anywhere near the integrity level now.  It is a shame.
bad,They lure you in with all this hoopla about what a great company they are and how they are there for you. Not! They expect you to do a ton of work for very little money. The pay is not competitive and they don't appreciate their employees.
bad,"lack of morale, all about state farm, not concerned if you have an emergency or life changing event to happen in your life... they want you there at your desk answering phone calls"
bad,"No Advancement, Mircomanaged, Too Many Meetings, Claims Computer System Does Not Work Well."
bad,This is a good place for employment and possibly career advancement. It was just not for me. Management needed a little help aside from thinking of themselves instead of thinking as a team.
bad,The management was not a suitable fit no one knew there job it was always a run around and the compensation at the time was poor. The job title was not explained properly and the chances for movement were slim to none. No advancement was available at the time. There was little knowledge on the position and the new changes that were in effect weekly and little help provided for promotion.
bad,worked as a temp and was treated as such. had no defined work space; had to desk share sometimes 2 or 3 times a day. management was not very approachable.
bad,"Write auto and homeowners policies"
bad,"This place was once a great place to work. The company and management once cared about their employees. The current environment is gruelling with little reprieve and no support while being verbally abused by agent staff and insurers. There is little work/life balance for parents of young children as you are penalized for you and/or your family being ill or school closing unexpectedly, even if you have the time off to use."
bad,"state farm was a good place to work in but i did not like the management, the manager didn't give the right instruction or direction i basically learned everything on my own which is fine with me. I would have appreciated a little bit more help from management."
bad,"Consumer service representative is a very busy job, Answering phones,resolving and question and then updating clients records. Processing payments, also contact person the client was calling for."
bad,Too much unnecessary stress for a company that only sees their employees as money and not people. Tedious job that requires you to stare at a computer screen for hours on end.
bad,I happen to fall into this job which gave me the schedule structure and financial security I was looking for. I had a lot of tough experiences working with a lot of people but it was not at all my passion.
bad,"Agent I worked for really did not take the time to personally assist me with the job duties. I was a completely new hire basically set up to fail. I am bilingual in English and Spanish so i guess this meant i was great for answering phones, which i am. But what about policy questions? i knew nothing."
bad,"Make no mistake, the focus is squarely on being able to produce the desired number of completed tasks per day. Management is a mixed bag as one can expect at any company, if you're lucky and get a good one your time ""at the Farm"" may be enjoyable. Don't get comfy though as it is clear that they want no one to make a career out of any position."
bad,you need to join the cult if you want to move up. Lots of competition when it comes to applying for new jobs and that is because there is thousands of people working there. Drink the juice though and it will take you where you want to go.
bad,"Very thankful that I was able to gain some experience under State Farm, but everything was not as it was originally explained to me during the job offer period. Still thankful for the opportunity, but it is not something I wanted to continue doing with my life."
bad,Best part of working here is they promote from within. Everyone in my department are like a happy family. The only downside is that everyone has their own way of doing task instead of a standard way.
bad,"The new State Farm is all about the numbers and not the quality."
bad,"State Farm's culture used to be one of a dream, promoting diversity/inclusion, family-oriented, career advancement, a wonderful place to work. They have recently underwent a full enterprise reorganization with the replacement of the CEO. We are now metrics oriented, lack customer focus, and the main emphasis is on production and bottom line. We have fallen from one of the top performers on JDpower for customer service to near last. Most of the departments are frozen for laterals and promotions. These departments are only open to external hires for what they deem ""stabilization"" due to high attrition. There is a large exodus of highly trained and experienced employees as a consequence. The managers are promoted off mindstate and generic managerial capabilities. Most managers haven't even worked in the departments in which they manage. There is a serious degradation of knowledge and skills across the workforce as a result."
bad,"Compared to Allstate Insurance, this company lacks the same integrity.  It uses a outdated software system making it extremely user unfriendly, slow results, and aggravates the clients.  It is a company that is very expensive and does not offer anything distinguishable from the competition."
bad,"Was a great company to work for but with changing times, and management changes, the atmosphere became cutthroat. I really enjoyed my positions there. The hardest part were dealing with the vindictiveness of the woman in positions of authority,"
bad,Company scams people with unethical practices and pushes employees to sell based on those unethical practices. Company is poorly managed which makes it hard to provide good service to customers. I would never recommend anyone to work hear or use them as their insurance company.
bad,"Workplace culture was varied by department "
bad,"State Farm use to be a good company to work for but not anymore. There is no room for advancement if you are not mobile. The work life balance has changed for the worse. Even though my job is stressful I like the what I do. However, I think that the benefits and pay could better."
bad,"I am alway overwhelmed by new business. Most of new clients were referred by my existing clients due to my excellent service. My personality is to concern anyone's need as my priority. So, the problem can be usually addressed in the first place."
bad,"I was treated as an outcast and it is hard to move up unless you are favorite employee.  The people are rude, snobby and judgemental."
bad,"As a typical entry-level team member/staff/office person, your'e answering phone calls all day, binding insurance contracts, and answering customer inquiry and issues. However, you're doing the latter about 99% of the time. You get stacked with so many phone calls one after another and each with a task that would need to take some time. And then, you'd have to get back to every single one of those phone calls, all the while there are more phone calls being thrown at you. "
bad,This is a well known company and wonderful opportunity to learn sales as an entry level captive agent. Limited ability to advance. Plenty of training and learning opportunities.
bad,"the hardest part was dealing with customers and the work environment was not the best, but there is new management when i left"
bad,"the [place is packed with L and H vendors."
bad,This company was a good company but to far away. This job was in irvine and I had to take the train and a bus just to get to this location.
bad,"This was a very serious place to work. The atmosphere is a bit stuffy and the managers were not people friendly.  "
bad,"Initially great place to work, then mandatory overtime work which takes somewhere from 15-20 hrs per week !  this has created a very bad working environment and negative attitude toward the company.  State Farms does not care for their employees, families."
bad,Company trying to be profitable and has no direction of how to get there.   In the meantime the customer suffers and they blame the employee for the problems that were created by them.
bad,"Working with clients to make sure they had the right coverage for them, Welcoming and earning new clients business.  I trained myself on the computer as I had no leadership to train me."
bad,Have worked at State Farm for 11 years.  Still stuck in same pay grade even though I have completed all the training for my job.  Morale is very low.  They are under staffed and getting time off is next to impossible September - March.  Management is constantly asking for overtime volunteers.  You have to constantly deal with new staff's lack of training and a growing amount of processing errors.
bad,"I have some of the best co-workers that anyone could ever ask for, also State Farm has a lot of cubical space with room, the hardest part of the job is dealing with the low salary."
bad,"The ins company is in a small town, location is not in a busy part of the small town.. The town is small the town is small. The town is small."
bad,"Overall this company has a great reputation on insurance, but they do not treat their employees well. Their call center is like a sweat shop and they mainly hire for part time positions then you have to BID for an opportunity for a FULL time position. Unbelieveable. No opportunity for advancement until you put in blood sweat tears. Never again and I will NEVER get their insurance."
bad,"I like the custormer service aspect of the job, becase I helped people.  I am not a high pressure sales person.  It is not in my personallity to push someone into a sale, even if it is for their own benefit."
bad,This position allowed me a position learning auto insurance review.  It gave me an opportunity to work with another large company.  I enjoyed the strong production environment and the learning experience it allowed me.  The company was well organized and knew how to bring in a group of people and lead them on a good path to accomplish a goal.
bad,"I sold insurance policies through mainly cold calling prospective customers and assisted current customers with payments and changes to their policies. I learned a lot about insurance being that it was my first job in the industry. I had great coworkers who were a big help along the way but there was little guidance and help from management with expectations remaining extremely high. The most difficult part of the job was being able to assist customers with service issues along with closing on prospective customers. I did enjoy the satisfaction of the customers who I helped and sold to, knowing that they left my office knowing that they purchased the right product for them."
bad,I really feel that if I was properly trained at State Farm then it would have been a great job. I worked for an agent that was only an agent part time and worked mostly out of the office. I was the only full time representative in the office and 100% of my training was through the State Farm computer programs.
bad,"I answered multi-lined phone systems. Greeted customers and answered questions regarding various types of policies. Quoted and completed property and casualty policies such as auto, renter's, homeowner's, personal articles, and etc. Collected payments and applied them to policies."
bad,"you learned a lot on the job training.  you were made aware of the importance of having insurance.  "
bad,Agents are independent contractors who have no HR department to hold them accountable for their actions so they typically aren't ideal to work for.
bad,"I was a contractor, No frills. Just there to accomplish key goals."
bad,"Roles were changing frequently, office turn-over is high, have the potential to earn alot of money in Sales"
bad,"My mother always taught me, if you cant say something nice, don't say anything at all..."
bad,"This was the hardest job I ever had, not because of the work but because of the office politics.  In the beginning, it seemed to be a great place to work.  There was no potential for growth but there was a potential to earn incredible money and be a part of a large company.  As the time went on, it has been the worst place that I ever worked including not getting paid on time. Sometimes my paychecks are up to a week late.  I have worked for other independent agents and I have never been paid late. I don't know if this is because State Farm does not pay it's agents commission on time because the agent always has different excuse as to why he can not pay on time.  The agent also frequently changes commission scales days before he is due to pay you.  And forgets about bonuses that are due."
bad,"As an agency employee you are the agent's employee not State Farm's.  Therefore you are at the mercy of the agent.  He can decide what pay rate, and benefits if any he/she will give you.  They can also give other employees a higher salary and benefits if they wish to with no justification or explanation as to why you are not compensated equally.  There is also no consistency in policies, or premiums.  Poorly organized both in agency and corporate offices."
bad,"Typically my day consisted of reviewing calls that came in after hours to address any important issues or messages left my clients. Then I would review the daily report of past due payments, or required documentation from our corporate offices. My management was minimal and we really had no sense of leadership. It was very much a favoritism game and the office manager was only concerned with her own agenda not the overall good of the office. I did gain a lot of useful information on household finances and how to address upset clients and work through issues of all magnitudes."
bad,it wasnt much more than a paycheck.  Unclear on goals on daily basis. No clear marketing strategy it would change from day to day.
bad,"This is a cut throat company. I was abused by my boss, there were other cases of other occurances with the same person and HR did nothing to stop it. Good insurance company, never a problem with any claims I've had, but is an AWFUL place to work."
bad,"Very stressful call center environment with very little being done to address the daily challenges of this job. High call volume is overwhelming and stressful. Employees are rarely given positive feedback for ""remarkable"" service. Management more fixated on data, charts, and out of sync with their employees. Trying to get time off is difficult and only exceptions are ""life events"". Must request time off over a month in advance. Schedules are not flexible and impact ability to spend quality time with your family. Mandatory overtime has been in force over three years and if you do not meet your quota you will be written up. Given guilt trip if sick or child is sick. This job would work for someone who doesnt have kids or plans to have a life. Human resources will not tell you the full details of this position. Be prepared for the following if you take this position:"
bad,The owner was very rude and I feel that he was very sexist towards women. I did however love the women that I worked with. The pay was 6.00 an hour for 40 hours a week and I had weekends off. I enjoyed being able to bring in new clients but there was not a bonus for my work however I met some wonderful people.
bad,"Sales, Service, Claims Assistance. Great place to learn, unfortunately in agency (especially a new agents office) once you have learned the basics there is not much room for advancement."
bad,"Overall a good company to work for as long as you have patience with total loss department disorganization, continual change, and poor leadership. Each department varies greatly as far as employee satisfaction."
bad,"Very micro managed, no work life balance, but great advance opportunities. You have no sick time, any time off comes from your PTO bank. If you work in claims, it is very hard to get out of the department due to freezes and lots of turnover."
bad,"State Farm used to be a wonderful company but have created too many employee restrictions, overdid “diversity” rather than experience and ability.  Due to the reduced qualifications the experienced people end up doing the work of the “avoiders” all for the same pay! Corporate no longer cares about the employee"
bad,"They have ""incumbency"" and ""stabilization"" rules, which means as an employee you cannot apply for different jobs if your department decides they need you. So the job you want is then given to someone off the street while you are stuck in your entry job."
bad,They aren't developing their internal employees anymore rather instead using consulting companies to perform work that requires technical skills.  Between small persistent teams that have to cover every technology under the sun to the lack of study/certification incentives you are not positioned to develop or advance your career with this company.
bad,Good company depends on the agent . I learned to NEVER WORK FOR A NEW AFENT. NO benefits ! Besides paid time off . My agent was never in the office only for 5 hours out of the day 3-2 days out of the week . Good job for new people at office . I wish my agent was honest at my interview. You need your license or else they won’t hold the position for you and that’s something most agents don’t say at there interviews .
bad,"Politics is what seems to me to drive managers more than anything else at State Farm.  Unless you like silly, childish politics, I recommend you stay away.  They say one thing, then do another...constantly.  I also experienced a change of managers 4 times in a year though my position didn't change."
bad,"The five years I’ve spent with the company I have witnessed dramatic shifts in the corporate culture.  The recent brain drain is noticeable, made getting your work completed difficult and they continue to move in the same direction. "
bad,"Pay is competitive, but there isn't much ability to balance work this life in the lower levels of the company (claims, customer service, etc).  There is a lot of focus on metrics and completing a minimum amount of work; if you're an extremely efficient worker, this kind of job would be fine for you."
bad,"Very stressful environment, the company is all about numbers and performance.  New young management coming into the company is not good, do not have a life work balance anymore as in the past."
bad,"The job itself wasn't too bad.  The management is what killed it for me.   My supervisor was a stoner, incompetent, and would never help with any questions.  The company will also fire you that day if you put in your 2 weeks notice or even hint to someone that you want to work elsewhere.  The training was adequate but involved far too much roleplaying, wasn't very helpful."
bad,They lack empathy and integrity. It's a good entry job for someone who has never worked in corporate before. The job security is at a 3 starn due to the new point system implemented.
bad,"Unrealistic goals. If you make goal, they will continually up the bar. State Farm prefers quantity over quality. They will preach that the customer comes first, but in reality behind the scenes, it's about the number of cases you touch, right or wrong. Definitely not the company it used be."
bad,"micromanagement is an understatement at this place. They work you like a robot with no empathy. Overtime is a gift and a curse, Was a good company to work for at one point"
bad,Worked 5 years. I wanted to get my license. The agent wasn't comfortable with that even though it was talked about for years. Eventually left to seek other oppurtunities.
bad,Great company to start at but not to stay at. The salary ranges are not competitive with the competitors. Raises in adequate. 401k match is on the lower end. The company has a great training program and will teach you how to do your role. It's easy to get stuck.
bad,The ceo is trash. He doesnt care about the employees. There is no work life balnce or room for growth. State farm pays below average compared to most companies
bad,n/a I don't have much to say. It was a great company when I first started but adding more to the company and changing CEO made a big difference in the company.
bad,"I worked there for about a month and then decided to quit. A days work consisted of making 130 plus phone calls and sells before I ever got my license (I got my license the week before I quit), skipping through my state farm training because the agent I worked for thought it was useless,  her take my State Farm exams for me,  getting told I need to make sales even though the contract I signed stated I didn't have to make any sales till month 2, and studying for my state exam. The entire time I worked there I felt ill informed causing the high stress work environment. This probably isn't for all agents I just got a very pore one."
bad,The bosses was unfair. racism played apart of everything. other employees would down upon others worker that they feel are beneath them. it got to a point where it was very uncomfortable to work there at times.
bad,There wasn't much to do! Waiting for people to call in and the people that work in the office are full of gossip and are hard to work with. They were stuck in their own ways and didnt like new technology to help makes things easier for everyone in the office.
bad,"The Management at this office was one of the most unfriendly I have ever had to work for. I even got a Letter for the VP addressing my dress code, because I didn't wear long sleeved shirts without a jacket to cover all of my arms."
bad,"Everyday was spent cold calling people who did not want to be contacted, you were constantly yelled at by clients for calling and management for not calling more."
bad,"Commission structure is misleading, you make pennies off it and basically have to survive off your base pay. Sales goals are through the roof, rarely anyone hits them, so as result you are not getting your bonuses"
bad,I worked in a new office with no business in a rural county where State Farm was more expensive than the competition and almost all comp was quota-based.
bad,"After working for 39 years was told no job as I was too far from Lexington, KY office.  Live in Berea which is 40 miles away.  Another employee who lives 40 miles away also offered job.  But they were a younger employee with less benefits.  Pretty obvious reason not offered.  Never had a bad review and worked even when I was sick due to having to call customers day before to set up appointments.  This was obviously not enough for them.  This is a different State Farm culture than it used to be.  No longer customer oriented.  Numbers oriented with new CEO.  Very sad as State Farm was leader in Insurance industry but no longer just another 800 number for service.  This has played out on the agency side as they are losing customers because State Farm has no service.  Why pay more to be told by someone who could care less about their job since they are no longer compensated well that they are no longer important to State Farm."
bad,"My typical day was supposed to be outside marketing, however we had someone leave; and I got pulled into a service role without growth opportunity.   The hardest part of the job was not being able to trust what this particular manager said.  The best part was helping people"
bad,"it is currently a call center based environment, with high demand and pressure.  "
bad,"Not the best, but not the worst. I definitely would never go back. It's not easy to advance in this company. The hours are long and the pay could be a lot higher. You are micromanaged all the time!!! Nice building, but that doesn't cut it for me."
bad,"Great place to work for the last 19 years, but with all of the new changes, there isn't a good work/life balance.  Pay is decent and benefits are good, with PTO and health insurance."
bad,"Onboarding and training were my best moments at State Farm, once they get you on the floor, they like to incorporate ""Non-Optional OT"" If you do not work your share of mandatory hours, you'll be labeled someone who is not a team player. "
bad,"When I began at State Farm it was a great place to work. Over the years the company decided to change focus and ultimately it is now a revolving door at the company.  The upper management does not care about their employees.  Lower management does the best they can, but they are still held accountable.  There is mandatory overtime, a workload that no human being can possibly manage, and whatever you do is never enough.  Moral is so low that employees don't feel they have the time to do things correctly, so they make mistakes and don't care as they are not held accountable for the errors.  There is just to much work and no time for even management to review it all. When forced to change positions in order to keep my job, I asked for training that I felt was necessary and was told it would come with experience.  I did not feel that was an appropriate response from upper management while being forced to change my position to something I did not want to do or feel comfortable doing."
bad,"Steady pay, enigmatic scheduling that may switch from regular to irregular permanent hours based on “metrics,” clearly laid out goals, lots of “random” surveillance of workstations, correspondence, and communications, inconsistent measurement of achievement metrics by a seemingly constantly evolving team completely removed from management, and a mostly professional management team."
bad,The culture at State Farm was horrible. They decided to close their Tacoma location and towards the end of their time in Tacoma they started firing employees for things they previously accepted company wide so that they wouldnt have to pay unemployment when they closed.
bad,"No benefits, paid vacation and sick, office etiquette is poor and very unprofessional as is the HR department. The agent has poor leadership skills and very little training."
bad,I started as a commercial underwriter on the production team.  I was moved to the contact center where we answered calls from agents needing help with whatever.  So I was hired as an underwriter and was told I was an underwriter but in actuality I was essentially a customer service/help desk associate.  Not to mention they use a workforce management system which tells you when to take breaks and when to go to lunch.  The one good thing about it was the wonderful people I worked with.  We always lifted each other up and kept each other motivated
bad,"This company can be great to work for if you get the right job.  But you aren't likely to get placed in a desirable position when you start."
bad,"Working for this company has been a roller coaster.  I would not recommend applying for them at the current time.  It is facing many realignments and changes. See where the company is in a couple of years and if it settles down.  I hope the best for State Farm, though I am sad to see the direction things have gone in the recent year.  I think the founder would be sad too."
bad,"Not a great place to work, very stressful. They do not appreciate their employees. Managers are ""do as I say, not as I do"""
bad,Since the new CEO took over the company it has really become a terrible place to work.  
bad,"Low morale since notice that they are closing this office. Monotonous work,  same thing day in and day out. Not challenging at all. Was okay at first but not amymore."
bad,"Poor managerial staff, no advancement, company makes MANY mistakes, low salary, no benefits, great staff to work with, just poor managers and unable to cooperate."
bad,"This is one company that has good benefits, but the culture is still ran by managers with a lack of engagement and more about obtaining the numbers at all cost."
bad,I started working at State Farm 5 years ago and it is a very big difference from the way things are being conducted today. They have promoted very inexperienced managers that are very number driven and scrutinize any little thing in your claim handling. They are constantly comparing you to others and making you compete with one another so that your numbers always look better compared to the next person. They don’t care about the customer or the repercussions that these numbers have on the customer. Everyone I work with is stressed and hates their job. I definitely would never recommend anyone to work here in any department of claims because it is all the same all across. This company is definitely not what it used to be.
bad,"I've been at SF for a few years, and have visibly noticed a decline in the workplace atmosphere and how team management handles their teams effectively. TMs say they only care about having ""proper behaviors"" however, still ultimately the metrics are all that matter. They measure everything from time talking on the phone, to time on hold, to time spent working after a call is completed, and how many tasks are completed per hour. "
bad,"I worked extremely hard in the call center and made very little money.  There was a lot of stress put on the employees and my particular manager didn't seem to appreciate anything our team did.  Would provide only negative feed back, nothing positive.  I tried several times to post out for other opportunities and found that to be next to impossible.  I would love to have had the opportunity to work in other areas of State Farm but couldn't financially hold on any longer being a single mom."
bad,"a typical day at work"
bad,State Farm is a Fast Paced work environment with Many ongoing changes. As of recently it has been losing a lot of good People due to the way that it has been conducting Business.
bad,"It does not appear the company is interested in the P&C insurance industry any longer based on major changes in focus, value of skills and professionalism and quality of leadership and new hires.  Recently, there have been some major changes at the company. The entire culture is affected and morale is extremely low."
bad,There is no advancement in this position other than owning your own company. Work can be enjoyable but hours are long requiring mcuh overtime without adequate compensation.
bad,statefarm is very fast paced ' management through my specific agency was not very good. work and home balance is hard. better job for somebody that does not have kids.
bad,Do not work at the Agency I worked for.  Her office is severly understaffed. Her management style is aweful and very unprofessional. You're home and work life balance will suffer as you're forced to give 150% daily.
bad,"Working at State Farm was fun, I enjoyed helping people out. The environment is very weird when it comes to management. Seems like some management looks down on you. If you do a great job they gift you with a cookie like a dog. They score you like your still in high school and they way they score you they intend for you to fail. The attendance policy is garbage. Making customers happy was my number one goal but if I didn't do my job a certain way and the customer was still happy I would get talked to like I failed. State Farm is not all one family it is split into several different categories. For instance if you are on the professional side of State Farm some of the polices that the lower ranks didn't apply to them. Other than that the people are great that work there but you always had to look out for number one."
bad,I did inventory / ordered supplies.  I answered calls recorded all messages that my boss needed to get back to. I learned how to do insurance claims. Always cleaned environment. Learning how to do all the insurances was a little difficult because there's several different ones. I enjoyed the all the work.
bad,"Horrible bosses! The amount of work they give you, does not add up to the amount of money they pay you. That's all I have to say because I actually do NOT have nothing else more to say."
bad,It's not a great place to work unless you are planning on being there until you retire.  The senior reps were extremely helpful but some of the management staff lacked compassion.
bad,"While I really loved my agent, and the low pay and lack of benefits was the deal breaker.  "
bad,"State Farm used to be known as the best employer in the area. They were a company that offered job security and great benefits, an ideal place to spend an entire career. This is no longer the case. State Farm is stripping away benefits, treating employees as resources instead of people, and the culture is changing so that employee morale is on a serious downturn."
bad,No work life balance. Unrealistic expectations and goals. No room for growth . Unorganized uncertainty ...............................................................
bad,Never really planned to leave but they are closing office and I can't relocate - not that they have even offered that yet. Poor communication from Corporate.
bad,"Senior leadership has unfortunately taken the company down the wrong road and because of this, many policyholders have left SF and employees are dropping like crazy, not to mention the billions of dollars they are loosing each year.   Line leaders are awesome; however, they no longer have control of their teams and senior leadership blames them for low morale.  Employees can no longer spend time on the phone with our customers and it has become a company which focuses ONLY on numbers and not our employees and policyholders.  I have worked for SF for over 20 years and would have recommend anyone to work here; however, now, I would say run away and fast."
bad,There was no advancement in small office atmosphere.  Handled much of the customer service with little compensation and benefits.  A good starter job.
bad,"I work for an agent, as a sales agent, so their rules differ from office to office.. The pay is awful. $10 hourly and commission starting at 3%. In my highest earning month i maybe cleared $13 dollars an hour once commission was factored in. you can work from 9-5 but to make any money you have to work more than that to see results. "
bad,"This company has fallen apart - avoid at all costs. New CEO has no regard for employees, benefits have declined and metrics are more important than people. There's a reason they have lost thousands of customers. recently."
bad,"State Farm got huge tax credits for their mega hubs in Dallas, Atlanta and Phoenix, so they are moving tens of thousands of people from regional offices to those mega buildings. The company policy is now that all work must be accomplished at a State Farm desk in a State Farm facility. No remote workers are allowed, unless you're one of the pets who were allowed to live on a boat. "
bad,"Cold Calling potential customers."
bad,"Did not enjoy my experience working in Business Lines Dept. You had absolutely no control of your schedule and it often times changed without sufficient notice. Sometimes you would end up with a shift working until 7 or 8pm. The job description was false and misleading as it does not state that you would be working in a call center. In addition you are micromanaged, your every move is monitored, and you are told what time to take your breaks, lunch breaks, etc. It is also difficult to get time off...especially holidays."
bad,"Bad leads, learned that if you wanted to make it you needed to become a outside sales rep, it worked better. Did not get the proper training from agent. Hardest part was getting leads, Best part of job was making sales! Also learned to close sales on phone and in person."
bad,"It is not the same company that is was a few years back. "
bad,"Many hoops to jump through to become licensed agent.  Location of agency not good.  Workplace culture was bearable, but it really does depend on the agency. A lot of cold calling to prospects.  the most enjoyable part of my job was meeting people."
bad,Company is changing. Less money more work. No reward. Indefinite incumbency periods for employees that don't allow for growth caused by badly implemented company changes
bad,High production environment.Manages every minute of your time. Very stressful trying to keep up with production quota and produce quality work. Once you get comfortable in one position you can quickly be moved to another.
bad,"I worked at State Farm as a stellar employee for 18 years and held several different roles at various levels. I thought I would be there for life, but since 2012 the company has undergone a major shift in culture and values toward its employees. Claims staff are incredibly micro-managed. The schedules do not allow for a healthy work/life balance. Trying to get time off is nearly impossible.There is a lot of stress with the inundation of employee monitoring tools. I left the company voluntarily when I no longer saw potential for me to grow there. "
bad,"State Farm used to promote itself as taking care of its employees. However, although important, the customer has become its priority at the expense of its employees."
bad,"People that I worked with, besides the agent, were great and helped make for a great atmosphere. The agent however, didn't fullfill her responsibilities we agreed upon when I was hired."
bad,"State Farm used to be a family based business where all associates were treated like individual family members. "
bad,Worked 25 years for State Farm.  They were a great company.  For new employees who were never apart of their original culture will most likely find them a good company still.  The focus used to be; happy employees make happy customers.
bad,"A typical day at work is never the same. Its very fast paced and no claim is handle the same. I've learned how to maintain calm and professional through conflicting claims. Management and co workers are the same as any other work place, you have great managers and then you have some that are not that great. You have co workers that are willing to help and care and then you have others that are in the work place just to collect a pay check. The hardest part of the job is not being able to assist the customer right away."
bad,"Weekly mandatory overtime is assigned (8-20 hours per week).  Our schedules have been changed from 9-5 to four 10 hour shifts including 830-7 every Saturday.  This is a call center environment focused on achieving high work volume as opposed to quality work.  We have a daily ""huddle"" during which everyone's statistics are posted on a board and you are expected to explain yourself if you miss a goal."
bad,the more rural the lower your wages from my experience. It's really up to the agent your benefits and wages. THat's really all i can say but it was definitely a location specific experience
bad,"Almost 20 years with the company. So caring for customers and employees. Regretfully things changed. More claims that can be possibly be handed, mirco micro management. With the consolidation went from 120 claims to 260. All it did was hurt those we were trying to help. Hour long hold times. Not able to get back with customers and attorneys. Not the Good Neighbor State Farm once was."
bad,"Honestly, when I first started with State Farm I absolutely loved it! My training was very in depth and informational, my first manager was amazing to say the least, she really cared about us and our advancement for our lives to be prosperous. She fought for us when our scoring came out unfair and never made us feel bad when we made a mistake, just trained us on how to do it the correct way."
bad,"Since the new CEO took over, there have been drastically numerous changes. We are given heavy workload forcing us to work overtime approximately 60hrs/week. The working hours are 10:30-7:00 which is very inconvenient if you have kids. There is no work & life balance. They also cut down our benefits and pay. There is no capacity when we request for vacation."
bad,"Since the new CEO took over,  there have been numerous changes in the company. We no longer have a work/life balance like before. We are given heavy workload and odd working hours. They also cut down our benefits and pay. When we request for vacation, we usually do not get the day we want."
bad,Must be a self motivated and personable individual if a commissioned agent. Not ideal for inexperienced salespersons.
bad,"During the course of my day, I have had the opportunity to work with many other departments to help further advance the company's strategic vision of change.  This has allowed me to gain perspective from different sources and how change effects each department differently."
bad,Working here is not the best. The employer cares more for getting new business then he does his employees. I would not recommend.
bad,My experience in a busy agents office is enjoying to socialize with your clients and meet new clients. I also enjoyed working with a close staff.
bad,"A typical day involved field inspections and issuing settlements in the field when possible. After inspections were completed, I would do paperwork, return phone calls and review the next days inspections. I learned how to multi-task and to emphasize customer service. The hardest part of the job was the wok load. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers."
bad,The company is a great company to work for. However if you work in Dallas Tx the management is not very good. There seems to be too many unqualified new managers with only a few years experience and they are not trained nor prepared to lead a team. The hardest part of the job is the amount of training that you will continue to get over time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the chance to meet new people.
bad,"A great place for student's and those who work two jobs per the schedules are part-time. Schedules have great flexibility for the morning shifts. It has become all about the numbers but there is space for personal growth and development. Overall management is supportive, but it is difficult to be put in position for promotions. The most enjoyable part of my job were the customers and my colleagues. Due to staffing the office became extremely busy and that started to burn out the employees."
bad,capital one is a very large corporation that really doesnt care about its employees. its so many people that they have a highturn over rate do to the unorganized corporation which makes it very hard to advance in the compant. Great company if your not looking for a career.
bad,"This company is good if you are right out of school and are willing to work for very little money (25-30K) for a couple of years.  If it's a second income in the home, or you still live at home with mom it'll do as well. If you can wait it out, they do still offer a pension."
bad,"-learned that many people who have insurance are not knowledgeable about their policies, so it was enjoyable to educate customers and provide suitable coverage for their needs."
bad,"I looked for new customers, cold calls every night. submit applications to agents. achieved goals that were set. strictly commission based"
bad,"lots of changes to keep up with and most of them do not benefit the customer, even though the changes are supposed to be for benefit of the customer. "
bad,The agent would leave staff to do stuff for themselves. Hardly helped and left almost everything to staff.
bad,"Although I enjoyed working for the State Farm agent, the office I worked in was not a busy office.  I felt very limited in what I could accomplish.  "
bad,Outgoing and incoming service calls.
bad,"I always heard, "" your the best "" then five minutes later, what about your pipe line?"
bad,There is a lot of documentation that is curtailed into this business. Deal with a lot of different people of ethnic backgrounds and have to file excessive amounts of paperwork in order to process title transferring to customers. Overprices on storage fees and other auto selling fees. Decent management. Other co workers were better when previous supervisor was on staff. Interaction with customers and associates.
bad,"The company does not really help you train, it is more on the agent. The training process is more of learn as you go, or call corporate for help. Unless you are a top sales person for over a year and become close with district managers there are no possibilities for advancing without moving to Bloomington. MAKE SURE if the agent says they will reimburse you for taking the classes to take your license you have that in writing. I am still waiting for my money 7 months later. The company has too many employees coming and going, customers get frustrated easily when everytime they come in it is someone new. Hourly pay or commision % could be higher. Although it seems that every month they are changing pay structure."
bad,"While working in the Service department, it felt more like upper management saw me as just a number rather than a worker. When I first started the CCC could actually help answer questions policyholders had, but a year later all CCC could do was cut in half. It turned into: answer call, apologize, transfer or leave a message to/for agent office. No matter the amount of extra training I did or the fact that I held a BBA degree in Business Management, I was never given a chance to even interview for a higher-level position or make a lateral move into another department. The company's employee retention-rate is laughable. It's surprising to see anyone last more than a few months at best unless they were content with just answering a phone call you can't help with or if you were filled with a lot of hope of someday being moved up in the company."
bad,"It is generally a nice place to work, for entry-level experience in the insurance industry. The training is intensive, and you need to be on the top of your game to succeed. When on the floor, be extremely cautious about what you do. They have artificial intelligence, that they spent so much money on, that listens to every word you mention to customers."
bad,The work hours were good and the pay was great. Statefarm the brand is a great but the Agent I worked for was unethical. Which made a very uncomfortable environment.
bad,overall the job was okay. The auto-ILR program was new when I arrived and very unorganized. The customers were my second biggest concern because the way the point system was set up then did not have much flexibility during lunch or for parents with children with asthma. The job itself was not bad and the trainers were very helpful but trying to locate information was a bit too time consuming.
bad,"Company is geared toward time based customer service as well as cookie cutter mold claim handling. No work life balance. Management is 100% geared toward meeting time goals and no focus on employees or any kind of work life balance, Poor upper management and horrible job focus."
bad,Training extensive lasting more than a yr and onboard is like cattle herding. The mentality during onboarding and training becomes competitive as each person strives to stand out above the others.
bad,"I have been in various different departments in SF, claims, sales, underwriting. There is not much work/ life balance, very metric driven, with many changes that seem to be having the opposite effect upper management was hoping for."
bad,"No work/ life balance and a high turnover rate.  "
bad,"The biggest pet-peeve about working here is how they continue to treat their employees. So many hard working, determined and committed people willing to give their all, but continue to get overlooked and over worked. I use to love to come into work and push myself to go above and beyond, but this place will drain the life out of you if you let it and there will be no reward for it. There has been, so much turnover in the last 6 months, that the work just continues to get dumped back on you and its extremely exhausting. This company has the potential to be great in every aspect, but they under pay, based on people from HR sitting at their desks and analyzing the pay rates of their company compared to other companies, but they also don't understand the many hats some of us have to wear in order to do our jobs, that doesn't get written in the job description, because then they would have to pay those people more. State Farm should be investing more money into their employees, because majority of us are working 2 jobs to maintain a household. It's sad to bust your behind everyday, just to struggle to make ends meet."
bad,Favortism to a buddies wife while she's allowed to treat people like dirt and get by with everything. I won't recommend anyone for this position. Go to a different State Farm to work.
bad,"I worked there going on 6 years, before deciding to leave, in a few different departments. It’s literally a high school environment. You are reprimanded for being a minute late, forget about ever being sick or having a child sick if it’s not “planned” time off your in trouble. Employees are nice overall but always in competition with each other you have daily meetings showing everyone you work with your scores for the prior day.  Management is touch and go depends what manager your under some are great others are AWFUL but they all have to report to someone higher up too."
bad,"Several departments in one building with opportunity to advance. Claim school offered as a tool for advancing job skills. Work life balance not a priority, shift schedules not suitable for all family situations. Non flexible management and upper management."
bad,This was a very unorganized place to work. I would not recommend this office for work to anyone. The people are extremely mean. The manager is never there to address the issue.
bad,"The pay is not great, the hours are okay when you do not have to bid for different shifts. PTO is good. The environment leaves nothing to be desired. The workers are unhappy and most of the team managers are only there for select few. They do play favorites. My team manager was good, but even he chose favorites sometimes. I do not recommend this job for  anyone who wants to enjoy where they work."
bad,"They are restructuring, which basically means going from many offices to just a few giant offices. This serves as an excuse for any nonsensical decision they make. They have de-skilled their positions, so that you don't end up with any transferable skills, only knowledge of their unique and antiquated system. Other insurance companys will see your experience there as a joke and not really insurance experience."
bad,Under went operational changes in order to meet daily metrics. Customer Service became second to finding ways to meet metrics.. A bachelor degree insured opportunity to those with no experience versus those who were working extensively with no time to finish college.
bad,Initially when I began working for SF you were expected to do mostly field work.  The last several years you became a number cruncher on your computer.  It was impossible to do a complete and thorough investigation in the time you were given based on volume of new investigations.  The culture changed drastically in my nearly 20 years.
bad,"There is no attempt to accurately balance claims adjuster's schedule to a balance of tasks and incoming calls. This leads to excessive build up of tasks, causing mandatory overtime (the last period of mandatory overtime was over 1 year continuously). "
bad,"The upper leadership aren't transparent about what they're doing and engaging employees on a regular basis about the reasons, needs, and impact of change. And they are under paying claim adjuster by at least $10,000 compared to there competitors."
bad,"It seemed like an easy approach. Get a job at the State Farm offices in downtown - I lived so close, I was walking to work! Training was 7 weeks, all paid. Spent 3 days of training only on benefits, including that education is paid by State Farm."
bad,"It really depends on the agent you end up working for, I would strongly encourage you to research the agency before making any decision of accepting any offer."
bad,"State Farm used to care about employees & customers. Now it’s all about the customers, numbers, & money. Underwriting employees have to earn their time off each pay period & submit time off requests for holidays and non-holidays up to a year in advance. The location in Lincoln, NE holds almost no developmental opportunities unless you are willing to move to IL, TX, AZ, or GA. Annual “bonuses” are based off of the company’s performance instead of the employee’s own merit. The training has become numbers focused, meaning how many items can be processed per hour, instead of balancing with quality. Items are processed wrong so much so that people are leaving the company over it. All locations have to conform to the way the Enterprise does things regardless of the dynamics of individuals and locations."
bad,"Stressful place to work,everyone is stressed due to the performance metrics. The pay does not equal the work load. The work life balance is horrible. I wouldn't recommend the job."
bad,"Missed kids like crazy. With this career new hires get horrible shifts and no good shift are available for long periods of time. It's extremely hard to get days off for funeral, kids sporting events, and vacations"
bad,"his is from an Auto claims former employee. I worked for State Farm for over half a decade. Without a doubt, there is no work/ life balance. Whatever you read here about flexibility comes from non-claims employees. Young employees are leaving and older employees are retiring early because they cannot take it. You will be expected to mandatory overtime with no end in sight. You will not be able to take the time off you have earned when you want to. No matter how good your performance is, you will be outranked by employees with decades under your belt at State Farm. They will get the preferred vacation and holidays and you will be stuck feeling burnt out. State Farm has auto claims employees in a point system for attendance. You will be penalized if you miss work because you have a family emergency, car emergency, etc. Get too many points and you will be written up and then fired. State Farm is all about the metrics and your every minute is tracked. You will be told when you go to lunch and when you take breaks. Your managers will have to talk to you so you can explain why you haven't met a certain metric that was never made to be achievable. Team Managers are also under pressure to have their direct reports meet these metrics."
bad,"What was formerly something to be proud of is now plagued with low morale, unbelievably terrible leadership, forced use of Agile methodology across the board even when it becomes a hindrance for teams.  Forced relocation for no real benefit, restructurization which ended up causing more turmoil and chaos than benefitting the organization.  Blindly adopting policies with no real merit then beating them into effect.   This place has undergone a real transformation in the past 10 years and none of it good.  ""Like a good neighbor"" has been retired and it shows.   It's more like your neighbor that lets his dog poo in your yard then blames you when he steps in it."
bad,"State Farm was an okay place to work at. My agent was really good at his job however, and sold a lot of life policies. Through SF i was able to obtain a P&C license, which was paid for. However, after being there for only a few months, I realized I was not into sales. This job is a hit or miss, if you are really good at sales, you could make a lot of money. the commissions were fair. However, if you are not a sales person, as I am not, you will be making close to nothing for your time spent. I did get an hourly wage, but it was maybe $2 above minimum wage, not enough to support my life. The worse part about this job is the cold calling, have to go out and pan out for people who DO NOT WANT TO BUY YOUR INSURANCE FOR 2-500 a month for insurance when they can go with someone like the General or someone else for a lot less. Give it that the insurance is probably not apples to apples, but for people who do not work in insurance, they do not care, as long as they are satisfying the state requirement, financing a car, or have a more expensive vehicle. I was trained by the larger company itself; SF would hold 2 day trainings on different products, to learn what they entail, how to sell, how to deal with rejection. Those were nice, however training for the agent himself was not really available. I was kinda just thrown in a desk and given a list of people, and told, here call these people, try to sell. Half the people didn't answer, the other half changed their numbers. Overall this is not a nurturing environment for someone who had no sales experience."
bad,They do not care about you. They will ask that you work 15-20 hours of OT every week while trying to maintain high standards of quality with low raise and pay.
bad,"The job is high pressure. You are dealing with a ton of money and lawsuits from injury and death claims. One mistake can cost the company millions and you can lose your job in an instant. The company does not value their employees is very unorganized. The company is constantly changing and put too much pressure on their employees to perform well. You are expected to do it all when you are an injury claim specialist. The expectations are unrealistic. My manager was amazing however, it is corporate that is the problem. They treat the managers at our hub horribly too. It is sad to see that people that have been loyal to the company for 20+ years are treated horribly by the company. The new CEO runs the company like a cutthroat business now where money is all that matters. The family and good neighbor culture State Farm was known for is long gone. "
bad,"Typical day is sitting at your cubicle with a headset on taking calls, sometimes nonstop. Our scope keeps widening, but our benefits are not increased. It's a glorified secretarial position. They tell you you'll be making a bunch of sales and commission will be great, but in reality, 90% of the calls you take are not sales related. Your training will not leave you feeling prepared and it kind of throws you to the sharks. I have become more and more anxious since taking this job, which is very uncharacteristic for me. You are constantly tracked and monitored to the minute. I am a customer and big fan of State Farm, but I wish I could have gotten into the company with a different position."
bad,"I worked at State Farm for more than a decade. You must assimilate or you will be miserable. They do not value the input of those outside of executive level management. Most new agents do not know what they are selling and therefore cannot advise customers well. The software systems are a kin to the Wizard pulling strings behind a curtain, in the city of Oz. This is not a company that truly values it's employees or customers. I worked with many who'd been with the company 20+ yrs that were very unhappy with their jobs, but felt stuck. They were riding it out, until retirement age. Not wanting the same future for myself, I chose to leave! Do not be fooled by fancy commercials and the name... This is not a great company to work for."
bad,"State farm is an okay place to work. Work is redundant, hard to advance. Management seems incompetent. Pay is not worth the work you are required to do."
bad,"Company used to be a great place to work, family oriented, after work activities and weekends with co-workers.  Employees and managagment cared for one another.  Changes in cultural now don't allow for anyof that.  Its all about numbers.  How many calls can you make, how many homes can you see, how many hours can you work.  The company is reducing the number of employees and I am being let go.  I wish all my fellow employees good luck."
bad,It once was a great place to work.  Loyalty from the company to the employees and from employees to the company.  Now with the recent new structure  it is all numbers.  Customers and employees are more unhappy than ever.
bad,"Toxic work environment. Bad management, terrible customers. I had to lie to customers because state farm would screw some people often enough to make me walk out."
bad,State Farm keeps you worried about not having a job. They are constantly going through a transition. Workload is almost always unmanageable due to turnover.
bad,"Worked as a temporary from 8am to 4:30am.  Lots of tasks, learned organization and time management.  Nothing hard about the job but could not get hired on due to the time constraint on pre-employment assessments. Most enjoyable was working with the customers over the phone."
bad,The salary was not inline with the areas cost of living.  Employees should not work everyday and still qualify for government benefits specially if they're single.
bad,Difficult area to work in with not the best training.  The use of two different computer programs make editing accounts difficult and confusing at times.  Commissions are low.
bad,"Great pay and benefits however, your lack of work life balance will make up for it! The culture has changed dramatically over the last two decades and it is now a place to look for a job, not a career."
bad,"I worked for a boss who was only in the office 1 time a month, if that, and I could count on both hands how many times we spoke in the year that I worked there. The compensation is low for sales as it is partial commission, which if your boss is like mine he will find any excuse to not pay you the commission. If you don't want your own agency there is really no room for growth."
bad,The quotas set in place are not reasonable. Employees cheat to meet their goals. Managers aren't trustworthy. The company doesn't care if your child is sick they will fire you for taking off.
bad,I used to love State Farm. The company culture was open and laid back instead of feeling corporate and forced . They tried to invest in their employees and help them succeed instead of play the numbers game and try to fill cubicles. They trusted their employees to manage their own time and had reasonable expectations for the amount of work that needed to be done to stay on top of things instead of trying to make everyone into robots. The exact opposite can be said of them now.
bad,"State Farm would have been the ideal place to begin a new career and stay until retirement. However, the changing atmosphere and the fact that the company is leaving the local area after a large hiring spree makes one wonder about the responsibility of the company. I've truly enjoyed my time there and am very disappointed that I won't be able to continue my growth there."
bad,"Literally feel like worthless scum here. There is nothing to make you feel confident about yourself. They don't call it a call center, but thats exactly what it has turned into. If you like feeling like a very replaceable number, then go for it. Like a good neighbor."
bad,They have a cut throat system that is very stress full. it's unrealistic. every task is time & if you 1 minutes late from lunch or fail to take your scheduled break. You will score poorly
bad,"State Farm is a great company to work for, stable, good benefits, they have many good things, but the career advancement is limited, if you are in the Miami office you will find lots of favoritism, and things of that nature. The job is also very stressful."
bad,"All I can say is there is overlapping work and goals managers can't explain, and poor morale among staff.  Too much work allocated to staff and the work is performed poorly.  You would be scared to know how the claims are really processed behind the scenes.  Management doesn't want your feedback on how to improve the work flow; just keep your head down and click your mouse."
bad,"By the time I was out of training and the floor, procedures had changed. My first supervisor was annoyed by the newbies placed on her team and was not helpful. My second supervisor was superb,she took the time to ensure the job duties were understood."
bad,Employees are treated like a number and not a person. The goal is speed rather than quality. This change has taken place over the last 4 years with many seasoned employees leaving the company for other jobs when employees are treated better.
bad,"Really enjoyed working for my boss, he was a sweetheart and always had my back. I felt I should have been offered health insurance instead of life insurance, but at least it was something. Pay was very low and stress was high."
bad,"Culture of racism and bigotry. One of the worst places I have ever worked. They sell you a dream that never comes true. No consideration for traffic, weather, or disasters."
bad,Basically they will let you go without notice. They don't care if you have a sick family member or anything in your personal life. This company just looks out for themselves and their revenue. The culture is stressful and many employees want out!!
bad,"State Farm seems like a good company to work for the first month, but then the real company starts to come out. It is consistently busy, management tends to be less than helpful, the attendance system is skewed, and it isn't worth being yelled at by upset customers for 8-10 hours per day."
bad,Things have changed. This is a good place to work if you are willing to relocate. Benefits are lacking and not competitive with other insurance companies. Work/life balance is definitely concerning.
bad,"Company was very family oriented, has become more numbers driven and a ""big brother"" atmosphere. Concerned that management is more concerned about making the numbers than if you do your best job."
bad,This used to be a great place to work with a promising future.  The company environment and culture has changed drastically over the last few years. Quantity is valued and rewarded more than quality and customer satisfaction.
bad,"Good company to work for, make sure agent is also 'good'"
bad,"This particular State Farm Agency, the work environment is very tense and extremely competitive among the agents..creating a very hostile work environment."
bad,Good work environment but very face pace and a little overwelming. A large volume of calls regarding claims. Co- workers are nice and helpful
bad,"Provide assistance to claim handlers by performing a variety of support services (e.g., setting up claim files, filing correspondence, ordering police reports)."
bad,SInce I started a few short months ago the turnover rate has been very high. The boss is a wonderful person but perhaps doesn't have the patience to run an office as she is very quick to fire people and people have literally walked out.
bad,Training is brief and there is no proper format for ongoing training for new employees.  Seasoned employees as being treated with a lack of trust and respect.  Stress levels are high due the high phone call volume and expectations. The claims environment is now a call center.
bad,"It is a large insurance company, lots of opportunities in Arizona, Texas, and Georgia. Upward mobility for those willing to relocate to these states."
bad,"A typical day consisted of balancing data, creating  web page updated or working on manual pages."
bad,"- A year ago I would have given all 4-5 stars"
bad,"The hardest part is having to bid for shifts every six months, and you may end up with a shift that includes working every Saturday and Sunday."
bad,If you are able to conform rank and file to the company culture propagated by State Farm it is an enjoyable job. While the benefits left something to be desired State Farm made sure to allow for personal time.
bad,"The work isn't difficult, basic insurance sales. However, the service work load is significant. Due to the high volume of service work, the sales of insurance suffers greatly. The agent couldn't comprehend that. His expectations were unrealistic. There is little training or guidance provided by the agent. Often times you're told two different things, to which he won't remember what he said."
bad,"Overall, State Farm is a great company.  I just happen to work for a very difficult agent.  Commission structure always changed, expectations were never consistent, and the agent was very prejudice, and harassed lady employers."
bad,"Friendly atmosphere but not my dream job."
bad,"You better be ready to work like an indentured servant.  Cutting staff, consolidating locations and tripling workload while freezing salary."
bad,"Talking with other co-workers is discouraged. They have just adopted the rank and yank system Jack Welch instilled at GE. If you cannot produce as much as your peers, you may be fired. "
bad,Excelent management but I was required to work long hours for very low compensation and poor benefits.  Good way to get sales experiance.
bad,"Very strict and uncomfortable environment. Have to sit there all day and call leads, and thats it. Very little training and had to spend a lot of money to get licensed."
bad,"Company that says it stresses diversity and customer satisfaction.   Artificially fabricates data to fit satisfy agenda.   Approaching 10 years at company, started with low salary which has tripled, yet still feels underpaid."
bad,Make sure you get along well with your agent. This will make or break you. I’d dare to say it’s the most important component because everything else can be tweaked along the way
bad,"SF in my opinion is morally-bankrupt. SF's focus is on profit. Human capital is expendable.  Working here is not for the weak.  If you enjoy your family or plan on having one, I would not recommend SF for you. There is no work-life balance. Metrics for employees and management are unobtainable without constant overtime which only leads to burnout.  During my last 5 years with SF I never saw so many employees go out on medical leave.  I truly hope SF does an about-face and focuses on their employees."
bad,Call center are the future for state farm and they dont value those that work in this harsh environment. They make it hard to get out once you get in the call center and hard for you to develop your self.
bad,"The company has changed from a work/life balance quality/quantity organization of happy employees to a metric driven fast paced factory production type environment and stressed employees. Now production is simplified to quantity vs. quality with the appearance of quality through ongoing training, but no real application given the production number demands. That is, the employee cannot possibly do the detailed quality work presented in the ongoing training to reach the quantity demanded by the metrics which really only measure quantity not quality. As a result, the employee is forced to sacrifice quality good claim handling for quantity making it an unfulfilling job. What was once a great organization has now evolved into an unsatisfying job where much of claims handling is now metric driven piece-meal type work. As a tenured employee I started when it was a family friendly customer centered company that has now evolved into an expense driven company to compete on price (premium dollars) to maintain market share. But cutting expenses results in increased claims dollars given the poor quality claims handling. I suspect at some point the pendulum will swing more toward middle, but right now the expense driven focus makes for a poor work environment."
bad,"Shortly after getting hired at a 8-4:30 shift, I was not given a choice in switching to a 12:30-9pm shift. They preach work/life balance, but then make it near impossible to actually achieve. Time off is scheduled MONTHS in advance, and even then you have to pray you’re able to get it. The micromanagement of employee time and heavy metrics driven environment add gratuitous amounts of unnecessary stress to the job"
bad,I did not enjoy working at State Farm in my time there. Although I was paid fairly the stressfulness of the job was not worth it. The job is very boring and repetitive.
bad,"State Farm used to care about its employees.  Those days are gone. They stopped doing almost all of the nice things they used to do. Now,  it is all about the numbers.  I have seen them fire people for not meeting metrics that they knew were not reasonable."
bad,State Farm use to be a really great company to work for but now it is corporate ran and there is no work life balance and is very numbers driven and lack of quality customer service.
bad,So many changes and micro managing now make this a terrible place to work.  Hard to get time off and schedules are not consistent. Lots of pressure to meet metrics that are ridiculous and then you have to deal with nasty customers. It just ain't worth it!!!
bad,Unrealistic claim Numbers. First line management has no support. Coworkers are great.  Too much work for the hours allowed. mandatory OT expected when needed. OT restricted to keep up.
bad,"State Farm used to be a wonderful job, a place that few people wanted to leave. Since, a reorganization that consistently shifts around work, a practice of ignoring their employees and always being understaff has opened the flood gates. Their Columbia MO office continually loses extremely talented and qualified workers to other carriers and industries. Their replacements are always untrained and unchecked - bad employees are kept around with no punishment or changes. "
bad,"What made State Farm a  great place to work was, there was always something new going on in the office; no two day were ever the same. Unfortunately I could not survive on the pay."
bad,"You're selling policies that may or may not assist the people purchasing the product, depending on the issue.  Best fit is someone who is good at persuading people with wordplay."
bad,There are no benefits offered with very little pay. Management was extremely nice but rarely there. Co-workers also extremely nice and helpful. Job is also very slow paced!
bad,"With one of the largest IT departments in the country, State farm was a great place to intern.  In the years since my internship, they hired and fired many of my classmates (thank God I didn't stay on), because their skills were irrelevant after a few years instead of retraining them. That did not sit well with me."
bad,New CEO changed culture no longer good place to work. Majority of employees less than 5 years experience. New CEO has forced out all of the experienced tenured employees.
bad,State Farm has lost all culture based on the original company. Everything is now based on numbers. And even if you are the highest producer in an area they will cut you based on the highest salary instead of on your evaluations or your experience.
bad,"Good for those who either "
bad,Most enjoyable was the team members I worked with. The work was sometimes stimulating but often very stressful. The management was more concerned about the numbers/metrics than about the employees.
bad,"If you are willing to relocate for demotions this is the place for you.  There is a difference between working for corporate and working in an agents office.  Working for corporate requires movement to Dallas, Phoenix, or Bloomington, IL if you hope to advance in any way.  Working in an agents office is good."
bad,"the agent that i worked for said that i would be making more money so that's why i took the job with them but then when i started i wasn't even making half of what my checks were regularly "
bad,"Stay away, company has changed so much and the upper management is changing so much that the business seems to be going off the rails.  Used to be a great company but with so many changes its hard to stay focused and feed secure in your job."
bad,Every agent is different so depending on the agent you work for you may have to work or be on call 24/7 in order to get a sell. Older agents aren't like this. Their is a better work/life balance when you work for an agent that has been in business for 20+ years. Be ready to do lots and lots of cold calling because that is the main route to get policies written.
bad,"Decisions made in the past few years seem to keep spiraling out of control. Bad decisions made by executive, little opportunity and growth for the last few years. Reflects in customer service and JD power results."
bad,Statefarm use to care about their employees. There seems to be no loyalty from them. We are just a replaceable number. Lives have actually been ruined. It’s just scary to know one day you could be on ththe chopping block and now you worried about how your going to feed your family. Not a good feeling.
bad,My over looker was very patient and helpful with educating me.She was very insertional and motivated her team members when times were a little difficult.
bad,Not the company that it used to be.  You are now just a number.  Metrics are all that matters.  Customer service is not what it used to be.  Very stressful place to work.
bad,State Farm continues grow as a leader in the insurance field. They are strategically moving operations outside of the Illinois area therefore local employees will need to at alternative employment options.
bad,"Working at the office I am at is awful. The manager and one other employee are messy, always talking about coworkers behind their back. Manager yells instead of teaches, and honestly cold calling is boring."
bad,"Micromanaged, not able to take off when emergencies arose unless it was covered by FMLA. Pay was not enough to live on and lack of significant raise. I do enjoy my coworkers."
bad,"State Farm is great at diversity and inclusion, requiring a respective work environment for everyone. They also do a fairly good job of providing training needed. However, production environment is stressful and advancement is very difficult without extremely competitive advantages. There have been significant job cuts across multiple departments and office closures across the country. Job security is low at the moment."
bad,The most enjoyable part of State Farm is the employees and work culture. You are allowed to be yourself. Knowing you have a peer always willing to help.
bad,"Each SF office is owned by the agent if you work for a cool agent you're enjoy it, however, wrong agent will have you hating your job. Like any sales job there are goals you must reach."
bad,"The Farm...as employees call it was a fun place to work when I first started back in the summer of 2016. We were talked to by long term employees that claimed State Farm was a wonderful place to work and grow with wonderful people that were happy working there. This was good because that was what I was looking for. I was tired of going from job to job and wanted a place where I could grow a career and provide a living for my family at the same time. A few months after we were released from training things changed. We were sent back into training to learn even more material, which was an enormous amount, without a pay raise. Things were changed on us at the drop of a hat and we were often told to just deal with it because this is the way things were done around there. And when we had complaints they mostly fell on deaf ears. All that being said, I learned skills I can take anywhere and the campus was a beautiful place to work. I'm grateful for the experience."
bad,"I did learn a lot about insurance, it seemed to be a great opportunity to learn about the industry. Many aspects such as benefits and support from management were sub-par."
bad,"Company has been on the decline since current CEO has taken over.Closing down operations in multiple places, relocations and layoffs. Work environment is enjoyable, but inconsistencies in work load can be daunting."
bad,"Incoming calls with customers."
bad,"Overall they are a good company to work for because they provide good pay and great benefits, but the job and environment isn't for everyone. The company is large so each employee is just another number and replaceable. Entry level positions are micromanaged heavily and scored off numbers that aren't monitored properly. Therefore, in my time there I saw several people get promoted based off numbers that they cheated and manipulated the system to get. "
bad,"could be a great career but agents can be greedy and only care about themselves with unrealistic goals and expectations with the tools they have provided you. "
bad,"Too many changes, too much stress. Not the same company it used to be. They want more work with less experience and are pushing the experienced employees out the door."
bad,It use to be a great place to work until they started this reorganization of State Farm its been down hill ever since. The workplace is now very stressful the workload has doubled and tripled and extra time is not given to complete this workload.
bad,"The first few years were ok.. but you'll get tired of of being a robot all day. Very conservative company. They care about metrics more than anything. Culture is lacking. Too many managers\supervisors doing the same thing and knowing very little. Heavy stress. This position was a callcenter and NOT a true ""support"" center. People with IT help desk experience should understand what i mean by that."
bad,"This is a great company to work for if you want to get the experience and is seeking career advancement. However, this company does not believe in a work life balance environment. The company, like many in America, is numbers and metrics driven, so the employees develop low morale and a sense of being replaceable by the next person who will work at a cheaper cost. The healthcare benefits are great, however if you use them you are penalized, for taking the day off to go see a doctor. I think the old State Farm was more of a family, however the new State Farm has lost that thought process and great employees along the way."
bad,State Farm as an Enterprise is currently in a state of flux which creates uncertainty in the workplace. Advancement is hard to come by and it seems like it will be this way for the next couple of years.
bad,SF pays their employees well. I have only worked in one SF agency. The agency level that I worked for was not a positive environment and I decided to leave.
bad,"When I started, State Farm was a reasonable place to work.  You can sense my enthusiasm.  A typical day at work includes issuing denials to 3rd party claimants, discussing automobile insurance coverage, and putting out fires (errors made by other employees).  "
bad,"A typical day is busy call after call. Need more training and more employees."
bad,"State Farm is made out of Individual Franchise Agent offices.The particular one I work with. The agent is unprofessional, does not    know how to communicate with her team. She would bring all her personal problems to work. She does not care about people who work for her, always makes up an excuse with pay and never pay's on time. No benefits, low hourly wage and small commission. Promises lots of things but never delivers upon accomplishment. My co-workers are great, very knowledgeable and always willing to help each other.The hardest part of the job is dealing with the Agent. She does not know how her business operates. The Agent relies on others to take corporate blame for her mistakes. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing research and analyzing a person upon he's/her qualifications for insurance. It is as enjoyable as you get treated."
bad,It would be a very good place to work if you have your own family. Pretty stable and you can learn about the insurance knowledge.
bad,"Daily worked job queues, answered phones, prioritize, and investigate claims as needed to help Claim Representative."
bad,I was hired back in December 2012 and was made to believe this would be the place for me. From day one you will be micro-managed on everything and the customer will always be right no matter what. They can call you everything but a child of God and they will still ask what can you have done better. Your calls will be monitored with a fine tooth comb and you must follow the script are you will be dinged. If you need to go to the bathroom you must clock out and in to do so because every minute of your day is accounted for. You will never know your schedule of what your doing cause it changes everyday and through out the day as well so you must constantly check it are you will be out of adherence and that will affect your performance even though your working. If you want to be a micro managed robot this is the job for you. I lasted a yr I think I did good.
bad,"The job itself is very simple and easy, basic customer service. My dislike was the tools given to cust. serv. reps was not adequate enough to provide a genuine service to the customers. Other than payments, ID Cards (sometimes), and transfers to tow services, you can't do much else. Every other sentence ends with directing them back to their agent. Tired of hearing the disappointment from people who pay hard earned money on insurance and can't get a simple answer about their policy if it's outside of their agent's office hours. Good hold over job, but not long term."
bad,"Great company poor owner, these are franchised out and every experience could be different."
bad,"This place was good , i had little bit of issues with management because , in begining, there were 6 of us working in office , slowly everyone started leaving because of the manager was not being equally treating all employees."
bad,"State Farm is normally known for being a great company but with the new changes it is slowly losing its reputation. Managers and team leads micromanage and hound you about adherence.  Not only that, they give you a hard time when you use your sick days. Sad to say but sick days are for being sick. Oh this is perfect for people who like working in a call center."
bad,"I worked as a temporary employee for manpower at the state farm insurance facility in West Lafayette.  During the time I was there I enjoyed working for the people there, and the work itself was not bad at all.  It was during this time though that corporate headquarters made the announcement that they were trying to decide what to do with that particular facility leading to much speculation that it will be closing in the next 5 years."
bad,"This is good place to begin your insurance career, however, you are only exposed to State Farm products. It's best to obtain a position with an Independent agency."
bad,"working at state farm was a solid learning experience I gained a wealth of Knowledge during my training. However the compensation is not commiserate with the experience needed and the level of training required. State Farm has wonderful programs and groups for employees to be involved in, but the compensation leaves something to be desired."
bad,It is an excellent company to begin with no experience. It pays less than the other companies and is extremely micromanaged. This position is a pressure filled position that has a high turnover. It is essentially a call Center position fielding calls from customers and agents.
bad,"Work at an agents office with no benefits and low pay and still deal with the mess that is corporate State Farm. Service is horrible,  often 1 hour hold times to speak with someone who has no authority to fix a problem"
bad,"Good product but priced too high in the auto insurance market, many companies are cheaper but not as good.  Most consumers are only shopping price for insurance so you have to sell value.  Wages are too low for the knowledge and experience required."
bad,"If you are a lower level associate, such as customer care center, sales or initial loss reporting, you will be working in a high turn-over job in a somewhat toxic environment. Chances are you may or not stay for more than a year at most. Those who are Professional/Technical Associates, will face constant changes and an overwhelming focus upon metrics for practically everything. Added to this problem is the slow, subtle and obvious downsizing of the company due to their new embracement of technology via ""A.I."" Many people have lost their jobs, with more to follow in the years coming. A word of warning to those who are seeking the Professional/Technical level jobs, you will eventually be faced with the prospect of being re-skilled, re-trained or having to be forced out. You will also be asked to do more and more, and see nothing in terms of compensation or recognition because expectations constantly change. Newer people with the company can't receive proper training and in some cases simply don't at all. The turnover rate is so bad in some areas, that they cannot keep up. Retirement is just not an option unless you've already been at this company for 20+ years. The bottom line, this company might be o-k to work for short term - but only if you are really determined."
bad,"This used to be a great company to work for. Changes in process and CEO have changed that. There is no work life balance. The benefits are good, and pay is decent."
bad,"Started out as the best career to date in life.  Rapid decline in past 2 years after CEO change. Never worked with so many unprofessional people in my life.  Micromanagement has become the new norm and work life balance is no longer a priority."
bad,"SF used to be a great place to work, now it has become all about metrics and the customer focus has slipped away. Work life balance is a joke and unless you are willing to live in a location with a large hub don't expect to have a job much longer. SF has already announced the closer of 11 operations centers starting this year."
bad,"the agency where i worked paid low wages, and there were no benefits.  The agent was not helpful with training, I was just thrown into the job to just figure it out"
bad,"Overall the staff was great.  But the market in insurance is flooded with 1000 other agents in a small demographic area.  They say you are making warm sales calls but you are actually cold calling many of the customers.  Also, as a team member you got one time commission and no residuals off your sales.  All the residuals went to the Agent owner."
bad,"Inadequate claims training...More less a Customer Service Call Center instead of claims. Stress..Stress..Stress. Constant worry of not hitting the ridiculous metrics..Lack of help support on the floor....EXCESSIVE MICROMANAGING....Left decent wages, great PTO and benefits due to unbearable atmosphere."
bad,Poor business operations at a corporate level.   Customer experience with the office is superior.  However once they interact with claims and clerical teams they usually leave the company due to inferior experiences.
bad,All they care about is numbers. Over worked. And they expect you to move the sun and the moon and it better be moved on time. They expect the impossible out of you. Which makes the environment very stressful.
bad,Customers are constantly upset about rates going up and everyone else in the industry is cheaper so it's hard to compete. Even if you crush it on your sales calls you walk away with peanuts for commission and a very low base pay. Great for entry-level recent grads.
bad,"State Farm is individually owned by great people, however the individual businesses do not have enough employees to keep up with the pace of the customers."
bad,"There was a lack of support on the floor for new hire agents once we graduated from training.. "
bad,"Great people to work with, poor work/life balance and micromanged by corporate big wigs."
bad,"There are 465 minutes in your workday and every one of them are monitored.  The training was excellent.  I did love learning the auto policies for the 14 states I worked.  The Team Managers I worked with did not take escalated calls.  One of the managers was an expert at making people feel really ignorant for asking for help.  "
bad,"I spent most of my day solving other employee's problems with callers that they did not handle properly.  Most people kicked the can, hoping to get off the phone so they did not have to listen to people who were upset.  Most of the people that called in, were not handled in the best way possible.  It was a volume based job where you need to get as much done as possible without really helping people.  The claim and call volume was insane with never enough workers to handle the claims properly.  I learned that customer service was possible but normally sacrificed.  I made good money and the pay was excellent.  The managers were good.  When you did your work well, I made friends with the managers, but poor people rarely were punished.  I received their problem claims when they would do their work.  An unfair work environment where everyone is treated as a number."
bad,A day to day job. Things have changed alot in the past 10 years and the company is focused on metrics and numbers more so customers. Its an ok job if you are just starting out.
bad,State Farm has changed a lot since I started working for them 3 or 4 years ago. There as been a shift from employee/customer focus to metric driven. Claims just isn't an environment for someone who wants any kind of freedom.
bad,"The company has changed its internal processes, which has caused us to lose a lot of longterm faithful customers.  These changes have caused tremendous delays, and frustration when handling claims."
bad,"That is, you're treated like a herd of cows and they don't base individual performance or circumstances on an individual basis. You could have perfect attendance and get customer compliments all day but in the end, they'll find a way to fire you if they over-staffed a department, regardless of merits of your case. It's a point system with no room for human error. Long story. Take my word for it. LOVED the job until they stabbed me in the back. It's all about the bottom line. Money in their pocket."
bad,SF used to be fun and productive place to work.  As the new CEO came in it became a very stressful place where u didn't know if u had a job the next week.  Forcing people with 30 + years to retire.   I enjoyed my job but managers made u feel u were never good enough. Always comparing you to workers in other locations. I did everything I could and everything they recommended and it wasn't good enough to save my job.  I personally had to go on three medications just to get through the day.  Things switched all the time so u never got a chance to be good at anything before it changed again.  Then they changed again because the new way didn't work.  Managers critiqued you on jobs that they new nothing about.  The friendships I made at SF were the best part of my job.
bad,"Worked there for three years and every time i was in line for a promotion someone who was more favored by that particular manager got the job whether they were experienced or not. Management was grossly overpaid for their complete lack of knowledge on what their team members actually did. Most managers would leave early on fridays and leave employees without anyone to turn to for help with complex customer questions. When the company began making changes certain managers picked on certain employees, writing them up and creating separate rules for that employee while allowing others to do as they pleased and sometimes they were public about it. It was like high school culture there and I would not recommend it for anyone looking for a rewarding career."
bad,"I loved working for state farm, however, the people that owned this one were off on cloud nine. They were more concerned about where they were going to take their next vacation than being concerned about their employees"
bad,working in state farm from the morning makes me feel so comfortable i learned to fox in each detail that i have in my computer and dealing with customers every day was the most important thing to me because i like it to be nice with people
bad,"A typical day at work in the payment plan consists of you basically being chained to your desk answering countless phone calls. Management usually micro-manages and when it is time for a raise, they all sit in a meeting and discuss you. Your performance is only a fraction of your performance review. If you have had disagreements with other supervisors, this is their opportunity to use that which will affect your raise. The environment is very professional and they are generous with paid time off/sick time/personal time."
bad,"Used to be the employee was the first priority, not any more. They are now last. Have fun working 1230-9 pm. and not be able to get off for personal time. Its all about numbers and not quality."
bad,"I learned that big corporations care more about their logo then their employees.  Not a good experience at all. The management team did  not show a great deal of are for their direct employees.  The consistency was not there and dealing with customer, claims personnel should tell everyone the same thing."
bad,It was a good learning environment. I learned how insurance agents cold call
bad,"Just getting my feet wet, state farm was a good place to start. I interacted with people of different aspects and learned how to deal with their differences and needs.usually walked in around 8 and immediately started working. My co-workers were always there if I ever needed assistance.What was often times difficult to deal with was when there was a non English speaking client and I could not provide them with service."
bad,This would be a great position for someone who has a large social network and is not afraid to be on 100% commission.
bad,NON OPTIONAL OVERTIME... NO VACATION TIME YOU WANT.... JERK STORE LOCATED UNDER BUILDING 1 @ Marina Heights. Set up to fail with metrics in Complex. No customer focus by having no stewardship. They hire idiots in Fredrick and Dallas
bad,"Firewall underwriting can be tedious work but I always enjoyed being meticulous at work. State farm was a great company to work for, or start working for 20 years ago. The company didn't even own the building at the location in Columbia, MO.  I think that speaks volume. If I lived in Texas it would be great and I could look for advancement, unfortunately at theocation I was in."
bad,"State Farm was a very pleasant place to work when first starting. They were very professional and made everyone feel welcomed. Training was a good experience as well, and they properly had us prepared. However as time went on, State Farm was understaffed and the call volume got higher and higher, making the work very stressful. Management didn't seem very helpful."
bad,they really push their people to succeed. they care about their people and good with the community. i am just putting words on here because it will not let me
bad,"MUST be a self motivator & willing to learn on your own"
bad,If you are looking for a fast paced environment then this is the company for you! Be ready to set and meet your monthly goals and be able to multi-task at all times!
bad,"Terminated for not paying attention, was told it was misconduct, disappointed but life goes on. I indicated that I completed a task but it was not completed, distracted by other task and forgot task at hand."
bad,"I worked for State Farm for 33 years.  I enjoyed the first 30 or so.  However, changes in the work structure and work rules became intolerable so I took early retirement.  The philosophy used to be ""make the employees happy and they will serve the customer well"" to ""the customer is more important than the employee.""  They now manage by numbers and metrics instead of determining the quality of service being provided.  I would not recommend to anyone that they work at State Farm."
bad,"Worked at State Farm for over 7 years. Since new leadership the company cut raises, bonuses, and became micromanagers. Anytime a minute late you would receive a point. There was a point system set up."
bad,This is a corporation in which they are not interested in their employees or training their employees.  Managers are not helpful and only looking out for their career.
bad,"The company was more worried about how much time, you spent on the phone versus how effectively you were able to assist a customer. Very big downfall. State Farm has closed so many offices and left so many employees without work, very sad changes the company has gone through."
bad,I was independent contractor for State Farm and I was not happy accepting contracts to work for them. I have not contracted with them in 10 years. I would not contract with the claims division again.
bad,"Very stressful environment, getting yelled at instead of taught what to do. They need an organized training plan of the computer system, how underwriing works, and how state farm works instead of expecting you to figure it out on your own"
bad,"What State Farm did was they built these huge hubs in Atlanta, Dallas, and Phoenix. What they did they told us that they were closing the regional offices and relocated everything to the hubs. They alienated a good portion of the workforce when they made this grand decision, because a lot of people were not able to move to these hubs."
bad,Not professional and the pay is low for the industry.There is no professionalism and no care for the employee.Possibly a good place for those who are new to the workforce.
bad,"Work environment was extremely micromanaged. Back to back phone calls, of course its a call center, but heaven forbid they see you taking a breather. Very hard to move up due to so much competition. Pay was good but not worth being treated like a child."
bad,I wanted to work with Seniors turning 65 with regards to the Supplement policies sitting at their kitchen tables since both my parents and inlaws where reaching that age to help be that expert.
bad,This was my first job learning about Quicken and being responsible for reports. I learned how to do bank loans and accident claims. Learning how to communicate and making sure all documents were in possession taught me a lot that transferred into my personal life.
bad,"prices for all insurance products were very expensive, making it difficult to compete with other insurance companies for sales and business, so commissions were low, at least in the region i was working. The company may be more competitive elsewhere"
bad,They are understaffed and have turned a claims handling unit into a multitasking call center.  It is impossible to handle the assigned work volume without working overtime and they expect you to work your inventory for the time you take off for vacation before you leave.  Which means you have to work two to three weeks work within a week in order to take time off.
bad,Customer focus has been lost and employees are not treated well. One need only review the financial data on the company to understand that all is not well with this company.
bad,"This place used to be wonderful.  It was such a family atmosphere 20 years ago.  Unfortunately, in order to be competitive, The Farm has made business decisions that affect the employee moral and the customer's ability to get claims resolved quickly.  Moving work to the hubs sounds logical, but the stress of the call center environment proves to be too stressful on associates and the turnover is heavy because the phone lines never stop.  There is a point system - beware if you get caught in traffic (Atlanta, Dallas and Phoenix traffic is inherently busy) too many times - you will be terminated. Or, you may want a week off, but they may give you Tuesday - Thursday and you have to get your supervisor to override it.  Too many bathroom breaks (when not taken on your assigned break) could me they want you to get a doctor's note identifying a medical need to do so. Also, the training is so segmented that many associates don't know what to do if something doesn't fit in the little ""box"". And team managers are less versed in many situations to know how to properly handle those situations as well.  I never see a smile on anyone's face - there is no work-life balance and there are some segments that have been on mandatory OT for years (oh, they call it  ""NOON"" - e.g., non-optional OT). Training for new field claim handlers is done on a virtual/web basis with only two weeks of ""field"" ride alongs for new field claim handlers, which is inadequate for residential claim handling knowledge.  File expectations, while understandably are stringent, create a bog of documentation that cripples"
bad,"Do you like flying by the seat of your pants and being told that no one really knows what the plan is? Do you like being paid the same as another department but being expected to do twice the amount of work they do AND having to do their work on top of your own? Do you like being yelled at by people over the phone? Do you enjoy the idea of no one having a set plan for what anyone is supposed to be doing? Do you like devoting 2 years of your life to a job and being told over and over that your job isn't going anywhere, then suddenly being told that your office is shutting down in less than 7 months and then not being offered any kind of real compensation? Then State Farm is the company for you."
bad,Job does not provide security. They have unrealistic expectations. No growth unless you want to become an agent which will take all of your money and they will not guarantee it will work out (they can revoke your contract after a year and you will lose all of your money you invested and STILL owe them)
bad,i really don't feel like writhing this but it was a decemt company to work for but i no longer wanted to sit at a desk all day long and call people when they are rude and don't want to be bothered
bad,"Claims is very stressful not matter what co your with. But workload is the deal breaker, and you will get a lot here. Problem is, this is bad for the customer and the employee. When the co starts picking apart your performance with non-nonsensical performance metrics its creates a depressing environment especially for a top-performing  associate like myself (so I'd like to think). My suggestion is stay away from claims unless you are facing starvation. Very dead-end and stressful. IMO, try to get a position that is not customer-facing and you will be much happier overall."
bad,Company recruited with misinformation about the metrics driven environment and company business closure.  During training you are told its a feedback rich environment but the metrics are not really discussed
bad,The work itself is not difficult.  The leadership is changing.  You are not likely to have the same manager for more than 12 months.  There is no remote work policy
bad,"Understaffed and negative work environment.  Solution is working overtime.  Little training, claims from all 50 states with different requirements for each state and unmanageable work goals."
bad,they put the responsibility totally on you. they pay for little and lead you to believe a storefront is necessary to sell insurance in 2017. expensive upfront cost.
bad,"The typical workday is very relaxed because most projects, tasks, and implementations take days, weeks, and sometimes years. You'll spend more time trying to get a hundred people to agree on the phrasing of a piece of documentation than you ever will coding, testing, or learning. If you're looking for a place of steady employment with no long-term change, this is the place to go. If you're looking for more active engagement, go elsewhere."
bad,People called in when they were in trouble. Stressful situations like car accidents and flooding houses. I assume it's like a dentist office--no one wants to be there but they have to go.
bad,"I worked for an agent so I was not a corporate employee. I was hired, however, by recruiters that told me I was training to take over the agency as the owner was retiring. That was not the case at all. I was then the agent's employee for two years with no path for advancement."
bad,This job was too focused on cold calls and sales for my liking.  Overall not a good fit and not interested in making a career choice in this field.  Overall a good insurance provider though.
bad,"•	Helped maintain and grow Michael’s current book of business into the number one State Farm book in the county."
bad,"Don't waste your time trying to work here, you will be making a mistake, drains you of your soul and micro manages you to the point where you don't ever want to go back"
bad,State Farm was a great company to work for and I enjoyed my time spent with the organization. There are a lot of different departments and opportunity for growth.
bad,"Working in a call center is a cattle like environment. You are asked to sit in a cubicle and answer call after call, regurgitate information, as quickly as possible, discourage questions and move on to the next. It is stressful andunpleasant because you are also judged on how ""remarkable"" the service you can provide in 5 minutes is. It is counter-intuitive."
bad,"The workload is reasonable, but job responsibilities change often with no additional compensation."
bad,"I came in to State Farm in hopes of becoming an Agent, but realized that there are many things about being a small business owner I don't love."
bad,"This was just a temporary assignment for about 6 months, and since State Farm is geared more towards Personal Lines insurance, it was a change for me, as I am a Commercial Lines person; but it was great experience."
bad,"You are required to be great at multi-tasking, assisting customers with their shopping needs, fix and maintain store displays, as well as cleaning."
bad,"Go into work according to the schedule that WFM provides. Answer at least 5 calls a day, handling several new claims out of your personal queu and jumping in and assisting others once you are within time service levels. If you have a cool manager GREAT if not, GOOD LUCK. They like to play favoritism.. a lot. Sucking up will get you everywhere, not sucking up will get you no where."
bad,A typical day at work is a mixture of confusion and frustration.  I gained insurance knowledge that I was otherwise naive to.  This position helped me to understand my own insurance policy better and prompted me to actually pay attention to the package of documents I sign when purchasing auto insurance.  Management is more of a micro-management environment and some managers unfortunately are unaware of how to perform the duties of an U.S.A and therefore could offer minimal assistance in easing frustrations through training.  The hardest part of my day was feeling less than confident with processing procedures because I understand how any errors could affect the client and quality work is important to me.  My co-workers shared my frustrations.
bad,Agents delegated part of their job duties and responsibilities to the receptionist.
bad,they let me go due to a misunderstanding. I advise no one works for State Farm.
bad,Could be better but I don't want to say too much as I am currently employed here.
bad,"Call Center Employee - Answering All Underwriting calls solving problems and advising eligibility.  "
bad,"Inflexible, poor communication. Not worth the time for the pay."
bad,"When I first came to work here I was elated with my position. Things were fantastic and I felt as though I had finally stepped into a lasting career. After all the dead-end streets and empty ""temp-to-perm"" promises from staffing agencies, the last thing I want is another turn-over. However, after the first of the year and due to agency quotas not being met, I was moved from Marketing to Sales. "
bad,"What I learn the most from my experience at this particular office was loyalty means nothing and always expect the worse. There were four employees there when I started and all four have been fired. My co-workers were awesome, hard workers and did their job to the max. We started our day at 8:30 A.M. and worked until 5 or until all of our customers were taken care of. I did my daily follow ups on new leads and also on old leads that I haven't closed the policy on. I service my customers new or old and basically made sure everything was running smoothly."
bad,It was a boring office job.  People were all older and set in their ways...
bad,Liked most of the people I worked with.  Normal hours.  Average management.
bad,"Most of the time there was alot of filing to do and there were moments where there was down time that the other agents bonded and got to know more about one another. It's a great enviornment to work in, very friendly people to work around and the customers were friendly as well."
bad,"Great Company. Co-workers were awesome. Not a fan of living off of commission, but besides that great overall."
bad,"As reorganization has taken place, the human factor has been taken out. Company is shifting focus to other locations in the United States and I am choosing not to relocate."
bad,Great company to learn how to sell additional products to customers
bad,It was a learning experience for someone that was interning. Was able to see if I wanted to stay in insurance.
bad,"Selling insurance and servicing customers as an agent is entirely stressful and time-consuming. You must always be on the phone and trying to sell ti anyone you can come into contact with. The pressure is high and the workload is heavy. It is not recommended for beginners to the workforce. For those who can handle it, it is an extremely lucrative business with many methods of payment directly impacted with the number of sales you earn."
bad,It is a good company to work for if all you want to do is handle customer calls all day for low pay. Advancement with this company is nonexistent unless you know someone or have a family member in higher management.
bad,"They hire in big groups and slowly get rid of everyone once you get any sort of small raise so that they can hire new people for less. I would only recommend this to someone who is maybe in college. However, beware that the management is NOT good, they are all very young and untrained."
bad,"Good company to work for. No room for growth and advancement. Typical day consist of support the assigned attorney and communicating with the court and policy holders,"
bad,"I have worked at State Farm for two years. In that time, I have worked more weeks with mandatory overtime than not. While the benefits and time off are generous, the lack of work-life balance takes too much of a toll to recommend the job."
bad,"Job would easily be less stressful if there wasn’t an avarage call time everyone had to adhere to. This isn’t a sells job it’s a claims job and a majority of the people calling have just gotten into accidents and it’s beyond rude and inconsiderate to try to rush them, also a waste of time because for most rushing them doesn’t do/help anything. Benefits are so-so and they willingly admit that they arent concerned with their employees happiness only their customers."
bad,"State Farm may possibly be a good company to work for, but not in claims. There is no work/life balance, the pay is not a livable wage, training is mediocre at best."
bad,"i have always heard great things about working with state farm, but I had a terrible experience working for the office on windy hill rd, in Atlanta. The manager was disrespectful and often manipulated pay structure."
bad,"It's unfortunate that this company has lost plenty of workers who dedicated 15 years plus to their organization just to lose them to other companies due to heavy work loads and too many unnecessary changes."
bad,"My typical work day would include but not limited to policy servicing, sales and notary.I act as a part office manager and team lead giving direction to fellow co-workers and mentoring. I learned how to piovt or cross sale additional products and servicesto clients. My co-worker are friendly and helpful. The most enjoyable and the greatest part of my job is helping the client understand the benefits of coverage and how to protect there legacy, dream and risk. the hardest part is when some cleitns can't see the vision."
bad,"Management has become completely out of touch,  employees work in different time zones and at odd hours."
bad,"Job success and overall daily experience at State Farm has a direct correlation to whatever manager one ends up with and/or ""team"" you end up on. I drew the short end of the stick in both case's. My manager was completely inept of empathy and was on my case constantly. I was in an accident that gave me a severe concussion (obviously this affected my ""numbers""). I told her that my brain wasn't functioning properly and my doctor said that I should take more time off. She said ""there is nothing I can do to stop you from taking more time, but if you go, you'll be letting everyone down. I won't forget that."" I eventually broke down at work and had a panic attack. "
bad,I learned alot and was able to get state licensed. This job was very interesting but stressful.
bad,"Overall cool place. Great opportunities to move up in the company. Some departments have flexible schedules. Compensation Is just horrible and PTO system could be 1,000 times better."
bad,"Working at State Farm Insurance for me was great until all the changes and office closures. All the managers I worked with was great, but work life balance honestly was difficult. If you have children or other responsibilities like school, hours can change at a drop of a dime. I've been here for 15 years and I don't feel like I make enough money for what I am worth. But....Severence and Employment vendor they are bring on to help us when the office closes is very generous. I am lucky in that I work in flex unit. The new offices are strictly watched and micromanaged to where you feel uncomfortable."
bad,"State Farm was a very nice place to work, and the people were awesome, however as a Customer Care Specialist (licensed agent at the corporate office) you are substantially underpaid compared to what you could make as an insurance agent in an office, yet you are expected to have the same knowledge and education.  Additionally, the expectations of the position are unrealistic based on the hours you work (6:30 am to 10:30 am or 4:30 pm to 12 am) and the amount of calls your receive from people wanting to purchase a policy during those times.  I do think it is a good option for people right out of school with no work experience, or people that are still in school and need a part-time position with full benefits.  The schedule are somewhat flexible, and you can try to release your scheduled shifts (although if no one picks them up, you are still required to work or call in sick, and you only get one sick day every 6 months).  If you wanted to make a career out of this position, with the small merit increases you get, it would take you 20-30 years to get to a salary you could actually live comfortably on."
bad,I love working learn new thing and have many work to due always staying  busy people are very friendly out going good learning skills
bad,"I learned more about insurance, but the business was slow. I never got my binding agreement so I moved on with my insurance career."
bad,Great place to get your feet wet. Good management with flexible hours. Pros and cons vary. Issues with new system. Would recommend for college grads
bad,Micro-managed. High school culture. Work overload. No room for advancement. Unbelievable situations.
bad,Poor pay and frequent changes to system that do not work.  A lot of realignments that do not work with the companies overall goal.
good,"I don't have an opinion. I work contract, I do not work with State Farm management. I work with a vendor, that provides help and training. Really have."
good,"Negative experience with culture from day one"
good,Commission structure is a joke after you sign a document the agent believes she can make changes every month to affect your commission. They do sale great products to consumers but the agents are greed and out of touch with reality. Would not recommend this job.
good,It is just another Insurance company. Trying to save money but taking wrong steps. Agile implemented but still a top down approach. Few bad managers are making the decisions harder.
good,"This is a great company but each agentcy is different and each agent is different.  For the position that does service and sales you are still required the numbers as if you were a full time sales person.  Also, it is very micro managed and old school.  Workplace culture is business.  No business casual at all just Business and push to be the top agency.  The most enjoyable part is the customers."
good,"Not the most conductive place to work. No organization, no answers to a direct question and some of the co-workers make it impossible to do your job around their personal lives."
good,Assignments were clear at all times. Diversity is key to marketing.
good,My time working for State Farm call center was not ideal. I did not receive steady hours and this was therefore affecting my pay and the scheduling was very random.
good,"Great company but bad agent I worked for. No work life balance, no room to advance unless you want to be an agent. Hard work and not enough pay! Agent was demanding, controlling and manipulative. No benefits for families"
good,"Trainers were not prepared, therefore provided a non effective experience. "
good,It's not any longer. There's a lot inconsistencies in how employees are treated in the Hubs versus the Operation Centers. Pay is not comparable to what other in the field are making for doing the same job. There's a lot of talk about work-life balance but very little action on part of management accepting it.
good,"I was very excited to be working with State Farm, I thought it was a great opportunity, until I realized that you work with independent agents, and you work for the agent not the company. There are times that you get to work with an agent that is a wonderful manager that you can learn from, sometimes you don't, and it can get very stressful because sales go down. There is also no opportunity for advancement unless you open you own office; that can be difficult, because event though you give out excellent customer service to all the policyholders, you cannot take your own business portfolio you have worked so hard to produce; because it belongs to the agent."
good,If you are an extrovert this job is for you. A lot of cold calling with only high commission opportunities if you sale life products. When starting a State FArm make sure to research the turnover of that agency. Management is important.
good,A typical day starts way before the office opens. Since there was no cleaning lady I was tasked with cleaning the office and bathroom. I often had to fix mistakes made by other agents. I was treated not as an equal and was looked down up even though I was also a licensed agent. No room to get any commissions as I was to busy answer phones and cleaning up.
good,"No benefits, 8-5:30 every night, expected to stay late and work weekends and events. $12/hr. 8% commission. Constant pressure to sell, while forced to spend much of the day doing service work and answering incoming calls."
good,"State farm is an amazing company with great values, that's not the issue. Choose your agent wisely!  I worked for an agent with preached one thing and practiced another. With such a small office his negativity attacked us all! It sucked the kife right out of us all! That's why he is in team 3 in 3 years and continues to lose customers!  He is closed minded and doesn't take anyone's ideas much further than his ears!"
good,"Less work & life balance"
good,It would be nice if there was more flexibility on time off and family life.  Plus management seems to be trained not to care.   They are only there to advise when situations merit it.
good,When I first began working at StateFarm the culture was okay . I was in the first auto pilot class in Atlanta for Auto-ILR. We were given false hope on fast career advancement. Statefarm is no longer a place that you would want to depend on for a career. Employees are getting fired left and right  for erroneous  accusations. In the past few months numerous members in management have quit on the spot due to unethical practices. Almost every manager micro manages the employees until they either quit on go on FMLA for stress and anxiety. I wouldn't recommend Statefarm as an employer.
good,This company is a mess. NOTHING is organized in a manner were things are done effectively. The agent staff don't know how to run their agencies efficiently.
good,Changed my perspective of insurance companies because of the respect agent had for his clients and also the amount of effort he made towards each client to go above and beyond most other agents in area.
good,Needs Improvement . Stressful. No advancement. Constantly changes without notification to employees. Interested in changing fields as it sucks the joy out of life
good,"While working for them it was repetitious, no a lot of business, no room for advancement nor were there any benefits with the job. I liked my coworkers and manager. The hours were good."
good,not all agents are educated enough to handle their personal obligations and keep those separated from managing their professional daily duties
good,This job was a learning experience that was very helpful in my growing career search.  I learned that the insurance field wasn't for me but I also learned that I loved the office environment with co-workers and clients.
good,I do Not have anything negative to say about State Farm Auto Insurance Company.  They trained me extremely well and opened a plethora of other doors outside of their company for me.  I am Thankful. .
good,"Over all it was a learning experience, unfortunately I was not right for the job they wanted of me. I wouldn’t work there again. It was stressful and some coworkers were conniving."
good,"Agents pay low wages for licensed employees, even with lots of experience. No raises since commission is available. Sometimes the commission is $5 and sometimes $10. Very poor incentive.  There are no benefits given. No health, life, retirement."
good,"At first I thought this opportunity was going to be great. I was a community college student who was just looking for a chance to gain some experience in the Marketing field. When I got hired as an intern for the local State Farm agency I was really excited and it was great until I started to notice some of the agents sketchy practices. Long story short, great learning opportunity and I wouldn't go back if I got paid a 6 figure salary"
good,"Fast paced, small office. Casual work culture with no room for advancement and stagnant pay. Flexible work hours and days. Lovely well established clientele."
good,job truly depends on agent office and how well it is organized and prepares its employees for success. Typical day is making 50-100 outbounds to project leads. Hardest part is SF rates aren't really competitive with the market.
good,"Overall I really liked working for State Farm. The company brings a lot of value to the table for customers to benefit from. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that agents can run their agency however they like, so if they want to pay minimum wage and hold some outrageous requirement for commissions, they can do so. For example, in my situation I had to sell 30 policies a month in order to make commissions on MY SALES. That's robbery imo and I think State Farm as a whole should watch for things like that."
good,"This company is great to get you the experience you need to get into insurance, but besides that, prepare to not see your family. You are just a number to this company."
good,Working for the specific agency i was working for in state farm was really uncomfortable. They were all very unfair towards me and it felt like there was some sort of favoritism in the office. i was always excluded from conversations (my opinion didn't matter most times). They were definitely not understanding or fair when it came to health problems.
good,Be prepared to spend your entire day staring at a computer screen. It is a good job for a non-active person. The benefits are good but the monotony and repetition gets to you after a while.
good,"State Farm is a great place to start a career..  although to get anywhere make sure you get to know your agent prior to accepting a position in an office.  Ask questions, lots of questions and you can make this one of the best choices of a lifetime."
good,"They are absolutely nothing about work life balance."
good,"Na. Goggle info for review. Atmosphere changes in Atlanta, unprofessional management and team leads. Atmosphere is very unstable and retaliation runs rampant."
good,- High stress
good,staff often mentioned they were unhappy. owner hard to please and gave wavering instruction                                                          .
good,"initial loss reporting for all customers, filing claims for both auto and home owners, micromanaged, metrics driven company, coworkers make it tolerable, little to no incentive"
good,"Good company for someone just entering the business world. Benefits are just adequate, pay leaves a lot to be desired.  Great work environment but difficult to move up."
good,Choose your agent carefully!   Some agents are terrific to work for and others have huge turnover within their team.  The team I was part of had new staff every couple months...
good,"Tenure with this company is no longer the focus, it's how much you can get done without really doing anything to move a claim forward. There is a scheduler that sits in an off site location watching how long you are in wrap state of call and then an email comes reminding you to get back into the phones."
good,Very demanding job that has very small up side to it. Compensation is rewarding but very hard to earn.  Job is always changing but never in your favor
good,"State Farm corporate is well organized and supportive to their employees. Working in an agent's office can be touch and go. "
good,"Great entry level position, call center will give phone and professional email experience. Good to learn about advertising and how the newspaper works."
good,A day at State Farm consist of taking about 20 incoming calls setting up claims for automobile accidents.  Making sure the customer is ok and that they are treated very nice and in a timely manor.  The hardest part of my day is when there are no calls are coming in.  The most enjoyable part of my day is when I can make a customer smile threw everything that they have been through.
good,"With current changes, work/life balance is unimportant to the company and it's management team so morale has dropped significantly."
good,"Taking incoming phone calls and issuing quotes for auto, trucks, trailers and commercial accounts"
good,Management was rude and they couldnt keep one customer service rep for a long period of time. Boss was very arrogant.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people with their insurance needs. Whether it be autos, their homes, retirement plans, very rewarding. The most difficult part was trying to make irate customers happy. Issues beyond my control as of rate increases and cancellations for driving records."
good,"The job itself was stressful. My old agent would change processes everyday, and expect more, then more, then more out of three 20 year old girls already on OT, and not getting paid because we were on salary. But we weren’t. Here’s a word to the wise, if your ever meet an agent who pays you “commission in advance” and you have a gap that you have to fill so you can get your paycheck “salary” but docs your “salary pay” if you don’t, RUN. I mean RUN"
good,"With the agents being employed by State Farm and their employees, or team members, being employed solely by the agent, this allows room for agents to abuse their power as an employer, and makes getting Corporate involved in any unethical behavior nearly impossible. Corporate State Farm will always side with the Agent, even if they have been consistently tyrannical, and verbally abusive to their employees with physical proof. They do not care about the team members, in the slightest."
good,"theres no money, no movement, and no support. good luck trying to sell when the rates are ridiculous and im trying to convince people to buy the same insurance at a higher price. get real"
good,"I did enjoy my experience working for both State Farm agents.  I was able to learn variety of skills including computer software programs, claims experience and problem solving skills.  I also was able to enhance my customer service skills and made valuable relationships along the way."
good,"I use to ooze pride working for State Farm however over the last 5+ years the environment has changed dramatically.  The caliber of employees are subpar, upper leadership says one thing and does another, consistent change that does not match the pulse of customers, more work with less pay and career advancement has stalled."
good,Not a great place to work. Remote town. No professional networking. That is the only big corporate. Wish it could have been better. But it is pretty big office.
good,Was not a great place to be. Lots of micromanagers and unprofessionalism.Morale was low in the office. Workload was too high for the compensation given.
good,During my time with the company I noticed how much drama can occur & how vindictive people can be. This is mainly the issue that stems from competition that should not even exist between coworkers.
good,State Farm was a great place to work.  Work life balance was encouraged once upon a time.  The culture changed to work only.  You can earn time off but it was difficult to take time off as I believe we were understaffed so it was difficult for the company to let employees off.
good,tried to get management to help me and the other 4 staff that were rooked out of their pay PLUS was told to leave the AFO and management  out of it because we were told that we DID NOT work for State Farm and if we bugged them any more that they (State Farm management) would get their legal team after US!  and I worked for them for close to 50 Yrs!
good,"Office and staff was very nice.  Pay was ok...Agent was arrogant...micro managmened every one. The worse I've ever seen. Intimated by men and inhumane. Not a good person. Needs basic training on how to treat others."
good,"I guess it all depends on who the agent is, as they are all ran by different individuals. I just so happened to land in two poorly ran offices."
good,"For one, I found out I don’t like working in sales from working at State Farm. Whether it was just that environment specific to that agency, or if I’m just not cut out for sales, I don’t know, but I hated my time there. You only get paid on the 5th and 20th of the month, which that alone wasn’t the kicker, but the pay is low because you’re expected to sell stuff in order to receive commissions and make up for the pay difference. You don’t always get sales though!! Not when there’s 20 different State Farm’s in a 20 mile radius, you’re competing your butt off to try to hit your sales quota. My agent that I worked for was horrible. She was well off from being the actual agent, plus her husband was so loaded that she’d never have to work and still be rich, but it made her snooty, rude, intrusive, and expected way too much out of us team members. I was there 6 months and I think she went through 10 different employees. Either she expected too much of them and they quit, they weren’t living up to her expectations and she let them go, or after experiencing the office for their first day, they never showed back up for a 2nd day!! I may be bias since I did work for someone like her, and maybe other agents aren’t that bad. Although I did interview with a couple other agents when I was looking for a job last year, over a year since I left her office, and the ones I interviewed with nearly had the same expectations of their team member as she did, if not more. So I’m just not cut out for that type of career, and I’ve run from it and I don’t ever plan to look back."
good,"Initially you will feel like you have found a possible career path, however due to the lack of adequate management and the overall feel of some of the departments you may change your mind. My department is one of the worst in the enterprise, due to the management structure applied. Production goals are set way too high to account for the importance of the information being handled leading to errors among the department however management continues to encourage quantity over quality leading to continued errors on the behalf of customers. Associates are not required to adhere to dress code therefore the professionalism aspect is very challenging."
good,"The job itself has potential, but my agent was not so welcoming to advancement or change. He was an older agent and not ready to see new ideas come forward. I was offered no benefits while working there and ended up leaving because of that."
good,In my experience management lacked the ability to train and agency owners whom were rarely seen expected the few to do the job of many so that they can travel on company excursion's.
good,"Take a minute to review State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company."
good,"It is not terrible, not great either--somewhere in the middle.  Good company to gain experience and then move on. Outdated business model when compared to other insurance companies."
good,"I would recommend this for anyone who has the fortitude in heavy sales. People who love challenges 24/7 would adapt soundly with State Farm Insurance. The hardest part of the job, to me, was having to intrude in peoples' lives and businesses. You basically have to 'chase' people and indirectly beg for their business. Again, this might be for people who like to struggle and face constant adversity. Unfortunately, I am not that type of person."
good,"SF is going through massive changes. It is not the same company . They use to value employees, now its all about every dollar they can save. They are penny wise and pound foolish, cutting experienced people that will save immediate dollars but lose millions on the back end through poor services provided to customers."
good,"Working for State Farm offices are always a gamble on which agent you are going to be under. Try to find someone with experience, a drive to sell, and someone with training already in place. This job does not come with a manual."
good,"Quality of environment was sad and depressing. "
good,I loved the company State Farm but the independent agent I worked for made illogical decisions for the customer so I ended working for him. I assumed all State Farm agents operated a fully ethical operation but learned that each agent creates their own business to satisfy their own personal goals.
good,"You work many hours and unless you own the agency you make minimum wage.  You work in insurance and you receive no health insurance.  There is no room for advancement and no more vacation other than the 2 weeks."
good,In order to advance from the department I worked in. It was who you knew. Not what you knew! If you have a supervisor who is willing to help you get to the point you are ready to advance- take advantage. Only a few will give you what you need to excel!
good,"It depends on the agent you work for.  Working for an agent, there is no room for advancement.  The culture has changed and I left feeling that I was no longer a valuable asset.  I had nearly 20 years experience and was extremely dedicated."
good,The work environment was very stressful. The idea of not knowing the fate of the company would then turn into fear about the fate of your job and how you would support your family.
good,I worked for an agent and sold policies for him not the company.  No way to get my own Agency or advance in any way.  The salary was low and mainly commissioned based which made it hard to maintain a family budget.
good,"Job started off good. Lots of work little pay and micromanaging is all over the place. If late by 1 minute you are wrote up, no morale in the work place at all."
good,Commissions were difficult to earn and there was no medical insurance or 401K.  I had to purchase my own insurance thought the National Health Care System.  He also wanted us to purchase life insurance policies to increase his sales.  He gave us daily phone call goals to dial and would sit in his office on the phone or would watch TV in his office that is when he did not leave to play golf.  I also learned not to trust what is said.  ALWAYS GET IT IN WRITING FIRST!!!
good,"A normal day is coming into the office and answering phones, trying to solve mistakes that other handlers made. The main goal is to pay people for their totaled car, but you handle more issues with the ""team"" because someone did not follow the state laws or make sure the customer is taken care of, while other ""team"" members continue to just send paperwork so that they look like they are paying out for vehicles. It is un-enjoyably to correct so many obvious mistakes and then be ridiculed for doing so."
good,"I have had State Farm insurance on my autos for over 20 years and  have been extremely satisfied with the coverage and the quick response when claims were submitted."
good,statefarm was a great company but once it was bought over the bs you were able to wash away with the organization and extra money you would work doing overtime was now not worth the culture that organization became.
good,"This is a very detail oriented job. I learned about different types of insurance, and requirements customers had to meet to be covered. Management does need improvement in the office I worked at. That is the reason I left."
good,Typical day starts before the sun comes up. Sort and open mail. Sort and open some more mail and then you sort...and open...mail. I learned that colored ink cost money to scan.
good,Great Company to work for if your goal is to become an Agent. Customer Service is a HUGE part of this company in ANY ROLE. Make sure you can market to the outside.
good,"I handled incoming calls and clients, ran quotes and made cold calls to bring in business.  Also participated in Marketing of the business as well."
good,"The company as a whole is fine, the individual agency and over abundance of them have created an untenable situation that will only get worse over time."
good,"Agent not understanding regarding If I had appointments with doctor, attorney, or real estate agent."
good,"As office manager the pay was low. no benefits, But you get a good look at what an agent does to decide if you want to become one. They are willing to train you for becoming an agent while on the job."
good,"working for my boss and a small business was difficult."
good,Just okay. Not exciting. Stuck in a cubicle. Management has favorites. Lots of gossip.
good,I was 100% commission in a low income area with FIVE agents in same town and subsequently wasn't able to make ends meet. If you are considering a position at State Farm ensure the Agent has a sufficient book of business to work.
good,Too many chiefs at this Job site. Training was hit and miss most of the time. Hardest part of this job is one day you are the best employee and the next nothing will please the boss. I enjoyed learning insurance through independent school AD banker. State text is hard but passable.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of reaching out to potential insurance clients, Setting up auto and home policies and engaging potential clients. I learned how to be persistent and overcome obstacles to reach my goals. My agent was very tough and she had very high expectations, which  was incredibly motivating as well as uninspiring. "
good,"The company was informative and exciting to work for. I had begun training to be a life insurance specialist, so there was room for advancement. My co-workers were very friendly and i enjoyed working side by side with them."
good,Ultimately working there was okay. Management was poor. Very inconsistent. Not really focused on advancing the employees within the company but instead outsourced work.
good,"Leadership is robotic, nobody does what makes sense. Work life balance is outta whack. Getting time off is almost impossible. All the talent has left to other insurers. They are a big machine that no longer cares about the employee, and the employee doesn't know how to handle the customers."
good,"Choose your agency wisely. State Farm itself is a great company, but the agent you work for differs. You'll work for them, not State Farm. Get your job offer in writing and your salary offer on paper along with their expectations."
good,Excellent company but no work/life balance and not enough compensation for the work you do! Not very much manager support. Main focus is the customer and making company goals.
good,"Helping Customers with their needs was rewarding at times. Low pay, little to no benefits made the position undesirable. Constant pressure to sell even if a customer just suffered a loss or just paying a bill."
good,"Very few agent offer benefits.  Employees work hard for busy agents and get burnt out quickly without a work, life balance.  A few changes to give more to employees would go a long way."
good,"I loved my job when I first started in 2012.  I wanted to retire with the company.  Great pay.  Great morale and a wonderful working environment. As time went on however, the company started shifting its focus from the employees and customers to their bottom line and profit."
good,"State Farm is a great company, however since the Agents are isolated from the company itself its really a hit or miss depending on who your working for"
good,"It is a face paced sales role, even though you are a receptionist.  You have to hit goals and sales numbers.  They say it's an option to do sales, it is not.  It is a must."
good,"Lots of promises of advancement and promotion, limited ability due to work-force freezes for critical, high turn-over positions.  "
good,"State Farm had too much going on, beneath the surface of our job description. If some of the behaviors were not so offensive, working there would have been fun. They had lots of pot-luck lunches & nice people with a few rude immature people, who made working there unbearable."
good,This was for a temporary position. I only worked for the amount of time that the contractor was up for. I stayed on for an additional 3-5 months prior to exiting for a full time position.
good,Unrealistic expectations on sales. Always changing the rules in the office. There is a lot of favoritism in the office. A lot of cold calling is expected.
good,"Good company if you are great at selling. If you are not great at selling, find another job ASAP. The job is very stressful and can make you very anxious. I was severely depressed and anxious the entire time working here"
good,Micro Manage at Entry Level. Very hard to advance and Mangagment doesn’t know there job. Getting paid to produce numbers and not help policyholders with out time restraints.
good,"St Farm has the potential to be a great company and would benefit from ""fresh"" management,  up to date systems and autonomy. Management has to be open to employee ideas."
good,Im not interested in reviewing my current employment. There are too many different departments and offices for my review to be accurate. Refer to the star rating
good,"Constant micromanaging, supervisors don't provide immediate answers, clients are never able to get a hold of the supervisor right away they run away when there is a sup call."
good,"State Farm could have been an excellent place to work and grow. However, the agent I worked under had a short temper and was honestly not a very nice person in the workplace. The person knew what they were doing, just would have been better off not having employees under them. The office I worked for also didn't offer any health insurance."
good,Hired nice people just couldn't keep them. Management was horrible and there wasn't much room to grow within the company unless you wanted to relocate out of state.
good,This is a fast paced business. Multi tasking a must with attention to detail.  Competing constantly to meet sales goals. Good point is that they have constant training - sometimes too much.
good,"If you are working for a agent..."
good,"boss was great but the cooperate side of company was terrible and didnt honor duties , we were number 5 in the southeast as leaders of sales in multiple categories"
good,"If you're a robot, this job is absolutely for you. Can't be late even though they plopped their business in one of the busiest places in Atlanta. Just really not a great place for someone who is looking to make more of their self. I think it's perfect for if you're in your 40s and just need a good stable job to retire on. But if you are young, full of ideas, and want to go places. Don't do it."
good,"5 minute grace period, outlandish point system. 4 points for one day missed. high call volume. many micro managers. no room for advancement, or growth."
good,"No advancement opportunities for employees."
good,"Different agents work differently, but I was sold on having a base salary with comission on my policies written and sold. Some agents will pay for your classes, testing, and licensing fee's. Other's may not and will want you to kick out atleast $300 - $400 before you even start training  because you must me licensed. That's just for Property and Casualty, most agents want you to be dual licensed with Life and Health which is seperate round of classes, testing and license fee's. Which equals about $$800 -$1000 for both licenses that only last 2 years tops. Once you get the licenses and are in office you spend more time doing unnecessary service work, getting screamed at over the phone about increases, shotty discounts, and people who can't comprehend their bill and nlwhere newr enough time talking to leads or closing sales to actually make commission. If you can make time for sales then you'll only get about 2 or 3% per policies sold for Auto and Fire. But ONLY if you sell required amount of policies per month which is ridiculous in my opinion. 15 - 20% for selling Life Policies since State Farm is more interested in selling life insurance policies for investment purposes. Only pro is that you don't have to sell a required amount of policies to get comission of a life policy. If you have the sales shark mentality then it may be a good fit for you but this was nothing more than a stepping stone for me. But Hey to each his own right..."
good,"State Farm is deep in an ongoing process of re-organizing, cutting costs, and becoming more efficient.  The company has shifted from the ""family"" style culture to looking pretty much like any call center or other high volume operation. There is a state of confusion as cuts in employment, building closures, and operational changes appear to be happening at random and poorly executed.  It can be a confusing place to navigate as goals, priorities, direction, and leadership is in an ongoing state of flux and change."
good,"The company used to have a great culture and employee engagement atmosphere with a customer first approach. The company has been going through some restructuring and upper management has lost sight of the culture & atmosphere which drew so many great people to be loyal to this company. It's understandable the company needs to make changes to stay healthy and competitive; however, at the same time the upper management needs to remember the front line workers and realize what the actual time is to address the customers' business needs."
good,Agents are too busy competing with each other to help another agent in distress. The time given to be successful is limited. Unrealistic production required from State Farm. Customers hard to retain based on constant increased premiums. Most of an agents time is spent handling customer complaints. Hiring a successful staff is a nightmare.
good,"Owner of that State Farm office was always unavailable, & the management of the office was horrible, as employees did whatever they pleased. Overall, the tasks of the job were enjoyable."
good,"Im sorry but with all the rate increases over the years that never seem to go down, it was harder and harder to work for State Farm. Yes they like to pride themselves on customer service over price but I'm sorry, majority of the people in the world, care about price. We lost soooo many customers to geico and erie. How do you expect an adult with maybe a family to survive making barely minimum wage and then working off commissions, when the rates are so high, everyone is switching and canceling policies."
good,"Not all SF agents are created equal.. Choose wisely.  Make sure you background check them, including financial stability of the agent and social media accounts.  Also, review their marketing strategy."
good,"State farm is not very competitive in today's given market for insurance. They cant beat to many providers except farmers and occasionally Allstate. Overall the experience was interesting but I wont recommend state farm to family or friends. "
good,"State Farm was a great stepping stone in my career. Each agent I worked for was different in many ways. Most days consisted of cold calls, and customer service calls for existing consumers"
good,"Constant training, need to meet/exceed daily goals, salary is not competitive, little to no opportunity to advancement, vacation days and benefits are fair."
good,"It is a nice place to work where there are lots of values personally and professionally with in the company."
good,"Transition time at this company. Their direction is not shared honestly within the company. There is a company speak issue that is not being addressed for those that actually ""do the work."""
good,"Shift in company culture has resulted in lack of job stability and lack of career options. One is never sure if the office will still be open next week, and it is nearly impossible to take time off."
good,"This review is dependent on who's office you work for.  With State Farm each office is independent.  The work itself is interesting, but the pervasive feel in the office makes it an unpleasant  work environment."
good,"Working for State Farm can be a good career move but, it is not for everyone. The benefits and compensation are great but, that is where the pros end. At all levels the work life balance is horrible. You are treated fairly based on your work metrics, however these metrics are more arbitrary goals and do not necessarily translate into real results. In my experience, working towards real results is a hinderance rather than a benefit. Working for State Farm is all about drinking the Kool Aid and doing exactly what you are told. If that is what you are looking for than it is a great company. If not, look somewhere else."
good,"A typical day at State Farm is very stressful because as a CCC rep- you answer many inbound calls every day. The most challenging part of the job is not having the ability to interact with team members and draw from their knowledge as one is acclimating to fit within the organization."
good,"CEO was fired for having 2 babies with 2 different secretaries. You can't get sick because if you are and haven't been there for 30 years you don't have any time saved up to take off. There is a new points system in place. People have to put their job first over their family and health because you get points if you have to call out sick. 20 points, you're fired. 4 points each call in."
good,"Great work environment and team, however the Agent would leave frequently or not come not the office at all so there was not much onsite support.  The pay including the commissions were very low. if the office was better managed and they paid more. It would be an Ideal place to work."
good,"you dont have to clock in or out , its a decent  job , needs to be worked on when it comes to managemt , you get promised benefits or a certain amount of bonuses and then  never see the money, also get things they give you the take it back"
good,Your manager can make or break you depending on there world view. You can have a certain tone on a call and if they do not like it they can start the process of firing you very quickly. Even if you change your tone to match what they want. It is still not good enough.
good,Overall State Farm Agency's are great places to work.  The agency I worked for last had difficulties that conflicted with my ethics.  that agency is no longer in business and should not hinder your decision to look at State Farm Agents as a whole.  They are usually excellent places to work for.
good,"I enjoyed the company and the products they offered. However, I did not care for working under a new agent who had not yet received an official contract with the company."
good,This company was amazing to work for until 2014 when they started changing everyone's positions and monitoring every move. Upper management changed the entire culture of the company and became a horrible place to work for when trying to achieve work/life balance. They also slowly started moving positions out of state so there was no advancement and eventually there would be no jobs at all.
good,"As I stated if you were in the right Department this was not a bad place for employment.  Unfortunately, there are certain departments when I was employed that were consolidating to other locations and I needed more stability of knowing I had a job to go to each day."
good,"Operational Dysfunction"
good,I was working there and was told to keep lying to an underwriter to insure another person moving into the same residence as his son....who was married but listed as single because his wife had a DUI and suspended driver license which would make that home uninsurable. I told the woman who had originally handled the policy to keep handling it and I would not keep the lie for her. After that work was made a nightmare and eventually I was forced to resign with some hush money. Totally crooked agency!
good,"State Farm doesn't care for their employees. Workplace culture is toxic, with the structure encouraging petty sniping and favoritism playing a huge role in who advances, not the impossible metrics that they pressure you to meet above all else. Even when you excel in the metrics and your results, they'll find a way to downplay your achievements, abilities and nitpick. Learn to play the game or forget about it."
good,"I really do not want to go through this idiotic process, I am being force to say positive things when I dont want to comment,"
good,I have friends in the area that work for other State Farms. They are all individually owned. The one I worked for seems to have the highest employee turnover rate. This does not seem to be the case elsewhere. I suggest to really ask around about management before signing on.
good,"typical day at work consists of 12 hour shift not leaving much family time."
good,"Take this job if you must, but keep looking! It is desperately repetitive and you will be highly micromanaged. You will say the same thing over and over and over, call after call after call."
good,I didn't have a good manager so the company didn't work out for me. My manager was very rude and didn't not car about your personal life.
good,the producer position at State Farm promotes the success of the agency owner but not that of the producer...this opportunity would be much higher rated if the compensation plan was significantly more competitive
good,"A very busy work environment dealing with auto claims, WC, EOB, attorney letters, etc.  I need an interview to further explains."
good,Co-workers were friendly and nice to work with.  Management was not friendly at all.  Made you afraid to make a mistake.  Stressful place to work.  Made it hard to want to go to work.
good,"slow paced, over promise under deliver. No room to grow in this field unless you want to open your own agency. Working under an agent does not provide you with direct State Farm employee benefits."
good,"i wasn't comfortable in the work environment, i had no time for school, it took a toll on me, it was really rough. I did learn how to be very patient and stay calm under pressure."
good,This job was very delightful in the beginning but as the months went on the true color shined threw and it became very unpleasant.  The turn around of employees were monthly making it hard to drive a straight ship.
good,"Always unable to catch up on work that was so far behind, ( 6 months) "
good,"It depends who your agent is if you have a good relationship with them it will be fine."
good,"a typical day at work will be filing  all paper work if needed calling  on all appointments  for the week .answering  inbound calls ,taking  payments (EFT)by electronic funds transfer. updating  changes on policies if needed ,update cc or bank information,mortgagee information,auto,claims ,ext. assist agent with daily operations in office and  promoting bank products on commission.while working at state farm I've earned to be very patient with clients and show them we  care and put them first. the co workers are great but hardest part of job is selling and making commission but the most enjoyable part is meeting new great people and trying to help them out ."
good,"Worked for a Agent, not for State Farm. Flexible hours, but not very good pay and no benefits at all. No opportunity for advancement."
good,"wrote apps and took payments'"
good,"Flexible schedule, but most agents require weekend work. Excellent bonus structure"
good,"I answered the phones all day, opened emails and sent emails to the team members. I would update the accounts for the agents if anything had changed. In the later part of the evening I would do cold calling to list of numbers to try and get them a free quote on insurance."
good,"While at this position I was able to learn a lot about Microsoft Outlook, which prior to the internship I had little to no experience with. I was responsible for taking care of payment made, recording and depositing them. I generated marketing materials and set up client meetings for our brokers."
good,The contract companiess they use are ridiculas. Spent most of day trying to stay awake between phone calls. mnimal demand and minimal pay (youu'd be amazed how much they get a head).
good,Hard work can be well rewarded if you play their games. Management could use more experience.
good,Everyday something new to learn looked the challenge of learning new things. I greeted customers loved all the smiling faces and getting to know each and everyone of them.
good,"For a major company, the pay is very low, but the demand is extremely high. This makes the turnover ratio very high as well. This was the best company to work for, but it served its purpose for the time being."
good,"It stinks when you can’t meet unrealistic goals and some managers tell employees to reset tasks to make goals. However, those same employees are getting in trouble for doing as they were told and then not having worked the files in months. "
good,"State Farm is a great company to work for, but agents are responsible for how they decide to run their office.  Each agent determines the wages/commissions paid and sets the team environment.  If there is a constant turnover in employees, there is a reason, find another agent."
good,Enjoyed the work and wanted to get on track to agent program.  2 agents both weren’t helpful or supportive.  Discouraged totally.  Decided to move on.
good,"When you're in an agency please be careful of what agent you choose. I have noticed the going rate/recommended rate of pay for its employees is about $15/hr which for the amount of work and stress of it all seems very low. If you have a great agent like I did at the last office I worked for I had great hours, flexibility and the ability to learn, grow, meet/make goals and reach them. If you're in a larger office like I am nowm we are under paid and over worked, little to no recognition, poor work culture. I had to actually beg for my last pay check. "
good,"you have to put in a lot of effort and time into everything you do and sometimes the compensation is not enough. the people can be mean, and management usually lacks in many things."
good,"The office environment was toxic. It was a culture of Micro-managing, Undermining and blatant Favoritism led by the Agency owner and one of his longtime employees."
good,"This company does not care about work and life balance their point system is very cut throat. I’ve seen employees have a heart attack and pass out and was carried out by ambulance from the stress of this company and they still received points which either lead them to a write up or terminated. I wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone. The metrics are ridiculous and they always add something new for you to follow. One minute you have to worry about metrics and next month you need to worry about customer service, everything is not consistent"
good,"I have worked in 3 different departments and there are ALWAYS procedure & process changes, usually with little to no notice and extremely INADEQUATE training."
good,"All agencies are run differently.  Depends on who you work for. For the most part, it's a good place to work and your salary depends on how much effort  you put into selling."
good,"Job was okay but management was horrible, work your butt off to qualify for bonuses. This I did not like because I was doing it more to qualify vs to help the insured. Management would even write multiple policies on employees just to hit bonuses."
good,training is very detailed much better than other insurance companies but still has challenges   management is the same as any other insurance company  relaxed dress code great benefits
good,"There are aspects to this job that are great. For example helping others and that feeling you get when you make a sale. The times in between, however, are boring. Clicking and dialing is not for everyone. Also because you are employed for an agent and not the company of State Farm there is not a lot room for raises (based off commission) and little to no benefits offered."
good,"Taking high call volume. Having a clear understanding of how insurance works and being able to explain it to customers and third party vendors. Reviewing all jurisdictions for each state."
good,"Typical Call Center Job; a pro would be the benefits package although there's only 2 options for health insurance plans; cons would be your ever changing schedule, lack of management/engagement, poor culture (no team building or personal mentor/development), no opportunities for advancement within, and the mandatory overtime."
good,Family was not a priority.  They expect you to come in no matter if you have an emergency situation or now.  No paid time off.  No benefits.  No work/personal life balance.
good,I worked for an independent agent who was brand new to state farm and to insurance.  she was a retired teacher/principal who didn't know how to run an insurance agency.  we spent an hour a day listening to her read us a book.
good,"bad work environment, managers don't communicate with employees. Managers are never on the same page, training is horrible they don't teach you the things you need to know. The pay is good but other insurance companies pay more."
good,The management here in AZ is not great at all. I feel as though they missed the vision set out by corporate. I hope that things have changed. State Farm has a big building but the name and the business has changed.
good,"State Farm is really a good company. "
good,Place puts a hold in a job position where you cannot apply for any other jobs form months at a time. They have increased work load drastically but have kept the pay rate the same.
good,"Call center is high-paced.  Metrics do not balance with Customer Service ethics or company inspired slogans.  Management will let you know you are doing something wrong, but they do not support you when you ask for additional training. High employee turn over rate."
good,Short staff issues due to high turnover. Low salary and overtime was a necessity to meet deadlines. Poor employee morale led to poor quality of work. Time off was difficult. Low work life balance.
good,I enjoyed the experience wih State Farm overall. I decided the environment of the particular State Farm office i was with was very unprofessional. I will always appreciate the knowledge i gained while there but I also cherish the knowledge of what I do not want in future employers. State Farm is a great company under the right agents. There were initial agreements upon me working there that became apparent were not going to be honored. I also did not receive my last two weeks pay because I refused to go back to the agents office to be berated once more by the State Farm agent. I feel that office would have better growth hadthe tools offered by State Farm Headquarters been utilized.
good,Stressful and a high turn around rate. Never felt like a team member and no job security. Being micromanaged from the moment you got to work was not a great environment.
good,"There was no real balance of customer service and production. Service and underwriting lines were unfamiliar with policies to the point where i would have to call 3 or 4 times. We were all poorly trained in the office, the job became repetitive and slow."
good,Recent senior leadership change over past few years unhealthy for company and employee. Lack of emphathy. Wanting to provide customer focus but not treating employees consistently and fair.
good,When I started at State Farm it was the best company you could ask for. We relocated to keep working for them but the company changed when the new CEO took over. There was no more work-life balance and employees no longer felt cared for just another peg filling a spot. I have heard the company is starting to pump the breaks and try and fix some of the mistakes they made.
good,State Farm is the best insurance company to gain claim experience. Recent changes have created an environment not favorable to their standards of remarkable customers service.  The expectation to manage  unrealistic workloads coupled with under staffing due to high turnover has created an ongoing stressful work environment.
good,"Very enjoyable co-workers and managers. "
good,"When I first joined the company I loved them. Over time, they changed and began to care less about their employees and customers and more about the numbers. They are not understanding of work/life balance especially to those with children and sick family members. They will drain the life out of you if you allow them to. One positive thing is that they do offer training for all positions. There is a lot of favoritism that occurs, leadership/management can tend to be very petty and vindictive towards employees that don't care for. If you jump through the hoops, kiss up a lot, and never miss work then you will fo very far with the company. Every day your team's stats are displayed from the previous day and are written in a color code meant to shame you. If your stats are in compliance with their goals, it is written in green, if they are out of compliance for any reason, it is written in red. Your manager will often ask you in front of your team to explain you didn't do well the previous day. They watch everything you do as if they don't trust you to properly do your job, you constantly feel the big brother eye upon you. "
good,"This company is not the company I joined.  I am dissatisfied with how we treat the customer and the employee.  "
good,"This was a good entry level position in the insurance industry. I learned basics of selling and bundling policies for maximum benefits."
good,I was able to gain this position at a time that I needed a job. My hopes were to gain more administrative experience however this position was rooted in sales and did not afford me the experience I expected.
good,"State Farm was once the #1 place to work but no longer with the new CEO.  Too much micromanagement in claim department and no work life balance. Workload more than doubled from 5 years ago. Now State Farm is more worried about numbers verses customer service. It appears they finally found someone who knew how to utilize and get the most out of Excel. Managers have learned how to skew the numbers to make their team look good. They went on the point system and if you were one minute late you would get a point, 15 points and you are fired. I never got a point but it was ridiculous how hard it was to meet the requirements.  I worked there over 25 years but left after seeing the direction this guy was taking this wonderful company.  So many good employees and customers have left since the new CEO took over which I think was his plan. They don't want to pay the high salaries for the experienced people and trying to make the ones that work there do the work for 2 and 3 people. Trying to get vacation that included a Monday or Friday was near impossible unless you scheduled it a year in advance.  State Farm is a great company with good morals and will eventually take care of you if you have a claim, but right now, they are not an employee friendly company to work for."
good,"I worked in the branch in Monroe, La for 3 years.  That department closed and I was relocated to Austin for 12 years. In 3/2016, my job ended. I relocated to Forth Worth, Texas. "
good,I worked very hard to learn and learn the State Farm culture. After 2 promotions the salary wouldn't get any better. The last manager was a complete moron and so were his superiors. The company lacks good management to make the departments feel like a unified company.
good,"My time at State Farm started well and ended terrible. I went in with hopes that there would be opportunity for me to grow out of my role in abrogation and use my degree in Health Promotion. My manager advised me that I wasn't a good candidate for transitioning to another role because she ""didn't have anything to base my performance on since I had went on maternity leave"". The role I wanted to be considered for wasn't a production based role, and I did not feel that was s fair judgment. The metrics that management wanted us to achieve were ridiculous. One can do it, but you must practically force yourself to become a trained robot to achieve them. We had daily huddles were your numbers were displayed along with your teammates. If you did not see the minimum, some managers would publicly shame you by asking ""what happened"". Not sure what is going on there now as I've been gone almost 2 years, but if the reports I'm getting from a former coworker are accurate, nothing has changed and it has in fact gotten worse."
good,"I believe State Farm is a great company that offers its clients many options. With the right salesperson, these clients will get a  great product and superior service."
good,Stressful and oppressive. Worker moved from out of state. Culture is insular. They do not seem to like outsiders. Management overlooks HR issues that can cause problems in the workplace. If worker had the opportunity to advice former manager.
good,"No benefits, no oversight, no training. Just cold calling on old leads. work life balance is good, but if you want to make any money you must put in extra hours."
good,"Management at the location I worked for was not professional, had issues of jealousy of her employees and was petty. State Farm as a company is not the problem, the problem in lies the Agents that are allowed to run offices."
good,SF is a company trying to keep up in this new age of technology. It's an old company that is losing customers to this new internet savy age based customer. Many of their mindsets and ideas are outdated and if they don't catch up to the competition they won't be around for 75 more years.
good,"Hope things have changed, the manger was not as patient as i hope. But i do hope things have changed so this manger would have been a big company with amor relaxed enviorment."
good,Run!!!  This is not a role you would want if you are in an agents office.  They will sell you a dream and try and keep you motivated by telling you that you will get into their agent aspirant program and if you do you accumulate mounds of debt! Current agent told us he should have been a teacher instead lol
good,"This company is attempting to catch-up with others and instead of slow adoption it has become a mad rush to make-up for years of no change. Too many chiefs. Micromanagers, no growth or development unless you move to a hub."
good,"Through the years there have been many changes at State Farm.  But I realize that for a company to grow, changes must occur.  The only change I do not agree with is Job Work/Life Balance.  Years ago, it was expected that all employees be able to maintain their work/life balance.  However, in recent years, the only balance allowed is for work."
good,Very little experienced claim handlers or management. State farm is closing offices all over country and is leaving the experienced claim reps without a job.
good,"all they are concerned about are numbers. I like to build relationships. I felt like a robot trying to get my numbers. Work is environment is ok you get to work and meet some true down to earth folk. I felt lost sometimes with different changes with the company, my office was an established office and they wasn't into learning al the new things. which"
good,"As an employee of State Farm I have learned how their company works inside and out. I like the company however I feel differently about the job. I always learn how to adapt to situations, so I have adapted pretty well to the high stress environment. I am just not satisfied with the not having benefits or with the pay at the moment."
good,"State Farm is moving all company activities to the Hubs. They are leaving the operation centers. In doing so, they are leaving a majority of the experienced associates. The company has also taken many of the things away that made it a great place to work. I hear the Hubs are great, but I have also heard the pay is low. If you want to work for State Farm go to the Hubs."
good,They did not care about you family life schedules were set in stone for 6months- 1 year it was just a terrible place to work with all the constant changing
good,"An employer who overloads work onto a declining workforce in an office destined to close. Prior to the phasing out of  certain offices, State Farm was a company that had taken care of it's employees and provided a good place to work with a great work culture."
good,"If you are the agent, they pay well, staff members do 90% of the work and do not get paid well. Reputable company but the staff do not get paid for what they do.  The agents get the glory, and the staff does the work."
good,"•	Provide support to State Farm agents and their staff, handle questions regarding marketing and advertising.  Handle reimbursements and agent service awards. "
good,"Do not work for SFPP ( billing dept.)unless you want to be stuck in a stale position. But I've actually seen people leave that department, go to somewhere like claims and come back to SFPP.  It was fine the first 3 years in ( i was promtoted within 2 yrs), remaining 7 years have been a roller coaster of jumping through hoops and still not getting promoted any further."
good,Owner make promises he never keeps. No training. Always changing how he will pay commissions. Lots of turnover. You work hard and it does not matter
good,A faced paced call center job that requires critical thinking and problem solving skills as well as excellent customer service and communication skills.
good,"Some of the co-workers were great, but for the most part it was a hostile work environment. The Agent/Owner was never in the office and had little regard for employees. This is a 5 year business that is not getting off the ground well."
good,"I enjoyed working with my fellow employees while at State Farm.  Management was very micro about how you did your job.  There was very little freedom and you were monitored on every aspect of your job.  Management rarely made you feel as though you were doing a good job.  But as mentioned, your teammates were very supportive."
good,"Had to pass insurance test to keep position when the posting said nothing about it. Co workers where great. Answered calls and took payments, set appointments"
good,"Work environment was not aligned with initiatives and mission of organization. Not an environment of inclusiveness and in my opinion was a silo driven environment. "
good,"I was thinking that State Farm would be more customer oriented than they are. I am not a sales person, I always want to put the customer first, regardless of commission."
good,"Daily Routine in place such as 	Handled large amounts of cash.  Resolved customer complaints.  	Handled billing and payment problems.  Initiated claims for customers.  Handled high call volumes. Learned all systems in the company such as abs system.  Co- workers were very pleasant.  I consider myself to be a fast learner, there was no hard part as i am a problem solver.  Guaranteed outstanding customer services."
good,"Everyone's always moving around, staying busy, working overtime every other day, the training was very understandable, and the paperwork was helpful."
good,The State Farm company per se is well run and a good place to work. Each individual agency is another story and often subject to inequities and biases of agency management/owners who set their own cultures and policy.  Some of these policies are highly suspect in their equitableness and ethical foundation.
good,"I have learned a lot from State Farm, but the opportunities to advance in the company is very limited and the job security is not feeling very existent at the moment."
good,"Typical day is to handle all needs new and existing clients needs, along with developing new clients. The hardest part about my job is being restricted to how many people we cannot help. The most enjoyable part is really helping someone that might have been neglected."
good,"A great company, poor management, The location was neutral, great benefits, and room to travel abroad the company, for promotional opportunities"
good,I don' have much to write about state farm. I was still in high school when I had this job. Didn't have much experience in the work place. I only worked 1 hour a day maybe 2 or 3 times a week.
good,"the day felt long, the manager was racist. didnt feel welcome at the time of coming in to work."
good,"The day would start with us getting our windows on our computers open to all the applications that would be needed. Taking calls from Customers that have account with State Farm Bank. Or Agents that need help on forms, or need to close out CD's or open accounts.  We also handled Car payments.  So we would be able to give them information on that as well. We always take security measures to make sure it was the agent or the Customer that we were talking to before giving them any information on their account.  Things were changing  a lot as they always do in the banking industry.  So making sure you were updated all the time and you knew where to find the information if not.   I enjoyed working with my co-workers, we were a team and were always there to help each other out if we needed help on something.   The hardest part about the job?  Was just making sure you were giving enough information.   The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to talk to customers from all over the Us and  Hawaii.  And helping them with their banking needs."
good,"This job is possibly the worst I have ever had. I do not enjoy the work that I do or the fact that this department has set a new standard for micromanaging. We are treated as though we are children at times and if we do not get 100% on Quality Monitoring, we are ""coached."" An understandable process until the words ""or termination of employment"" are used. Good customer service is thrust aside in favor of being a robot. I enjoy the benefits but I am doubtful that the benefits are worth this."
good,good place to work and settle down. Excellent work life balance.
good,I was impressed with management's willingness to work with employees when any problems arose
good,"A typical day at work would consist of scheduling appointments, responding to emails, answering phone calls and making sure you meet your goals on a daily basis. I have definitely gained a lot more communication skills and patience. You learn how to cope with certain situations due to the level of stress it can cause."
good,"Arrive at work turn on phones follow-up on any leads, and handle any customers that came to the office.  I learned a lot about auto insurance that I did not know, insured motorists and exactly what all the terms meant and covered.  Management was not very receptive, possible personality conflict.  Had one co-worker she was very helpful and learned a lot from her.  Hardest part was learning the terms of insurance and learning how to explain to the clients in Spanish using the correct terminology.  Most enjoyable were the clients and how appreciative they were when you took the time to explain and make sure they understood."
good,"Every 15 mins you're being told to switch works queues, answer phones, you have to constantly monitor a form that updates and changes what your doing in quartly increments.  IT SUCKS!"
good,This company does not pay enough wedge and they have very strict policy including intensely repetitive work environment.
good,It was ok place to work but not any room to move up or achivements
good,"Typical day at work started at 8 am - 5:30pm, no lunch, no breaks. Non-stop office setting. My co-workers understood how crazy busy it was so everyone tried to work together."
good,"I enjoyed helping applicants with quotes for auto,life,health and homeowners insurance. I learned to perform administrative routines and the hardest part of my job was meeting a monthly sales quota."
good,"The job was a cleaning every two weeks. It was a small office, which made the job easy. That would be the only good thing about the job. It was almost no supervision, with maybe one other worker, and the tools for cleaning were outdated. The one thing I learned is to be stobborn when cleaning, as it tends to make a clean workplace."
good,"•a typical day at work;Very pushy Bosses and everyone thinks they are correct in he say. They tend to over ride over proper paper work, work ethics. The older you work for a older experiance team the more the team working ethics are at its worse. Lots of offices are not upto date with New working ethics. Employee co-workers try to down grade or take your work. Very picky and dont care about customer service.•what you learned knowledge on Insurance.•management: VERY SAD AND NOT OPEND MINDED THERE FOR THEMSELVES.•the hardest part of the job, listenning to a very anoying superviser that wont be quiet and let you do your job or her job. •the most enjoyable part of the job, finnishing yr job and getting to go home to your family."
good,"I had good time, great run and good feeling that I was one of the key architects for their UC/EUCP program. Contributed to building of many solutions and overall excellent opportunity."
good,"I worked Monday-Friday and holidays off from 8:30am to 12pm. I would answer phone calls help clients pay their bills, and also calll clients who's policies were going to expire also clients who did not pay their monthly, quarterly, or semiannual paymetns I would call and remind them or take payments right then. I learned a little bit more about insurance and what it intails. My boss, who was the head agent was mostly never really there and when she was she was always itching to leave. Her second in command was amazing, she helped me to understand things and took her time my first day there make sure I really understood what I was doing. Hardest part of the job was prolly getting laid off by a text message. Most enjoyable was talking to people and getting to know them."
good,Management and performance rating system needed work as far as placing people in the right jobs for their skill level and not knowing enough about our jobs to rate us correctly.
good,Provides a wide array of working environments depending on location.
good,"Co-workers have great communication, I have learned alot about insurance and love working with customers."
good,"Good place to work but no many company benefits, great starter job"
good,After the reorganization the company culture changed drastically for the worst. The company no longer valued their employees and had no work life balance.
good,"Manager was a personal owner and did not spend much time in the office.  I was told that I would be let go after working there for a full year - due to the owner purchasing a 2nd home and that he ""could not afford to pay me and his 2nd mortgage""."
good,Typical day is moving reviewing credit applications as quickly as possible to achieve agreed upon turn times.  There is little opportunity for advancement within Bank Operations.
good,"Used to be a family friendly company, but no longer due to corporate structure. Work life balance is poor. Time off structure is not conducive to sudden life events."
good,Mgmt was hardly around when needed. Most Mgmt friendly and helpful if you get the right mgmt. Family comes first and they couldn't help with schedule.
good,not much chance to do your own thing.  very structured and rigid with most jobs working on the phone all the time.  good benefits was one of the best things about this company.
good,Nothing more to add..job is pretty straightforward...ibhated claims and insurance so it wasn't for me but the company and benefits overall were good. That's it
good,"This is not applicable at the time as I am no longer working for State Farm Mutual. While with the company, I worked for an agency, not the corporate office."
good,"time management and production environment, brand yourself and handle insurance claims. have a positive attitude is encouraged. being accountable, taking ownership is highly encouraged."
good,"The organization has a few areas of opportunity."
good,I like the job however unless you working for State Fatm directly there is no growth. Working in a sales role many people are in it for themselves so make sure you do what is expected and dont get into any office chatter. I like that the job caters to the customer and they are big on professionalism.
good,"Let me tell you right away, the managers are not as NICE as they claim to be. A whole lot of child like activity goes on at the Richardson Location. Everyone is an adult but in underwriting it does not feel that way. I am still in training but I’m not sure this is the right role for me due to the lack of maturity of some of the managers."
good,"Most Agents require a sales quota each month. So it's really up to the agent for everything. He or she is judge, jury and executioner. you really have to work the phone's and have a good sales pitch."
good,"Be on time, do the job and leave. Keep the conversations with coworkers to a minimal. It's a job and after being in training for 3 months you are tired but atleast you receive a through on hand training to assit you with what you will deal with once you hit the floor."
good,"No comments sorry you have to work there for yourself and see if its a good fit for you the work culture isn't for everyone."
good,"Good money, dumb managment and will fire you over drama and no proof so they wont have to deal with it. PTO is a joke but just call out and use FMLA haha."
good,I worked for several agents some who helped me a lot and gave support and others that did not help me succeed. I generally liked my coworkers but corpoarate put alot of pressure and implemented changes that I did not agree with because it made our jobs unnesissarily more difficult
good,Basic insurance job with expectations for sales and service together. The hardest part is dealing with ever changing systems and corporate rules. Expected to be well versed in every item you sell.
good,"company goes through a good training, things change once you get out,management can be a pain, point system in claims is unfair its not forced through all departments."
good,"Each agency you work for operates differently. My review of working with a specific agent can be different compared to another State Farm agent. Which is the risky part. The management for the agency I worked for was not completely professional. There were boundaries crossed in the workplace. It was difficult for team members and the agent to separate work and personal life. Since there is only one boss there, words can be changed easily. Meaning, you can have a procedure for this specific training and then it will change again when a team member cannot follow it correctly. The agent I worked for did not stand by her word. The agent paid her team members hourly + commissions and bonuses. Hourly was easily calculated due to online clock-ins/outs. The commissions were way too complicated to understand. Some months commissions were paid, some months there was a delayed in getting compensated. The hardest part of the job was not having a leader leading from the front. The agent provides workloads to the team members and expect only team members to make numbers for the office. The agent did the bare minimum on sales while team members were struggling to follow a correct procedure the agent could not finalize on. Aside from the poor management, I learned many things of the real world; how to properly insure your vehicle, home, etc. I can honestly say I took some education with me from working with State Farm Insurance. Although, I do not recommend working for an agency to anyone. I recommend working with operations instead of an agency."
good,"At first, it was fine. The first 3 years I felt like I could move up. I realized that without a degree that's impossible. I went back to school and was promoted. Unfortunately, I was terminated once I made it know I wanted to work within the field I was getting my degree in."
good,"They require a lot for a little. The point system is HORRIBLE. They do pay time and a half on holidays & with OT. They are usually good about allowing OT to be worked if offered. They want you to constantly take calls, no sitting in wrap, take breaks during break time only. They claim you can move up within the company but it takes so much and then you may not be released from your current position. They used to be stuck on numbers but that changed a bit once the new section manager came. They merged all the unlicensed demand pools together with the same amount of pay. Some of us went from working 7 states to about 30."
good,Great for entry level but if you have experience the breaks and work life balance just aren't there for the amount of pay..............................................
good,"Visiting with clients and helping them with their policies. "
good,I truly from the bottom of my heart do not wish to furnish any information about this company as I go through a potential transition period with the company in the very near future.
good,If you are willing to compromise your ethics and values the management will love you. Management prefers to promote workers who are not a threat to them. They like employees who agree with them 100% of the time. If you disagree with their work practices start looking for a new job
good,It's a fine place to work however there is a communication breakdown in the corporate structure that causes a lot of frustration for agents in the field.
good,Typical make more money cut benefits and employees. Company has changed from being family friendly to cut people to make an extra dollar. Less benefits and lower pay with no job security.
good,"Do some research about the agent before you go to work for them. Working for a slacker agent could make or break your insurance career. Many of them don't want to train you to be an agent, they want you to sell for them for as long as possible. "
good,"I’ve had some good years under a great manager. It’s amazing how team dynamics can change with leadership. Now there’s a constant anxiety and fear, the term “pressure cooker” used often."
good,good to work if you're really wanting to get into the insurance biz and if you don't mind calling & being on the phone all day or bringing your work home.
good,"Every single UX project that I poured my energy into was ultimately shelved or reduced back to current state by the Bloomington Biz Teams. "
good,"State Farm can be a great place to work if you work in a good office enviroment. This is pertaining to the agents office you work for not directed at State Farm itself."
good,"Poor advancement with company"
good,"I was very excited about working for State Farm Agency. Although, I had no prior experience in the business. I could have received better training and more team work from employees and would have preferred more professionalism from management."
good,Wasn't great but wasn't horrible. I did not have a great interaction with my agent so that greatly effected my view. I thought the product was great and they were ethically sound though
good,"As a claims associate you will be taking phone calls all day from customers who are usually less than happy."
good,"A typical work day at State Farm was very task oriented. You had a queue and were expected to try and clear it by the end of the day."
good,overwork you. super micromanaged. switch schedules and managers a lot. if you get a bad manager it could drastically change your experience. not enough break times.
good,"My Agent didn't have drive to make sales . I needed to get my license and could not obtain it. However, I would still make sales because I speak Spanish and would not get any credit or additional pay. I believe their is a flaw with State Farm and could have more sales if their standers were different within regards to their licenses."
good,"This location was focused primarily on the sales aspect and not enough about the customers. Very disappointed in how the staff was treated. Those who want to grow a sales skill set would thrive, but better options are available."
good,"Work schedule consisted of long shifts, constant changes in work day. Poorly managed when it comes to handling customer concerns. More numbers driven then results oriented. Highly stressful environment. Tools and assistance needed wasn't always available. "
good,"The job used to be more relaxed & enjoyable. Now it is all about numbers. How many calls did you take. How long is your average call. How good is your available time. How high is your after call work. Everything is now tracked. Aside from that, that pay is good. Benefits are good."
good,It was a pleasant experience working for the company. The job was very repetitive and was stressful when the workload was heavy.  I didn't like only doing one task all day long.
good,"State Farm will tell you every day what a great company they are to work for, but they could really could care less about their employees or customers. State Farm is all about beating the competition, so call center employees are pressured to get the customer off the phone and get right into the next call. The expectations are clear just not sustainable long term. The use of overtime to meet demands is the norm not the exception and they will make it mandatory. That along with solid weeks of black out days to request for time-off and shift-bidding make the work life balance terrible. They do have some great perks (discount programs, all the insurances, retirement and pension)."
good,State farm is sharp with their training and you must obtain licenses if you want to stay with them. My only complaint was that I was brought a board and left in the dark as I was working with a closing store after an agent left his store another manager that hired me promised me would work with his other store it never happened.  I had experience but was brought in to clean up their work.  This happened to me elsewhere as well.  You must become an Agent if you want job security.
good,"struggled with manager, was not compensated for work done, manager could not hold employees and was tough to work with.  Unrealistic expectations which were hard to meet"
good,"I would answer the customers call by greeting gathering information "
good,"This office had two wonderful ladies, but the owner was much less friendly.  It was not a good fit personally.  I was not comfortable with the pressure to up-sell or try to add on to a customer’s request for services."
good,"Poor management made me seek employment else where, the agent had horrible office structure. Favoritism was a big thing, kept people who couldn't pass their licensing exam around. Moody and constantly took it out on his representatives."
good,"Unattached management, it could be a good place to start your Insurance career. You must love people. You must work hard to climb up. Good Luck you can do it."
good,"State Farm used to care about people and their families.  Now it is all about numbers and money, they no longer care who they hurt.  They have closed multiple offices around the country and thousands of people have lost their jobs."
good,"State Farm is a good company that's in transition and loosing a lot of experienced workers due to the lack of advancement and poor salary."
good,I got to go out and meet people which I loved!!! There are no residuals unless you are the Owner. You belong to the Agent who owns the individual Companies.
good,"Work place culture was dead, Upper management changed and the company when down hill quick. A great family oriented company that cared about their employees and customers went to not caring about their employees and only about the customers. Moral went way down"
good,"Don't expect work/life balance. They are all about the numbers and not their employees. While the pay and benefits are good, you will work crazy hours, weekends, holidays and it still won't be worth the money."
good,Every office is ran a different way. It all depends on what Agent you work for. The Agent works for state farm and even as a licensed insurance agent you work for the Agent of the office. Every office has a different vibe and your pay is up to the agent not up to state farm. It was okay at first but it is not for everyone.
good,The company itself is fine but my agent was not great with time management and I often found myself asked to complete personal tasks after the official day had ended.
good,"Chain of command is really important in this company. Higher up Leadership in my department doesn't appear to know what they're doing. Gobs of nit-picky administrative policies are introduced seems like monthly. Really feel like I was treated like a 5th grader even though our job title says were are 'professionals'. Also, it doesn't appear that they really think through the decisions before green-lighting."
good,"Structured workflow with a demanding claim production expected, yet overtime wasn't allowed."
good,After being loyal to the company for 5+ years with new management and office closings the moral is no longer what it use to be . If you are looking for a job with mandatory overtime its the place for you
good,"Customers only care about price.  They love you when you first get them started, if you are able to save them money.  Their next renewal, if they make it that far, will leave."
good,Nice company to work for but different agencies are ran differently. State Farm as a whole is an awesome company to work for. All depends on the agent you work under
good,The company State Farm is great company to work for. The Agent not so much I felt he could of paid more and offered a lot more then what he did. But over all I like the insurance.
good,"Leadership was sometimes AMAZING and sometimes the worst. I had 4 different leaders within my first 2 years. Unfortunately the worst leader I had, I ended up with twice."
good,"Chaos without a vision.  Most work is service based with no sense of why or what the effort is intended to achieve.  Management is largely promoted out of non technical areas of the company and no idea how a technology organization should be run.  The culture is very complacent and there is no sense of urgency around making critical changes to the organization which are desperately needed."
good,Work was slow for what I was hired to do. Dealing with customers with a positive attitude is always a challenge. The most enjoyable is watching initially angry customers leave happy
good,To many changes and not enough explanation. did not take care of some of their senior employees. Not sure of what direction they are going. brought in people i supper management that did not know the culture and was only looking at bottom line.
good,"I worked in claims which is a horrible job. Customers are angry about slow response times, hours on hold, and a difficult process. Dealing with that every single day is stressful. The management preaches about creating a customer experience and apathy and taking care of people, but then barks if you are on the phone with a customer more than a couple minutes, it is an impossible environment to succeed in which is why the turnover is astronomical. Promotions happen if you are a ""dude"" or sleep with a manager,"
good,"working at agent office is stressful; "
good,This company has an attendance policy that punishes the employee for sick children. FMLA is available if the company that manages FMLA claims approves it. Cigna is extremely hard to work with.
good,Found that many SF agents are arrogant and give an impression of superiority over other in like fields. There was no opportunity for advancement with the agent that I worked for and he was always looking for something for nothing. He believed his occasional small gives of a hundred dollar pre-paid credit card gave him the ability to attach strings while holding those things over the heads of his employees.
good,"As a home claims adjuster there is nothing more enjoyable and rewarding than being able to resolve a claim and help a human being get their life back in order after a catastrophic event. As for the least enjoyable aspects of my line of work is not being able to extend coverage to a customer due to a policy exclusion. A normal workday consists of checking daily schedule as planned out by forecasting for what particular functional duties I am assigned for each hour of the day. Communicating with customers, contractor's, Public Adjusters as well as Attorneys of claim stats, payments, and resolutions. Management plays a key role in employee development to prepare employee's to advance to different segments within the company. Management leaves all claims decisions to claim specialist handling the claims, and primarily function to field messages from upper leadership, or to handle customer complaints, claim reconciliation is the sole responsibility of the handler of that claim. Workplace culture is one that is customer centric focused while maintaining  safe and efficient workplace environment. Build rapport coworkers to create a relaxed while professional work environment."
good,"When I worked for State Farm in the past, they treated their employees like gold. Since 2015, they changed the way they treated their employees and created a cut throat type of environment and began over working their staff. They began a micro management process and then began giving low raises which has created a high turn over of staff since then. They have edged out long term great Managers and have hired lower paid staff which was their goal. "
good,Just a bad way to run a mortgage company. No drive to make your team want to do better.  No incentives for performance.  Very political and shows favorites when promotions happen.
good,"State Farm rewards their agent owners, but the employees are the ones who suffer most.  Generally low pay, unreasonable goals at times, often high turnover."
good,Professional working environment and the opportunity to develop yourself does exist.  You also have a good opportunity to meet good professional working people at a very professional company.
good,"High Paced sales and Customer Service environment. Get to meet a lot of people and help a lot of people. Depending on who your agent is, you will either have a great time or miserable one."
good,Workload is too heavy. Office has terrible turnover rate. Systems put in place for account management need to be updated but management is set in their ways. Operating systems are slow and redundant. 9-5 job with some Saturday’s. Customers are great.
good,"Working with State Farm involved a lot of phone calls. Management said that they paid for leads that were willing insurance customers (Rarely did you call a willing lead) You then had to deal with a lot of cussing and angry potential customers. Training was strong, very successful agency, no real benefits offered, low salary with commissions."
good,"Friendly local office with 1 sales team member, and 2 people who are service. This office likes to remain small and local and is located in Dearborn Heights, MI"
good,"Typical day of work involves lots of negativity from co-workers, resources dwindling monthly. Hardest part - long hours, no recognition, no control of leadership to make effective change / change that makes sense to anyone."
good,"Overall it was a good experience, but pay is too low and no benefits. There are no advancement opportunities. Employee efforts are not valued, appreciated or rewarded."
good,"Lots of various jobs areas to move to, large campus, onsite cafeteria, lots of training and continuing education available. overall good place to work"
good,"Overall good company to work for, but not this office. Difficult management team, young and negative atmosphere. Enjoy the policyholders, and it's an easy job. Good overall hours. Good job to learn how to handle customer service issues and complaints. Hardest part of the job would be sales bonuses. Very difficult to reach goals which means the entire team suffers for one person not producing."
good,"the job culture is sales driven, "
good,The money was great just no job security! Fast paced!  I loved the work I just wished that there was more work to be done.  The trainers were very helpful!
good,"Company is great, however, in my department there has been a ""freeze"" for advancement and have been told that it is ""indefinite"". We are going on 2 years and still no end in sight."
good,Agent and office manager were not very helpful.  Office manager felt unobliged to give help when asked and people were out to take his job.  Not a very friendly atmosphere.
good,"I would feel much better if the compensation package for people in my position (worked for co. for years and now making less than those with no experience. Situations like this make those who have been with the company a while, like a number, not valued at all."
good,"I worked on a contract basis and did not receive benefits. The pay was excellent and I was fully aware of what was expected. The culture for contractors is different than for staff, obviously. That being said, I would recommend if the contact position as a financial means to an end. I cannot fairly assess the staff experience because I didn't experience it."
good,"State Farm use to be a great family based company to work for. Now its just about the numbers, and not the employees. "
good,The team that I worked with in the Frederick location was very helpful and fun to work with. They provided me with valuable information. We shared a common ground.
good,"I owned and operated a local insurance office and was responsible for sales and service of Life, Health, Fire and auto insurance for the clients that I acquired.  I also completed field underwriting and claims processing for Fire and auto insurance customers in my office."
good,"A job with potential, but if you don't have 100 personal contacts you can convert to their coverage right away, don't even bother. 90 day probation before they decide if they want to enter you into the agent aspirant program."
good,"Job avdvancement can be quick however due to the recent changes, job placement was sporadic. Work life balance all depends on which department you work in. This is also determined by if the dept is customer facing, therefore being at work is priority."
good,Small business within a large enterprise but not much assistance from leadership in pursuing other career opportunities withing the corporation. Not much room for autonomy.
good,Company has been in a constant state of change for several years. No stability. It has moved to a lean six sigma environment and has become very stressful. Numerous tenured employees have left the company. Upper management out of touch.
good,"Good job, bad manager. Many young women being trained not able to obtain their license. Too many mistakes to correct on accounts. Too many accounts to collect on outstanding balances."
good,"Provide customers with information on insurance. I learned that insurance is expensive in Florida. The work culture is very competitive. As hard as you work, it is never enough.  The hardest part of the job was not having an insurance license. The most enjoyable part is helping customers during their most difficult times when they had a claim."
good,New Structure is unfortunate. Typical day at work. What you learned. Management. Workplace culture. Hardest part of job. most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Working at an independently owned State Farm agency, the energy and flow of the office is alive. As a producer, I was a licensed property and casualty producer in the state of New Jersey. Sales, the thing that makes you go to work with a drive. Patience, understanding and learning something new along the way took a very long time but worth it. Knowledge, getting the company and polices like the back of your hand."
good,"Behind the times playing catch up to the financial industry. Siphons energy and resources to vendors, customers come last. Business model needs upgrade."
good,State Farm has been around for many year so most of the procedures and policies are fail-safe. I worked as a receptionist in which I loved working right with the clients and answering whatever questions they had. it was a great learning experience as a new receptionist
good,Working at Statefarm requires making 100 plus calls a day. You'll learn a lot about the Insurance Industry working there. Management consists of whatever agent you work for. Although technically everyone who has earned a license is considered an agent Statefarm kind of demotes you to honor their agents.
good,"The metrics are unbearable. State Farm is losing customers and great employees because of the micromanagement of each call. Average handle time is recorded daily and ""coached"" in front of the team on a daily basis if not met. It's nearly impossible to give the quality of customer service that State Farm customers need and deserve during a claim call during the time allotted to do so. The stress and the constan"
good,"Inbound call center, call volume is not terrible but have been short staffed for quiet some time, coworkers make it tolerable, management is too pushy"
good,Unable to find solutions for issues.Shrugs off problems and is very self absorbed.  No guidance or training made available. Expects the world and nothing in return
good,"typical have to be somebody and know someone to get in there. If you happen to get in by luck through the temp agency, don't expect to go far.  management is a joke."
good,"Too many work politics. There is no work life balance. "
good,"Too many negative changes have occurred that impact claim handling, customer service, and employee moral.  This is not the same company as when I began my employment here."
good,"Job itself was good, but management made it a miserable place to work! Benefits were very nice and you have the opportunity to receive an annual bonus if auto and life sales increased each year. But the direct supervisors really did a very poor job."
good,"I did not realize how stressful this job was until I left it. It is perfect for someone who doesn't mind overtime, monotony, working in a cubicle and being micromanaged every day."
good,Producing lead and closing sales. I learned that a leader is someone who show's by example. And sometime we have to loose inorder to win. Management was very in experience and workplace culture was fun but very negative. Hardest part was working being the top producer and not being appreciated and the most enjoyable is the ability to achieve goals I set for myself.
good,my direct boss was not in the office very often when we had questions and most of the higher ups were not very helpful. the hours were very good and there were no benefits
good,"You are not compensated enough to be a licensed professional. $9.37/hour is what your salary comes down to. The company is great, but the management at the agency is poor."
good,It's an easy job to work. You have to follow your script verbatim. Management is cool. have a café & gym (really nice). The hardest this is learning auto.
good,"I worked in a very small office with two other people, and one insurance agent. Our insurance agent was horrible; late, made others do work for her, took advantage of people, and took many shady steps to help her get more money."
good,"Company experienced record-breaking growth over several years - company did not adjust infrastructure to handle influx of claims, creating burn-out/no work-life balance."
good,I have been happy working here but need a change. I would like to expand into an underwriting or claims specialist role and since each agency is owned independently that is not an option at this time.
good,Family atmosphere is gone since new leadership. The culture of being a part of the company has changed to just being a number.
good,"If you want a place that requires even a little critical thinking, this isn't it.  They have ""dumbed down"" most of the jobs to where you are following step by step instructions and just reading word tracks.  There is little opportunity to experience any job enrichment.  The best part of the job is the people you work with...there is a sense of camaraderie since you are going through it together.  The hardest part of the job is being constantly treated and talked to like you are stupid."
good,solid job with established rules. Trusted and loved company.Customer service is rather common sense and attention. all is good here.
good,love working for the company compensation is very minimum. I was sold on idea and salary that will not be realistic for years to come
good,asks everything from you and gives nothing in return. refuses to even care about hardship request. claims work/life balance but actions speak louder then words
good,Great learning tools provided each experience is different it's just not for some people ......................its a lot of work
good,"As a front counter help, you often times have tension with cooks. Can be a stressful, drama-filled environment. You feel like you are in high school. Nothing special about benefits. its a fast food restaurant. What would you expect."
good,"This position does not longer exist under the new model."
good,"I realy enjoyed my position and the relationships i was building with my clients. Sadly, the expectations of what the compensation would be and the benfits were not the same as when I took the postion. I was very upset and now I have moved on to higher education in a different field."
good,"Typical day at work is very busy I can answer up to 200 calls a day possibly more. Dealing with upset clients so; I have learned a lot with my self control and patients; also have met some amazing people that I still run into out of the office til this day. Some clients still ask for me from what I am told. "
good,I'm in a call center environment. Its very fast paced. I help agents and agency owner with any business policies. I also am involved in personal development of my oral speaking in Toast Masters. I also conduct status meetings for my team. I assist my team members with questions that they may each day.
good,good place to start if you want a career in the insurance industry. every office is independent so experiences will vary
good,"As an employee of this State Farm office, I enjoyed the daily interaction with customers and explaining their policies and what we could do better for them.  At times it did become about the numbers and that is where I started to lose interest."
good,"From day one, she has accepted every challenge we gave her. She started with three projects and three weeks later (due to a staffing need) we added six more to her plate. Then two months later she was managing the communications and OCM activities on all of her projects. Now she has three more projects on her plate and she just keeps driving. She is tenacious and professional. She gets along with all of her Project Managers and the members of the teams. She is comfortable communicating with Sr. Executives as well as technical system architects. She lives by the motto that she wants to be awesome everyday and help those around her be awesome. She lives this daily. The hardest part of her job is not enough hours in the day. She doesn't know when to stop and just begin  again tomorrow. The most enjoyable part of working with her is her positive attitude."
good,Great Management who invested a lot time in teaching employees how to improve there skill in the work place. Not only for the company but for the team as a whole.
good,"Working for state farm was OK, but really my employer/friend is what made it really pleasant. Fantastic employer to his employees."
good,"If I had the opportunity to go in and interact with my customers and move on it would be ideal but that is not the case.My supervisor is a rarity as far as attitiudes go but effective enough to make you want to look elsewhere. I will say that tenure is valued above all, so the best advice would be to wait it all out keep your mouth closed and you'll be ok."
good,Worked here for about a year. I truly enjoyed the people i worked with despite being micromanaged. It caused a lot of stress and mental anguish on many of the staff. Miss the people but not the work.
good,"The office provided was exceptional with a computer desk, ample storage space for personal belongings, a computer with dual monitors, and telephones in each (8) offices and two conference rooms supplied with large monitors set up for easy viewing. Weekly meeting provided little guidance for how to perform better within the job and would merely be a ""pop-quiz"" of sorts on the clientele and products we offered. I was hired as a receptionist and required to acquire my Property and Casualty insurance license, which cost out of pocket $400. Provided a different head agent, I would have wanted to stay."
good,It was a great opportunity to learn the insurance industry. I enjoyed talking and helping our clientele. I currently work there and I am learning new things everyday
good,"Job is fairly easy. Depends on the type of insurance you are working, ex. auto or fire. Co-workers are good, except for the usual suck-ups. Good luck advancing unless you are one of the chosen by your manager."
good,"State Farm was a family oriented and caring company to work for until approximately 2010.  At that time, after taking some significant financial losses in certain market areas, the company decided to cut all funding for morale boosting activities and celebrations.  The family atmosphere of the company sudden vanished.  All the things that made State Farm different was destroyed and the company adopted inferior business practices of competitors.  Also, the company insists on a terrible 'interview based' promotion matrix that relies on a 'point system' that is completely unfair and biased toward truly talented employees.  State Farm loses a lot of good talent because the company ignores the 'diamonds in the rough'."
good,Very little room for movement within the company.  Pay structure is mediocre.  Health benefits are average and is one of the few companies that offers a pension in conjunction with 401k. Unfortunately 401k match is very small.
good,Poor management as State Farm agents are independent contractors.
good,"Your agent can make or break you. If you have a good one, you may make money and be treated well. If you don't, good luck to you. Each agent is independent and there is no recourse against them."
good,My typical day would consist of a diverse balanced work load.  The break rooms had everything you needed to just relax and be comfortable including a large television screen to view the news.  The co-workers were overall friendly and helped make the day go by faster by conversing.
good,A typical work day consisted of many different things. Answering phones and dealing with customers. I enjoyed working there with my coworkers but i can live without some of the customers who can be very rude when you are trying to help them.
good,"A typical day at work was to greet customers and take in payments. I answered the phones and answered questions to the services that we offered. I set up appointments for new clients and existing clients wanted to review or updating coverage. Assisted Spanish speaking customers. Assisted clients with the claims process. "
good,New department opening up and it is very unorganized. The retention rate is ridiculous.
good,Great people great atmosphere able to learn a lot regarding the sales side of insurance.
good,sales of all property and casualty insurance lines large agency in small town. high pressure sales required on monthly basis
good,"Claims handling and especially estimating are a good fit for me personally. I have always established good rapport, and provided great customer service."
good,"Spent almost 30 years working for State Farm Agents, some good, some great, some less than great. . .pay was fair the farther one got away from the East bay! Same work, less pay for East, East Bay agents. These days it seems to be ALL about sales & less concern about service. . .sadly!!"
good,No real respect for employees that work long hours for the company
good,"Extremely long hours, mamagement oblivious to difficulty for time management given hours on the road. Suggest you request inside and not a field position."
good,"the encouraged culture is a double standard, managers can do as they like without repercussion, if you are different, you are isolated and not allowed to be successful."
good,Supporting the agents and customers with payment options became a number of calls instead of caring what the customer wanted or needed. Management was very poor in supporting our needs as representatives.
good,Not much to say about this place just really stale people to work with and really no fun
good,"Typically came in early and began my job and completed my work daily. Enjoyed close customer contact, and excelled in all aspects of production in the office, expecially in the banking area, for which I was hired. Consistently noted for work ethic, customer service, and production for bank and insurance."
good,Work was not difficult. The clients are nice most of them are happy with their service.
good,"High call volume deatiled oriented, co workers and managers provide awesome teamwork."
good,"Working for an independent State Farm agent has its pros and cons; and it greatly depends on the agent and your relationship with that person. I worked with an agent out of Richmond. He is a very intelligent and knowledgable agent who has a great support staff. The compensation package however, left much to be desired. Meager is an accurate word. Less than $20,000 a year for a full-time position with a nationally known company handling the financial futures of individuals, families, and businesses. No benefits were included. The agent provided periodic learning opportunities, such as CSR mastery conference calls, but these were rare. He spent most of his time out of the office. He travelled frequently. In 2011, he took what amounted to over 2 months of personal vacation time - during which he went on cruises with his family. The only redeeming part of the job is the people you meet and work with. It's insurance, so my clients were an extremely diverse group of people who I sincerely believed gained something out of doing business with me, and vice versa. My advice if you want to work with an independent agent - make sure you understand your arrangement and get it in writing. This agent promised me $50-60k/yr in a sales role; and delivered me a $10/hr account services position."
good,"Without benefits for single owner agents and limited room for growth, it is hard to want to be committed to the workplace. Independent agents can be kind and progressive but the parent company does little to support employees of the agent."
good,State Farm offered a competitive salary and was goal oriented to help you grow within the company. They offered great benefits and understood the importance of work/family balance.
good,"I was hired as the Customer Service Manager, halfway through training I was told, not asked, that I would be joining the sales department because the agent ""didn't have enough time to train two sales people and a customer service manager"", even though he hired these people in these roles? Very unprofessional."
good,Company is well known.  Training provided online.  It's best to have some background in the insurance industry.  Pay and schedule depend on agent you work for.
good,"At one point in my  career, my only focus was being responsible for my own productivity. I enjoyed that because it allowed me to focus on my contribution to the team and to learn about the insurance industry at my own pace. The challenge came when I was moved to the call center environment, 7 1/2 hours of dealing with customer complaints that were out of my control. I would have been fine if it was not all DAY!  If I had not been forced to work in a call center, I would still be with State Farm."
good,I liked working at State Farm however the training process is horrible. My supervisor I worked under wasn’t even knowledgeable about the work my team and I was doing. So going to the supervisor about something you don’t understand was a waste of time.
good,"There's often a lack of guidance which makes success hard to achieve. It takes forever for anything to be fixed through corporate, and frequently I would get conflicting answers from underwriters."
good,"Your experience it's mainly going to depend on your boss or the owner of the agency. Since you are not working for State Farm directly they can create your pay structure if you become an elite sales man you will quickly realize that you are probably being under paid. "
good,"If you are looking to advance be sure to inquire about the incumbency period as they are very vague on response. If another dept. within the company is looking to accept your submission, mang. is good about with-holding information from you. If looking to promote ""Its who you know"" not how well you do."
good,"As a member of management, our motto was “faster better cheaper” and “doing more with less”. The culture at State Farm has increasingly gotten poorer and poorer throughout the years. It’s truly all about the numbers. Poor work life balance in some areas, yet other areas people have all the free time in the world. I’ve been on both sides of that. Upper management has absolutely no idea who does what. They will hound a paraprofessional employee over not achieving 100% productivity, yet there are high paid analysts that shoot the breeze with their peers half of the workday."
good,"Fast pace world in resolving complex accounts. Definitely assisted in enhancing my multitasking skills, organization and work ethics. Built great friendships along the way."
good,"Great company to work for when I first started but after they made all the structural changes, the emphasis began to focus on productivity more than the customer experience which caused a lot of stress on employees. Overall I think it's a great place to start if you aren't working or don't know where you want to go professionally. Some people love it, others don't. I appreciated them for giving me an opportunity. I learned a lot about the insurance and professional."
good,company is trying to change with the times and workforce is experiencing growth challenges.  Very unstable work force stability and high stress levels.
good,"Agent autonomy is the biggest issue I saw in my 18 months with SF. If you get a bad agent or an agent that clashes with any number of personal factors, you lose."
good,"As stated, this is a very professional and somewhat relaxed enviorment to work in. Food and beverage avail. Management can be inconsistent at times but direct."
good,I learned how an insurance company works. The culture is quiet and very corporate feeling. Very strict metrics to meet. Health insurance cost a lot I spend about 400 dollars a month. I am looking for a different atmosphere to work in that's a little more relaxed.
good,"During on-boarding and training I remained really excited to work for state farm however after being assigned my manager things went down hill. I was receiving a lot of concern with how many times i was using my pto. I could see if i had been falling behind in training or if was already on the floor and my absence was causing a direct issue with my coworkers but that was not the case. "
good,State Farm was a really good place to learn how to work under pressure and how to deal with upset customers. I feel like they should take more than just 1 and a half day to train new employees at their call centers
good,"Job experience depends on the agent you work for.  Lots of cold calling and emails as well. Each agent runs its own agency, as a team member you work for them NOT State Farm."
good,"While this job was a great learning experience, it had no opportunity for growth or advancement. If you can work hard and are determined you will do great!"
good,"Call center environment, you will be assessed on your ability to meet 5 core metrics. Little work life balance, decent compensation but not an industry leader, appropriate benefits."
good,"State Farm in general is a great company.  However, micro management, insecure co workers and lack of Agency owners presence leaves open opportunity for click bullying within the organization."
good,"2.5 stars. I don’t agree with the systems put in place and I consider myself extremely customer service oriented. My manager had given me poor feedback and then lied about it. The attendance policy is complicated to say the least and promotes poor working habits as well as a strict micromanaging working environment. It might work for some but definitely not my cup of tea. I am a team player and want all to succeed, however I work well with coming up with efficiency upgrades and promote going the extra mile for the customer from beginning to end.  SF has a “not my job” attitude and you can get in trouble for helping a customer a claim which is “out of your scope of handling” even if you were trained in how to handle it. The metrics for deciding how you get promoted is based on numbers and length of calls instead of customer satisfaction"
good,"It really boils down to the team/manager your assigned to"
good,"State Farm used to be a GREAT company to work for, that's no longer the case. Focus on productivity has pushed too many seasoned, well trained employees out. Newer, younger workforce is only there until next best thing comes along. Workload is too heavy but they're stingy w/OT. Work/Life balance is a joke & a lie."
good,"Good place to learn entry level skills, you start as a receptionist if no sales skills. However, the sales and cold calling are very stressful. its not something I was comfortable with."
good,I had no intention to leave this job but they lied about the job position... Supervisors had there favorites...overall the job was good but they need to change some of the management
good,"Answered phones, directed calls, helped with insurance questions. Accepted payments on policies, made deposits, typed letters , made cold-calls, mailed out customer notices."
good,"Towards the end of my career with State Farm, it was clear that the company was no longer invested in the lives and well being of their employees. The changes being made were not in the best interest of the employees or the customers."
good,If you getting cussed and put down if you are not good enough or not a kiss up then this is the job for you. The pay is decent but no benefits. 401k promised was never received.
good,"Great benefits, pay, and location but the management was so bad that I had to leave. Contacted HR a couple of times but they didn't help either. A co-worker of mine, who helped me alot more than my own manager, worked for statefarm for over 15 years (agency and call center combined) had to quit as well due to poor management. It is sad that this company has so much potential but due to poor management alot of people are leaving."
good,"It's an okay place to work if you're just looking to go in and do your job and go home.  Sales Leaders range from the nicest people in the world to complete jerks. You could be busy all day or you could just spend your entire day twiddling your thumbs, it all depends on who you're supporting.  Salary is somewhat low for similar positions.  You'd be supporting at least three sales leaders as best as you can remotely.  That means chasing down a lot of people who give you half answers to important questions and getting your phone calls screened."
good,You could have a great agent or a poor agent. This is mostly commission/sales based when in office.  Requirements have to be made and location is a key.  Not for the faint of heart by any means.
good,"Great place to work temp. while in school or have little children. "
good,"girls in office didn't want any masculine interference"
good,"I have been working there only for a brief time. From my experience, I felt this is a very professional place to work, however it can be stressful due to high volume of phone calls and bad attitude customers. The salary and benefit can not support one self to live in the Bay Area."
good,"The culture used to be better until the new model, when their obsession with metrics got out of hand and they are basically shutting down my office, which is now a ghost town."
good,"Good company, but I have already wasted enough time working for them to put more thought into this review."
good,Long hours and not much pay in an agent's office unless you are the agency owner. Some agent's won't take no for an answer and you feel like you're badgering people that will never buy anything and wasting your time because the agent needs the sale.
good,"Although, each agent is different at State Farm, my agent paid the employees very little, especially in comparison for the cost of living in San Francisco.  She was nice, but there was tension in the office and alot of office politics. Passive aggression was something that i experienced everyday through my co-workers. When I first took the job, the agent told me that the team was like a family. I came to find out that everyone was only out for their own interests, and were quick to throw people under the bus in order to look better in the eyes of the agent. After my experience, I would not recommend State Farm to anyone."
good,"Working for State Farm claims is the most miserable I have ever been in my life. Other claims segments have done away with the attendance points, however Express has not. The point system makes it difficult for someone with kids or who is easily sick to call in. The employee morale is at rock bottom and it’s very apparent you can be replaced."
good,"Was told id be able to take a test to become an insurance broker, then they told me they couldnt afford another broker, so they kept me part-time. I was unable to receive benefits or paid time off and felt the need to leave because there was no ability to advance or move up in the company. Over all it was a very boring and dry place to work, the location was the only good thing about that job."
good,"I really enjoyed working for State Farm up unitl they closed down my building. They through my office into chaos and didn't do anything to help remedy the problem. State Farm will close any locations that aren't in Tempe, Atlanta, Dallas, and Bloomington. When they announced our closure it took months to find out any details and then we were told we had to reapply for our positions and there weren't enough openings for employees. I will never work for this company again."
good,State Farm is undertaking dramatic changes and reducing its workforce. These changes took its entire workforce by surprise due to lack of communication from the CEO. It will take the company some time to rebuild employee relations and reestablish culture.  Work/life balance allowed varies by location and department - experience can be positive or extremely negative.
good,"In order to meet quotas, the owner requested and sometimes demanded that the sales agents perform unethical practices, which drove me out of the company."
good,"I have worked with various State Farm agents since 2003.  There is a definite ceiling.  You can be the best customer care person on planet earth and still end up on the bottom.  I believe in the product and I care about the customers...but I have become very dissatisfied with the middle men, so to speak."
good,Weekends are required and that is the stressful part of the job when trying to balance family and work.  Hard to move up in the company even when your work experience outweighs the degree of some managers.
good,"I have nothing to say. Its a fast past environment. You will learn insurance policy, how to apply policy, communicate with diverse customers, team work."
good,Didn't have enough reps to cover the que. Extremely overworked and with very strict and regulated breaks. Great for advancement but only once you exit out of the CRC department which tends to be the trend.
good,Last 5 years were difficult. Numbers opposed to service. Company ethics and employee morale have depleted significantly. No longer a top company to work for.
good,"My experience, I hope, is not typical.  I worked in the office of a retirement-aged agent.  His motivation was minimal and he catered to the clients best positioned to fund his retirement.  I found him disengaging and I disagreed with his approach."
good,"I absolutely loved this company when I started. The culture was laid back and comfortable. We have good benefits and a flexible schedule in the Customer Care Center. Over time they have implemented a lot of new changes with little to no raise AND they took away all of our morale incentives. No more rewards for exceeding goals, new stricter policies, and uncaring management practices. The morale is at an all time low. The rest of the company has a different set of rules so I get better feedback from those departments ,but we are one of the lowest paid insurance companies in the area."
good,"You can only cold market in the city the agency is located in, you cant market on social media or in other cities. No health plan offered, but th owner will sell you a health policy"
good,"The agent's office I worked for was fairly new when I started working for her. It was a slow paced environment and she was rarely ever there. A lot of the customers searched for quality relationships with their agents. Typical day at work included servicing policies on a daily basis, calling customers to remind them of their payments, cold calling prospect clients, quote walk-ins as well as people over the phone."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time with State Farm.  The work was fast paced and complex.  Opportunities for development were readily available.  "
good,"They have have cut efficient teams to save money and overloaded them. The salary structure (Systems department) is rigged so that it is difficult to even keep up with inflation. It used to be like a family, now few people care about anything but surviving. This is all since the new CEO took over."
good,"This was my 1st job in sales so I really wasn't sure on what to expect. My manager was great as well as my co workers. I didn't have benefits and was expected to show up to events during the weekend and before/after work. My hours were 9-6 which was really hard for me. I felt as if I didn't have time to do anything. I was also asked to purchase life policies for 10 of my family members to help increase sales which I could not do so my manager ended up paying for. My manager would add the amount of policies in my check as a bonus which screwed me over in the end.  What I hated the most about this job was the cold calling! We had goals to meet each day and one of those goals was to make 150 cold calls a day!! It was too slow paced for me. It was a new office so there wasn't much business yet. I would make over 250 calls a day, answered phone calls and  met with existing customers and i would STILL have about 5 hours of having to find something to do... I would then print different list but that didn't help much either. Overall, this job may be for someone but it was not for me and leaving was one of the best decisions I've made."
good,"What a wonderful company in terms of pay and benefits. Truly you are well compensated in the industry. Sadly, the company now sees its employees as adversaries and no longer part of the larger company solution."
good,"State Farm has a long history of being very sound financially and maintaining a vast reserve to handle extremely large catastrophic events in the insurance industry.  Technology development and adoption were neglected many years, and are now a foremost concern.  The major constraints that this company faces are contractual limitations imposed by the independent contractor agents and the several and varied legal and risk concerns due to the large exposure and state to state discrepancies."
good,Job security hinges on metrics and adherence. Job Development is stagnant. Not much opportunity to branch out from the call center or to pursue other job opportunities at this time.
good,"The company makes sure you know you are the lucky one to be working there, and you are continuously reminded, rather than appreciating the work you do. They focus completely on how many seconds or minutes the phone call was rather than giving great customer service."
good,"SF was a competitive, fast paced atmosphere but it did not allow me to gain revenue residual like most insurance companies offer their employees. I worked for a scratch agent that could not afford to pay more although I was the top salesman for 4 months."
good,"The job is glamorized as ""bigger"" than a call center... but it's not. Burn out is super high. Every minute out of your chair or into your breaks (even if you're working) counts against you. No flexibility on attendance policy. Managers are almost never around anymore... they're always in ""training"". The disorganization is clearly obvious to customers as insureds are leaving State Farm in droves. It's a standard call center with management that normally don't have the answers themselves. This place is so good at referring you to others that you'll run in circles 8 times looking for the same answer. Because no one knows what's up."
good,It started as a great company to work for until the claims department focus became all about metrics and getting off the “list” of the week. This new focus made it very stressful to perform the job and difficult to provide quality customer service. It became all about impressing upper management or consultants vs the customers we serve. The response was get it done while we also reduce and eventually eliminate overtime. The morale declined as employees began to quit weekly and their inventories were dumped on existing employees as if we were not already overwhelmed with pending claims.
good,"Statefarm switched to pooled PTO instead of separate vacation, sick and personal days. This was a horrible thing as employees lost time. They also implement ""T2"" and badging in and out for professional employees."
good,"If you want to get your foot in the door in the insurance industry this is a good place to start, dont expect to move up in the company this place has good benefits but they could pay you more for what you do, I started as an underwriting service assistant they cross trained me for 1 year but did not increase my salary based on my duties. When you do apply you have to notify your supervisor and they are the deciding factor in your advancement meaning if you are not a supervisor favorite more than likely you wont get to advance. The management here is terrible they are unprofessional and child like. get your experience and find a better job."
good,This is a large stable company with a definite top down management style. Just do the work and keep your head down. The pay and benefits are still good relative to the current job market but not as good as it once was.
good,"I choose not to compile a review at this time, except to say, set a goal and achieve it. The rest is just to fill required character space for this section."
good,"A typical day at State Farm consisted of getting my daily meetings and reply back to any emails that need to  be scheduled"
good,There was no accountability for our office manager and she was in charge of days off and dispersing leads. It caused a lot of mistrust among the other employees
good,"Culture has changed since I started to work here. Lots of people being laid off. Even if you participate in tuition reimbursement program, they rather hire people outside of the company, rather than people already working for the company."
good,"Co-workers were great, good work-life balance for non-sales staff."
good,i loved the job but the management in that office was not a good fit for me. I made a decision to leave his office but i would work for a different agent
good,"According to all the old timers, State Farm used to be a great workplace.  At the moment, it does not matter how well you perform at your current job, you need to get a designation and know people in the department where you want to work in order to move anywhere in the company.  Most of the supervisors are not helpful in giving their employees a chance to advance when those employees are making the supervisors look good."
good,"Your experience will depend 100% on the agent you work with. The office I was with started of really well. Positive team and good perks. As the years went on the agent and office manager (married couple)  were out of the office more and more on personal holidays/business and expected you to fully run and manage their business with very little support. Concerns that were voiced were ignored leaving you feeling unappreciated. The benefits provided were average.  It is a very independent job so you have to manage your work load effectively, especially the sales end of things. Its very easy to get overwhelmed with the small things. The biggest thing I learned- If the agent decides they don't like you or you aren't preforming, they just fire you and move to the next person. You are very replaceable."
good,"A typical day involves mostly taking claim calls, sometimes your schedule will change at a moments notice, so they want you to refresh your schedule after every call. Most of the co-workers are very helpful, most of the managers are a joke. Your weekly meetings with them are among the other people that sit around the managers' cubicle with no privacy so if coworkers are not on the phone, they hear everything that is being said, whether it's personal or not. Managers are not really there when you need them and you can forget escalated calls, they avoid those like the plague. And management has a culture of making excuses for each other, which is very disheartening because you basically have no one that you can talk to. Sometimes the managers make you feel like you are just a number. And the only way to get ahead is to do some serious brown nosing. The dress code is very laid back which is a plus. The salary is ok, but I know of several people that have left the company to go to other insurance companies where they work less but are paid more. But when we ask about raises, they say they have highest pay rates, which can also be disputed by easily looking on indeed or glassdoor. The hardest part of the job is feeling like you cant get help when you need it and if you go to10 managers with a question, you will get 10 different answers but the most enjoyable part is being able to help people that really need it."
good,The reason I left was more me than the job. My boss was really cool and very driven. it was sometimes stressful but not often. I wasn't fond of cold calling leads. It was my least favorite thing.
good,"If you are good at finding your own leads and cold calling this is a good fit for you, otherwise you spend a lot of time collecting payments.  Not a lot of lead support."
good,"Working with the crew we had was awesome, working with the company itself was very hard to reach them and hard to get answers right away. but we did learn how to talk to clients and up our customer service skills"
good,"State Farm is struggling to find itself in this new technically savvy, instant gratification world. Hence, they're making a lot of changes, quickly, which isn't something they have done before. Unfortunately, it's very trial and error, so mistakes are being made. But considering they're a legacy company, it should be expected that turning the Titanic quickly doesn't happen easily or without problems."
good,My time with State Farm was short. I enjoyed my position very much but the owner/agent chose to go a different route so my position was terminated. It was rewarding get the clients the coverage they needed for life's unexpected mishaps.
good,I work with people who have been in auto accidents and most have never been in one before.  I have worked with several people who enjoy what they do.  The hardest part is knowing your job is moving out of state.
good,All around this was a great experience. I learned a lot about claims and policies. The hardest part of this job was the consistent changes on a daily basis and the extremely insane way they micromanaged their employees. Work culture was GREAT! The best part of this job was helping people.
good,"Typical Day: "
good,The job itself wasn't so bad but it can get a bit repetitive after some time. The job does have various numbers you must hit each week which is visible to all your peers. Everything you do can be tracked so no messing around.
good,"Company is moving most jobs to southern states. Many changes so morale is very low. Most have to work overtime to keep up with work load. Hard to get days off with low tenure. If willing to relocate, you have a higher chance of advancement."
good,"10 years ago it was more of a ""family"" environment that valued the employees. Recently it has become more of a numbers over quality environment. A typical day at work became clock in sit at your desk, head down, & work without socialization. Management is friendly enough if you get a supervisor who values their employees. The hardest part of the job wasn't the work but the environment as it was very low morale. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the times you could solve a problem for the customer."
good,"Helping customers in times of distress by starting the claim process and answering any questions.  Providing rental options, car repairs, towing services if needed."
good,This is a workplace that can have many highs and lows throughout the day.  You have the opportunity to help customers through tough times but also work with difficult situations as they arise.  Advancement opportunities are few and far between and extremely competitive.  The initial training is absolutely the best.  Management varies extremely from manager to manager.
good,The company pushed a culture of telling on co-workers for the smallest of things.  Politics was awful.  All the people that I know that still work there can't wait to retire.
good,"Mandatory OT for months on end. "
good,State Farm offers no benefits. The pay is mediocre at best. Unless you are the agent don't expect to make very much and be pushed hard to sell everyday.
good,The internship was an original creation due to the office being small and in a small town. Called customers daily and attempted to give customer support in any way.
good,You must be someone who can handle constant change.  A easy going and flexible person is the best fit.  Most of the claims adjuster positions aren't flexible enough to be family friendly or balanced.
good,"Working for this company is ok, if you're able to get into the groove with an autopilot work ethic. Doing something different isn't always going to emerge. This applies to non-claims related positions."
good,"the place is very stressful.  "
good,"Decent pay but cost of living for surrounding areas is VERY HIGH so it kind of takes away from the compensation benefit"
good,"Good company overall, worst part is attendance points policy. The attendance policy is very strict and showcases the company places more value on its customer service than of its employees."
good,"I learn alot working here, however the environment is cutthroat and the pay is minimal. Also they demand alot of their workers and only reward the ones they like."
good,Giving quotes visiting different dealerships and businesses.  Customer service explaining overages of the different polices and what it means to the customers.
good,"A typical day at work can be stressful. Employees are encouraged to seek advancement after a year of employment. Most take that opportunity to get away from the phones, others quit before the year is over."
good,"to much work not enough time with family "
good,"Company claims process makes it near impossible to provide quality service to customers. Work/life balance is tough. "
good,"Some days are slower paced than others. Usually Monday's and Fridays are busiest. The small town hinders commission opportunities. There are no benefits as far as healthcare, dental or vision while working for an Agent. It provides a good feeling when you see that a policy you helped sell helps the customer in their time of need. The hardest part of the job is explaining rate increases and why premiums go up and that we as representatives have no say so in the matter."
good,No longer is there the respect for length of service/dedication/experience - The whole way of doing business has changed - In order to stay in business - one must make changes to remain profitable but disappointed to see the very drastic changes that took place that has affected many employees very quickly
good,"Work is great if you like to help people out. Most customers do not understand insurance and your expertise is needed. There will always be a handful of customers who are irate, but the majority are pleasant to work with. "
good,"My pay and benefits were unmatched but the treatment of employees from Corporate and the company's prioritize affected my physical and mental health, as well as that of many other employees."
good,"Like most insurance companies, you have your corporate branch and then you have agencies. State Farm corporate is just like any other major company. But working for an agent is less glamorous. The pay is very little and they very seldom offer benefits or true vacation time."
good,Great coworkers company security not there with loyalty to those that worked so hard to make what they are today as they claim they needed to restructure after long time due.  However have done numerous times and at the risk of overworking current employees staying and not what best for overall structure of company and service to customers
good,"As long as you do EXACATLY what is demanded of you by the company you'll be fine. They own the book, they own your money. You will lose your support from the company if you don't spend the money they ask, and where they ask you to spend it."
good,"Selling insurance can be a challenge and will definitely have its ups and down. If you learn how to let stuff roll off your shoulders and keep a good attitude you will be fine. There are days where you will  make tons of sales and feel on top of the world. Other days you will feel like you wasted your whole day but, its part of the business. Just take it for what it is and enjoy the ride!"
good,"This was a great opportunity, but I did not trust the management nor did I like their customer service. There were questionable action that I did not agree with."
good,It's not particularly interesting. Management doesn't care to hear feedback or incorporate improvements suggested by individual contributors. Everyone is essentially ranked the same making the extra effort to try to get a higher ranking a very poor return on investment of time.
good,"In the years since I was first employed, there has been an increased focus on metrics.  While I completely understand the value in measuring and encouraging increased productivity, the company has stopped valuing individuals for their unique aptitudes and individuality and only sees each person as number.  I thoroughly enjoy my job but all flexibility and personalization has been removed the workplace.  Lower management recognizes these issues and tries to be accomodating but often have their hands tied by upper management decisions."
good,"It really depends on your agent. It's great to gain the experience as an small business owner, but the pay is a bit frustrating for the amount of work you put in. No benefits either which is a downside."
good,Typical work day was relaxed and inviting. No room for advancement or increase in pay. Particular agency lacked management style and involvement with staff.
good,big corp it is what you expect from any big corporation care about the bottom dollar employees come and go like any other company state they care but they don't
good,"This company is going through significant change with respect to office locations, employee performance measurements and corporation culture. Due to this changes I would prefer not to get into specifics."
good,"I honestly don't have anything good or bad to say abot the company.  If you are looking for a career in insurance, this is a good place to start......"
good,"Overall a good Company, but Poor commission payouts. They aren't as great as they initially made it seem. There was also no benefits available as an employee such as Health Insurance or a 401K plan. You are expected to stay late and since this was a salary position I was  not compensated for the extra time spent at the office."
good,"overall just not the company for me "
good,I can only speak about claims specifically. The key is to do it as long as you can before you get fired. The job itself is extremely exhausting and the demand for overtime is rampant as turnover is extremely high.
good,State Farm is a great company but recently they increased their rates making it more difficult for newly licensed agents to reach sales goals.
good,"The wages are so low, that the company hides the market based (Cost of living/Inflation) increases in the annual performance increase.  So, if you have an average to above average performer and they receive a 3% annual increase, but the base level for the role is 3% lower than your current rate all you get is brought even to the new base and your performance increase is negated, makes you feel really proud of what you do - NOT!"
good,"Use an Enterprise Claims System to work claims, either in an individual or team environment. Daily assigned schedule. Micro-management. Standard claim practices to follow. Minimal training. Bottom-dollar centric. No work/life balance."
good,Management here is unrealistic and does not adapt or listen to employees or customers.  Good money and benefits but employees are asked to make too many sacrifices.
good,"If you're in claims your job comes before family, the hours do not support the work/life balance they claim they care about.  They are starting to treat us like we work at the local mall, and the pay the lowest out of all insurance companies in the area to do the same job."
good,"Good for a temporary part time job. "
good,"•Actively sell insurance policies to potential clients."
good,A typical day at work consists of assisting customers who call in with filing an auto or fire claim. This can be stressful sometimes because you do have fatalities that have occurred. The work environment is relaxed and co-workers are a joy to work with as well. The pay could be better considering how much detail and time we put into processing the claims.
good,"Don't get me wrong State Farm is a great company to work for...but I think it depends on the location. The benefits are by far, one of the best in the industry, but the pay is exceptionally low. Even with the salary adjustments given in 2015, which were suppose to match other industry markets, the pay is still shamefully low for an industry that generates billions of dollars. Today, living in Atlanta is almost like living in one of the major big cities , the rent is at an all time high, so when your working at a job where your probably bringing home less than 2000 a month, you'd except the work environment, especially Management to be professional and not so messy. (I'm sorry, but some of them are). When I worked for State Farm, what I got from Management were two things: If your a person who likes to come to work and do your job and not get involved with the politics, you will not make it at SF. At first I thought it was just me, but after looking at some of the other reviews and other people experienced the same thing...everybody can't be lying. Some, not all management is surprisingly unprofessional and if your not one to really talk or get into all the nonsense...you will be looked upon as an outcast and they are not going to like you and it will show.  I was in a team meeting with one Manager and she basically said that if you don't come to work and socialize, speak to others, it would effect your bonus. In other words, if your quiet and mind your business, you won't make it and from reading and speaking to others outside of SF, this is their culture. Some of the managers"
good,Self starter environment with limited supervision. I have encompassed a high level of problem solving skills and an increased ability to adapt to changes on a consistent bases.
good,State Farm is a great company but they do not treat their agents great.  Pay scale is very low and really hard to make a decent living if you are supporting a family.  No benefits unless you buy them for yourself. Stable hours usually working 8-5 or 9-5 with weekends off.
good,"State Farm is a good company however with the changes they are making and some of the old management stuck in their old ways, makes it hard to be innovative and also perform at high levels"
good,I work in the underwriting team. The employees I think are like robots. There is no interaction and this makes the workplace not fun. Very slow to increase pay. Good training. Training was the only fun part of it. The new building is nice and modern and has many restaurants on the first floor.
good,I got into this field because it seems like it has opportunity for growth. The insurance field is not one that is going away anytime soon and that presents a need for employees.
good,"A typical day at work is assisting our clients with questions on their policies, servicing them in whatever capacity they need. Main role and objective assisting Agent and team members with daily calendar management and anything else they need support in."
good,"Mainly completed towing claims, banking deposits, filing, data entry, scheduling for the agency manager, marketing prospective clientele. I worked for the agency as a part-time employee until the agency was sold and they needed a full-time position filled. At that time in my life I was not able to work full-time."
good,"Small office with 3 employees.  A good mix of phone and in person interaction.  Great co-workers, customer service always a priority."
good,"Excellent work, life balance work place but they do not pay for experience.  Little chance for advancement and they fostered an environment of you should feel lucky to have a job."
good,"Stressful place to work.  It is all about the numbers and nothing about customer service or how you personally grow and develop.  Some people spend all day on the phones and others will do nothing but tasks.  Every day starts with looking at your numbers from the previous day and that pretty much tells you how today will be.  They continually add more work to your day, but the pay does not increase with the expectations.  You are told when you take a break, lunch and if you have a phone call or claim that keeps you from going to your next assigned task it will take you out of adherence for the day and if that happens too many times you get written up."
good,"This is an ideal job for a a brand new hire or recent college graduate ."
good,"The opportunity to advancement is there but unfortunately very difficult to get a chance for that opportunity.  The customer service is great, the company really strives for customer service and quality."
good,"A good place to be introduced to the insurance industry and also, enjoy working with my co-workers and the current hours of operation."
good,"Have to make 200 cold calls a day. The commissions structure is not meant to help you make money. I did love my co workers though, just not they money they promised we would make."
good,"Company is undergoing change that is demoralizing as it used to be like ""family"" atmosphere but not any more.  Competitive pressures are forcing the company to be  profit oriented at the expense of the employee."
good,Answer phones provide customer's with quotes and policy information training to be certiifed in State farm stocks and bonds and banking info
good,I love my job and the people I work with! The agent that I work for is great! I have been with this company for over 2 years. Working in an Agent's office is not the same as working for State Farm .
good,"A typical day at work is answering calls from policyholders with questions regarding policy and/or premium. I also quote potential customers that call in or stop in that are my part of the alphabet. I reach out to people that have received quotes from our office in the past to see if we can requote them at this time. "
good,"A typical day starts and ends with cold calling for new business. I enjoy Insurance sales and see myself exceeding in this industry, I am just looking for a more stable and structured enviroment. Needing a balanced salary with benefits. I am very happy with the commission scale that my employer offers, but my pay is not consistant, naturally. I need a set pay with benefits and an option for bonuses rather than solely relying on commission. And the potential sales are somewhat out of my control based on numerous factors. So I am really looking for constistant stability. "
good,"The position can be quite demanding and stressful at time, the most difficult part of my position is the difficult conversations I am required to have from time to time. My management team has been great to work for. Corporate change is affecting many positions at this time."
good,"State Farm is a great insurance company, but very conservative.  Great place to get into the business.  Will teach you a lot in a short period of time."
good,Room for growth within the company; Worked for three different departments while working at the store location. Enjoyed working for member services; Had to leave company due to lack of hours
good,"•	Elevate client relations by establishing credibility, discerning needs, and providing appropriate coverage recommendations. "
good,"Great pay, say starts with a team huddle followed by reviewing of sales goal prior day and same date of.No good work life balance over worked with no apprecation."
good,"Not exactly what i wanted to do right out of college. A typical day at work is very repetitive. Same stuff everyday, They say you're going to be trained more on the 100+ lines of different products but pretty much have just learned three different work types and have been cranking them out because it is a production environment. The production environment can be overwhelming sometimes and also make you feel like everything you are told contradicts each other. They say they aim for quality but the quality process has been all over the boards for about a year now and has not been consistent. They are moving towards an ""enterprise"" format but State Farm has an old saying that, ""it takes a long time to turn this big ship."" With the company being 90 years old, they do have some time to get up to date on their processes. However, job security is a huge plus."
good,"State Farm has never had a lay-off and has a great amount of very seasoned employees.  There is a lot of pride in working for such a long standing strong company.  However, the company has gone through restructuring and many of the changes are creating a new company feel."
good,"Call Center environment"
good,"State Farm was a fun place to work. The synergy between the employees was great. It was a fast paced environment for the most part. I was able to meet a lot of people, and work with many of them one on one. Helping comfort them about their insurance. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers that wanted something I could not do for them. The best part of the job was being able to build great relationships/friendships with my customers."
good,"This was a  part time temporary position through a staffing agency with no promise to hire. Through this job opportunity  I became more knowledgeable about the claims process."
good,"My review is very simple sales, is very competitive and hard work."
good,State Farm is a great company to work for especially when trained properly.
good,A typical day at work is spent on a computer in a cubicle-type environment processing automobile policy changes.
good,Although it can be very laid back on a day to day basis the goals for each employee were set too high.  Not only was it almost impossible to meet those goals but when you did the pay was not that great.
good,"I wanted to try something by switching to State Farm because I knew some people there but i did not like the kind of job that we had to do. I love technology like video games, computers etc. and that was not doing it for me."
good,"Good work environment. They have high expectations to meet sales numbers. Those that don't can expect constant coaching. Misleading  communication on the hours that would be worked. Applied for 30 hour week and was told I would be working 24 hours. My disability was not address for 7 months while performance suffered, The call center is very noisy and its hard to concentrate."
good,"I understood that this would be a typical insurance residual compensation arrangement.  Unfortunately our agent is brand new to State Farm and did not understand the compensation arrangement himself.  It appears that State farm pays once and done on all products sold.  I had been an independent agent for a number of years and expected to be in a position to build a career and not just a job, therefore I am looking for the right opportunity to move on,"
good,"Customer Service"
good,"- cold calling, calling on referrals, outside marketing/local outreach, cross-selling, multi-lining/pivoting to existing customers within existing book of business"
good,"Login at workstation and login phone and proceed to take in calls and handle claims Inbound/outbound calls to customers, agents, repair facilities. Investigate, evaluate, negotiate coverage liability of insurance claims"
good,"I love my co-workers and enjoy people all together. The best part of my day is when I can resolve a claim in a timely manner and hear a customer say ""I thought I would never get that deductible back""."
good,I had 15 agents assigned to me that I would call for.  Each month they would upload a lead list of their current customers and I would call them to try to set a review for them.  I learned that once I master what I am supposed to do I would like to have more responsibilities and tasks so I can grow and advance within the company.  Unfortunately the management there was not the best for a call center.  Alot of my co-workers did the bare-minimum which in turn made me look better to my supervisor.  The hardest part about the job was that it was so extremely easy and became very monotonous.  The best part about the job is that I was 1 of the top performers.
good,"Overall the experience is ok, it provides some security with an average pay check. The thing to keep in mind is that being Agent Staff, you are NOT a State Farm employee. So, you don't get the benefits package as if you were working for corporate, also you're expected to run the office while the Agent plays. So, it's a coin flip."
good,"arrived at work, check e-mail, and messages. Checked phone messages pending, Returned calls from clients. Processed any applications not completed. Co workers were not friendly hard to deal with. Most enjoyable was helping clients with their problems and concerns. Learned all regulations regarding auto, home insurance and how mto handles claims"
good,"As my first sales job working with insurance, I was first introduced the customer service side and was blown away on the training process and how well it geared its employees to treat customers. I took immense pride in working for State Farm, both in California and Michigan."
good,Enjoyed working with coworkers and some of the bosses I had. No chance for advancement.
good,"Many daily service duties, filing auto or home claims, inbound and outbound phones, faxing, filing, checking and replying to many e-mails, greeting people and helping with any questions or concerns. I learned a great amount of information in relation to auto, home, health and life insurance. Management is not picked wisely, it appears that it is whoever is next in line with the time. The hardest part of the job is to pick up the pieces from someone else's doing when it comes to the insured's. I really enjoy a fast paced work environment, working with the public and problem solving."
good,"Did not work directly for State Farm, the independent agent office was fast paced."
good,"As a college student, I was able to work in the sports dept and gained valuable knowledge about how a paper is produced as well as an opportunity to get a couple bylines."
good,Small office environment that provided flexibility; very responsible management to the customers
good,"It varies depending on what agency you work at. Be very careful when deciding to work with a state farm agent, as they can effect the next job you go to by looking up your new agency and emailing your new employer. State Farm agents sign contracts saying that they wont take another agents team members. so if you accept a job and find out you do not like the place your working at or the people you work with and want to go work at another state farm office. First you have to quit your current job before another one will interview you and even after that. Your former employer can still call your new one and tell them all kinds of horrible things, that you never even did and cost you your new job, so be warned. Overall I would avoid new agents as they do not like buying quality leads or paying a competitive wage."
good,it was a good experience. my boss was very nice. coworkers were great. hardest part was cold calling.
good,"This was for an agent and not the company. My day consisted of reviewing the daily call list to call and remind people of their payments. Calling leads that we got, and setting up appointments to discuss their insurance options. I really enjoyed talking about insurance, a lot. I did not like that the agent wanted me to tell people that she was not in the office and she was. I did not like have to try and pressure someone into buying a policy just to get the policy count. I enjoyed the consultative side that allowed me to let people know how they were covered and what their policy actually meant. My co-workers were fine, and we laughed some, but was not as positive as it could have been."
good,There are pros and cons to working at such a large company just have to find the balance and make the most of your opportunities when they come along.
good,High volume environment; unfortunately no customer interaction; coworkers are great; learned how to handle the difficult customer and how to provide quality customer service regardless of the circumstances
good,Walking into this role I did not realize how challenging it would actually be when I initially interviewed. Being on 100% commission was rough and in the economy we were in made it almost near impossible to make money. I did not like the feeling that we were like a snake in the grass waiting to strike and putting pressure on potiental clients that was not needed.
good,"I started out loving my job and where I worked!  After a short time I was ready to advance to another position.  The company took a stance to ""freeze"" all employees from moving up.  This continued for over a year. When they finally lifted the freeze they took a different approach.  Instead they would take more than 3 months to release you to your new department if you were selected...the new department would always retract their offer as they needed personnel now.  So it was the same thing as a freeze but the company could deny it.   Any company that does things like that to their own employees, I have a hard time standing behind.  "
good,Everything was about how many deals you closed. It didn't matter how much you closed last month it was always about the next deal. Never felt appreciated
good,It’s a good company to start off but if you are looking to grow then this is not the place to be. The overall benefits is good and they have a pension plan as well as 401k.
good,"Place was okay to work for, not really any room for advancement. Compensation seems okay before you start factoring in the fact that you are paying for your own insurance."
good,"truth be told, the benefits aren't bad, the schedule is semi flexible, the hours aren't bad. your experience depends entirely on your supervisor. some are super awesome and understanding and want their teams to achieve and thrive but then you have other supervisors who just have something to prove. its like this with any corporate job. you do however have opportunities to move up and into different departments."
good,"Previous experience helped a lot to settle at SF.  Learned other stuff and company portals. "
good,"I loved working at state farm, i relocated to phoenix and helped start up the hub location, i moved back to missouri and the office there had become more structured toward meeting numbers, quality was not as important as getting your metrics met. They changed alot of their policies and pushed alot of great experienced workers back out into the workforce. If you are in a hub location the environment is great, if you are in an office that is not a hub, its rows and rows of empty cubicles and lots of unhappy people."
good,"Do better State Farm. Poorly ran department. Supervisors are LAZY & do whatever they want and try to intimidate you. Whole department needs to be revamped & on that note I really hope the corporate SF in Bloomington, IL doesn’t know what’s going on because if they do and have done nothing about it considering they care “so much” their employee then SF has bigger problems than I thought!"
good,I liked working at State Farm until I got into Homeowners claims. I don't recommend that dept. It was a dumpster fire. I liked that they had a pension.
good,"The State Farm mission is to help people manage the risks of everyday life, recover from the unexpected, and realize their dreams. We are people who make it our business to be like a good neighbor; who built a premier company by selling and keeping promises through our marketing partnership;who bring diverse talents and experiences to our work of serving the State Farm customer."
good,It is hard to earn a livable commission with State Farms pricing.  Expected to cold call 50 - 75 times daily.   High turnover due to the difficulty in earning commissions.
good,"Management- solid okay "
good,"Overall, State Farm is a good company to work for and has good benefits. Staff members works hard and work well as a team. Team building events are fun and try to encourage participation."
good,"At the time, I was offered an opportunity to work and finish college as a returning student due to military deployments. However, the work/school balance was off and I decided to quit to finish my degree before returning to the field."
good,"Overall, I would not recommend this company as a great place to work for. During the interview you are told one thing, but it is a completely different situation once you are hired. Management will give you duties to expand your skill set, they give you free lunch once a week, but will have you doing things outside your comfort zone even after you have told them that is something you aren't capable of."
good,"State Farm agencies are franchises and is based on the agent. Most agents are nice, and easy to work with, but the job itself is limiting. There is not formal training, so your ramp up time can take a few months. The compensation for the amount of work is too low. This is a great place to start off in sales or insurance."
good,If you’re entry level it’s a great company to start. They teach you a good bit. Training was about 1 month sometimes longer for different positions. Paid training is definitely a plus!
good,"My office is, on a daily basis, a busy, fast paced environment.  My favorite part of my job is working with our customers to assist them with any need they may have.  The hardest part of my job is when I am not able to satisfy a customers for reasons beyond my control."
good,"Very much a call center environment but this is of course not advertised this way. High turnover in management and inconsistencies in how attendance policies are handled by management. Very strict attendance and no wiggle room for any sick days or emergencies. If you do not have the PTO hours and you call in sick, you could lose your job. PTO/sick days are not separate. Benefits are very good snd so is pay  so that may keep some people with the company."
good,"Main issues with this company would be the unreasonable ""no-fault"" attendance policy. There's absolutely no room for fairness or real life emergencies. Having previously worked for a different insurance company I would definitely say it's a good opportunity to become licensed in all states that requires license, get some experience and move on."
good,The people I worked with were great and I learned a lot from them. They helped me enhance a skill set that I have been able to use in other employment.
good,Owner/operator was a good supervisor who provided a certain amount of guidance and mentoring. Was open and happy to discuss any topic. Provided opportunity for advancement.  Was not frequently onsite. Employees were not motivated when the supervisor was off-site.
good,"State Farm is relentless about service metrics that management bases your performance on.  Too much emphasis is placed on these metrics, and not enough recognition is given to those that are good workers."
good,metric oriented at all times. Certain management will help you to advance as long as your numbers are  met across the board. A lot of mandatory overtime was requested .
good,"Be prepared to work hard to meet goals. This was a great company to work for however there was not an ability to advance in pay, making more sales was the only way. You can be a top producer, but be expected to sell even more the next month."
good,"The call center environment was a pain. Most managers where good but there where a few i went through that where more about making numbers the customer care or quality of the call. The pay is OK but at a entry level job in a company that large i expected to be at least to live on my own with no support form anyone, but that is not the case. High turnover,  nothing but numbers to them, very stressful."
good,"This used to be a noble place to work, but its since changed. Glamorized call center, poor work environment due to the caliber of associates and a benefit package that has been chipped away. If you want to work insurance, I'd shoot for other companies or going independent. This company has killed itself and its name as a great place to work for the next 90 years."
good,"A typical day at work starts with clocking in, starting up your computer, opening all the appropriate pages and jumping on the phones to take initial loss reports. There are two 15 minutes breaks and a 45 minute lunch throughout the workday. You work in a cubicle. "
good,"The training for the claims position was way overloaded and was unorganized to the point where I felt I had no idea what I was doing by the time I was speaking with customers, which I was very uncomfortable with."
good,"Due to a new attendance tracking system that was put in to place, where there were only a few centrally located clock-in stations (on the 2nd floor of a building with an awful parking garage), it caused for a lot of well trained employees to be let go.  The points system they started to use caused points to accrue quickly for ILR & Express Claims associates, as their time off was based on the amount of call center hours allotted & number of people assigned to work them. Even being sent home by a manager when one was too sick to continue working, 4 points (out of 16 to get terminated) were given b/c there were not enough people working on phones to cover the schedule.  This being said, if one hadn't tried to give it their best efforts & go in to work that day, they would have accrued 0 points, as there were ""free"" sick days allotted to individuals per hours worked, but it was not something that was ever discussed so that one would be aware."
good,A once great company.  New CEO doesn't hold the company values that made this company the Auto Insurance Industry leader.   They now take a back seat to many other insurers.
good,At the base level it isn't a bad job. The culture can get very toxic however. It is entirely commission based so if you are not prepared for that be cautious.
good,"I think it really depends on who the agent is that you are working for. Mine was self-centered and cheap. She only paid me $12/hr + bonus and commission (which she found any excuse to not give to me). If you have a great agent to work for, it might be a way better experience for you."
good,Not a lot of things to do. But learned a lot while i was here. Worked BOD's in the morning and then the res of the day answered phone calls and handled customers that walked in
good,"steady work  but not a lot of room for advancement. More to job than trained for. training was lacking for overall position, need to concentrate more on what is being taught"
good,A nice relaxed environment. Flexible work hours. Very friendly to employees. If I was offered permanent employment I would have accepted it. I would definitely suggest State Farm as an employer
good,The company benefits and the company overall are great however; the manager that I reported under was not a good manager. Her team had the lowest morale in the center and she led by intimidation. I believe that if I were assigned to a different manager (there were others who were awesome) my review would be much better.
good,"One of the most stressful jobs I ever had. It literally made me contemplate suicide on more than one occasion. But you know you get great benefits without any work-life balance even though they claim you do. Every six months you have to fight to keep your schedule and once you get a new one, then you're assigned to a new manager. So now you have to rearrange your life around this new schedule even if it doesn't work for you and build a rapport with your new manager and team. Yay! And, God forbid your child gets sick and you have to leave to take care of them. Now you're written up or you've gotten points. But, wait, I thought they promoted work-life balance? Who are they kidding? Call off sick - you're punished for that too. It all adds up to you being a bad worker. Then after two of three occurrences (sick leave or being tardy), you can't be promoted even if you're a top performer. It's not worth it. They treat their workers like scum but expect you to be the best while sucking the blood out of you. Here's my advice: work for Geico, or, perhaps, go work with Flow cause the lizard and the brunette might be better for you. At least, they seem nice from the commercials. But, whatever you do don't work for State Farm. Run for the hills!"
good,"Great place to start, you will gain a lot knowledge about insurance however there is little room for growth or benefits. Work culture is competitive because industry is competitive."
good,"The company is going through a reorganization trying to cut costs and remain competitive.  They are closing offices and opening ""hubs"" to consolidate employees to save on operating costs.  I consider myself a team player and can appreciate why the company is making these changes, but the end result is they are giving unreasonable work loads to claims employees.  Management could care less about your work/life balance because they have no work/life balance themselves.  I will work over the weekend to try to stay on top of things and provide great customer service.  Unfortunately not everyone is the same.  Management response to me is that I need to find ways to ""eliminate waste"" so I can do more.  Essentially they have driven me to start looking for other jobs.  I can't take the stress and workload of this place anymore, and it is not worth giving the time up with my family."
good,Good pay but lacks job security. The new culture lacks job security. More duties with less pay are expected. I have performed a variety of job duties on top of my regular job duties.
good,"Wherever you start a job in a company , you learn lot, how to manage your work, how to deal with different customers according to their behavior.  I learnt to paint my experience in a positive light. "
good,"Great people to work with but doesn't pay nearly enough to live on and no benefits. Awesome boss and friendly staff, nice clients.  Work-life balance good. Pay sucks.  I took a $40,000 pay cut to work at State Farm."
good,"originally I thought this would be a rewarding career. i was hired by someone who has been in the field a long time. Unfortunately, this person had hit almost retirement age and wanted to have everyone in the office just working without him ever being there. If He was there it was for an hour or two and Being brand new to the industry, it's a self learning environment and sink or swim mentality. when ultimately,Ii reached the end of my demise working for a company that doesn't want you to learn how to be good at your job as long as you can "" produce and make magic happen"" without any real idea as to HOW to do that it definitely creates a low morale and a hostile work environment when you and 3 other people are going off the same few leads the company pays for while trying to maintain a goal of  1 new line of business a day. "
good,"Typical work day - Connected to a phone line, receiving calls"
good,"Some people like working there, others hated it. Very stressful environment. "
good,Easy job but it all came down to sales. Even if it wasn’t helping the person out. I liked being able to help my clients but having a supervisor always eves dropping to see why you didn’t pitch a sale was aggravating.
good,"After some consolidation, they're closing many offices and requiring people to relocate to the hub locations. The morale in the office decreased once they announced these changes."
good,"When you work in a agents office, your not a Statefarm employee, therefore misleading as far as life benefits etc. your a independent contractor, and work only for the agent. This is a way for State Farm to pass cost onto agents."
good,The company has stripped down to the basic.  Not a lot of training but you are expected to have a high amount of responsibility and gain the knowledge on your own.
good,This is serious job and it deals with peoples' Lives and family's well being. you have to be Sincerer and apologetic especially if you work in claims or directly with the Policy holders that has been affected but natural disasters.
good,If you work in an agents office you pretty much get paid minimum wage with little or no benefits even though they require you to be licensed...which is not easy to get.
good,"Researched, analyzed, and recommended new marketing opportunities to improve results.  Managed housing inventory for accuracy, kept track of debits to balance assets.  Presented and negotiated offers on behalf of the client, keeping their best interest first in mind.    Attended home inspections, final walk-through of the property and closing of the transaction.    Design website and managed social media to bring brand awareness"
good,Training was suppose to be for a week or two but push for 1 week and expected to know it all within that one week. The 1on1's was suppose to help develop a tool to develop yourself to correct your incidents but instead was used against you from long previous years that they went back instead of the current year.
good,a typical day at work was not normal. I didnt learn anything and poor management. The workplace culture was not good. The hardest part of the job was a fake smile
good,"I do love my job and knowing what I know. I just don't see this as a ""career"" job. I don't make enough money and not having benefits REALLY sucks. It's a good job for someone that's retired and looking for something part time or maybe someone younger."
good,"In the morning I would take care of late payments, discounts, changes and any other service work that needed to be worked, while taking oncoming calls. "
good,"The day starts with a team huddle with management to discuss information as well as any updates or changes that taken place recently. "
good,State Farm use to be a wonderful place to work!  It has since gone down hill.  They no longer care about their employees and somehow believe they are running a factory now.  They are looking to get rid of there highest paid and most qualified people.  It's sad. m
good,"its okay, not the best. the company did not offer much for employees. the ceo was nice. the co workers were not great. one guy almost created fraud by signing a document for a client."
good,"Statefarm is very push forward and get to the end. calls are set to go a specific way and there arent many ways around it. ""Follow the SAP"" is all that was every talked about. When you work as hard as they push you, you do see that they only want to be the best but to me i feel they didnt really want anything for the employee."
good,"Working at State Farm is not really a career unless you pick a good career path. Claims is a non-stop role where you are constantly receiving work, and people quit all the time."
good,Company has changed drastically for the worst over the past few years. Employees continue to leave while the company continues to lose customers. No one cares anymore about the employees.
good,Good company.  Good values... somewhat good management.  It is a company that has many good products just make sure you have a good agent that will advise uou well
good,The position was limited for commissions due to the total portfolio was not open to inside sales. This is a part time job that did not have an opportunity to obtain day hours.
good,I personally learned a lot here. I was able to be educated on insurance and had the opportunity to grow as a professional. Call volume is high morale is low. Work/Life Balance varies by department.
good,"FIRST of all it depends on the AGENT!!!!! Where you are located, and how the agent runs the office.  Working insurance is and can be very satisfying and helpful to the public. Also, enjoying working with the public. A typical day, could be stressful, when there is a bad storm there is a lot of claims of course. but then you help people. You do your other typical changes and payments. The hardest part is when you cannot write someone's business or have to cancel somebody that has been in your book of business for a long time for some reason.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing everyone happy about everything:)"
good,"As receptionist, I personally did not like working at State Farm. I enjoy having customer interactions and I very rarely had that. I was a first time receptionist and instead of being taught how to do things right, I was yelled at and treated with a negative attitude. Aside from that, it was a very slow office so there was not much to do."
good,At least I don't have to be on the phones! Other than that the raises and bonuses are on the decline. Its a great job to gain experience and take that experience else where. `
good,"Job duties turned into collection of money,"
good,"No benefits with independent agents, standard office setting, sales and goals to reach. good insurance experience. good company to be apart of...…...."
good,"Good Company .. Just Grew Too Fast When during my tenure..."
good,This is a job for someone who has a lot of contacts and have a lot of sales experience. Management was over stressed and hardly went to sleep. Every pay period was a different pay check.
good,When I started a few years ago it is different than what it seems. Being in target isn't good enough. Managers are micro-managing everyone including the high performers. No room for promotion... its hard to be promoted in Express.
good,"Left on good terms."
good,The position I held at State Farm was very entry level into insurance sales as well as auto insurance customer service and basic office funcitons. Management at this company is very helpful and welcoming.
good,"The day to day job could be very stressful.  Immediate management was great but upper management was not due to no job security.   However, there were great people to work with, but unfortunately, they are losing a lot of great talent due to their recent changes."
good,"The actual job was typical call center work.  The hours are hard to manage for a single parent, most of the hours are 4 - 12 hour days.  If you are scheduled to work weekends then it will only be Saturday or Sunday not both."
good,work environment was good. I would recommend this office as place to work and get excellent customer service. they are great when you need them to help in times of need
good,The hardest part of the job is being to handle stressful situation while maintaining professionalism also knowing that because the customer is always right but knowing what to say ans how to say it
good,"Most days are spent handing service aspect of operations. If you're looking for a career, starting at State Farm is a pretty good choice. Many agents will pay for your learning material and testing (within reason). The agents I worked for were new and started from scaratch. One agency closed due to poor performance. So it's definitely a competitive industry to pursue. The hardest part of this company, other than losing my job, was having to chase clients to pay. Which really isn't hard just more annoying."
good,"Okay place to work, but to much micro management and  to much focus on meeting goals and not quality, but the employee's are a great group of people to work with"
good,"*Answers phones and emails from customers"
good,"The environment has changed drastically since the company implemented structural/operational changes.  The amount of stress and work/life balance you receive is based on the dept you work in, as well as your manager.  Some managers are great and some do things out of spite.  The metrics for phone positions are unrealistic.  If you choose to work here, FIND A POSITION OFF OF THE PHONES.  The pay is okay, but I wish it was a little more.  The cost of living steadily increases and their raises are very small."
good,"The company is fine. They do a good job with on-boarding, and making it seem like the possibilities are endless. But the company was too big and unorganized, that the possibility for advancement is unlikely. They also instill fear in the employees from the beginning, claiming this is the best company to work for and they would be hard pressed to find something better. Most of the frontline managers aren't leaders. Many worry about their own agenda instead of developing their employees. Compared to other companies in it's size, the pay was substantially low. There was no work life balance, because the attrition was so bad. And due to the size and nature of the company, the claims positions were so efficient (financially speaking, for the company), but that made the work load uncomfortable. There are plenty other insurance companies in the valley - some that have better benefits and pay. Save yourself time and energy, and go find those places."
good,State Farm has been a good place to learn and grow as much as possible locally. I am looking for a new profession that will allow me to grow and stay local.
good,"Some employees were very competitive and underhanded but, for the most part fun to work with. Management was hostile. Loved interacting with customers."
good,"I worked for the company for over 15 years and it was forever evolving. Change is inevitable but their changes caused more hurt than help. The company has wonderful, loyal, honest and family driven employees that are not appreciated. I do appreciate all the wonderful years of great customer service lessons, the relationships that were built as well as how the people of the company respected and enjoyed servicing the customers. Some of the management were great but others have a lot to learn. I will always remember how great of a leader this company made me."
good,State Farm as a corporation is a good company.  The problem was the agent I worked for was a complete jerk.  Unless you were in his family he treated you like trash.
good,"I thought that the job was simple, yet my boss dealt with the situation poorly by hiring me, yet explaining that they did not have the time to train me."
good,"Agent team members are employed by the agent, not employed by State Farm. Only the Agent is employed by State Farm.  How you receive benefits is based off the agent, as well as drug tests.  This job is Commission based."
good,From the first day of training you get bombarded with messaging of an environment revolving around teamwork and family. The fact is they're perpetually understaffed due to high turnover rates and they don't give you time to know anyone you're working around. There's little to no downtime between calls and they're so overfocused on metrics versus how happy the customer was with the call that there's no satisfaction behind doing a genuinely good job. Whether you get the opportunity to apply to another position is so highly dependent on which individual manager you get; one person worked less than one month out of training before their manager recommended them for a management position and others with a different supervisor are rejected for applying for secretary positions almost a year into working for the company. Extremely stressful and not worth it in the end.
good,"I enjoy working with such a well-balanced company. It is tough knowing that pay isn't as competitive as other insurance companies, but they help pay for schooling!"
good,"I applied to this job during my last semester in my undergrad, I was told they would advance me when I get my degree. "
good,"This position is perfect for college students who are currently focused on school more than a career. Also for parents who need a work life balance. "
good,"Make sure going in to take the highest level position you can.  During my time at State Farm, many individuals were told that opportunities for advancement were tremendous and did not end out being the cause because individuals who were able to transfer from other locations to the new Dallas Hub were given 1st right of refusal.  In other words, any new positions or opportunities that became available went to people in ""Legacy"" or other locations first and then if no one applied, opportunities given to local applicants."
good,"A typical work day was training on policy and job duties, for 6 months... I learned a great deal about insurance fraud, litigation, and how to read/ understand an insurance policy. Management was constantly changing, due to transfers and ""promotions."" I had 3-4 supervisor in the 6 months I was there. Workplace culture was stifling. I think they counted the amount of time I went to the bathroom. I was part of a large group of college graduates being trained as claims reps. The more senior folks frowned upon our upbeat attitudes and initiative to work smarter rather than harder. The hardest part was the constant training and testing for months on end, attempting to attain certifications and multiple licensing in order to meet the job requirements. The most enjoyable part of the job were most of the people I interacted with. Unfortunately, a good group of like minded, educated, and motivated individuals that will end up being like the rest of the senior folks there the longer as time goes on."
good,State Farm is a great place to work just starting off into insurance and the claims department. The pay is lower than most other insurance companies. Before state farm gave 10 days of PTO on your first day of employment but now you have to work for hours to accumulate PTO.
good,"Pay is probably on the lower end of industry average, but some agents offer opportunity to train to be self-employed agent. Goals are set by the agent and can vary depending on what accolades the agent wants to achieve."
good,"Company is great for insurance, be and to their agents,but their be lower level employees are treated poorly.  "
good,Well i thought i stay with State Farm for rest of my Career!! But...they are closing office in Tacoma amd now job is uncertain.........................
good,The company is good. they are very demanding on reaching goals. I always felt like they had the carrot stick in front of me but I could never reach it. Good pay though.
good,At the  entry level there is a problem with turn over and the company leadership does not seem to value employees at the bottom or even some of the policy holders.
good,"i was fooled into thinking it was strictly customer service but it was cold calling and all sales which i was not interested in so i left the job, but for someone looking to learn sales its good."
good,There are many business decisions being made that sort of make sense but are not generally good for the employees.  I can see what they are trying to do but implementation is poor.
good,"I believe they have lost sight of their true identity and  are beginning to see a decline in corporate culture. In my opinion, they need to get back to doing the little things that made them great."
good,The company seems like it is slowly declining. Working in the customer care center can really affect your work/life balance. Promotional opportunities have been slower than usual.
good,"State farm overall is a good company, however everywhere has its flaws, job/work life balance is terrible, I would say that is due to bidding for shift preference. Pay is not compensable to continued job demands, and highly micro managed."
good,"This is a role which can be great if you work with the right person, otherwise, it is possible to work for a manager with an archaic ideal about the sales environment and a disdain for millennials like I was unfortunate to work for. In regards to pay and benefits, it is also up to your State Farm agent you work and I was definitely snubbed."
good,"The people there ate really great. Their work ethic is really sincere. Sometimes there is a odd corporate culture that weighs heavy on the inability to innovate. This is about old guard employees who've been their 15-25 yrs being set in their ways and less open-minded about changing process and work product to follow industry standard. New managers come in and derail an established project or shed a negative light on and fire people just to make a name for them selves as a cost-cutting pioneer, as a result anyone interested in job security is afraid to stick his / her neck out."
good,The new culture is heinous. Good management is few and far in between. The company will not be number 1 for long. Some employees are great to work around.
good,"This was a small business that could of done a lot better for it's employees. It was poorly managed and the owner was just in the business to cash out. There was no room for growth."
good,"Competitive environment with good pay and benefits. Fast paced, call environment - Need to be able to understand basic insurance knowledge and have good productive work habits to be successful."
good,"Low paying salary, very competitive work environment. Learned a lot about working for an independent agent. Leads were often hard to obtain for Life and Health clients"
good,If your just getting start this is place to start. It's a lot of movement going on with the company. They don't pay you as much as others but it's a nice group of people to work with.
good,"Every day was the same as before. You take calls, handle the problem, and assign a field adjuster to view the damage. The role of a desk adjuster is not difficult at all. You assist the claimant as best as possible in an attempt to relieve some of the pressure they may be experiencing due to the loss."
good,Typical day at work can be extremely stressful.  Some micro-management tactics.  I learned to focus on production which sometimes put quality of customer service low.  Hardest part of the job was using some of the work tool resources.
good,good company no benefits must sell and handle complaints from clients can get stressful. must sell commission based. pressure to sell life insurance not easy
good,"I was fully licensed with State of WA and State Farm in all four lines of insurance, passing all of the necessary State exams. I handled customer service, confidential policyholder information, quotes for all lines of insurance, bank deposits, processed claims & policyholder payments. As a result of having passed all of the exams & being licensed by both State of WA and State Farm, I was able to bind coverage in all 4 lines. This job entailed a lot of phone service, with policyholders as well as other departments, such as claims, and vendors."
good,"Change is inevitable however, it has become very difficult to manage priorities due to unrealistic expectations.  The culture has changed from a people (customer service) culture to a numbers culture."
good,You are doing the same action every daybed you don't know your schedule until you clock in. You don't really know your job until you have been there for more than 4 months and you have metrics to hit every day week and month. Everything is monitored and controlled.
good,Love to educate people about protection on their life investment. I did obtain my P and C license from the state. I do believe I will work again for them in the future. They have been solid for years but sometimes over priced or are unable to insure someone.
good,Can be stressful.. Repetitive All about goals. Hard to get days off. BUT does pay well and room for growth if you want it. Type of supervisor you get just depends on the teams needs. Some are worse than others.
good,"Typical day involves correcting other team or company mistakes and trying to help customers understand their policies, changes etc...but that's just service. However the multiple application systems State Farm uses is just ridiculous. Go to one place for quoting autos, use another system to quote RV's and others have to literally lookup and calculate rates manually and submit paper apps  ...it's just the most uncoordinated resource ""system-if you-can-call-it that"" I've seen.  Once when you've learned the tricks and where the tools are at the pace is better. But the thing I was looking for most going in from this agency was a mentoring relationship since I was starting new in the insurance industry. But apparently what was expected in return was to just shut my trap, not offer other opinions or disagree with the owner in meetings and just book appointments. Too bad it was not a good fit because my co-workers were pretty nice, and I looked forward to going into work with them. Hours were acceptable, however I could see that if I had more time/success that there definitely would have been some after hours and weekends expected. Not a problem because I knew that going in. Beyond that, benefits offered were minimal at best, but potential commissions and salary were pretty fair and seemed attainable. For example: my agent's office offered  8 paid holidays, 3 sick days and $100 (after a year of employment) towards (medical, vision, dental & life)  for plan of  choice. Beyond that, you're pretty much on your own."
good,"The focus is entirely on the numbers. Don't get caught up in thinking that integrity exists. You are expendable! "
good,The bank is not affiliated with the insurance division career wise and is very difficult to switch from one to the other.  Management did not assist either.
good,"If you're interested in working in insurance, try to find an agent that is already established and well-known in the area.  I don't recommend working with a fairly new agent, because the pay isn't worth the consistent tasks you're expected to complete in order to help attract clients."
good,The job is stressful because of the nature of auto claims. But the stress is made 10x worse when management is only concerned with  numbers and not quality. There's a feeling that someone is always watching over your shoulder
good,The current express model focuses on the wrong metrics which ends up causing more work for the associates because claims are constantly having to be re-worked because of employees trying to meet the metrics but not working the claim to its furthest point
good,I was offered the job without applying and I thought it was a great opportunity. On the plus side all my licensure courses were paid for by the agency but on the down side the work culture was uncomfortable at best.
good,Answered any questions or concerns policy holders had with their insurance and claims. Sent reminders or premium payments and notified customers of any rate changes.
good,I started off as a marketing intern and that involved me doing a lot of cold calling from computer software and if you had no prospects become actual customers you were frowned upon.
good,"I enjoy the group I work with, our team switches supervisors quite frequently.  The benefits are standard for any large company.   I've learned a lot working there."
good,State Farm was an okay company to work for. The hours were flexible and there was a consistent need for overtime. There wasn't many advancement opportunities within. It seemed the company preferred external applicants.
good,"Very relaxed at agents office. Prices keep going up, can't keep up with customers switching insurance. Rates way too high. Would not recommend as not competitive"
good,Full-time employment. Monday through Friday. Two of my co-workers were fantastic.  The environment was good.  The pay was acceptable.  The computer program was a challenge.
good,"State Farm is a good company it just depends on the agent you work for. The company itself takes care of team members by providing support when it is needed, but each agency is independently owned."
good,"it's a good company but most of their policies (attendance, paid time off, ect..) are not focused on the employee but more on business needs, it has created a very poor work life balance for myself."
good,I really enjoyed the job in the beginning when I was able to obtain my sales goal with only being able to sell Auto and Bank but then the goal was increased by three times the original goal while still only being able to sell the original two lines of insurance. It was very stressful at the end.
good,Changes are a way of life. Company is growing and trying to keep up with the times. New hires are hired in huge numbers and are in training for a year to 18 months
good,"This company used to be all about work life balance and now it is all about its bottom dollar. They do not care if their employees are happy and you get the feeling that they do not care, that you can easily be replaced. "
good,"Great company if you want to live in Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix or Bloomington, IL. Lots of changes with restructuring of the company and compensation in some areas."
good,"The company was ok but they are very strict on time. You have to be on time every day or your job will be in jeopardy. They schedule your lunches, breaks and daily schedule and you must adhere to it."
good,"Learning experience"
good,"State Farm is located in a very modern community called City Line. Great atmosphere, continuously improving and very friendly faces. In the role I am in I get to provide insurance agents any needed information on current and expired commercial business policies."
good,"everyday when I would go in I would expect some challenges. Its a great company to work for.  But management has very poor communication with staff.  the hardest part of my job was when my team lead was out , I stepped in to do her job and my job."
good,"If you that kind of person who want to sit on your butt all day and listening to call and put the same information in the computer and say the same thing all day long then you  are good to go in this job. I had never ever work in a call center and never want to do this again. Over all state farm is pretty good company but can be stressfully and exhausting working 10 hours shift, put it this way it take a certain type of person to do this type of work doing the same thing continually."
good,"Loved the job, loved the company.  Management keeps a high volume of stress and drama in the work place.  Training is available just not given the proper time to be able to do it."
good,"Overall an Ok company to work for. Pay is ok, potlucks all the time. But the agents that call in do not seem to utilize there resources at all. And expect you to do there job for them, which makes your day extremely tiresome. Sometimes the call volume can be overwhelming at times."
good,My passion is customer service! Being able to provide advice based on my experience and expertise while actively listening to my customers needs made this a job worth going to each day
good,I have worked for 2 completely different agents how the office goes is based on the agent you work for some are laid back and others can be very stressful expecially if they are an agent just starting out. I feel that the people at headquarters didn't have good answers to my questions and training is ridiculous. They hand you these really big manuals that are confusing I found this to be the hardest company to train and know my job effectively with.
good,State Farm provides excellent training for their employees.  Great company to work for.  This is a very small office -- 3 employees and 1 owner.  Job consisted of selling & servicing Personal Lines products along with Life & Health.   Agency provided license training and compensated for State License exams.
good,"This was an excellent place to work up until about six years ago.  I loved my job and the people with whom I spend my work days.  Unfortunately, the once family and employee oriented company became all about numbers and micromanagement."
good,"The salary and work hours are the biggest pros. For information purposes, each agent's office is different. The agent decides your salary based on experience and volume of business for the location. Each agent also decides the hours of operation for their office."
good,The understood culture is high productivity and insurance designations to be considered for lateral moves or for a promotion. This is regardless of the degrees or prior skill sets an individual has.
good,"It was alright, I'm just disappointed in the fact that there wasn't really that much opportunity for me to be promoted and the new T2 system was pretty glitchy."
good,spent my days cleaning up & getting screamed at by customers because of someone else's F ups.  not fun....................................................
good,"Working at State Farm Agencies was a fun experience. We had the flexibility to work on own schedule. However, the pay was low and there was no benefits at all."
good,"A typical day at this job starts out like any other, meet co workers, chat, start the day. The job itself is good and enjoyable and leave you feeling satisfied that you did make someone's experience a little easier. Management wise, I had a pretty bad manager, but i did hear stories of good and even great managers that went above and beyond to help the members of their team, whereas mine did not, she even shot down my requests to take time to review my performance to find where i need improvement just the luck of the draw i suppose. Almost everyone at the job was nerdy in one way or another and it made me feel at home there, among my own kind. Hardest part of the job was the daily meetings about our metrics, and praising those that excelled and shaming those that did not."
good,"captive sales with a company that is known for dominating the arena of property and casualty as well as for being the leader in increasing premiums before the rest of the pack means that your sales opportunities are limited."
good,I have always enjoyed working with State Farm companies.  My co-workers were good. Iearned a great deal about all different types of people at different agencies
good,"Management is not contractor friendly, many times biased, no proper control on the projects progress, some times felt projects are purposefully dragged and over estimated and over staffed."
good,"Call center environment which had a lot of clicks (e,ployees family members and close friends working there) making it hard to move up just on skill set."
good,"State Farm is a great company to work for however the management leaves much to be desired. You will often be made felt as less of a person, as I have had 8 supervisors and all have talked down to me, disrespected me, micromanaged me, 2 of them even went so far as making them tell them when I had to use the bathroom. Advancement is near impossible as they place more emphasis on bring immigrants over and giving them the best jobs. Three of the departments I worked for were eliminated and outsourced. Job security is not great with State Farm anymore."
good,Flexible schedule with room for growth. The work can pile up since the office is always short staffed but it is not difficult work
good,"take customer complaints regarding their auto accident. meet with different client daily, take payments in person or on the phone. making sure they have the most care."
good,"Good company, could be better. Could be better at advancing people, more open positions. Could have more employees; overbearing workload most of the time. Metrics set too high. Could be a lot less micromanaging; more festivities for the employees."
good,"A typical day included completing prior tasks while taking on the new ones for the day.  With the switchover to a new underwriting company new eligibility rules and quoting systems had to be learned in order to provide accurate information to the customers.  This training ended up being self-taught, often resulting in slower response time to customers.  With the help of a great experienced co-worker to assist, we were able to work together to get things completed in a timely manner.  Dealing with rude clients added to the stress of the job, but the appreciative clients made the job bearable."
good,"I had difficulty passing the insurance exam and State Farm as a company wouldn't allow me extra time."
good,Work/life balance is hard but manageable. Great place to work and the benefits are Excellent. Large and growing company.
good,"Be aware of the bait and switch. Recruiters will sell you on one job and a few weeks in to training your entire job description will change, and management will not show any empathy for the sudden change."
good,I worked there for a few weeks learning and studying to get certification to sell insurance. They do not offer medical insurance which you must find for yourself and they were less understanding than they came across upon hiring.
good,"Working in insurance is hard work. You constantly have to be on top of never ending calls and issues.  The people you help are amazing, but giving them bad news is hard."
good,"It was not what I expected. AT ALL.  I didn't want to feel like that annoying, nagging, sales lady. This is a small town area and everyone seems to know everything about everyone.  I had a more comfortable experience working and interacting with customers and clients I did not know.  It was more comfortable for me and didn't give me the feeling of personal rejection.  It's hard for me to sell things to people I know, it makes me feel like I'm begging, especially selling insurance. Something you need and never see. It's much easier to sell a physical item that people can see."
good,"Recent rate increases have driven away a lot of our customers and only a few can be sold on the brand, 90% of people are shopping on price and are unwilling to switch carriers."
good,"The job requires you to attain the Property and Casualty License. There is no benefits package and the pay is hourly. You have to talk to customers on a daily basis all day if you do not like to talk this isn't the job for you. On a day to day basis you call late pays, quote people, and do loan applications if you are bank certified."
good,"I ""telecommute"", but am considered a mobile worker, so they get around having to pay for internet services. State Farm has not caught up to a lot of the other company's that have this open and I have regular problems with Skype for Business. "
good,Office moral per each State Farm Agent comes with a lot of variance. Not much accountability in terms of various goals and iniatives being driven by the agents. Most agent staff are more knowledgeable then their agents. Not much room for advancement; in addition has the WORST marketing plan EVER (ie. dialing 80-120 random households/day-VERY LITTLE TIME FOR FOLLOW-UP).
good,"Fast paced environment; "
good,Good benefits and opportunity for advancement.  Was able to work several different positions and have a very extensive background.  Good team building culture.  But management was very limited on what they knew
good,"-Start time varies depending on the shifts you were assigned to."
good,"Started out with high praise for new employees in Tacoma office, constant up-beat encouragement, ""we are in this together"" attitude from all levels of management. Made one what to work harder and better every day to please and to support teamwork."
good,"I currently work for State Farm under an agent. This agent is all about the numbers and meeting goals. The environment is great, and I love the interaction I get to have with my customers."
good,I am not sure if I would recommend it. You have to deal with mad clients every day and the Agents do not care to speak with them.
good,It was a student job that I had on campus.  Overall i learned to manage others under me as well as give and take directions.  Also I learn to work under pressure to get certain projects done on time.
good,The job is quite stressful as the salary is low and you must make up the difference in commission. There isn't much job security as people often swap companies.
good,"Everything was about sales numbers, and a fierce sense of competition was fostered between the various sales staff -- we were rivals, not co-workers.  Sales was the top priority, including constant cross-selling to other products for current clients.  The hardest part of the job was the ""Always Be Closing"" attitude and strict sales goal system.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the base pay rate, which was good, and the 9-to-5 hours."
good,"A typical day at work consists of analyzing risk, reviewing applications, corresponding with agents, and managing a book of business.  I learned many valuable interpersonal communication skills, building construction knowledge, insurance practices and policies, and a specialized knowledge of property and casualty underwriting in a growing region of the country.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with belligerent customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction that comes from helping the company stay profitable."
good,"Make sure being an insurance agent is something you are interested in, it is difficult and you have to be aware of everything going on with all clients. Can be difficult if all coworkers aren't noting their conversations with clients. I learned a lot about insurance and will use throughout life."
good,"Training was very intense, many different systems to learn. Very compact learning environment. Poor work schedules, too many requirements to submit tour bids."
good,"I worked for a small agent and temporarily. they have pretty good products for the consumer, and my manager and co-workers were really nice. I had fun. The downfall, is there really isn't much advancement opportunity with these places and benefits are limited as well as time.  you have to abide by corporate rules/reg since they are all franchised offices."
good,"typically when you work for State Farm you are working for an Agent and not the company itself, therefore your experience depends the agent and not the company"
good,Work for a seasoned agent.  New agents are all over the place.  They are disorganized and you do not get the training you need for your office.
good,"Starting at State Farm, I was looking for an office job that could work around my academic schedule with potential for agency ownership in a few years.  It is a great learning experience adding to my prior years of insurance experience.  I have better my customer service skills and have learned to look for key words while on the phone.  For example, if I was on the phone with a client and they mentioned getting married, I would suggest coming in to meet with our agent to discuss the importance of a life policy as they expand their family and start having kids.  It is a rewarding job, knowing that you are helping to secure families financial future and protecting their interests (houses, cars and boats).  The culture however isn't as supportive as I would like it to be.  Some co-workers will act hassled helping out the new guy (I have only been there a few months).  I would say the hardest part of this job would be trying to help customers with little experience.  I was under the impression I would be working 20+ hours a week, but I instead work a little under 10 because we have been slow.  It is frustrating because in turn, my paychecks aren't what I expected and my budget had to be totally re-done.  Another downside is the experience.  If I don't have hours but am still expected to perform as if I have had the hours, it makes it challenging.  Overall, I would give, with MY particular circumstances, 3/5 stars."
good,fun place to work but some staff are not customer service oriented. pay is not enough to support a family. charging people for policies they were never told they were paying for happens quite a bit.
good,"Provided you do all that is expected of you, this company will provide stable employment.  State Farm offers a fair salary and other benefits."
good,"Enjoyed helping people, enjoyed working with other team members."
good,"A good place to work, limited potential for advancement."
good,"My position with State Farm was Sales Producer/Agent Aspirant. Unfortunately with lack of proper management and employees, my time was mostly spent on servicing the book of business, rather than building it. I enjoyed talking to our insureds and answering any questions they might have; however sometimes I felt as though I did not have enough time in the day to assist everyone who required my attention. I learned how to balance my work schedule appropriately to assist each customer and provide as much information with the allotted time I was given. I learned how to successfully run an agency while our agent was out of the office. During this time, I was able to book lead companies and insulate other commercial businesses."
good,"Please see resume for daily duties and skills.  I learned quite a bit about mutual funds, increasing my overall financial business acumen.  Most difficult part of the job was the job security, as there was very little and management tended to act contrary to what had been previously verbally expressed."
good,it was really calming always attending customers at all time.
good,I left the company to pursue a more lucrative opportunity utilizing my industry experience.  The job I held was not satisfying monetarily and could be stressful at times due to constantly changing terms of service.
good,"Answering client requests in person, over the phone and email. Would process various requests, such as quotes for a particular insurance, or changes to current policies. "
good,"Call center environment."
good,The compensation is poor.  Employees are not recognized for all of their contributions.
good,I didn't necessarily like working for the agent in the SF office. She was sometimes stubborn and micromanaged almost all the time.
good,It was a great experience for me and I learned a lot to work there
good,This office was using two computers.  Old technology and new simultaneously.  Very confusing at times and outdated.
good,"Work sales leads, first thing.  Second, handle claims submissions and call backs.  Third handle underwriting emails and policy maintenance.  Finally, create and call on personal sales leads."
good,"Each day at work involved answering phone calls and taking payments from customers. I learned customer service related procedures. Management generally directed me to deal with their work overflow. My co-workers were pleasant, and the hardest part was staying in a chair for long hours at a time. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I never felt overwhelmed by work related duties."
good,"Insurance sales and service"
good,"I enjoy this job very much. The most rewarding part of my job is helping to educate my customers on thier personal risk and help them find products and to protect thier families. The hardest part of this job is all of the knowledge that I have had to retain. I must know how to price insurance, answer coverage questions and protect them with the best coverage I can, for the least amount of money."
good,"Process mortgage loans for State Farm agent customers. Work with LO's agents, and customers to close mortgage loans.  Training with company was good, Loan origination system was not very user friendly."
good,"policy changes, took payments, wrote new policies, educated people about different coverages"
good,"A typical day at work includes general office management and going though a daily checklist of activities including: quote follow-ups, payment/billing issues, customer complaints, etc. When the checklist is finished there are several lists for cold/warm calls."
good,"I've learned many things working for the same company for 9.5 years. This company is constantly adapting, before one decision is made another is being made to change the structure or layout. It is difficult to adapt when one company-wide change has barely been set forth and then something else is changed again. I would recommend for someone to get in any other department besides claims."
good,"State Farm is an ever changing company that used to be a great secure place to work that allowed you to raise a family and grow with the company. Now they have changed and no job with State Farm is secure, especially not in Bloomington, IL. My co-workers are great, management does not use or value our skills. I've learned that it is hard to earn a good income at State Farm if you have not received your CPCU. A bachelors, even master's degree, will not get you far."
good,"While I didn't enjoy doing the same thing over and over and over again, State Farm is a very good company."
good,You learn insurance by passing the test and learning as you go.
good,Typical day will be more focus on numbers vs. people and customer service.
good,This was a very well friendly place to work. It was more of a family experience.
good,Great company.  Ok place to work.  aldsjf;alsjdf;alkjdsf;alksdjf;lakjsdf;lkajsd:flkja;ldkfj;lSDKJf;laksjdf;lkajsdf;lkja;dslfkja;ldkfj
good,"I have learned a lot about insurance from the basics to more in depth knowledge about different areas of insurance.  I typically would organize lists and be able to assist existing customers with their claims, existing coverage, or desired coverages.  I specifically specialize in life insurance and providing information to people.  The hardest part of this job is being able to juggle work and school.  Having two jobs and being a full time student is no easy task.  The most enjoyable part of this job is creating relationships with coworkers and customers."
good,"State Farm is in a transition period which yields greater claim volume while still maintaining the promise of remarkable customer service. Overall, the environment is one that encourages quality but high work product. "
good,The main agent was a friend of mine that I had been knowing for years. I gave me a great opportunity to work for her.
good,"call center work, most jobs require a degree although it is not needed since they do on occasion hire for claims jobs without degrees. Extremely busy all the time."
good,A typical day at work consisted of the marketing and selling of insurance products and providing customer service to current clients. At this job I learned the importance of the follow up. The management had good intentions but was very obviously having problems with the coordination of a growing staff. The hardest part of the job was trying to fit in the sales environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was building relationships with customers and co workers.
good,I think this company was a good company to work for I loved my job. I just think they make some poor choice in the people they choose to hire and don't know when to let people go espcailly when harassment is a huge problem in all the offices.
good,The company is changing its culture and starting to look like every other company.
good,"• Managed the front desk, interacted and greeted clients"
good,It was not a good fit for me personally. The owner was not sure what he wanted and was not able to provide the proper training.
good,"I started my career with State Farm working for several agencies in my local area. I was Licensed, but discontinued the license and the career to start my own business."
good,"In context of job time in IT: The department is attempting to ""go agile"", once again chasing the latest ""market craze"" in terms of process improvement.  Huge roadblock is lack of formal training at the Exec/mid-Exec levels, allowing poorly executed implementation of agile-related principles and concepts and furthermore, areas of 'legacy thinking' to persist.  In other words, a long way to go to effect a true culture change."
good,A lot learned and experienced and a great group of people to interact and work with. They helped me achieve my licenses with ease. I would recommend to anyone with a great work ethic.
good,My experience at State Farm was bittersweet. We had a language barrier. I was born in U.S and my supervisor expected me to speak perfect Vietnamese. I only learned basic Vietnamese. And they didn’t train me well. Lack of guidance. Expect them to be experts.
good,"Good place to start, but after a few years it was time to go. You meet a lot of great people along the way. "
good,training and productive.  very good at increasing working knowledge of insurance policy and procedures. work conditions can be very stressful at times.
good,"Like to get a good-paying job not requiring a college degree is cool. Just FYI FMLA benefits for absences don't kick in for 1 year, but you do get med coverage after 1 month. "
good,"I felt like this company was my second home. Hardest part of the job for me was doing my job in the time allotted. Management could be difficult or amazing. I learned a lot about insurance, vehicles, and the office culture. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was helping people."
good,State Farm does not treat their employees very well.  Each sales office is independently ran and each owner has their own rules.  Pay is not up to standards.  Constantly pushing sales and not appreciating the hard work of customer service
good,"State Farm as a company is fantastic. It comes down to the agent you work for. THEY set the standard for what you think State Farm is and will be. So ultimately they will make you either enjoy it or hate it. Just remember you get out of it what you put into it. You can go far if you prove yourself. it's not easy,  and it's definitely got a lot of hours if you want to succeed well. But by doing this you can move up either by going into corporate or by owning an agency."
good,"Hectic day for the most part. "
good,"Pay used to be fair, they used to care about employees and there was a work life balance. They laid us off in April 2018. The severance package was fair, I can't complain about that. I used to love working here!"
good,It is a call center (so don't believe all of training and management when they repeatedly say it isn't) and the majority of calls are complaints and you are being yelled at for things you didn't do and have no control over now. 100% of your shift you are taking incoming calls from customers. Very stable job and forgiving management for employee mistakes.
good,I was let go with no explanation.  Manager did not even say 10 words to me as I was asked to leave. I am still at a loss.  According to my former co workers employee morale is at a all time low.
good,I was oversold on the amount of money I could make. The work is monotonous. The commissions are very small especially considering the amount of hoops you have to jump through to make them happen. And then chargebacks are a thing as well if someone cancels within six months of buying from you. Not a place I enjoy working at.
good,"I’m thankful for my time at State Farm, it provides me with more in depth knowledge into not only how auto insurance works, but claims process overall."
good,State Farm has fair pay for what you do.  The claims department needs proper training for Associates.  The training is geared for the next step up position but you don't know this until you start doing your job and you realize you were not trained for the job you will be doing.
good,"Overall, after almost 4 years, I can say that it hasn't been a waste of time. The company seems to have gone in a different direction, and because of this, my pockets saw the brunt of it. If you're looking for a customer service job, where you do minimal work for a mediocre paycheck, and are comfortable with the monotony of a desk job, then this is a great place."
good,"Typical day means lots of time on the phone chasing leads. There was quite a bit of cold calling. Mostly internet leads. State Farm's systems are antiquated, 20th century, but it works and they are beginning to update. Management is pretty much the individual agent and whatever he/she decides. Atm's pretty much have no input. Workplace is routinely monotonous. Same thing over and over. The hardest part is staying active long enough to get through the day. The best part is co-workers."
good,"Organized a huge project that involved many states. Kept track of 100s of applicants via text, emails and phone calls. I started work at 6:15 a.m. so I could reach the east coast and ended work by going to two banks and the post office every day. I prioritized my time and handled office management in and between deadlines for applications."
good,"State Farm as a career is a wise choice if you don't mind being targeted for standing up for others. State Farm is a good company but in recent years the culture from Leadership seems to value people less and productivity more. Productivity is a necessary component to sales and performance, however those overseeing those performance results can fall short of their own expectations. I used to love my job but the change in culture changed the way management perceived their employees. Productivity & Performance are the only targets without concern for how those expectations impact the performer. The results goals seem to be arbitrary not based on achievable expectations which have been tested. A standard set by automation rather than placing realistic goals based on human performance. If you can find a position that places less emphasis on hard targets, or if you are accepting of that, you will be happy."
good,"Working sales brings out the worst in people and that can't be said any more loudly than at my state farm agency.  My agent hired several people which all conflicted with each other.  After 2.5 years working there, I began to get fed up with this culture and decided to pursue other avenues.  "
good,"I worked for an independent State Farm Agent. Not a good experience.  Inadequate training, no positive feedback. Overall, a negative work environment."
good,"It was a fast pace, got to keep up with the changes.  Work life balance and getting time off was horrible.  I've heard it has improved,  Like in all companies, there will be amazing managers that will encourage and help you grow within the company and others that only care about how they look within the company,"
good,N/a. I have nothing bad to say about Staye Farm. Good insurance company. Very well liked in the city of Atlanta. Expanding daily. They have their own shuttle service for employees
good,"The culture at SF shifted in 2015, from a company interested in service to a company interested in beating the competition, at all costs for their employees.  They shifted to seeing insurance as a commodity and therefore claim service as a commodity as well.  The executives are pitted against each other and will go to any length to make themselves look good on paper, regardless of whether they are measuring something that has relevance to the final customer experience.  They tried a culture reboot in 2018 but it didn't work.  The pay and benefits are great though -- if you can get in for a little while, get trained, and live to tell about it, another insurance company will probably snap you up.  Good luck to you."
good,Very demanding position no benefits end of year goals to meet company metrics are extremely stressful you must enjoy high stress to be able to make it.  Owners are great.
good,"As a long time employee, I've seen the focus shift from the customer to metrics that don't match the actual job I do.  Room for advancement seems limited if you've been around a while."
good,"State Farm used to be one of the best places to work, but the culture there has changed. They are turning into a call center environment that recycles its workforce. The building was nice. That's it."
good,"Fix the systems, train underwriters,...spend hours every day doing useless tasks because the systems are broken or underwriters make constant mistakes. Can be rewarding selling and helping people, but dealing with corporate is a joke. Good money and great work experience"
good,Always worked late and when we hit our quota it usually didn't matter because the customers would never answer again after the first call. Pay was not worth it either.
good,"The environment was stressful and morale low. It was difficult to advance unless you knew the right people, and the politics got out of hand. The pay and benefits was decent, but not worth the stress."
good,"it can be a little strenuous, but you get used to it. "
good,Not a good company for anyone with a family as they require to much of your time.  It is very difficult to be a parent and work this job because its all about what is best for the customers and not so much about working with you to create a schedule that allows you to be the best employee you can be and the best parent you can be. Its like they make you choose and of course you have to work to provide so...this is my only negative about the job.
good,"This was a contract position. Some of our "
good,"Terrible support from agent. I had to drive around to prospect customers, never reimbursed. My agent didn’t like to advertise and then complained about us not getting business. Agent #1 goal is to get business but no real plan to get it into the door. Good stepping stone to work for other insurance companies."
good,"This isn't a bad place to work, but it is incredibly tough with the expectations that are set.  This is part of the reason for the high turnover rate."
good,No further comment . They need to pay the associates more money. And hire a more professional type of people ...........................................
good,"State farm, while being my first professional job it taught me alot. While it seemed promising.  The team was quite negative and there was no room for growth. The team was not team oriented and there were a few issues in the office."
good,"Experience changes depending upon your primary agent. In my experience, I was hired on for a specific position, then gradually pressured into full on sales. By sales, I mean cold calls. Additionally, there was constant pressure to make sales goals. I would only recommend the company to someone who can handle rigid expectations with minimal direction and have no problem working cold call trenches. Solid pay, however no benefits were offered in my circumstance."
good,"This company is nothing special. No different than any other major insurance company, Many other options for those interested in Risk  Management and Financial services,"
good,My job is in jeopardy because they say I am not picking up the job fast enough yet when I started I was told that everyone learns at their own pace. Now I am told I am in danger of termination because I am not learning the job fast enough.  I am on the verge of tears daily and feel paralyzed with fear of making a mistake.
good,"After 20 years at State Farm, my department was outsourced.  State Farm has closed facilities in Frederick, MD and moved business to more profitable labor markets out of state."
good,">SF is a highly productive company that expects excellence 24/7. "
good,"The best part of working for State Farm is the family atmosphere and learning something new every day.  The employees help each other and find reasons to celebrate.  Conversely, upper management made a decision to consolidate the work streams and our responsibilities doubled....without any added compensation.  Morale changed dramatically and there is a sense of feeling used.....a take it or leave it environment."
good,"They are changing a lot of things to make the employees happy. I just got hired in December of 2018 and I hear a lot of people talk about how unhappy they are. For the amount of money we are paid the work load should not be so heavy. They tell us all the time ""it's a hard job"" well pay me like it then!!!"
good,"Affectly answered over two hundred in-coming phone calls."
good,"PTO time is a slap in the face. It takes a month and half to generate one day of PTO time. No sick time, no vacation time, 21 points and you are fired. You accumulate 4 points for one day, 3 points for half day. No cost of living pay, you get a raise based on your preformence. A new hire will get a better schedule then a person that’s been there 2yrs or more. 10hrs shifts for 4 days a week 3 days off. You will more than likely get a Shift working Every Saturday or Sunday. With no kids you should be ok. The pay isn’t the best I know other insurance carriers who pay more for the same job. Metrics are somewhat do able. Some managers don’t even know how to take a claim over but have to grade you on your claims"
good,"My last position at SF was in the Tier II-III Bodily Injury department. The workload was way too much to handle in a 40 hour week. My manager was consistently unprepared and basically useless as far as actually managing and controlling the team. People basically did as they pleased with no consequences, and those of us who actually cared were left to pick up the slack. Also, the daily emotional toll of constant major injuries is something that takes a special type of person to handle."
good,"Nice environment, pay could be better, with step increases or someting to that nature.  It would be nice to have a office located in South DFW as well."
good,"Great company, great customers, really fun customer service type work. "
good,As a sales agent you do not work for State Farm so you do not get benefits those are out of pocket. It took me 3 tries to find the right agent and he was amazing. Unfortunately the cost of insurance is expensive especially with the high deductibles that the marketplace offers so I had to leave.
good,The company has changed a great deal over the past few years. Main focus is about meeting SLA versus customer service.  Met some great people and forever friends.
good,I'm learning the system in and out which is the hardest part because the sales part is don packed because of my experience in customer service that I have been in for several years.
good,"Learned a lot about the company, selling insurance, and handling all aspects of claims. Enjoyed my co- workers, the agent was seldom in the office...."
good,"I had the opportunity to work in a few different positions, each position helped me gain more knowledge of the insurance industry. People I worked with was the most enjoyable part of my job, we worked well together to complete projects."
good,Company had zero clue how to do mortgages. They should never have been in that part of the industry. Stick to insurance and stop dipping your toe in to the mortgage waters.
good,"State Farm is a great company to work for. The advertising is everywhere and the brand has a good history. Pick your Agency wisely. Some agents are aggressive in sales, others are lax. All are small business owners trying to make it. Office culture depends on agent’s involvement and management. Do your research and Pick your Agency wisely. Environment is everything."
good,"When I first joined, I was promised easy career advancement and an un-beat company culture, as number 1 in the industry. Since, with the change of executive level leadership, the company itself has suffered not only on a record low growth level, but more so with employee morale. Many tenured and experienced employees have left due to these changes and this has forced inexperienced individuals with small amounts of industry knowledge into impressionable roles. The enterprise has become extremely competitive, and has caused an uprising of worn out employees.  "
good,"State Farm Bank was a great place to work for years, great culture, great employees."
good,When I first started at State Farm it was a company that I felt was family oriented and kept a well balance between work and home life.  My last few years there things went down hill and it was less about family and more (in my opinion) about the bottom dollar of the company's revenue.  I also felt they had less empathy for their employees.  They started to outsource the work and shut down different parts of the company across the US.  I think I was one of 6 people who were let go for minor reasons in about a 6 month period.   For things they were extremely lenient on in the passed or continued to let others do the same thing.  I was there for 16 years and I still miss the people but I do not miss what State Farm has become.
good,"The management for the agency I worked for was understanding in working with your schedule and meeting with you to go over goals, unfortunately there was a limited amount of resources put into lead generation leading to a lack of sales opportunities."
good,"State Farm is currently going through an organizational change. The job culture has seen a dramatic shift from just 4 years ago. Executive management appears to still be attempting to fit a square block in a round hole. Given some time, I would expect this to get better."
good,State Farm was a very good company to work for and provided me with a good living.  I thoroughly enjoyed my job.  Recent changes in the claims structure led me to choose retirement.
good,"Received 30 to 40 calls per day answering customers questions regarding their Auto Claim or initiating a new Auto Claim, many from the scene of accident. Calls were monitored, with weekly feedback. A weekly side by side was preformed by your Manager listening to a call, with feedback and follow up to your weekly performance regarding tasks and call time. Challenging part of the job being able to talk and type at the same time, and provide great customer service and quality work.  Managers eager to help with your development, and growth. Learned to work more efficiently, and improve my talk time by controlling the call with asking pointed questions, and answering questions in a direct manner.  Enjoyed meeting some great people, and provide exemplary customer service to customers in their time of need. That's what I do best."
good,I worked for an independent sales office so I do not think it is fair to make assessments on the company overall. I liked my boss my nut unfortunately  due to financial miss management my office eventually closed.
good,"The work-life balance is alright however it's mandatory to work a Saturday or Sunday, you can never get a full weekend off unless you have PTO or someone is willing to pick up your hours. it's way too many changes and you can be fired out of nowhere. The turn over rate is extremely high. On the weekends the calls are back to back. You don't get a chance to breathe, it can really do something to you mentally. If you do not like being on the phone this job is not for you. The Pay is alright it can be better due to the fact we have to do so many things.  If you enjoy being cursed out by policyholders this jobs is for you!"
good,Managers make a lot of difference to your work/life balance. Growth is not very easy. Not many wfh options for people who can’t commute everyday. Benefits could be better.
good,Good place to work. Nice activities for the employees.  State Farm is a big company with lots of employees. They have a very nice park for the employees.
good,A typical day is very fast paced but in the last couple of years the company has changed the culture. You have to stay focused on your task and not get caught up in the atmosphere.
good,"State Farm was once a very enjoyable place to work.  In the past few years it has evolved into an overly micro-managed, rigid, and uncompromising place to work.  Working in the claims department was always challenging, but also rewarding.  With all the changes State Farm has implemented, they have downsized the job into sheer drudgery and absolute misery."
good,Wasn't satisfied with the company overall. would not recommend to any friends or family members of mine. Its was a horrible experience and i hope no one has to go through what i did. Will be changing insurance companies as well!!!
good,"Love this company, but things are changing. The family-like feeling and bonding with coworkers is no longer encouraged. Like many places, favorites are chosen and made obvious, and there are cliques.  Inconsistencies in training and accountability means it sometimes feels like pulling dead weight. But overall, management is pretty open and understanding, and will try to help with whatever is needed. The benefits are great, the pay is alright. It's still a decent place to work, it's just not what it used to be."
good,"Great company to get started in, however advancement is not as present as it once was. Stressful environment where company goals overshadow employee satisfaction too much."
good,"Great company to learn about the insurance industry. Your day-to-day schedule will vary and will not be set. If you do not like working on weekends and holidays, this is not the company for you. The insurance industry requires 24-7 availability, because there is no set time an accident, or catastraphy can occur."
good,"I didn't have time for school. "
good,"Fast paced, customer service oriented company that had required integrity of its' employees at one time. Lots of room for advancement in the insurance industry."
good,"Not a bad place to work, but not better than any other. The culture is very top down, limiting the ability of teams to deliver. There are just to many people in leadership with no added value."
good,Company is getting away from what made them succesful. trying to conform to industry norms still a good company needs to refocus and dedicate to current employees.
good,There is the old boy's club mentality in some areas which make it hard to continue your career as a woman. Lots of re-orgs reduce the confidence in upper management.
good,"While the compensation package is still one of the best in the industry, the culture, work life balance, and job security have taken a nose dive in the last few years. What used to be a job where I could be proud of the company I worked for and I was valued for the quality of the work I performed over the quantity of claims worked had definitely become the exact opposite. The job is so stressful that you feel too drained to do anything after work. If you happen to be in a department that does not mandate overtime, you often feel like you HAVE to work overtime just to keep up. It really is sad, because this USED to be a great company to work for."
good,"Work/life is emphasized as being very important."
good,"An overall good place to work, but there is no work life balance. To take off you have to see what times available and if you don’t have PTO accrued you can’t take off. You essentially accrue 6.2hrs every 2 weeks for a shift that’s 8.5hours long, you do the math... SF has a high turn over rate which hinders your growth in moving up in the company. And don’t get me started on the point system. "
good,"Working in the call center at State Farm is a good filler job while you're looking for something better. They have decent benefits, but the pay is hardly worth putting up with the stress of having to meet certain metrics for call length, accuracy, number of calls taken, etc."
good,This place was very fast paced and made sure that all the calls i was making were effective. The work place is very modern and easy to get along with employees.
good,"Coworkers are wonderful.  Most of your day is spent on the phone , but you are also expected to meet work production goals.  These are non negotiable and ruled by metrics deemed possible by someone else who's probably not held your position.   Be prepared for never enough hours, time or staff to field all calls and get all work done.   Non optional overtime is expected regularly which makes for a difficult, if not impossible, work life balance.  The position is stressful, decisions are expected quickly but also expected to be well researched and investigated and accurate.   The company offers PTO , but you'll only be able to use it if there is capacity to do so, which is rare."
good,Going through the separation process and there needed to be more oversight on how it was handled.  Criteria was not clear and there was no recourse if you felt there was a poor decision made
good,I loved working at State Farm.  I held on through many changes and demanding times.... work was hard but fun. As a trainer I had lots of responsibility on my shoulders and when moving to a new state with no family I have to make a change for a better work life balance.  That's the only reason I am leaving.
good,"The Managers feel they don’t have to learn what the team does which causes a disconnect in the teams ability to succeed."
good,"Company is trying to adopt to agile methodology and digital transformation. It's an uphill task with long tenured employees."
good,"Its a great office with great people but the training style is not for everyone and I find myself more frustrated than satisfied. There is no"
good,State Farm is a great company to work for but caring about your employees in order to have a stress free work place is something that I feel and employer should have.
good,"Depending on the agent, it is a very good job. Unfortunately there are virtually no benefits or paid time off. Pay feels like your desperately making sales to keep food on your table. The job is very repetitive as well. There is no career advancement unless you want to be a state farm agent for the rest of your life..."
good,"Overall, this company has good benefits for those who are in management and have worked for the company for many years. As of late, the new CEO has made many changes which has steered the company away from the fundamentals of a work/life balance and keeping the employee's needs and happiness a priority. Most co-workers are friendly and helpful.  Entering/leaving the building is a challenge with traffic."
good,A typical day in state farm's claim's department includes high phone call volumes on top of discretionary work. Metrics are highly monitored. The job does come with a welcoming workplace culture where learning is encouraged amongst a team environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of providing remarkable customer service.
good,"Your supervisor may or may not know how to do your job.  I had to assist new teammates just as I was assisted by senior teammates when I first started."
good,"It was ok working here. They definitely have it made with being near the ASU campus as many students like the flexible work hours. However, if you work in a call center, forget it. I will never work in a call center again. This job was great while I was finishing school though, it was more of a placeholder till I found another position."
good,"In my experience working here, I held various roles within the company. It’s an oftentimes stressful work environment with sometimes poor management. The opportunity to grow is slim to none. Salary was the bare minimum pay offered for the role you performed. Annual reviews were subjective and did affect pay increase percentages."
good,Great flexibility with work schedules. Associates very helpful and knowledgeable. Very customer focused. Provided good job training to help you succeed.
good,"Very stressful,  competitive, restrictive and streamlined workplace for me.   I prefer to work in a more relaxed atmosphere where you can breathe and not feel overwhelmed every minute of the day.  Plus, I only had 30 minutes for lunch so I have to swallow my food and only 2 x 15 minutes breaks: one in the morning and one in the afternoon. "
good,This position was entry level claims adjusting.  Management wanted claims processed fast and low dollar which frustrated customers.  There was never any appreciation for the time spent on a job.
good,"State Farm has a good culture. They offer good flexibility regarding scheduling within their Sales department. Compensation is adequate, but the people make it a worth while environment."
good,"Constant changes in claim processes on a weekly or even daily basis. No consistent work hours, had to ""bid"" on new work schedules about every 6 months."
good,Worked for State Farm for two years. Must be willing to take tough phone calls from clients. There are not that many benefits but if you work for the right agent you may get some.
good,Fast paced
good,"A typical work day involves about 30-50 calls (combination of inbound and outbound, but mostly inbound). You investigate claims, make liability decisions, inform callers of procedures to have vehicle damages inspected, set up appointments for inspections, rental reservation requests, etc. You also spend a fare amount of time each week reviewing incoming documents and determining what follow-up actions need to be taken."
good,"I was able to experience different cultures "
good,"started very early, learned all types of insurance management ok,hardest part of job having to shift bid. Most enjoyable part of job seeing co-workers."
good,"Company is deleting staff in regional operation centers to only have presence in HUBs not located in my city. "
good,This is a great work place for most. They need your help from talent workers! Good benefits and helpful managers. Just be open-minded and prepared for change in this industry.
good,"It was just two of us in the workplace, it was very quiet and slow paced. I learned how to manage people finances and help them with the lowest amount in car insurance, life insurance, and home."
good,I enjoyed my job was sorry that I couldn't stay.  It was a good place to work for or I wouldn't have stayed for 25 years.  My job kept me busy all day and if I finished my work I could always find something to do.
good,I was very excited when I was offered the position at state farm.  The company overall has a great workplace culture and do what they can to keep moral going.
good,"State Farm is a good place to work. The benefits are great and the environment is good. But, because of a series of layoffs, it is exceptionally difficult to find job advancement in the current environment."
good,"Not actually working for State Farm.  Working for individual agents.  First one I worked for was ok.  Too much drama.  Second agent I worked for was horrible.  The manager at the second office was amazing.  He cared about his employees and protected us from the agent until he couldn't take anymore and quit.   I don't believe all State Farm agents are as bad as the last one I worked for.  I'm sure there are good ones out there, I just didn't choose well."
good,"The benefits were great but to complete all your work you would need to work a lot of OT to keep up with the workload. It provides you with a really nice pay but if you have children, like myself, you start finding yourself losing those moments with your children."
good,"With a new CEO, the company is going through tremendous change. Virtually all departments have been impacted resulting in numerous lay offs across the Enterprise. There is a loss of institutional knowledge and that's acceptable since the focus is on budget. Learning curves will be steep and will be visible to the internal and external customer."
good,Fast paced high volume work environment. Single point of contact for first party policyholders and third party claimants. Complex property auto claims.
good,"A typical day at work started with a short team meeting in which the supervisor communicated updates and let us know our goals for the day, then we worked for the rest of the day by ourselves at our own desks with the exception of two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch."
good,"Stressful call center friendly environment, constant changes to processes, procedures, management is not always available when needed, seeking management advice too often is actually seen as a negative outlook"
good,This is a company with strong secure  financial background. A diverse workforce environment. Many opportunities to explore different job titles as well as physical locations.
good,"Lack of communication around goals and expectations.  Company has entered in to a phase of cutting back.  While that is a business reality, they have not communicated goals or set expectations.  Immediate manager and director do not know what to expect in terms of projects, production, staffing, or other resources.  New leadership in mid 2017 is far less communicative than prior."
good,"It's a job that no one ever grew up aspiring to work. The job pays decently, but creativity and compassion are seldom observed or encouraged from management. This applies to all claims positions, otherwise SF is a great place to work."
good,I'm not saying every state farm is like the one i worked at but my particular company had 0 to no benefits and no management. Also there was promised commission but most of the time not received.
good,"Not a lot of opportunity for career advancement unless you can bring in the big bucks. There is no room for folks that are great with customer relations, if you can't sell, you won't have a job for long."
good,"Process heavy."
good,The home office was always helpful anytime I called.  The hardest part of my job was working in an office that didn't have much patience for someone that is new to the company while training.  The most rewarding part was making sure the clients were taken care of.
good,"You will not make the cash you want to make working here unless your in a high volume sales office, and in those situations it comes down to the agent in the office on how hectic that kind of an environment can be."
good,"Over the past 18 years, I have had the opportunity to work for and represent a financially and ethically strong company. I had the opportunity to work full time while obtaining my bachelor and masters degrees. My leadership in the past gave me the freedom to develop new roles and instill processes in various levels of leadership."
good,It pays well for the job but the managers place a lot of pressure on meeting quotas which makes the company culture feel like employess have no job security.
good,The Company has been undergoing a major transition. It is becoming less of an insurance company and more of a call center. It is not the same company it was a few years ago.
good,Its all about the mount of customers you get through and not the customer service or services you offer. They only care about production although they claim they care about quality. Job advancement is dismal.
good,"Difficult to work at a call center for 2 years and at night and weekends.  Also, difficult to get on a day shift. Great diversity and inclusion and on-boarding program."
good,"It’s a great company to work for. The job is not that hard, there is just a lot of material you have to learn in a short period of time. I work in a small agent office."
good,"Stable company, good co-workers, too much pressure from management to get ""numbers"". Not the same enjoyable place to work as it used to be. Many employees are unhappy there."
good,"I learned the difference between an office environment and a direct marketing company.  Our agency was an enjoyable place to work, especially working directly with our insureds."
good,"However job security is not that great. Company is reorganizing and many jobs are moving,being down sized or eliminated.  Company is okay to work for as long as you are mobile as this is where the company is heading."
good,State Farm is a place where you can expect to have a position as long as you comply and merge into the culture of the company. The benefits package is desirable. Most positions are desk jobs and it's difficult to move up the chain if you don't have connections or lineage within the company.
good,"I was both a claims adjuster and fraud investigator at State Farm.  As an adjuster it was a very unrewarding position and overly structured."
good,"The job was ok, however they work with a point system and no sick days are available. If you miss a day you get 4 points. If you late to work or from lunch you get points. If you get close to your points they do not care about the ""remarkable"" service that you gave (which is what they wanted from day 1), they go strictly on points, no matter if you sick, have a death in your family, car wreck or anything. Maybe they should reconsider it on a case by case situation and evaluate your work. Companies have to understand everyone does not try to take advantage, for some people life does happens that causes them to miss a day or be late."
good,It is a good starting job to get on a good path to saving money and ensuring your bills will be paid! There really is no good work and home life balance they will let you know that they care up front but once a situation occurs and you have trusted that flexibility piece then you see the true intentions. My flexibility was not personal but military.
good,"State Farm is going through a series of changes, so of which involve relocation.  Many positions are being moved to a tradition in-office that were at one time face to face interactions."
good,Get there early and go through the mail drop and process that. Help clients with their insurance needs. Answer the phone and manage front office personal.
good,I enjoyed my time working at State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance company. In my time there I learned a lot about insurance and different types of insurance there is.
good,I really enjoyed working there.  had a nice boss but again not enough time to really experience the workplace.  I received a better offer and needed to take advantage of that.
good,"Will give you the tools to work into being a State Farm Agent. Requires more than 9-5 hours while receiving minimum pay. Will learn all areas of being an agent (management, sales and service)"
good,"When I left it was a mediocre job. But note, it didn't start off that way. Over the years the culture of the company have change dramatically. Some good, but mostly not so good. Work life balance changed for the worst. Pay is mediocre. Workload extremely heavy."
good,"The job itself was very laid back and enjoyable. However, the owner and one other agent did not get along. There was a lot of miscommunication which caused a lot of issues with clients and in office workers."
good,"work hard, and results are rewarded"
good,"Performance management assist in outlining your day. I learned to interpret multiple state policies/ and abide state statutes. The workplace culture has worsened in the last few years, but benefits are great."
good,As an independent adjuster working with State Farm can be nice depending on the location of the operation center. The days and weeks are long but for the most part the environment is relaxed.
good,"I learned how to grow a tough skin at State Farm. Very hands on with customers, you learn how to listen to what the customer says and then to speak after wards. Learned how to control an angry customer.  It was a very disorganized situation, sometimes it would fill like you were given all the tasks for the day, while picking up phone calls and trying to make sales calls all in eight hours. You learn to manage and multi task but becomes super stressful after a while. The hardest part would be dealing with a customer that is wrong over the phone and they keep yelling and yelling and telling you are wrong over and over until you provide them with the correct information and they never say sorry. The most enjoyable moments would be actually helping the customer and seeing that i was able to give them a good experience when they would walk in or even over the phone. Also management was terrible. The manager is very very dedicated to what she does but she would be very harsh when you would ask for help and would make you look bad for the tiniest things."
good,The best part of the job are the people I work with. The training for the most part is good. It is a fast pace environment where you deal with customers to provide remarkable service.
good,"I enjoyed working for State Farm and I enjoyed seeing customers and resolving their insurance and financial needs.  My coworkers were very pleasant. The local management could use some training. Daily production of insurance policies was enjoyable,  however, completing State Farm Bank products such as auto loans and Certificates of Deposit were my favorite tasks."
good,I have only worked with one agent and while it was a pleasant experience at first it did not grant me the flexibility that i was looking for with my school schedule and work. My agent was a tad overbearing but the hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers who are at times very feisty and refuse to be wrong at any point in time.
good,"Overall State Farm was a very nice company to work for, however they were in the process of transitioning locations and employment on a massive scale when I joined them in 2012.  Simply put, in the five years I worked there I decided that we were not moving in the same directions."
good,This job proved to be challenging and a little more than initially anticipated.  This type of work is not for everyone.  My co-workers were great and helpful.
good,"This company used to be Family and employee orientated, that is no longer the case. Reorganization has turned this company away from its Original Core Values in regards to their employees. Long time employees are no longer considered in the future path they are trying to take."
good,My manager was amazing. Awesome guy that I'm still friends with. Its tough because they sell you the idea of opening up your own agency but it takes 3-5 years of making $12 dollars an hour before you're even considered.
good,This is a very good job for someone looking to get into sales. It definitely pushes you to learn how to sell when people really don't want to talk. I will warn though after about a year it becomes very tiring and not worth the pay.
good,"Help people manage the risks of everyday life, recover from the unexpected, and realize their dreams"
good,"ILR is a very basic job. The only issue is they have some rather hard to reach goals based on the training provided. While in training, no mention is made of call handle times, or several other proprietary program issues."
good,High volume of calls and claims to be serviced with minimal help from management. Work day was very demanding with several metric and numbers to hit to keep good job standing. Training did not prepare me for the job in my opinion.
good,It was a very good place to learn how to maintain in a office environment. I was able to assist customers with their accounts and become eligible as a state farm agent
good,"State Farm is one of the largest insurance companies in the country, and you get a real feel for that when you work there. All goals are driven by corporate with minimal input from the employees."
good,"A typical day consist of 15 to 20 phone calls, calling customers either to gather information or give information, reviewing files; completing evaluations on injuries parties; working mail, new claims, file notes from either managers or claims processors to complete a task in a claim, paying bills, communicating with attorneys and composing letters.  We have two 15 minute scheduled breaks and a 45 minute lunch break."
good,"Did not like where I worked and I did not enjoy selling insurance. I was a good salesman, and I was very knowledgeable of the products, however, I worked in a very small town and there was no one to actually sell to."
good,"The company had change its way to work lately and is more restrictive. "
good,"if you're in sales positions this will apply to you. the typical day at work is sale sale sale. especially for newer agents. licensing is a must, some agents will pay for qualifications. expect to speak to somewhere around 40-50 people a day to be successful. "
good,"Friendly work environment, flexible work schedules, lots of over-time, good pay. This company offers lots of training and has opportunities for advancement."
good,This was a great company to start my experience with. I always swore I'd retire with Graybar. they strive for excellence and take care of employees. I would recommend Graybar to anyone.
good,"very hostile atmosphere"
good,I think the company has great vision. I just hated having to work the late shift every day and living out of town. Getting home at 10pm at night was difficult
good,The opportunity to help people is outstanding. Customers call when they have a problem and you are there to assist them through some of the most difficult times.
good,Not the best place to be if you have a life worth living. Definitely gave too much to just be let down.. I was a great person who worked hard and was let down..
good,"great company to work for overall and lot's of opportunity if you are willing to be mobile. the office in jax had good management but sadly little opportunity for advancement within the company since most operations are conducted at the hubs in TX, AZ and GA."
good,They needs better management and be fair with employees. I enjoyed being the assistant to the accounts manager and having to interact with business's and HOA's.
good,"State Farm is overall a great company to work for if you're looking for great benefits and job security. The company has become increasingly focused on tracking the quality of their employees' work product and their production, which is a plus for the growth of the company and for proper employee compensation and career advancement. State Farm is very focused on developing their employees and they invest a lot in training and development. State Farm also offers annual bonuses based on policy gains and lapse/cancellations, annual salary reviews and a pension plan.  "
good,I worked for state farm for almost 10 years and always felt like I the company as a whole had no concern for work life balance.
good,"good company to work for."
good,Used to be a great family friendly place to work. Now the personal aspect has been removed. You are just a number. There is no work/life balance.
good,"State Farm has been in transition for a few years. Currently it has changed the atmosphere and work environment. Such changes has had multiple employees resign. State farm has no longer accommodate employees work/life balance. Most importantly, the new structure does not focus on the customer. This change has only touch the foundation. It's driven on numbers only. Employees are timed on each movement of their day, and realistically this eliminates providing a customer relationship. Employees that are meeting the recommended daily/weekly/monthly numbers are told they are not doing well as others and need to produce more. And the lower producers are getting memo's within their record-which this effects their pay rate and promotions and there set daily schedules. No longer room for peer to peer support to prevent. OT are a constant, as not enough employees to keep up with the work. Team managers are taken employee interactions personally and in return give lower raises and no acknowledgments to that employee. I understand the need of change and to compete with other competitors. This does not mean employee degradation. This change has set a negative setting within the company."
good,Great company for new professionals to begin their career.  SF has afforded me great opportunities over the years.  The company is currently undergoing massive changes and promotional opportunities are limited.
good,"A typical work day consists of reviewing mail and handling it accordingly while also answering the phones and tending to the needs of both the insureds and third party.  Working at State Farm allowed me to utilize and my customer service skills when dealing with those who have faced a loss from very minor to epic proportions."
good,get as many licenses as possible and move on. there will always be job offers go for the highest paying
good,"Good benefits and pay, but when they matched pay with competitors due to constant people quitting they added more work and less coverage of representatives. Therefore, now calls volume is extremely high and they expect for you to rarely get off the phone for water / restroom breaks."
good,Typical Agency model for the sales and marketing of State Farm insurance products. Constant interaction with customers both in person and over the phone.
good,"State Farm was an exciting place to work. However, their training was quite sub par which made the job difficult at times."
good,"Easy to work with management and colleagues.  However, compensation was below average and job security is questionable.  Currently, opportunity for advancement is below average and work load is equivalent to two adjusters."
good,If you are working for an agent you are not going to be making much in commission because he gets the renewals. its very boring and your stuck in  an office all day
good,"With all the changes to new state, promotions are hard to come by, forced incumbencies in one department longer than a year before being to post out or move up"
good,This was a great company to work for. Just like anywhere there are good and bad things. My co-workers were great and they made it enjoyable.
good,"Work Life balance is great, greta benefits. There was not much room for growth or advancement. Management held you back from moving anywhere in the company. Compensation is very poor"
good,"Three women and one agent in very close quarters. Agent is gone a lot. Front desk gets all walk ins (business) and never leaves her desk so she can answer the phones (quote coverage). There is very little chance for the others to get new business, which means lost commissions. As long as her sales are high, he won't get rid of her."
good,This job was very lucrative but the management was not on top of things the way a company of this magnitude should. As far as the employees of the company we all felt like we were a big family.
good,"Typical day at work involved auditing travel expense reports for the employees of the corporation that traveled.  Making sure that the proper documentation was attached for their expenses - that the documentation would also pass the FAR regulations of the travel expense reports.  I also dealt with any relocation packages that were given to employees and the auditing of those receipts/expenses that would come in.  There were also employees who had short term international assignments that had travel expenses that required auditing and I was handling those.  "
good,"All of the work day is spent on the phone answering calls and returning calls to body shops, other insurance companies, and of course State Farm policy holders. State Farm provided a nice and productive working environment with a few amenities."
good,"My job as a word processor was very interesting and relaxing.  Because all typing was done via dictation, I have learned how to really listen to what someone is saying.  I've achieved perfect typing skills, e.g. speed, punctuation, spelling, charts, formats, I've extended my knowledge of medical terminology and also learned a great deal of legal terminology.   I worked with a small group of wonderful people and had a great supervisor."
good,"State Farm was a very good company to work for and had a customer service first culture.  However, over the years the culture has morphed into an aggressive production oriented culture with a do more with less attitude overtaking the customer focus."
good,"A typical day at work for this State Farm agency was coming into work, getting a list of customers to call put together, and then cold calling them trying to get a quote. "
good,While I was in the PacNW region I was very happy with the enviroment at the regional office.  When I transfered to CA it was drastically different.  It was a much older staff and culture.  Very rigid.  Once the re-org occured it became much better.  My main complaint was the business casual dress code.  I was written up for wearing a Hawiian shirt on a day other than friday.  I have heard they have since done away with the policy and allow employees to wear jeans.
good,"I find State Farm a pleasant place to work.  It is very organized and customer service oriented.  "
good,"The agent I worked for did not allow me to work to my full potiention, only allowed me to call cetain people. Co-workers did not work as a team to maximize sales in the office."
good,"State Farm offered  good benefits, and was somewhat family oriented. Departments and supervisors were constantly changing. "
good,Very fast paced environment in which call ins as well as walk in clients occur during the entire business day. In addition to directing clients I also assist them in what they made need help with as well as provide insurance quotes to them.
good,"Being a part of an Agent's team can be both tough and rewarding, depending on who your agent is. It really is just luck of the draw."
good,Working for State Farm was not an unpleasant experience but there was no room to advance within our office. I worked for the agent so there was no where else for me to go other than the position i held. Management was not present for more than 4 hours a day so it was difficult to communicate when issues arose. However i was also able to become more independent and organized since i needed to rely on myself.
good,"I process auto accident claims, exhaust benefits, turn on or off provider network. Computer skills used daily. Great work environment. Search and find new specialty and title of providers."
good,"I worked for the company about a year and a half, the culture is great, benefits are really good, and there is definitely room for advancement...but there are two things I think they really need to change in order to make the work environment better for associates, 1) They really really stress numbers. I was personally instructed by my manager its ok to sacrifice quality in order to meet the quota. WHAT?! yeah, that definitely needs to change, myself and coworkers found ourselves more stressed about handling claims quickly than correctly. "
good,"Overall the job was a nice way to build customer service skills. However, the way the office was managed could have used some major improvement. Also there was a lot of office drama that really brought down the whole morale."
good,"I worked for and with an agent to bring in new business as well as increase existing relationships with additional services."
good,Each day I would come to work with a positive attitude and willingness to work. Management was great and very accommodating; co-workers were very pleasant to work with. The hardest part of the job is when our position termed. It was a good experience and atmosphere.
good,A typical day included answer calls 25-100 calls per day and filing claims while helping customers with any and all questions in the initial start of a the claims process.
good,Company operates like any other large company.  Can get lost in the numbers and compensation is average.
good,This company has truly provided a platform for me to develop and perfect my professional skills over the years. It is the place where I learned the benefits of hard work and providing quality customer service. Great experiences over the years.
good,"Work is long hours, fast paced, "
good,"State Farm is a great place to work with opportunities for advancement, but the pay is not competitive.  The hardest part of the job is slim opportunity to gain full time positions.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when I am able to help a customer in its entirety."
good,"As much as working in a call center can be terrible, it doesn't help when the job environment you work in isn't the best.  You constantly hear gossip, and occassionally it's about you.  I'm sorry that I don't have the time to chat cause I'm getting work done.  Once you get to  a certain point there's not much room for advancement."
good,This is a great place to excel financially and improve your standing within the financial world. It is a simple job that only involves stress when dealing directly with customers. This office would have attained much more success if the managerial staff were in tact. The current office manager is unfocussed and does not work productively throughout the work day.
good,great opportunity while working as in customer service rep.
good,"Typical day at work just involves taking calls, some of which can be handled on your end if not you will be transferring the call elsewhere."
good,"This is a great team environment.  A typical day in the cat office, varies.  There are days where there may not be very many phone calls coming in, and then there are days where the phones are ringing off the hooks.  The volume highly depends on the weather conditions that policy holders may be currently experiencing, or recently experienced.  The hardest part of the job is staying motivated after working a few 60 hour work weeks, with no indication as to when the normal 40 hour work week will return."
good,most of it is self taught the agent that I work for is to busy most of the time to teach anything and with certain aspects I have asked for assistance and have yet to have that assistance. Frustrating at times and no health or dental benifits. Pay is a big cut from what i had before and hours are not what i was told when i applied for this job. Taking away from my family time and I am a big family man. I have a co worker that is consistently tardy by half hour or hour and a half at times and nothing is done about this.
good,"Typical day at work would be making phone calls and trying to sell some home and auto insurance. Making sales was our number one goal every day. I learned a lot about insurance and why its so important for others to be insured correctly. I had amazing co workers everyone got along with one another which made the office a warm and friendly environment. Hardest part of the job was the cold calls and most enjoyable was everyone was doing their own thing, everyone was to themselves and we still got to have some fun while we worked."
good,"The typical day at work was an office/cubicle setting; very silo'd as far as technical breadth and malleability. Management was supportive and focused on development, although often opportunities were limited. It was difficult to cut through red tape, but such endeavors were achievable through perseverance and due  diligence. Aptitude was paramount, more so than specific knowledge, which was admirable. Flexibility was limited, but the opportunity to explore opportunities based on performance was exceedingly enjoyable."
good,"A typical work day consists of answering phone calls for automobile insurance claims. "
good,"I was not informed at outset of the true responsibility or type of position.  I went through 6 week of training before I knew exactly what I would be doing. On the first day live, we were scrutinized by upper level executives which made it very difficult to perform.  Most everyone had no real clue of what was required of them.  The employees (my team) were fantastic and we formed a very close bond.  The training, although not detailed enough, was the most enjoyable part of this position.  I got to know new and interesting people and that is always a plus."
good,"I had no complaints, the environment was fun and the customers always enjoyed their visits"
good,A typical day at work consisted of opening the building every morning.I was responsible for checking the office voicemail and making follow up calls with customers. During the course of the day I would market state farm products through networking meetings and within social networking media.When my manager hired new employees I would be the responsible party for training. If any new insurance products were opened I took on the task of calling underwriting to speed up the process.The hardest part of my job would have been selling insurance due to the competitive market. The most enjoyable part of my job was the ability to coordinate my own schedule.
good,"Sales position. A lot of outbound calling. I've learned how to identify the need for certain lines of insurance and how to complete different applications for various lines of insurance. Fairly new office, great amount of pressure to grow business."
good,"A typical day at work varies, from assisting current customers with their insurance policies, quoting new and existing business lines, helping the customer find ways to save money on their policies.   Involved in hiring process and training of new team members in our office as well as other offices.   Assist customer with the claim process.  Retention processes to help reduce cancellations and lapses.  Discover and share  the product or service we offer to protect the customer individual needs."
good,"Multi-task projects, team player and career minded with excellent work ethics. Bilingual in English and Spanish very ambitious and dedicated employee with high integrity and great leadership skills."
good,"Working under an agent when starting off in the insurance business is a great way of learning the business. You get all of the training and advice while being paid to do so. However, the pay may differ from agent to agent, so are the benefits."
good,"Great schedule and allowed time off when needed. The agent I worked for pinned a lot of responsibility on me, and it made me confused on my work title. Offered a lot of incentives as well."
good,"State Farm used to be a good place to work with great compensation and job security, but in the last 5 years they began to outsource many things and listen to outside efficiency experts who don't know our business on how we should do things."
good,The agent I work for is amazing. I just wish I was paid a better wage.
good,"Coming from the outside, I was one of the few in the support departments (i.e. Public Affairs, Marketing, Human Resources) that had no Claims or Underwriting experience. While this did inhibit my ability to advance, it did allow me to play an important role in helping my team develop. My leadership trusted my input and provided me with the opportunity to develop of use new skills the advance my career."
good,"State Farm is a great company to work for, I just wish that the agent I was employed for would have gotten her contract"
good,Really enjoyed working in the call centers. Felt like I was outcast for not joing commitees that had nothing to do with my job. I was there to work not be part of extra things that had nothing to do with my job.
good,Small office environment that provided flexibility and lots of training in the products and services of the company. Very challenging breaking into and developing new customer groups.
good,Everything is not as promised
good,"As soon as I drive up to work, I get an overwhelming feeling. The joy of knowing that I am about to help some one in need of a service is a blessing. To be a part of making someone's day is worth the drive, and I drive a long way."
good,Laid back but proffesional atmosphere. People are very nice. you can earn lots of money.
good,The job itself was great but the owner didn't stay on top of things like paying bills or handling customers and paying staff.
good,"considerable workloads, technically competent professionals strong support staff, good leadership ."
good,"It went from caring about customers and employees, to only caring about customers. They don't seem to care about anything except for their metrics, which makes employees feel worthless."
good,"This is a call center environment for those that may or may not like that. Cafeteria on site, banking on site. It really depends on who your manager is of your team which will determine your happiness here. Some managers are great and very helpful. Others, such as in my case, was not. Plus it is difficult to get a day off or to get overtime if you really need it."
good,Local cmanagement is very good but bewildered by many of the decision made by the executive office    The are often required to enforce procedures that they don’t agree with    This makes for a strained work environment
good,Fun place to work but low pay. Had to have a current license to be employed there but did not receive any commission on sales. The people are fabulous to work with and for but the pay is not.
good,"Good company to work for.  I really believe in State Farm products.  It really depends on the agent owner as to income, job security, and work culture."
good,Expect to be pushed to your limits. Very high paste work along with metrics. Auto claims will continue to push you to your limits. High volumes of work
good,Bills get paid... Employees don't really feel valued. Metrics more important than work life Balance. Hard to stand out unless you really get to know managers on a personal basis.
good,"It was great working at this company, would’ve loved to learn more. I learned that building your own clientele & referrals is the best way to advance ."
good,"state farm is a company the is owe by agent under one name at the time I worked they they have no medical benefits. the hour rate for me was low, and were was no over time"
good,"I no longer work there so I have nothing to say about this company, bad nor good. There were four lines of Underwriting, but my department, BL USA, was the most complicated, detailed, and non repetitive of all four."
good,Make sure your agent is not new unless you have at leaast 10 years experience and you have money savied and salary is at least 38K with commission and benefits.Get contract and signed agreement with a severance pay agreed if he/she decides it is not working.
good,"This is a good environment to work in but most of all, I love my customers. Helping people and writing a policy they need at a price they can afford is the best feeling."
good,"It offers wonderful benefits and services for the employees. More than not, there are managers that do not credit their employees with the input changes and ideas that are the difference makers in those areas (Managers take credit for work other's provided/implemented)"
good,"The workplace culture has changed in the past few years.  State Farm was always a high volume, fast pace workplace but being regional allowed for some flexibility.  Since the realigment (going from regional offices with some autonomy to one enterprise) the workplace has become regid and inflexible.  "
good,A typical day working at state farm was sitting at a desk answering phones and helping customers throughout the day. We also would have time to look over certain things that we were not fully comfortable with.
good,The environment is very dynamic and intense. Great opportunity to learn about the industry. A conservative company with a great brand and people. There are great benefits offered as well.
good,"A typical work day usually entailed a morning ""wow"" meeting with the daily sales goals reiterated. All team members would go around and share their ""ah ha"" moment for the day."
good,"Fun work environment , with a very flexible schedule. Really allowed you to learn the ins and outs of insurance sales , especially at an entry level position"
good,You typically work as a private contractor which may affect the type of benefits available to you office to office. The hours are usually pretty decent.
good,They offered awesome entry level positions with great compensation. There is plenty of room for advancement. This company helps you grow your resume from the date your hired on.
good,"Lots of opportunities to learn the industry and explorer new careers in customer service, sales, underwriting & marketing. State Farm provided an eye-opening  experience which help me understand the importance and value of protecting dependents."
good,"I enjoyed working there, the people were great, but sales goals were higher than anyone in the office could achieve and bonuses were unobtainable. If you're looking to make steady income, and don't need the bonuses to live on, it's great."
good,"Because of organizational changes, the company is centralizing to 4 locations.  The company is undergoing many changes that make the work environment very challenging."
good,Challenging and impactful.  Supports local communities.  Heavy workload.  Team environment.  License requirements for certain positions.  Stressful job.
good,"I learned customer service, and great communications skills. The hardest part of the job to me personally was giving quotes but I had helpful co workers and managers that helped me."
good,"Worked for some great agents, but did not enjoy the insurance game at all.  Extremely redundant and unfulfilling work.  Did not enjoy sitting in a cubical and making cold calls all day."
good,"My work day consisted of reaching out to potential customers, analyzing their insurance needs, presenting products, setting up the appointment and closing the sale."
good,"StateFarm Insurance was a good job right after college. I went in with very little experience and gained plenty of exposure on customer service and sales. A typical day included cold calling, reaching out to prospects and leads. My coworkers were great, but the lack of upward mobility led me to pursue other opportunities."
good,"Tread carefully, keep your eye open. that is all I have to say. The only real draw back is being forced to complete a review through indeed. ANd in order to fill word quota im typing nonsense"
good,"Good for entry level experience in Insurance sales. If working under an agent/owner, it can be extremely frustrating, The amount of work and stress outweighs the : benefits (if any), salary and commissions."
good,The hiring and firing process should be fixed and warnings or at least reasons should be given before terminating someone. The money is great and benefits are great.
good,"I did not work for the company very long but it was a nice environment while I was there. Staff was pleasant, company lunches on Wednesdays, and good work hours."
good,Very good benefits. Staff are very friendly. The work life balance can be hard to balance. Overtime available. Most holidays have to work. Comes with a pension
good,"Indeed.  Everyone knows that reviews are jaded at best. People who are happy do not post reviews nor can reviews be considered as fact. Therefore, you should not make it a requirement."
good,No Benefits. Poor training. Very low pay and very difficult to move up. The job consisted of all cold calling. Very high sales goals. Sytems were old and very difficult.
good,"I left State Farm mostly to take on a management role that wasn’t being offered to me there. Every time that I filled in for a manager I would get great reviews, but when it came time to fill a position, I was over looked."
good,"Fast and ever changing environment.     Metrics determine phone calls, and number of tasks needed to  meet goals.  Is more of a factory like environment if you work in claims."
good,Staff was very friendly. I enjoyed the work but very competitive. The commission payout was very low compared to other insurance companies I worked at.
good,Small office and I hated sales so I quit but if you like sales you will probably like it. It was in Northridge and the location to get there had traffic.
good,"I did enjoy the pay and benefits while working at State Farm however, the company as a whole, seemed to focus more about saving a dollar than they did about proving excellent customer service."
good,The longevity of coworkers and friendly environment. Life long family relationships. Excellent training and previous good working schedule.  Management was very approachable.
good,"It is what you make it , if you remain busy and call your leads to make sales then it will be okay but honestly unless you become an owner of an agency then its not worth it for the long run."
good,State Farm became a claim factory instead of spurring claim professionals. More interested in quantity than quality claim handling and spent most of there time promoting people who had no first hand claim knowledge. But managed numbers etc.
good,"Stressful at times to hit numbers but nice people to work with. I wanted to move around more and not behind a desk, I like fast past environments. I love busy work."
good,Job can be strictly selling or customer service. Each State Farm office is run very different. Most Agents want their team members selling as much as possible especially life insurance.
good,"This is a job that is highly stressful.  You receive a list of things you do wrong every day and work in an environment that is so loud, that it is often impossible to hear the customer.  If you want to work for the customer, this is not the job for you, go into real estate.  If you want to work for the company, this is the perfect job for you.  Every employee and manager will tell you, this is not for everyone.  Make sure you know what you are capable of, and what you really want your day to include. Changes are made so often, its hard to keep up."
good,look at emails first thing to check for updates and log in ready to take calls the hardest part was training was to fast paste for me but i enjoy working there left on medical reasons but i am doing great now.
good,The workplace her is very competitive and fast pace. You need to at least come from a background in insurance if not you won't have an understanding of what is going on.
good,"Was hired, trained, and developed as an insurance professional in the beginning.  Was also given frequent opportunities to prove yourself as such with adequate recognition.  Due to unfortunate changes in company philosophy, position went from highly-trained insurance professional responsible for a range of duties, down to a processor with a narrow range of duties, pressured to complete as many transactions per hour as possible."
good,You would think for the oldest insurance company around they would have a better system for handling their policies. NECHO is a dinosaur and ECRM is glitchy. The amount of things you jave to do just to get one thing done seem insane. if you come from another insurance company be prepared to be shocked.
good,State Farm was an amazing company to work for. Salary and benefits could be better but overall nice. There is definitely room for advancement within company.
good,"State Farm can be an exciting company; however, the company struggles with consistency between departments, and with management.  In the last few years, State Farm has undergone reorganizations in numerous departments."
good,"State Farm Mutual auto insurance company used to be a good place to work. Great employees are hired and they are fun to work with. However, in the last several years, consolidation of operations led to too much disruption and lack of opportunities to move ahead."
good,Typical work day included scheduling marketing events and then executing said events and gaining potential clients and then on days with no marketing events cold calls are made and planning for future events
good,"constant inbound calls, basically a customer service job not much to it. Benefits were great. Management was the biggest down fall here, walked around laughing and doing nothing but scolding on what you are doing wrong. Management is incontrol of your advancement. So if you are not on their good side then kiss other opportunities goodbye. So excited to work here, but beware it is not as good as it seems.  You can find something better!! Trust me."
good,"Not for everyone.  If you like to sell, go for it.  I basically got tired of almost constant phone call quotes with clients STRICTLY wanting the absolute cheapest price.  Statefarm ain't it bro."
good,"Some of the hardest parts of the job were long hours, however, there was compensation in the form of over time. The most enjoyable part would be talking to people and making sure that they were protected adequately."
good,at the time of working for state farm I was going through a tough time in my life and I just felt my boss was very rude and unsympathetic. The job was pretty cool if you need help you could ask your team lead.
good,I was a Temporary employee.That was my experience with the company. I worked there for 10 months part time from. February to December 2013. Not enough.
good,"I enjoyed the people and enjoyed my job.  I worked with the boss on special projects and did my job as well as I could. I actually worked for agent, I was only a employee of an agent, not State Farm."
good,it was rough  at first I went through a lot until I was paid fairly I had to jump through some hoops but it wind up paying off but I wish that my son the patience who I was getting paid to take care of was still alive not dead it took a toll on my life
good,"The culture of the whole office is really depends on the Agent from State Farm office, and the salary/commission is different as well. Looks like the head office doesn't have a lot of control to the agent office..."
good,"Change has not been kind to the Farm. Where they previously worked to develop a one of a kind reputation of care and concern for their customers, the current company is chasing metrics mostly."
good,It's fine. I come to work. I answer calls. I service accounts and answer questions. I help our insureds fell comfortable from an insurance standpoint in their daily lives.
good,"I only worked here part time right out of college in the call center, I do not feel as though I can write an accurate review of their process or of the company."
good,I have nothing to add about my experience with State Farm it was good experience to learn your role as an agent the pace was just right right plus a friendly environment
good,"A good place to work, however they are playing catchup to the the other insurance companies. Hard to feel secure in an environment that is constantly changing and not knowing what the future will hold."
good,State Farm is a well known company.   I have learned a lot.  Productive environment but not flexible to balance work and personal life.     Must be able to be a multitasker.
good,There is not a lot that I can say about the company. Word from multiple agents and had a very good experience with just about each and every one of them. It offers a great work and life balance also to very competitive pay and very competitive environment to help better yourself and they're willing to teach youyouand.allow you to move up
good,"Good job to hold while going to school. Not many opportunities for growth with independent agents. Compensation was fair for the job description, but needed to find something more rewarding."
good,Its a great gateway to insurance. I'm filling the rest of this with useless words because I don't really care about writing more than what I stated and wished this wasn't a requirement of INDEED.
good,"Incredible Training for Injury Claims. I gained valuable transitional skills in coverage and liability investigation, evaluation of injury claims, and negotiation skills."
good,"Learned a lot, good work/life balance with excellent benefits.  Former employee now, still remain close with those I worked with for so many years.  Great people."
good,State Farm in Hazlehurst is a great company to work for. It’s a very fast pace office with great people.  They were very flexible with the schedule and when I needed off to take care of family related issues.
good,The culture of the company has dramatically changed. The company once was a company that was all about work life balance and very big on family. That is no longer the case. I would say that they have aligned themselves to be more competitive at the expense of employee satisfaction.
good,"Compensation, environment and culture varies by the agent. They're small business owners so the base is rarely impressive. It's a great way to get a feel for which direction you want to go in the company."
good,"While the benefits were great, the culture or environment was negative and filled with unhappy associates in express claims for lack of progression and high turnover rates and poor work life balance"
good,It is a small but busy start up office in a small town.  The Agent has many years of experience and is motivated to make the office a success. The office ours are 9-5.
good,Not leaving just looking for pt evening . Not leaving good company if you want to apply then apply.  Trying to apply for part time jobs elsewhere . Has nothing to do with my current job
good,"I worked for State Farm for 20 years.  It was family oriented and stable.  The company restructured 2 years ago.  Many departments have been eliminated or staffing reduced.  This is no longer a company where generations of families work.  The turnover is high.  Management gets their directives from corporate and can not longer make decisions that make sense.  It breaks my heart to see a company that was one so highly thought of reduced to a bottom line, bean counting organization."
good,"They have recently consolidated a lot of operations centers and closed many buildings. The claims center I work at is being closed soon, my job was moved to Dallas, Texas."
good,A typical day at work was overall very stress free and I have a boss that was very driven to help his employees and align with the company values. A good place to work.
good,"State Farm is the epitome of the Corporate world.  It is top-down driven.  You work in cubicles and most people are ""job scared"".  The management is aloof; however, the pay is good, and the benefits are fantastic."
good,"Great opportunities, I wish I didn't have to relocate, hopefully I can work in another State Farm facility. My manager was very supportive, the co-workers and attorneys were patient and willing to help."
good,Job security is not found. We have gone through three organizational restructures in the past three years.  More than 30% of those  employed have lost their positions.
good,"There are a lot of great perks that you get from working at State Farm, such as tuition reimbursement, full benefits (even if you work part-time), and an employee credit union with a low interest rate."
good,"the job was eah, it was not fulfilling and the agent better be on the ball or else the entire crew will suffer. it may be a good filler job but not a career."
good,State Farm was fun at the beginning but working in claims at an insurance company is as exciting as it sounds. It didn't help that the company seemed to be losing money following major storms. Caused additional pressure. Had to move on before I hit the glass ceiling.
good,most of the jobs requires you to be on the phone a lot. You have to be in certain positions for maybe a year before you can be transferred. The training is not good.
good,"Okay, if you really need employment. Strict and stressful. You're in a cubicle and is always on the phone. If you like that type of environment this is the job for you."
good,"Loved working the fast paced environment and taking care of our customers when in need and vulnerable, while problem solving, looking up state laws and scheduling appointments for rentals, auto body work and tows."
good,"varies widely due to each office being its own agency. in general agents are not good with HR, just were good in sales and ended up owning an agency. money can be good but usually very small amounts and they are quick to hire and fire and use people to make their goals while they do very little."
good,"Opportunity to move to lateral positions in the company and build knowledge and skillset."
good,"hard job now that State Farm is moving away from Customer Service and doing Sales only.  Job  is cut throat between employees working to make a sale.  "
good,"I was relatively new to the company; however, most colleagues talk about how great the company used to be. While some may think that is nostalgia, the company has made some very poor decisions. For being the number one insurance company, State Farm has tried to minimize costs by cutting many of its staff members. This causes frustrations with customers because most of the work gets backed up. In the past two years State Farm has lost over a million policies, but our CEO touts this as ""struggles between a successful transition."" Since my first day on the job, State Farm has been making ""the transition"" and nearly five years later they have yet to complete it. The transition plan seems to change from month to month as upper management has the next fever dream they decide to execute on the next big cost saving measure that will eventually get thrown out in a couple months after employees and customers severely dislike it. There are some remarkable aspects about this company such as the benefits package that is nearly unrivaled with other large employers. Along with the many aspects of this company State Farm is revising, the benefits may take a hit after I post this review. Hopefully this company can figure out what direction they would like to go in before every customer and employee jumps ship."
good,Statefarm is located in a great place on the bus line. I learn a lot about insurance claims and was effective communication which prepared me for the job I am working now.
good,I enjoyed working with my team! We were all determined to give value to each and every customer at the right price. Unfortunately we also had poor management which led each of us astray to find another job.
good,"Not a difficult job, definitely need to provide excellence customer service. Worked in the response center so I endured many claim calls. Could be somewhat demanding speaking to insured's in difficult settings."
good,"state farm is a good company, but the company no longer pays a salary that is livable. the good paying jobs are far in between,  if a person is  qualified for the job,  wait time to get the job is 2-3 years to get a interview, even then a person may not be able to move the into the job because of manning problems at a person previous position.  Management just cares about numbers. which they use for justification for bonus, days off and salary increase."
good,Quoting clients processing payments answering phone calls Interpreter for non English speaking clients. Planning for college making important decisions regarding Life insurance.
good,"State Farm used to be a customer oriented and employee friendly.  Unfortunately their model (using agencies) cannot keep up with the internet model most companies are moving too.   The overhead of paying Agent commissions is an albatross around their neck.  They now cut corners in every aspect of their business to try and save a few pennies.   "
good,it truly depends on the agent. An agent is a person whom you will work for unless you work in the service centers.  State Farm has been doing more commercial lately..
good,It was interesting to see the vehicle types and the different costs to repair them. I enjoyed talking to and helping customers deal with the unexpected.
good,"SOME of the managers are really nice, the others are on a power trip. The people I worked with were fantastic I'm glad I got to know them when I did. It can be really stressful during hurricane season alot of overtime as you want it. sometimes you have to do mandatory overtime but you have the option of breaking it up (at least when i was there anyway)"
good,"Great place to learn "
good,"A typical day was reviewing medical reports and bills. Verifying the injuries that were billed were related to the motors vehicle accident.  If so, pay them up until policy policy limits.  Review any Arbitraton or Law Suits  that come in for processing."
good,"Too many reorgs and transitions have led to too many excellent people being let go.  The company, higher executives, used to care more.  Now it's just about the numbers, and they're letting go experienced people for lower paying, low quality employees."
good,"State Farm Training was not structured enough."
good,"With the growth of GEICO and Progressive State Farm is toppling from the top. As they try and make changes to keep policyholders, that means more and more sacrifices from the employees."
good,I love working there but it doesn't pay enough to raise 2 girls. The work environment is good and the atmosphere is nice but this is an entry level position for the young.
good,"We have many tasks to complete per day, in addition to being expected to sell State Farm products. State Farm has many resources available to its agents."
good,"Depending on your managers discretion, you may find yourself involved with routine job functions and learning the State Farm way. But as time and experience builds confidence in your supervision, you are exposed to more and more special projects with increased exposure to leadership."
good,"I worked for quite a few years for State Farm.  As the company continued to go through changes, it did  not appear that the employees were no longer important to the company."
good,"Overall, working for State Farm was fine, It was a very simple job that required almost no thinking at all. However, as with most customer service jobs, it was also very boring."
good,I worked as a customer service representative helping clients obtain auto and homeowners insurance. I enjoyed interacting with the clients and ensuring that their needs were taken care of.
good,"I enjoyed working at State Farm for about 5 years. I was in the sales department. The last year I worked there I had 3 different managers all who were completely different. The last one was dishonest and it was frustrating to work with him when he would say one thing to you, but a minute later say something completely different to another. "
good,Management in the Sales Contact Center is sub par. Directors are micro-managers and don't hold all leaders accountable for their work or even showing up.
good,This position was entry level. I would not recommend this job for anyone who is more advanced in their career. Great opportunity if you just relocated to Atlanta.
good,State Farm still uses a very old quote/sales program. This has been mentioned to be replaced since before I started in 2012 and is still in place today in 2019.
good,State Farm is a well organized and managed company.  Competitive rates and products that meet the needs of their customers.  They have generous policies that cover more than other smaller carriers.  Great claim service.
good,State Farm offers great benefits and pay. Front line management is typically very good. Upper management is questionable.  The company is in the process of restructuring their claim model from a highly customer focused environment to a high volume call center environment.  Over the past few years the staffing has been inadequate to keep up with production goals and provide the type of high quality service State Farm built its reputation on.
good,Management is overbearing and hard to work with at times. The money is really good. They have a new point system that they manipulated to get people they don't like out.
good,"A typical day was going through and calling leads. Leads were not very good, so important to develop your own. You have to network a lot, otherwise it's hard to make money..."
good,"The benefits at State Farm are really good.  The pay is reasonable for the amount of work done everyday. You do get two months of training prior to going out on the floor, but the training isn't up to date with new processes and procedures.  Also, each manager likes things done differently. The lack of uniformity sometimes causes confusion for employees and, not surprisingly, customers too."
good,"Ok company with a lot of room for growth and technology. The culture is decent though. I believe if you work hard you can succeed. Also, knowing and having the right connections can definitely help. The way folks are treated is not always consistent and fair."
good,I enjoyed providing good customer service to our policyholders. i enjoyed my work environment & worked with great people.  I enjoyed my time with State Farm.
good,It was an okay work environment. Poor management and lack of direction. They expected employees to be perfect and it was not a very relaxed environment.
good,"This company used to be a desirable place to work. With the current CEO and his narrow minded view of why workers come to work, it is losing its status quickly.  Good place to come and work for a couple years and then get out.  No real long term opportunities."
good,"I would make cold calls most of the day, which doesn't sound too bad, but if you are more service-oriented than selling insurance is not in your best interest probably. I loved my agent, but it was not a good fit for me personally. The most stressful part for me was the lack of training I received. Learning as you go can be costly in insurance because every mistake matters."
good,"Decent work life balance because I never had to take my work home with me. "
good,"its very easy work but its not pleasant when working on commissions when having a family ."
good,"•	Processes and settles total loss claims"
good,"Not busy."
good,"My experience was working for an independent insurance agent.  State Farm was a good company to work for.  The State Farm agencies are all individually operated, therefore I did not work for corporate."
good,"No benefits, minimal growth opportunity, and antiquated. Pay can be good, the systems are very outdated but there is a laid back environment and small offices."
good,"flew me out for specialized training, I recommend working for this company if possible, training instructors were patient and thorough when going over materials"
good,Typical corporate cubicle culture.  Great people and managers doing their best.  Corporate one size fits all culture leads to micormanaging and generally unhappy workforce.
good,"State Farm is a lot better than other auto insurance companies. In the past, companies like The General and Safe Auto would jack up the rate every time I had to renew the policy, even though I never filed a claim or caused any trouble. State Farm keeps the rate steady and reasonable. I've been with them for a few years, and I'm glad I don't have to hop around between companies anymore."
good,"you take inbound calls from existing and new customers, help set up policies for auto and home/renters. "
good,"In the past this was a top notch company to work for, most recently the culture has changed. Company seems to be more about the bottom line than about employees. They have great benefits if live where main office hubs are."
good,"I worked here immediately out of high school, and consequently dealt with a considerable learning curve. There was little to love about this job, but also little to hate."
good,Quite a bit of interaction with customers on a daily basis. Not the best place for growth unless you choose to become an Insurance agent yourself. Good starting point to get the Customer Service experience in.
good,"This is a good temporary job, not a career path unless you really  love insurance.  The industry is very demanding as are the customers. Insurance for the most part is a scam and you will spend the better part of the day explaining to customers why their rates are going up and why their claims are not being paid.  It truly is a labor of love and not for the weak of heart."
good,"Since I was placed by a temporary agency to work at Statefarm, I wasn't allowed to receive many benefits.  Or allowed to participate in many of the events so my experience is biased.  Temporary employees were treated as second-rate employees about 80% of the time due to company restrictions. It was difficult at times to deal with some of the in-house employees who did not have a professional background or credentials to handle their job duties.  Some of the in-house employees were concerned that they may lose their job to a more qualified temporary employee. This was at a time when the recession had caused many layoffs."
good,"State Farm is a good place to work but the culture and structure needs updating to make things better for the employees.  "
good,"Felt like a reliable job until State Farm decided to restructure its business model to support the customers needs or so they say.  Great benefits and solid stock options.  Pay could always be better, recommend it if you like working in a cubicle"
good,"Good Company. Producer of Insurance, good products and timely processing of policies. Competitive products as well. Must be a go getter to be successful."
good,This is a good place to work overall. It is a relaxed and laid back atmosphere. You get to meet and talk to a lot of new people. I would recommend this place to work.
good,"State Farm was a great place to work for at the beginning of my career, being a tradition-based, family oriented and employee focused company.  Now, not so much.  Many of the traditions are gone as well as jobs.  "
good,Fun and supportive work place. Nice staff and CEO. Allowed for independent work space. Good location and able to reach targeted goals. Good commission rate for leads obtained.
good,it was okay as a entrance into insurance. There is a lot to learn and room for growth. the opportunity is what you make of it. Do not like working under agents though.
good,I appreciate the opportunities presented to me at State Farm over the course of my 5 years with them. The benefits package included a pension which I loved.
good,"Job duties changed and sales became the focus more than the initial position I was hired for.  If you are looking for a sales position, this would be a good fit."
good,The stress level is extremely high. The goals are unrealistic. You are micromanaged the majority of the time. The only good thing is that you are surrounded by alot of food places
good,"Be willing to relocate and keep up with licensing "
good,State Farm is full of amazing people who are genuinely kind. The problem that it faces is that it has become so large and so bureaucratically minded that it is unable to adapt to change. It's policies and procedures are applied uniformly across the nation without regard to regional differences. It is likely with the current culture and leadership it will sadly go the way of blockbuster and I can not in good conscience recommend it as a good investment opportunity.
good,Its a good starting sales position but there are no benefits or retirement planning. Its a small office setting so that nice and relaxed you must meet commission goals to make any money and on top of that there is no healthcare or anything offered
good,"I enjoyed working with the people in my department. great benefits, flexible schedules but could use more helpful supervisors. Fast paced but fulfilling."
good,This was a pretty good place to work most of the time. Work/life balance can be difficult at times and sometimes overtime is mandatory in order to meet needs.
good,"a typical day of work, what I learned, management, workplace culture, the hardest part of the job, the most enjoyable part of the job, do not include con"
good,Good Place To Work. Great people. Great environment and they are always looking to hire new people who are willing to work hard and get to work on time.
good,Nice place to work at. It becomes a family but helps out when needed. Competitive salary but you work hard to earn unless the site is already established.
good,long hours low pay and the agents are very greedy they care about sales and growth not doing what is right for customer. too much overlay and red tape
good,"State Farm has a low wage compared to other companies for same job."
good,"Provided me with good tools to transition into a more elite sales role. Great boss in Destin, Fl. Hardest part of the job was doing the same thing day after day. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with the people."
good,It was a great job i just couldn’t pass the test. As much as i tried to be able to pass the test for me it was hard. I kept pursuing other dreams to expand my knowledge.
good,"Seem some of the other departments were okay but everyone knows that claims is the worst, No one wants to work in the department. The work structure is designed to stress you out for no reason, even if the customer praises you, or you help the customer to the fullest or you make the numbers that are required in the metrics, These managers will tell you everything that is wrong with your performance but will never praise your improvements. The most difficult part of the job is the Metrics system put in place. This system is unrealistic and the standards that it is kept up isn't worth the aggrevation. NO ONE seems to know what they are doing including the managers. but they require them to hold you to a high standard on a system they don't understand and they accuse you of making mistakes that they themselves make mistakes on evaluating you on. Its a circus in claims."
good,The pay and benefits are good but management will seek to let go experienced people to save money when business is not going well.  Cheaper to hire replacements at lower pay/benefits.
good,The company could improve in their training and management/ employee communication. Management could do more to aid in the development of their team members.
good,State Farm was a fun place to work but the compensation was overall very low and required a very high volume.  Due to the nature of the auto insurance business the majority of the time we were much higher in price.
good,State Farm is such a broad and large company that my small role cannot accurately and definitively gauge the experience that others may have.  I had my good days and bad like most other people.
good,"Each agent will run their office differently. It was stressful trying to drum up your own leads. State Farm is a good company, they are my insurance company for my cars, home and boat. I just didn't enjoy the pressure."
good,State Farm is a great place for training only. I recommend all my friends to go for the training itself and than apply elsewhere. SF pays contractors more than actual employees.
good,"Typically a day consistent of answering phone calls for servicing existing customers and making outbound calls to generate new business. Calls made are from leads bought by the agent, calling from the leads list or book, and calling from the phonebook to attempt to get new quotes."
good,Enjoyed my time there. Answering customer calls kept me going the entire day. The company gives employees resources to be successful at their jobs. Great company
good,I enjoy the work that I did. The office was friendly but at times hostile due to owner being very micro managing. That was the hardest part for me because I've been in the business for a very long time and I understand my work duties. Sometimes too much micro managing can cause to start lacking and I don't want that. Insurance is not just a job to me. It's a career I take pride in.
good,Overworked and understaffed.  Poor work/life balance.  Poor management.  Systems out of date.  Negative environment.  Not one of my co-workers enjoyed the job.
good,I was able to find jobs I enjoyed. I was self-motivated and kept a customer focus for both internal and external customers. I sought out mentors to help me navigate new positions and obtain business knowledge.
good,"Overall a decent company to work for, definitely not the highest paying. Metrics can be met it just takes time. Work life balance depends on the department, I have worked in a department where it was easy to get days off and another where it was close to impossible. I don't have any major complaints about the company, there are technology advancements that need to be made, along with making sure that when rash decisions are made that loyal dedicated employees are considered. Half of everyone I have come to know has left due to low pay for work d=performed."
good,"I ended up relocating on my own to accept a position at State Farm and after less than a year at the position it was determined that the office will be closing by the end of this year. This is, needless to say, disappointing after moving cross country. Though I will say that the work environment and overall company culture at State Farm has been supportive, it is a very fast-paced work environment not for the faint-hearted. State Farm is very metrics driven, and I believe the metrics cause them to lose sight of the most important factor of their line of work - the customers. The most recent focus has become more about handling a higher call volume than being able to provide the best customer service possible. The company does provide great benefits, but compensation is not always as fair as it should be, in my humble opinion."
good,Employees are friendly and some will assist with any questions or concerns.  Some management was very helpful and resourceful.  The overall company is a good company.
good,It has been too long since I have worked for State Farm Bank (Mortgage Loan Department). I did enjoy working there until the beginning of the housing market crash.
good,Claim handling is a challenging occupation and requires a great deal of patience.  An adjuster needs to be organized and proactive with their work.  High volume.
good,"Enjoyed being a part of a large company.  Employment was enjoyable however, once I learned about the opportunities to sell both Personal and Business/Commercial products, I decided 19 years later to leave."
good,"office work "
good,I was hired on through a staffing company. My time there was ok . I do feel it is a lot of thing that they could improve on. I enjoyed the transistion to my new job.
good,"Job quality here will really depend on what position you have in company, whether your position is workforce managed (read: micromanaged), and whether or not your manager feels like being a power player."
good,"Abundance of restructuring taking place.  Significant cultural change over the past several years, and I expect the ""transformational"" feel to continue for some time."
good,The manager was very flexible and understanding of my situation. He ran a very good work environment and would recommend him. The co-workers were also easy and fun to work with.
good,"The job has no rewards for their employees which can lead to low morale. Just as well, the stats are hard to maintain and hard to understand. But, the pay is good for the area and the job itself is not too hard."
good,"The company is becoming less personalized for the agent and the customer.  Makes a lot of long term customers upset and they leave.  SF starves their agents, which pushes them to make unethical choices."
good,"I would spend the day keeping on top of paperwork and underwriting and the rest hunting for new business to write."
good,"State Farm offered a wonderful training program within the span of 1.5 years. The trainers were dedicated to teach us from the ground up. I started with a 100+ group of associates, majority new to the company. It was not what I had expected, but have gained so much experience that I am forever grateful for; however, there are not as many opportunities in the operations centers than there are in the hubs. For example, in the past few months I have been working on attending as many development classes as possible. It seems unfair that the hubs are allowed a class every month when I have only been able to attend one in my location (second opportunity was cancelled due to low interest) and am unable to attend virtually in the other hubs. The demands are centered for the hubs, but when you have hundreds of other employees in other areas showing obvious interest to advance there is little interest returned. I am a member of various committees which helps break up the monotony of the day; but, it is deflating seeing little career growth while I am trying so hard to become a well-rounded employee. I was greatly interested in the company with what seemed like an enthusiastic interest from leadership for future job advancement due to having a degree. I think it is an unfortunate time to begin a career in the company while it is going through many transitional phases."
good,There a sense of job security working here. In my experience they tend to pay employees below the market. Minorities tend to struggle in advancing their career
good,A decent place if your young and just getting out of college. They have a long training class that can go on for months. They offer tuition reimbursement.
good,"State Farm is a secure place to work with opportunities to find the best position for yourself. "
good,If you like insurance it is a perfect place to work. It is a good place to learn skills that you can translate to other industries later on if you choose to do so.
good,Was a great entry level job.  I learned a lot about the insurance business.  I learned great customer service traits.  Schedule was flexible and great.
good,State Farm has been a good company to work for. I enjoy the people I work and the hours but there has been a lot of change. The hardest part of the job is the amount of claims worked each day.
good,I have worked with a lot of great people.  However the work culture is currently numbers obsessed.  Every part of your work day is measured and review continually.
good,"A day at work would consist of answering calls and maintaining the book of business. Sydney was a crook, no one liked her and clients hated dealing with her."
good,I was released due to downsizing. I am neutral with this company.  I was not there long enough to make a difference.  I would not go back because the downsize came
good,Working at State Farm provide me with an excellent opportunity for advancement and honing of my interpersonal skills.  Being able to help people plan for their future and protect their families is very satisfying.
good,There are always changing something. They do not train you like the use too. Since the CEO changed it has not been the same.  They have great PTO and willing o work with you.
good,"My review would be unfair because it has been over 20 years since I worked there and the company has made several changes. The compensation was very good, the company was a good employer."
good,It's a very hectic fast paced office have to be able to multi-task. The customers are demanding but the day goes pretty fast because we are always busy
good,"Entered claim information, mail room sorting, ordering of supplies, customer service, processing applications of newly insured candicates, the most enoyable part of the job was customer service."
good,"Working for State Farm was a good overall experience, however like most insurance positions, it is a very demanding job, meaning working 24/7 everywhere you go and constant occupation in a constant work-like environment."
good,"State Farm was once thought of as a working family of employees. Many people were hired because they were family members of current employees.  One program had a nurse visit you if you were sick for a period of time to check on your health.  This and many other programs that were geared towards the well being of the employees has been eliminated.  Now production is tracked by numbers and computer entries and the employees have become a number. The most frustrating part of the State Farm culture is the lack of knowledge of management.  In many cases, management knows nothing about the skills needed to perform the job that their employees have to know, yet they evaluate these employees annually.  How can this be fairly done?  It can't, and deserving employees are rated unfairly because of this lack of knowledge."
good,Work place could be stressful at times but overall work environment was pleasant.  Some managers needed more training.  Hard to reach out to HR at times.
good,"I wish not to express my feelings online nor do i wish to write a review, however this system is wanting me to write something to here it is. More text"
good,The job security in the last few years went down.  My job was out- sourced by Sedgwick. Too many lay offs to feel secure within the enterprise.  Eager to find something new that will I will feel value in working for a better company.
good,"Its an OK company."
good,i spent a lot of my time expanding on the agents community presence as well as clerical work. cold calling and travel were vital parts of my duties and tasks as an intern
good,"State Farm writes/underwrites and sales auto insurance"
good,good learning bussness and sales. pays for your training and commission on all sales. easy job make calls and set behind the desk and sell insurance ..
good,"Handling and settling claims was a typical work day.  I learned that there were a lot of people you had to make happy on each claim."
good,"Going through some changes, but still a good company. Great benefits and competitive pay. Schedules can be challenging for balancing work and life. If willing to relocate great opportunities."
good,"When you take a position in an independent agent office  you are not an State Farm employee you are an employee of the agent and benefits, 401K, PTO, etc. may not be apart of their offer to you. Be mindful that all agents can run their office the way in which they see fit and the office culture varies from one office to the next, including compensation."
good,"Since I was a part of the leadership team I was able to help influence the culture in my department. With that being said it was a relaxed, high performing environment."
good,"I worked an internship at an agency. It was very flexible but I often ran out of things to do when I came in. If you enjoy sales, it is a great place to work."
good,"In general I really enjoyed my time working at ""the farm'.  Everywhere you go there is a smiling face. Everyone I work with is so friendly.  Working in insurance is a great way to help people and customers are calling you because they are in some sort of crises.  They are closing many offices to move everyone to certain hub locations.  Because of this thousands of people are losing their jobs if they cannot relocated.  Not everyone can do this and it leaves good people who planned on retiring there out looking for new jobs.  The benefits are great though including health, dental and day care spending accounts."
good,"The work atmosphere is relaxed and friendly, but advancement opportunities are low. Monthly sales goals can be difficult to hit, making commission difficult to earn at maximum levels."
good,"Decent job with flexible hours and willingness to be adjusted. Not too stressful but a lot is asked of you, need to know multiple systems and processes."
good,"the company is a wonderful company to work for, but over the past 6 years, things have changed. the employees haven't been treated equally, and the way the business aspect is going is making the customers unhappy as well."
good,"I am an early adopter of change and appreciate where technology is taking us as whole. That said, I believe we are getting away from ourselves and losing the human connection that made us who/what we are today."
good,The company is a good company for beginners who are new to the insurance industry. The job can be hard due to constant changes that are never consistent.
good,Sink or swim. The other Producer in the office was caring and very helpful. There was not not enough training in the area of billing. You can't help someone else understand if you don't know what you are talking about.
good,"A typical day at work was executing recovery from claimants and serve as Catastrophe Adjuster when needed.   I learned to work as a team player no matter the situation.  "
good,I did not like sitting in an office all day making cold calls to people who were not interested in insurance. I'm sure it could be a nice long term career for someone else.
good,"Whether or not State Farm is a good place to work really depends on what department you're in at the company. For me it was alright. I was in the call center for CCC Sales. Its not a bad job. Some will find it enjoyable actually. It's most certainly not Afni level bad. Call centers just aren't for some people. I found the job horribly stressful, did not enjoy it in the slightest, but couldn't seem to get out of it. Also, with all the layoffs there was no guarantee the job I got would be secure. With that info in mind I left the company and went back to college to get a more marketable degree. I'm not going to bash the company. Its got a great culture (overall) and benefits. The pay is fantastic too. It just wasn't for me."
good,"okay company to work for, competitive salary and PTO"
good,Customer service and sales calls daily. I enjoy having my own office and working independently. Being able to control my own day. It is a very busy and stressful job that requires a lot of multi-tasking.
good,I would like a friendlier company. State Farm did not welcome new hires very well as they liked to focus on their current producers more to allow for being more competetive in the market
good,"Okay starter job. It is worth it if you want to get your foot into the door in the insurance industry, but it is not worth it if you are looking for a long term career."
good,State Farm provided great benefits. When I started I instantly started accumulating personal time off (PTO). Most of the people are great to work with. It can be really stressful trying to make the required daily goals.
good,"Been here now for 5 years and even I can tell it's not the same company that I started with 5 years ago. Previous role as a CIR specialist was sunset and had to apply to a different role just to keep a job. Now I'm in a role in the CCC Support Center which consists of talking to internal customers and troubleshooting hardware and software applications. Majority of calls are from State Farm agents or staff who want you to hold their hands throughout the entire call and some with a false sense of entitlement. The pay is ok but definitely the environment has changed and not the ""family and fun"" oriented company that it once was. The Attendance and point system is HORRIBLE and not having paid sick leave hours is a pain if you're ill and have to use your vacation time to cover yourself."
good,I liked the people I worked for and with. It was a small office and I learned more about customer service and the right questions to ask when customers called. It was a bit difficult to talk to others in the office because it seemed very strict and ALL business.
good,"Answering phones. Quote and Bind insurance. Outside sales, corrections and payment sales. Outside Rental marketing. State Farm Bank deposits. Handles Auto Claims."
good,All the employees had worked together for a long time and there was a strong feeling of being an outsider.  Too much time was spent socializing.  The incentives offered did not appeal to me.
good,I worked the phones to handle B2C and grow business by selling policies. I enjoyed the work but the quota structure was tough since it demanded some of all type of policies to be sold in order to collect commission.
good,Challenging work environment with people who like to do well.  Some aspects of job both stressful and exciting.  The workplace culture is good and friendly.
good,"The job offered the opportunity to earn an uncapped amount of money, but you have to put in a lot of work to earn a high amount from commission. It is a fairly relaxed work environment."
good,"I was in an office where the owner was on a contract year. He received reviews every 3 months leading up to a final review 12 months in. He didn't satisfy the growth his supervisor was looking for and received a ""no""."
good,"State farm was an okay place to do an internship. You will succeed if you are a good sales person, but it is very competitive and hard to make a living."
good,"Much to do in a limited amount of time each day which added stress; however, my work is fulfilling and employees are generously compensated."
good,"temporary assignment with Spherion staffing Agency in San Jose California. I •	Claims Support process, conducted outbound calls to Insurance Companies, to confirm valid liability coverage, open claims, and exchanged information nation wide"
good,"I had great coworkers and a flexible schedule; the environment was business casual, and we had so much fun doing give-aways for our clients.  The best thing about working for State Farm was giving back to the community by participating in local school and chamber of commerce events."
good,I enjoy everyday I get up and come to work until I see my paycheck and remember that I am way too under paid for the work that I do but at the end of the day it doesn't matter to the people making the high bucks
good,This is a metrics based environment. State Farm Insurance  offers pretty decent healthcare insurance packages. They match 401K contributions annually.
good,Typically average to fairly above average working environment. Job satisfaction is average to nominally above above average. Good team environment. Would work there again!
good,rates and dropped customers are your enemy here so get used to seeing a lot of this.  I would suggest independent instead.   Like a good neighbor state farm has dropped you.
good,"Always busy, never a dull moment."
good,"Complex work environment, but great promotion opportunities. A great place to learn and grow. The most enjoyable  part of the job is helping customers in their time of need or loss."
good,"Sales isn't the field for me, but I had a decent boss. Was frequently on call outside of normal business hours to take care of customer issues. Scattershot training."
good,Production is very important here. Selling is something you must love to do in order to enjoy the work environment. The pay isn't as great as you'd think!
good,"Assist claim handlers in setting up claim files, filing correspondence and other material related to claim records, set up"
good,"benefits and co ethic makes up"
good,In the claim department they really dont care about the customers they only care about the amount o money they can bring in. They rather you rush the claims verses delivering excellent customer service and excellent work for the customers sake. The managers do not know how to be professional in the department I was in now when I was in SFPP the were well organized and the managers kept it professional. I guess every department has different standards.
good,"With the retirment of the former CEO, the new CEO has turned the company from a family environment to a corporate environment with puppets as Managers and Supervisors. No sense of togetherness anymore. Everything is number driven with little to no work-;ife balance"
good,Well I guess they are doing something right as there are agents everywhere and if you like to sell sell sell then it is the place for you with a little bit of service.
good,"My job was to follow up with pending customer who got insurance with State Farm. I would check e-mails and received phone calls. I would provide quotes and work with Hispanic people who did not know English to provide them this service. It was important to meet with the goals and open new policies. What I enjoyed most was the staffs I work with, we all work as a team."
good,"Fast Paced. On the phones the whole time. Management is poor. Workplace is not the best either. If you don't understand anything, they are willing to help you out though."
good,This was an a fun atmosphere and I met several interesting people while working here. During my time I trained on some of the ins and outs of the insurance business and became more familiar with how the process actually works behind the scenes.
good,Pretty boring usually.  The agents expect you to grow their business without providing leads in the older agents' offices.  If you work for a new agent they will provide leads but a lot of times the leads are bad.  Be prepared to be asked to try to sell insurance to all of your friends and family.
good,"fun job but the management was iff. fast paced at times, manager was stuck in between wanting to be her employees friends but at the same time she would threaten firing them"
good,12 hour days. training could be better for the position they put you in. management above the team leads is ok. hardest part of the job is meeting some of the unrealistic quotas in place.
good,"The company is good and they did a lot for me. A few years ago, the business model changed and with it, the culture did as well. No longer did we have ""fun"" at work and it was all about cutting costs and doing more work with fewer employees. They laid off knowledgeable, tenured employees by relocating jobs to 4 different cities. Many cannot move so they either retired or quit. Recently, the company had a huge loss in revenue - many attributed the loss to the new way of doing business and the lack of remarkable customer service. Many employees no longer ""care"" about the company. No matter how good of an employee a person is, your job can go away. There is no longer such a thing as job security at State Farm."
good,competitive... a typical day job... you will learn a lot on the fly no real training program. work place culture varies from office to office. The hardest part of working with state farm is dealing with rude customers.
good,I loved working for statefarm except for all the cold calling and not getting paid unless you write a policy on a brand new never been with state farm customer.  It's nearly impossible to find someone one who has not had state farm at least once in their lifetime.
good,"Overall State Farm was a good company to work for since offices can be small its a tight knit environment. There is also opportunity to meet other colleagues from different offices at company events. Since each agency is independently owned, benefits can vary. I had no health insurance or 401K, vacation time was considered the same as sick time and only had 80 hours for the year. Advancing within State Farm is kind of difficult to do unless you're looking to run/open your own office. Commission was not the worst but commission pay back was horrible."
good,"The benefits with State Farm are excellent. However, the company is making changes that will eventually lead to the closing of some of the  offices, including the one I currently work in. Because of this, there is limited availability to improve and grow within the company."
good,My work environment was a call center. Therefore it was precisely timed calls and quality monitoring. The most enjoyable part of the job were the  work hours.
good,"You can learn a lot about insurance from this job. This position is mostly based on commission, so it can be a little stressful to make your quota every month."
good,"Good place to work, great co workers.  The inconsistency of management makes it a confusing place to work.  They seem more interested in your production than your overall well being.  We run out of work pretty regularly, but they continue to tell you need to do more."
good,I commuted 140 miles a day at the time the pay was excellent the work was rather easy and the benefits were excellent I enjoyed my time with the company
good,"I worked for a bad agency so my review may be biased. I enjoyed working for this company. It taught me individuality, patience, freedom, courage, and diligence"
good,every agency has a different agent. The experience you have will depend on the agent you work for. I made a decent salary being a top producing agent.
good,"A good job and competitive wages, but it so competitive that good hard working people get look over and push back for other that really don't do the work but act like the did."
good,Good company to work for.  Nice people to work with.  Smart co-workers to work with  and able to learn a lot about the Insurance industry.  Good way to learn about all fields of insurance.
good,Indpendently owned and managed. Not all agents know how to manag an office or its employees. No real growth once you are in an office unless you become an agent.
good,"Great company with high expectations for their reputation. Not much work life balance but they are stable and can demand what they want, and they do. The resources available is priceless, but will you have time to take advantage of them."
good,a typical day at work started with getting papers from the last receptionist there. Calling the customers that they didn't get a chance to call. We made calls to people to see if they wanted to become clients to state farm. The management could have been better.
good,The job was a marketing job based on cold calls and inbound sales calls.  The management was inconsistent in handing out work duties.  I left before the situation became worse.
good,"Internal culture is changing.  lThey are not focused on customers or on employees, so I'm not sure what their focus is right now.  I'm pretty sure they don't know what it is either. I'm hoping they come out of numerous restructures/realignments a better company."
good,Very fast -  paced work environment.  Nice company to work for.  You are paid salary and if you don't finish your work you stay over to finish it.  The co workers are very nice and helpful.  The pay isn't terrific.
good,While I worked at State Farm I was hired to be an assistant. The problem was since I was a fully licensed insurance agent at the time. I was expected but not paid to be an actual agent. This was very frustrating since my boss left everyday at 2 to play golf or do whatever he wanted leaving me to man the ship if you will.
good,"Entry level positions at this employer are call center positions, meaning you are on the phone all day and from my experience often with mandatory overtime due to poor scheduling/organization. The job pays well because the city is expensive to live in but the metrics can be frustrating to overcome due to strict guidelines enforced by subjective employees that follow their own set of rules for grading. As a result promotions can feel out of your control unless a robotic disposition is something you have naturally. Most of the higher level positions are out of state and would require relocation-which could affect your pay depending on the cost of living in the new state. "
good,state farm is a big company that works kind of like a huge bank and insurance company with a twist. they offer so much that to some it can be overwhelming at times.
good,"Could be a good job if you are comfortable and motivated to sell products. They have a variety of products from auto and home insurance to life and health insurance, and mutual funds."
good,"State Farm has chosen numbers over quality.  Very stressful environment.  Although the benefits are excellent, I would not recommend working there.  It is now a call center environment and employees are not treated as professionals."
good,State Farm Jobs are a dime a dozen. Agency staff can be a revolving door. Find a agent who cares about customers and not just the bottom line number. Pay is average to lower end depending on your sales ability.
good,"Good Place to work. Professional and great teamwork environment!"
good,"Pay is great, not much work/life balance. Employees are awesome, love the people I work with. Good paid time off, but not much capacity to take time off."
good,"A typical day at work doesn't change much at State Farm in TDP, basically doing the same hing every day all day. That's probably the hardest part - its super boring. It pays really well and the people are alright. Management isn't super great, especially if you need an accommodation, but not the worst managers I've had."
good,"Claims is a fast paced environment, continual changes. Your schedule must remain flexible If your in school or have kids you have to work around the schedule your provided in claims. The other departments such as Underwriting have more flexibility and advancements"
good,"Great benefits and pension plan after 5 years there. Pay is  bad for industry standards. Give it a shot, the opportunities are there if you work hard for them."
good,My time here has allowed me to learn more about the insurance industry and other roles. It has been the booster to me receiving my adjuster's license and hopefully will boost my career.
good,Typical work day was busy.  Everything I know about working in an office environment I learned at State Farm.  It was my first full time job out of high school. Management was easy to approach and get along with.
good,"the systems were hard to learn and the training was sub par. when I needed help, it was like pulling teeth. the agent owner was nice but the office manager was not"
good,I worked for an agent.  The company has a great culture and strong values.  Competitive pricing within some markets.  I would recommend becoming an agent.
good,"State Farm has 2 types of employees...the ones that are connected and are able to coast (and frankly are lucky to be there). And then those who have had to prove themselves and work hard to get where they are at. If you are part of the latter group (like me), you'll find that once you finally get into a job that matches your skill-set, you are dumped on relentlessly and taken advantage of while the people that were connected and have been able to coast all their lives sit around all day drinking coffee. Honestly, I'm not normally a person that advocates for laying people off, but State Farm has a lot of dead weight loss working in that company and those that are competent are worked to the max and become burned out."
good,The particular Agent I worked for was hard to please but loved the position and people I worked with.  Miss it.  It's nice to go to work and go home!!
good,"Good insurance company, just need to iron out some in office issues.  Have never seen a company go to the links this office does to take care of their customers."
good,"good place to improve, helpful manager. No diversity. Forced call calls. forced into sales afterwards.   Work independantly is required.  Life sales required"
good,"When I worked at this employer, I loved it.  I haven't worked at State Farm in 8 years; therefore I can only wright about my time here and not current"
good,"was hired at a point in which the business was doing poorly with many workers on differents leave agreements, and ""layed off"" once other workers returned from leave"
good,It was an introduction into insurance. They need a better training program. Thrown in quickly to all situations. owner didn't have time or patience to train.
good,Not the best work environment. Coworkers were great but Corporate was profit hungry. They let anyone become an Agent whether they have formal business education or experience or not.
good,"no benefits offered, that sucks. Pay is different every month. Potential to make more but when the business is slow, not much you can do. NC rate increases are driving a lot of people away from State Farm and when our prices are higher no one will buy with us."
good,"Budget for projects is cut drastically each year. Huge changes since Michael Tipsord took over as CEO and it really seems to be impacting customer experience and employee happiness. Cutting back drastically ability on work from home and closing multiple offices across the country. "
good,"I learned work is only hard if you make it that way. Working with ""family"" makes the day go faster. I also learned, you can't stay at a workplace you are not dedicated to do."
good,"Great place to work, fun and inviting job, decent pay and benefits, Managers were not that great, were brought in from other fields and did not know the area they were managing."
good,"The position was not for me and therefore, my success was limited to the desire I put into the job.  There were a lot of favoritism in the office I was involved in."
good,Overall its good. Culture is good. Lot of importance for professional development. You get lot of help in work and processes. Very strong management team
good,"Low pay for a company of this size."
good,"Enjoyable job, great hours. The hardest part of the job would have to be meeting sales goals and dealing with difficult customers. "
good,They hired me and a few others then after a few weeks they eliminated the cold calling position and laid us all off. We were only working 12 hours a week to begin with.
good,"good company to work but but its more management oriented."
good,"I was a temp. Internal were treated differently. more job security etc. If given the opportunity to be internal, I would have taken it. "
good,Great Company to work for. Corporate is great if you have questions on submissions or if you can or can not write a particular piece of business. Claims are helpful too.
good,the job it self was very easy and laid back. But the supervisors had there picks and always had jokes about the employee but was serious at the same time..
good,"The best part of the job was training the staff which helped our office work as a great team together for understanding & working well to help our clients. It was always rewarding to assist our clients to provide the best coverage & give them the knowledge of the insurance policies they have. Selling & servicing multiple lines of insurance, along with the daily duties of running the office, from banking to making sure the office team ran smoothly was our typical day at work."
good,This job is very good if you are just starting out in the workforce. It helped me work on my customer service skills in person as well as on the phone.
good,The work itself is pretty boring and you can't make any real money unless you are selling life insurance.  If you have a passion for insurance this would be a good place to work.
good,"I have nothing bad to say about State Farm, great company I was simply laid off, when it was time for me to reapply there were already enough employees."
good,"Working for State Farm their computer systems are a little outdated for my standards. They are great with claims, but writing business and rates have been bad lately. Growth in company especially agents office is little to none. They mostly hire from outside fields to open up their new agencies."
good,Do a great job hiring employees.  Benefits are good.  Work environment positive and nice.  Would work there again if opportunities arose.  I like State Farm.
good,"This is an ok place to work but is very strict regarding attendance.  There is little room for advancement despite what they tell you in training, as I was awarded a promotion twice and each time my current department refused to release me and allow me to take the promotion."
good,Working at state farm is very lay back . The pace is very slow. Most day you wouldn't have much to do. Others days you were extremely busy with no time for lunch. Overall a good place to work.
good,"Used to be a place enjoyed working, culture has changed so much for the negative since new management last year. No longer treated like a professional, everything is micro-managed and no longer any growth opportunities unless you are willing to move out of state."
good,"The corporate numbers game has outweighed the human element State Farm used to be known for. This is not a bad company by any means, but work/life balance has taken one of the hardest hits, and that is something they used to be known for. Unfortunately when your people aren't happy it can be rather contagious in a very negative way. Not everything is bad though, the benefits are at least still competitive."
good,"My experience with this company began while enrolled in College, great organization to work for. Plenty of positions within the company, fast paced and challenging."
good,Compensation can be good if you are mobile and willing to move for promotion.  Otherwise can be difficult to advance in career.  Pay can be decent after years with the company.
good,Strong work environment. Great opportunities. Ability to move across the country. Opportunity to learn and grow on a daily basis and help customer receive the care they need
good,"I would recommend working here, good pay, decent benefits. If you need an entry level sales position with not much experience needed, try working in insurance. Training is provided and the compensation is awesome."
good,"In a lot of positions you are micro managed. Most of the jobs are pretty stressful.  You feel like you are never good enough. All about ""the numbers"".  If management felt like you were not ""making the numbers"", you would feel like a child being sent to the principal's office or feel degraded or ashamed for doing ""unsatisfactory work"".  I was told I didn't care about my job, which was just the complete opposite! It was very insulting!   "
good,This place was ok. I am not a fan of sitting at a desk all day so this was not the right position or career for me. If you enjoy selling insurance and being at a desk all day then this is probably the position for you.
good,"Poor compensation, high and unattainable sales goals. Highly discouraging as an agent team member. Would recommend a larger firm or independent insurance agent, instead."
good,"A great place to work, minus one major problem.  Your Manager has far too much influence on your success.  Great managers will create great morale and advocate for success while other managers will have an adverse affect on Associates chances of movement."
good,"Good company with long history. Historically took care of employees, but has since become more corporate in practice and care of the people who work there. I still have friends who work there, but don't feel it is the same."
good,State Farm is a great company to work for. Relaxed environment. Hardest part being at State Farm is the attendance policy. State Farm has great benefits
good,SF is a great place to work with lots to learn. Very competitve market with plenty of potential for growth and earnings. Offices in every city for easy commutes.
good,"SF instituted a points system in which they give points if you're absent or late. After accruing five or more points, you get written up. More than that, your job is in jeopardy. It wouldn't be so bad if the assignment of points were consistent. To make matters worse, they installed time clocks and time you down to the very minute you're supposed to be there or be off work. If your phone call with the customer lasts past the time of your break, you're out of adherence and get into trouble."
good,"Job is challenging and not heald in high regard. Other personal look down upon you & is tough to move up at postion level. Great benefits is nice, but lacking else where"
good,A typical day was simple. Everyone had the same responsibility and we all knew our roles. Things were calm as long as you stayed within your job role.
good,"Selling Auto, Health, Home, and Farm/Ranch Insurance"
good,"If you are working at an agency, you are not an employee of State Farm. You are an employee of the agent. The agent is the SF employee."
good,"assisted customers with sales and service ensuring proper coverage for their homes, vehicles and life insurance Took claims and  proper coveragereviewed policies to make sure"
good,Very humbling experience knowing what people go through on a daily basis. It's important to realize just because it hasn't happened to you yet doesn't mean it wont
good,"State Farm as a company has tremendous resources, but this was a family-owned operation with family members making all the decisions.  If you weren't family it was tough to make your opinion heard."
good,"Colleagues were all remote but very easy to work with and experienced. Management was not a good experience. Constant layoffs with no warning, very low morale as a result. Not an innovative work environment."
good,"if you are not cut by the state farm cookie cutter forget moving up."
good,"Friendly people to work with, face paced and good hours of operation. Good client to agent interaction and gain wide range of skills. I was able to learn at the job on the go."
good,Too many claims per person. Need more employees. Direct management has restricted decision making. Stressed and exhausted employees. Not being able to help the customer in and timely manner is very difficult. However helping a customer recover from their loss is satisfying.
good,"State Farm is a great company that not only helps to protect their clients, but also helps clients financially.  Working at State Farm has allowed me to grow personally and professionally.  I have seen the gratifying results of properly insuring a client and I have seen the smiling faces of a client who had no idea I could save them money by refinancing their current Vehicle Loan. "
good,"State Farm is a great company to work for, especially if your just getting started in the field.  They have amazing products such as insurance and even bank products."
good,Its very hard to grow a book of business within a community where there are an average of65 agents within Clinton Township Its hard to increase business.
good,"This wasn't a good environment for me. I was new to a call center environment such as this. The managers were cold and not trying to engage with the ""hired help""."
good,"Working at State Farm has provided me great skills within the organization, sales, and communications aspects. enuring that the people in your community are protected is very rewarding"
good,"They have a great credit union. The company is going through constant changes/downsizing. The production areas are expected to work at an unreasonably fast pace,"
good,This company has transitioned into a production base environment. There are many statistics that you are tracked on and held accountable for.  Good benefits though.
good,"Good place to work , people are nice. Good training. Benefits are good. Call center job, sit at a desk all day. Need open availability. Work/life balance ok depending on your personal life"
good,"Decent work place, work mainly off of commission.  Requires lots of customer service experience to insure the customer gets the optimal experience. Salary dependent on the agent you work for."
good,"If you are able to adapt to constant change, State Farm is the organization for you! It provides the opportunity for growth for entry level employees. Although the organization is going through various changes to stay competitive and the culture has evolved, it is a great company to work for."
good,"Listen to your front line employees-- the people actually doing the job. We are smart people and know what we are doing. We understand it costs the company money when our call times are 30 seconds longer than average. We understand that it means more people need to be on the phone. However, what management doesn't seem to understand is how frustrated the employees AND customers are with being rushed through the claim…"
good,"Great family atmosphere, hard work, you must have drive to succeed. Helpful but more hands on, do it yourself attitude is a must."
good,This is a very traditional company. It is a good place to learn the basics and grow in a large company. The biggest takeaway from the company is to learn quickly how to adapt to change. f
good,"I loved handling account and helping clients! My only con is that I do not have any real opportunities to grow! I loved to help people, I just wish I could do more!"
good,"Responsible for processing monthly production reports"
good,"State Farm invests time and money training their employees. Their philosophy is refreshing. The hardest part of the job is you're being watched,timed and recorded on each task and call."
good,State Farm has an overall good benefits program. Over the years I worked there I had the pleasure of working with a great management team and made many new friends along the way.
good,"I worked with State Farm for several years while raising my family, obtaining additional education and building my leadership abilities. State Farm is an excellent environment for employee growth. Work/life balance and company culture has changed immensely. I would recommend this job to the growing professional."
good,"Nice place to work. They really care about you and your work there. You feel very important no matter what you do. Only downfall, is you are on the computer talking on the phone all day."
good,The job isn't hard pay is not that great. I feel there is no room for growth at the company. Basically all day you are looking at policies and pulling various reports.
good,"Wasn't too bad of an experience, left for personal reasons. Sometimes you are very busy and sometimes you will be sitting in your cubical going insane. Very good pay."
good,"Its an ok job, just youre clerical job with heavy phone calls and helping customers one on one and handeling insurance policy."
good,"As a receptionist, you don't have much responsibility as long as you come to work every day and stay on task. I only had problems with the agents doing things at the last minute and making my job a little bit harder. Although you don't do a ton of work, you are still busy all day along making sure notes and clients are ready for the agents to take over."
good,"Typical work day involves mostly outbound sales calls to get new customers.  Also, address and inquiries from existing clients.  "
good,The agents know nothing and use their employees like commodities. Prepare to be squeezed for every lead or potential sale you can muster and then get tossed to the curb and replaced with someone they can pay cheaper.
good,Great company State Farm has a lot to offer for their customers and employee's.  I really enjoy the office I work for as well as my local Agent. The hardest part of my job is sitting still but I really enjoy helping insure families and provide the proper coverage they need to stay protected for the unexpected.
good,"State Farm was a fun company to work for. I grew a base of insureds, learned everything about them, had favorites who would visit me just to say hello. A few of my insureds would bring me donuts or remember my birthday.The hardest part of the job was the immense documentation needed to prove each interaction with a customer. My co-worker, Kaye, was the best!"
good,Great place to work at times. Can be stressful as with any job. Concerned experienced mature staff. Pay rate increase yearly based on annual review and performance
good,"A typical day consisted of data entry, mining, and managing. I learned several new aspects on how to navigate on a computer, and I was able to increase my Microsoft skills. I gained experience on the phones and learned how to properly communicate with callers. My co-workers were fantastic, and the atmosphere was very loving. The hardest part was the consistency and the most enjoyable part was my co-workers"
good,"i enjoyed how close i got with my customers, this job was a great experience to have when it comes to dealing with people on a relatable level."
good,"great company to work for, great employees, great agents.The job itself will not be the job unless the you have a great attitude, patience and great customer service."
good,Good place to work; good benefits; great place to gain knowledge about the insurance industry if your inexperienced; provides a variety of property and casualty skills both personal and commercial.
good,Company is a great place to work however they are moving out of State.  State fFarm has many changes going on.  There is limited flexibility. Work/life balance is an issue
good,"A typical day in underwriting is doing the same thing each day nothing changes."
good,"Everyday at Statefarm was usually the same. Same people, same schedule, and typical call center vibe. It was a very enjoyable experience, but it was not the job for me."
good,"Nice. Im not a full time employee hence I can not review this."
good,"Decent place to work with good benefits. paid breaks and time off. work can become mondane depending on your position, lots of time siting in one area."
good,"Typical workday consisted of greeting patients, answering the phone trying to assist costumers. The job was okay if you just wanted a job to pay bills and make it through life."
good,"I don't really get a sense of fulfillment at the end of the day.  Same thing every day.  You have a great opportunity for advancement, but if you have children, you can very easily get pulled into putting your job 1st.  The more you dedicate yourself, the more money you can make, just like most other job I suppose.  My theory is work smarter not harder, and in this field I think you can be very limited due to being limited by the intelligence and morals of clients.  Every agency is different, so I guess this really wouldn't apply to ALL State Farm agencies, but would definitely apply to the majority of clients.  Once again, every State Farm agency is different and has a different client base.  Too many variables to give you a general review about State Farm."
good,"•Engaged in customer service."
good,Everything changed. It was a enjoyable to come to work every day. You managed your day and had the opportunity to work a little extra if needed. Now it's a much micromanaged environment.
good,"I have learned a lot about the insurance business because of State Farm. The main draw back is some of the management. Lots of pressure is put on them to put on the workers. So it's nice when you have a understanding manager, But if not then each day may not be that fun."
good,"Typical work day assisting State Farm insured individuals and prospects with various issues such as making payments, getting roadside assistance and filing claims. I learned more about how insurance. Hardest part of the job was switching to another shift when one was not working out for myself"
good,"everyone is friendly for the most part, a few ppl have been there for years and of course they have a MAJOR say when it comesw  to what goes on at the office. so if u wanna work here long term u need to be able to keep them happy along with the boss. if they dont like u, then ur out the door"
good,Not a great deal of room for advancement and essentially no benefits which is why I left. A great starting out sales position but rough if you are looking to make it a career.
good,"There is just not enough work for me at this moment, so unfortueately I do not look forward to going to work everyday.  I need to keep busy through out the day."
good,"It was fast pace, very complex, too many changes, no pay upgrades for the amount of work being added on.  I always got the schedule I wanted."
good,"Opportunity to sale face to face and a lot a communication with customer"
good,I did a lot of phone work and set up appts. The supervision was also good as it was working on my own mostly!  Calling out to various clients was great at times and hard at other times!
good,I enjoyed being able to help customers with all of their insurance and financial needs. I took pride in knowing that I helped make an unexpected claim situation run as smoothly as possible.
good,"My typical day at work would be to open the store and take out all the fruits that were needed to make smoothies. I would have to restock and cut bananas when it was needed and count the money and make sure it was the same as last night's count. I would then turn on the Tv's, which provided the menu, and then I would click on the 'open sign'. During the day I would assist customers by taking their orders and making their smoothies and then checking them out myself. Later on during the day, I would have another co-worker to come and help me because we usually started to get busy then. It would normally be only two people working during the day. I learned to be independent very quickly being only sixteen. I would open by myself and sometime's close by myself. I learned the importance of memorizing every smoothie, so when it got busy I could be fast for my customers. The management was different then most business I have worked at. I didn't really feel valued as a worker or protected as a worker when working myself. My co-workers were great and when we worked together we were able to knock out a crowd as very quickly. The hardest part of the job was being by myself only being sixteen and opening early in the morning and then sometimes closing at night time by myself. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to have free smoothies, even off the clock and being able to make tips on top of being paid hourly."
good,"I learned a lot about the insurance business, including homeowners and automobile policies, and their computer systems while working here."
good,Great work culture but no formal business process. Traditional team and mgmt structure without consideration for improvement outside of these traditional roles.
good,"I like that everyone is friendly and willing to help. The job deals with auto claims so using your customer service skills, patience, empathy and compassion is very much needed when dealing with customers."
good,I learned how insurance related to everyday life and how to be able to better explain it to someone who was purchasing our product.
good,"I was able to work part-time close to home, to be near to my children.  "
good,"getting nice opportunities,for corp - corp positions,getting excellent opportunities towards working with the direct clients.very happy with this service provider"
good,"great place to work but indepently owned and does not provide insurance for health or dental or family, base salary is too low and comssion scale is very low also"
good,I would spend 50% of my time on the phone telemarketing new and existing customer for new insurance products. Limited marketing as their are way to many agents in belleville we only had 3 zip codes to work with!
good,"In such a short time I gained much experience and gained a Property and Casualty License through a program that I will last me for 2 years. Great staff to work with, competitive but compassionate group and Agent. Insurance is a career choice that I will love to continue or any finance/customer service career path. Room for growth and programs to become an Agent of your very own office. The pressure and work load was outstanding but most likely not suitable for most people of course without proper training. Overall great company!"
good,"It was fun work environment and  I enjoyed the time I spent with. "
good,"State Farm is a very good company.  They offer great benefits and provide a good working environment.  A typical day at work is very busy with phone calls, arranging schedules, processing expenses.  My co-workers were consistently team players that would provide excellent back-up.  The hardest part of the job was working with another group in State Farm that would not keep you updated on the status of each meeting.  The most enjoyable part was interacting with the executives and my co-workers."
good,"I stayed with this company because I was a single mother and I needed the job for benefits. The benefits here were amazing.  That's about all it has going for it.   The pay there sucks unless you graduate from college, then it is good..."
good,This isa great place to work for.  I have learned how to read people very well in this industry.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with constant change all the time.    Nothing is  ever consistent. I love helping Policy holders in their time of need. This part is very rewarding to me.
good,A typical day was finding new clients and trying to get them to switch over to State Farm Insurance.  The office I worked in was a family office and welcomed me into the family. One of the hardest parts of the job was letting some know that State Farm would not insure them. An enjoyable part was that it was a small office and was a family friendly place.
good,"Employer was nice, had great management, but had very low tolerance. "
good,"Management could be way better, they pick favorites, there is a lot of drama on a daily basis."
good,"The company was amazing! The supervisor was great , always nice and respectful. The job environment was always clean and the other employees were great to be around. I was excited to go to work every day ."
good,Great work place; Some of the management is great to work with and very helpful. Policies are very strict and quality monitoring is micro-managed.
good,"I enjoyed working for SF - many good people and high level service. Good benefits, good environment, good diversity, very professional and ethical coworkers."
good,"Working here requires that you can have almost constant interaction with customers and be able to transition from conversation to conversation without being slowed by less pleasant interactions. The pay is fair for the work being performed. The work is very repetitive, so is not the best environment for someone who craves new and variable work. Attaining a management position in the company guarantees that you will have a competitive income long term, but given that the average tenure of employees can be around ten years, it will take a significant commitment of time before typically being considered for a management position."
good,Collaborative team setting that is positive and supportive. With regular team building activities and encouragement of personal development from co-workers and management.
good,"The company is moving more towards easily replaceable workers, and less from expertise in claim handling. Leadership is generally good, but their ability to affect change is limited."
good,"If you are looking for stability SF is a good job to work for. Management is there for you, you can depend on them. Phone volume is heavy so you will constantly be on the phone."
good,Supportive management that are concerned about helping you reach your goal. I work three days a week. This was a great schedule at first it let me have Mondays and Fridays off with my son. He is now 3 and attending school so I need something full time.
good,"The job became more about cold calling a ridiculous stack of lists. I loved the customer service aspect of the position. However, I find being pushy about insurance was just not for me."
good,"State Farm is a good company to work for. Everyone in the office is very professional. A typical day at work is very steady. Helping clients in anyway they need it. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help the clients with a problem that I could not resolve like a billing issue, which all billing is handled through corporate. The most enjoyable part of my job is when a client gets the help they were looking for. Also when I am able to get the savings and when they leave knowing and understanding the coverage that they have."
good,"I have never worked for a company before, or since, that had better health,vision and dental benefits.  The pay is excellent, and hard work is involved, but worth it."
good,"I learned a lot about the basic operation of a business and how to manage and keep a small business profitable. I dealt with customers each day and made sure to maximize each customer interaction opportunity to produce a sale and ensure customer satisfaction. I handle calls dealing with complaints to normal service calls to even new business calls and maximizing the sale. I also kept detailed notes of daily activity. Kept track of important documents and filed paperwork appropriately. The boss has never been in a team member position though and has a hard time deciding how to run the team realistically. All training was self taught and at a crash course pace. Unfortunately I was the only office member able to learn most everything you need and be fluent with computers, so I spent most of my time trying to fix everyone's mistake and show how to not make them in the future (to not much success). I feel I have outgrown my team and current office and would like to move on to better opportunities offering more pay and a more satisfying field of work."
good,Fun place to work if you like customer service and to talk on the telephone. All about the numbers on your own personal growth and development as as employee. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them on different ways to provide customer service.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management."
good,"Fast paced,busy environment, easy to get lost/discouraged if not organized must hustle to get new business. Location is not ideal for walk ins."
good,Great Company always room to grow. great benefits and health package. Management are always helpful. and the overall company environment is friendly. Also company has competitive insurance packages.
good,Working at State Farm was fun but one must be able to wear many hats. An Insurance Agent should know about all the products that State Farm offers.
good,Stable job.  Day to day job function can be monotonous.  Not a lot of room for creativity.  Management takes a long time to implement suggested changes.
good,I learned that I love talking to people! I love working with others! I also learned that I wanted to be intentional with others and build more relationships with the clients; that was a bit hard when selling insurance. Selling insurance is not something I want to do with my life.
good,Great place to work for college students! Offers flexible hours and pay with no weekends in the office! No requirement needed to start but must obtain either Property & Casualty and/or Life & Health state licenses to conduct business.
good,"I have learned so much on the avenue of insurance policies and sales. The experience itself has been a great one. However, I am really looking to be able to work from home."
good,Not cut out for straight commission so I helped answer phones and various administrative duties. I had a couple friends from my church that worked there and I learned a lot; just not cut out for straight commission.
good,fun place to work. very supportive team and team work oriented. easy to use systems. office hours are great and holidays are suported
good,The tools to preform my job effectively and efficiently are not provided as they are with other insurance companies. They use a dos based systems to make changes and the time it takes UW to issue a policy is laughable.
good,Always learning something new. Interesting to learn more about insurance. The value of insurance for each individual. More of a desk job then physically being able to hands on help people. Required training and licensing.
good,A place that is very busy and learned a lot of what to do and not to do. It can get stressful at time and the environment can get heated with co workers. Overall a good learning experience.
good,"This company is a good company if you are interested in climbing the corporate ladder. With the proper time invested and the extra mile given, you may be able to advance a great deal faster than you may could with a different company."
good,There are lots of changes happening within the company.  The focus is becoming less about the quality and more about numbers.  Constantly being measured against fellow employees and your numbers directly affect your annual raise.  Be prepared to work most holidays. That being said they do give yearly raises with performance cash bonuses and incentives.
good,"Pretty good place to work, Good hours, nice pay, decent management and co-workers. Would recommend.No weekends and holidays off."
good,My job consist of calling potential customers to offer them car insurance and life insurance. Going thru email and emailing different clients throughout the day. On certain days I had the opportunity to take payments for current customers car insurance and life insurance. I learned how to put a quote together and manage money on different level. My co workers were very easy going and they made the job fun. The hardest part of the job was selling life insurance. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with customers and making friends.
good,Great place to work however I want to broaden my insurance knowledge and experience. Job security and chance for advancement are strong.
good,I enjoyed my work experience there I like the people I worked with they treated you with respect. I learned a lot while I was there and had a great time there
good,"Typical day @ SF Collections was simply talking inbound calls to help customers come up with a productive and consistent way of being able to make their monthly payments on time while providing good customer service...I learned how to use my customer service skills to help customers who are in a seemingly impossible situation."
good,My days were spent meeting the many needs of my agent's clients. A majority of my time was spent taking phone calls and answering current coverage questions. The hardest part about my time at State Farm was the lack of breaks. Lunch breaks were rarely taken etc.
good,Worked in an agents office in college. It was a great place to get me prepared for the professional workforce. They were also very flexible around my course work.
good,"State Farm is a very large corporate ran business.  I enjoyed learning all of the skills I developed.  They used to offer classes that would help you refresh skills or learn new ones...but that stopped and was focused only on education of insurance.  The department I worked for downsized, therefore the job I performed was no longer needed."
good,I left because they would not give me the day off for my mother's wedding. I did not like that my boss would not even help to get it off. She also did not know how to do my job.
good,"•Responsible for seeking out new clients and develop clientele by networking and generating new lists of prospective clients."
good,"Organizing tasks, helping customers, helping team mates, being productive and working hard. Taking numerous calls, handling escalations and issues."
good,upper management has small interaction with associates. The hardest part about work is to understand managed chaos. They do try to have activities to celebrate achievements and holidays.
good,"It's ironic, you work for an insurance company but do not recieve insurance benefits such as disability insurance, life insurance, health, dental and vision insurance. "
good,Enjoyed helping the customers with different insurance needs from home to auto to life insurance policies. Left this position when hired at Merced County Human Services Agency.
good,had a great agent who was flexible and really tried to teach and improve.  sales calls were challenging but rewarding when closing the deal.  Learned how to polish my communication skills
good,Co workers are friendly with positive and optimistic attitudes. The day would start with beginning of day tasks Replying to underwriting emails and contacting clients who called after hours. Answering all inquiries about policies and billing. Adhering to bi-lays and code of the department of insurance in California. Building quotes and following up with leads was a frequent task that had to be speedy yet accurate. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you were actually able to help a client save money on the cost of their auto insurance and home insurance.
good,"great group, very supportive, hours long, very diversified; good food in café; central location, close to expressway, good training dept"
good,Small office and agents demands were unlimited. the pay was on the low end of it all. Job description not specific. The job itself consists of lots of driving
good,"Each office is different because they are owned by different agents. Some days are busy and other days are extremely busy. It's never a dull moment. If there is nothing to do, there's always calls to make."
good,"Worked here for 14 years.  Excellent pay, a lot of employee cliques though.  Seems like they hired anyone just to fill spots in claims.  Company definitely went downhill the longer I worked for them.  Some managers were nice, other were arrogant and thought they were better than employees."
good,I had reached my year mark with this company and wished to stay longer.  The housing market crashed and the phone stopped ringing which meant I was out of the job.  Try to get a licence while in this position as a back up.
good,"Great job! Ability to expand your skill sets"
good,"A normal day here would be at 8 and end at 5, co workers are very good people and willing to help but itll be times when you really need help and no one will be in sight for hours."
good,"I worked in Austin, Texas and my management and co-workers worked in Greely, Colorado, therefore, I worked Virtual.  Each morning I called my co-workers in Greely, Colorado, to determine what my job would be for that day."
good,"Dealing with management"
good,"Good stable company to work for, only if you can deal with being paid almost $20K less than other companies with the same position.  Advancement is possible if you play the cards right with the correct people.  Nothing is truly written, everything changes based on the person.  The company has a motivational plan-Get you in, get you pumped up about promotions and then keep you in the position you are in by coming up with excuses about why you ideally need to stay put.  Experiences vary based on position offered."
good,Management was great and work load was plenty makes for a long day of work. Fun team environment for people who love working in teams daily. I learned to stay focus and get the job done accurately.
good,"work 10 hours a day 6 days a week"
good,"I loved working here, my boss treated his employees very well. I got along with everyone there, a very friendly environment. I loved being a receptionist here, but I had to also learn how to sell car insurance, which I found out was something I did not enjoy at all. If I was just a receptionist I feel like this job would have been better for me but having to get my license to sell insurance and learn about selling it was something I just couldn't see myself doing unfortunately."
good,Great company culture. The account representative position at State Farm is ever changing. There's great opportunity to learn more each day.
good,"Large insurance company, head quarters in Illinois."
good,My day consisted of calling from a large lists of numbers in an attempt to providing them with a quick quote on their auto insurance.
good,"a typical day at work dealing with different respondents"
good,Working in Custoemr Service can be a challenge over the phone. Policy Holders call in to discuss issues and also get help to problems that there agent can't assists with. One of the hardest part is the time on the job and lenth of the breaks. Poor planning and some mangement not up to standards.
good,Great place to work. Advancing into management is a questionable process. Pace is dependent on where you work. Some areas are chock full of projects others not so much. External consultants have it easy here. Many idling and billing consultants as every area is not very good at projecting workload. Good technical co-workers. Hardest part of the job is approval by committee and paper work for processes
good,"I didn't know what I was getting into when I got this job and it turned out I didn't like selling insurance or had the persuastion to. If you like persuading people to get insurance, this is the job for you. I don't like pushing people to get something they don't want so I definitely did not like this position"
good,Advancement and compensation have been fair during my time at State Farm. I am ready for a change in my career which is why I am currently searching for new opportunities.
good,"A great company, lots of opportunity to move around the country if you would like to relocate. I enjoyed my time but was not willing to relocate at this time in my life.  Many long term employees in the facility. Would definitely recommend to a young employee as a company to grow with."
good,"This job was a lot of clerical work making cold calls. Taking payments, customer service, doing insurance quotes."
good,GC Services was a good starting company for me.  It allowed me to make goals for my career and learn skills to continue to use throughout my life.
good,"Lots of Networking - "
good,"A typical day at work includes solving billing problems for customers, write new policies, cross selling, take payments from customers, manage office."
good,the work was challenging and fun.  learned a lot on the job. it was fun watching the children grow.
good,"It was a pleasure working here with the exception of favoritism..  I am an easy going person so I did not allow it to effect me but it is hard.   "
good,My review for the actual agent office I currently work for is less than the actual organization itself. Agent is very unorganized and lacks true business knowledge in how to manage her office in a productive manner and financially.
good,"My manager has excellent management skill overall and we have a great team work culture in place. They do provide you a full training section and 1 month in house training while you are performing your job. It makes you feel you have a team back you up.   However, the workload is just way too much to handle and low pay.  It is a great opportunity to learn and start your career."
good,Was offered a job with a set of goals. 3 months in they change all the goals. Of course much higher
good,"the only problem really with state farm, is, as a team member, you work for the agent, not really State Farm. each agent is different and runs their office however they want. Aside from there is no room for advancement (unless you want to become an agent), most do not offer benefits aside from paid time off."
good,Very rewarding position. Able to interact with students while making them feel safe on campus.
good,"I like the company and the chance to grown. However, I am looking for something full time rather than part time. I have learned a lot for only being with State Farm for a short amount of time. I am continuing to learn new and exciting thing every day. The management and my co-works are all nice and easy to get along with."
good,I never worked for State Farm. I just helped organize events because my mother was employed there. Overall it was enjoyable and nothing was difficult for the most part.
good,"I open up the office, manage and run day to day activities of the office. Service the customers, make sure the payments are made correctly and write insurance policies. My coworkers are great and we always have a good productive day. The hardest part is the time that it consumes in my life. The most enjoyable part is helping people understand and see the value in insurance."
good,This is an outside sales position for building the book of business for the agency.
good,"As my first reception job this proved to be pretty simple. Answer phones, file paperwork, take phone payments, mail receipts, assist the agent with any and all tasks requested. Once trained on the computer system I was left alone to do my job. Once I was there a few weeks they added the marketing run. I was responsible for creating renters/auto flyers to deliver to local apartment complex offices along with free labeled goods as incentives to read and potentially bring in new business. I did this once per week and was compensated milage on top of my hourly pay. I was also responsible for cold calling customers (phone prospecting) to try and generate more business. I was responsible for customer service when necessary, and collected payments in office and delivered the nightly deposit to the bank after lock up."
good,"Multiline insurance representative.  Consulting and selling life, health, property and casualty insurance products to businesses and individual clients."
good,A lot of time on the computer and the phone. People skills is a big thing.
good,"A very small accounting firm.  I had lots to take care of, which I really enjoyed doing."
good,"I thought this was a great company, however so many companies are using recruiters with insight details and feedback but no real results that are satisfying for both parties"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with. They make me comfortable, and we are like a family. The hardest part of my job is working for a company with low pay and no benefits. I have learned a lot through direct client interaction, and how to deal with all types of people."
good,Outside sales representative responsible for generating new business in various locales.
good,"I have been with State Farm over three years. "
good,"State Farm is a great company to work for.  Most management is supportive in advancement and will work with you to move up.  Volume is high, job security is also high.  Yearly raises is a plus which most companies cannot provide on a yearly basis"

good,"opening business,,, answering phone calls and making calls, sending letters to customers ,filing, taking payment, sending and receiving faxes, scanning documents,  I learned how to write policies for Life insurance cars homes rental units. Management was good she basically taught me my job and left me there to do it. there were no co-workers it was just she and I there were no hard parts of this job.

good,"very energetic, high pressure and great atmosphere, people were very friendly and helpful"
good,It was a very fruitfulone year working at State Farm Insurance. I got to learn many new things and new skills.
good,"I worked there for some 25 years.  We were treated as family.  I had medical issues with myself and husband.  Always told not to worry. But there comes a point when the income coming in is not enough to meet the owners expenses, so someone has to go.   Co-workers all covered for each other during absences or bad weather.  The best part of the job was getting to know my customers who had  became friends.  Small family businesses are something I would stay away from."
good,"This was a great opportunity. I maintained a some what busy front desk taking payments and answering multi-line phone calls."
good,"My average day at work is constant which I enjoy.  I use a lot of energy to process information, service existing clients and gain new business as well. I have learned effective communication skills, multi tasking, prioritizing, problem solving and completing tasks in a timely manner.  Management micro manages the team and my co-workers help out but don't seem to share the same drive as myself. I feel the environment is not enough for me to reach my goals and I would like to expand with my knowledge. The hardest past of my job is delivering negative news to clients although I have managed to communicate professionally. The best part of my job is the unknown everyday, I really enjoy new tasks and problems coming to me as I am always eager to solve them!"
good,"Management is questionable, sit in your cube all day and answer phiones and do busy work."
good,there is pros and cons within each office I've worked with.  I guess it's just a matter of luck and hope that you have a leader as a boss and not a boss that makes you feel like he's behind you with a whip like a slave owner whiping you everytime he feels the company is slowing down.
good,"Answering phones and processing auto claims, 15 years of experience working with people.  I loved my co-workers and enjoyed working in a team environment.  The hardest part of my job was not being able to pay a claim, the most enjoyable was being a ""hero"" to people and having a positive impact on their lives."

Hardest part about this job was grasping concepts of insurance. Most i enjoyed about this job is learning things that I will remember for life experieces.

Passed state licensing exam through TX Dept. of insurance.  This was a very family oriented workplace.

good,"I learned a lot about customer service and time managment.  I was a fire claims rep for large fire losses.  The most difficult part of the job was serving on the National Catastrophe team and being  absent from my children for extended periods of time. A typical work day required scheduling appointments to review fire losses, writing structual estimates and paying policy holders.  If a large catastrophe occurred you had 24 hours turn-around time to pack and get to the affected city. It was exciting and great to be able to assist those in need. The knowledge I obtained during this career was priceless."
good,"Take phone calls all day. Metrics are important. Licensed and appointed by employer to sell insurance. Management likes to micro-manage. Sometimes difficult to put up with daily grind (customers, micro-management, etc.)"
good,"Phones, faxes, cnx, endt's, quotes, reports, marketing, payments"

good,"Complete duties for the day.  Learned about different avenues of providing insurance for our clients.  Management was steady and co-workers knew the importance of working as a team.  The hardest part of the job was communication - since it was a family-oriented type of business, it was like having to communicate with a family member as well.  The best part of the job was also the family-orientedness.  People genuinely cared for you and your developement."
good,"A rewarding experience of field investigations with paper files, travel within Salt Lake City, followed by promotion to relocate to assist with setting up the new call center in Greeley, Colorado. "
good,Management is ok. Enjoyable because collaborative work space.  Difficult to find a work space though and travel time between buildings is excessive.
good,Customer service/administrative assisant. Became more of a call center than claims office
good,"Fast paced, high volume call center with a good team atmosphere"
good,"The targets set were too high, as its a franchise, the office doenst have too many people and sometimes can get quite boring"
good,Very established State farm. Agent is very informed on everything on all policies and very helpful.
good,Sate Farm is great company to work for. I would still be there if it was not required to work on Saturday and Sunday.
good,"Thank you for a great work environment. I have great co-workers, and free coffee in the morning."
good,Its like really working for yourself with little training. Boring to me.
good,This organization is a great place to first gain professional experience.
good,Great family work balance. Absolutely wonderful co-workers. Hardest part of the job...licensing.
good,Space coast credit union was a good company to work for. My coworkers were nice.
good,"State Farm is an incredible company from the perspective of most customers, myself included. It is a one stop shop for insurance and financial services. Working for a State Farm agent is a wonderful way to break in to the insurance and/or financial services world, so long as you avoid the complacency that usually comes after learning the products and how to successfully market them. There is a very low ceiling as a State Farm team member, as the title of this review implies. Once you have perfected the craft of need-based salesmanship, it is best to move on to a career with more room for growth."
good,I enjoyed the work and learning it also. However the boss did not like the fact the I was throwing up all day from being pregnant and decided it was not going to work out.
good,"My typical day at work is answers phones, work task in between phone calls. Research incoming mail, prepare overnight packages, and certified mail. Research attorney demands and packages and make sure the package are process into the claims. I also set up new claims and assist customer with gerenal claims questions. The hardest part of my job is dealing with an upset customer who just lost a love one due to an accident."
good,This company is very diverse and offers a wide variety of insurances that expand your knowlege and skills as a clerical and customer service worker. The managment was mellow and task orinanted. Co workers were eay going and most of the time to themselves. The hardest part of the job was the upset customers that we insured during deaths of family memembers. Most enjoyable part of the job was the travel for verification of insured property.
good,You learn to work as a team to grow production of sales but still are able to focus on your individual numbers.
good,I guess it depends on your agent... I loved the company but not the agency. Full of a bunch of snobby women who worry about their appearance more than their peers. Awesome working experience to put on my resume.
good,"Small offices are laid back and comfortable, most of the daily work is calling people to remind them to pay their insurance and taking claims."
good,This job was not one of my favorites but I always got the job done. It was very customer service based so there was really no time to bond with your co-workers.
good,Sell and review insurance and financial products from State Farm. I've work in a couple of offices: 1 that primarily serviced policies and the other that pursued new customers 80% of the time. All agent's choose pay/benefits and all agencies are ran differently. Some good some not so good.
good,"Come in got paper work ready for the Agent to sign and call clients take phone calls file all paper work manage other staff . The agent I worked for was great nice christian man. Loved the other staff members. Hardest thing was trying to answer all questions with out bothering the agent, Lots of clients wanted to speak with the agent not the office manager. Most enjoyable working with the public ."
good,"This job is enjoyable if you like quiet, and not much personal interraction. I however am much more of a people person, so this job is not so great for me. Customers can also be harsh at times when it comes to insurance that they do not understand."
good,The company is a good company but it is hard to make sales because their prices are a lot higher than most other insurance companies.
good,"good company, direction is in transition, unsure where company will end up."
good,"Took a lot of responsibility with different type of work such as sales, customer service, retention, administrative work, etc. So be prepared to work all day."
good,"call center environment, ok people, ok pay, clean center, didn't like the cold calling"
good,Great insurance and financial services products. Computer system needs upgrading to be more efficient.
good,The most rewarding part of the job is helping customers recover from a loss. At work emphasis was placed on meeting metrics constantly.  Job sometimes was stressful.
good,Software difficult to use and out of date. Agent provided poor customer service. Working in an agent office is being a middleman between customer and corporate. Very frustrating because nothing can official be done from an agent's office. Everything must be submitted to corporate which then can be changed and altered causing more frustration for customers.
good,"The State Farm agency I worked for was a great place to balance personal life and work life. However, each agency is ran according to the agent in charge. So there can be a lot of inconsistency from one office to another. The company as a whole is backed by years of stability, but it is very frustrating at times to work with the systems that State Farm uses. Operational wise, they are not as advanced and ""in real time"" and customers expect to get things done same day, but the systems cannot support their requests. Sales are difficult as rates are generally much higher than competition, but learning to sell the ""State Farm way"" and overcoming objectives is how you can achieve your numbers. They also push more financial services than P&C now. Overall though, it's a great place to work."
good,The claims department at State Farm provides acceptable benefits and pay but lacks required leadership and follow up. You should not expect any sort of assistance in learning beyond initial training.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my employment at State Farm and would have preferred to retire from there. I was happy with my range of work, my bosses and my coworkers."
good,You have to like people and be able to pass State Licensing. Most offices do not offer benefits or retirement. Most offices are flexible with work hours
good,Overall state farm is a good company. I didn’t have a great experience in the end as I had conflict with a manager. So just managers need improvement.
good,"Corporate office is incoming sales, also in agency mostly out going sales. Positions are mostly straight forward. In the out bound calling it is reasonable to make 50 calls a day. The hardest part of the job will be following up with perspective clients. Generally an easy sales job, the company is well known and easily recognizable. The most difficult part of the job is due to being mostly commission based pay. Commission is on a sliding scale, so on a low month or one containing holidays you may make very little. Annual salary caps pretty quickly, not due to sales opportunities, due to time put into closing sales and establishing policies. Commission doesn't match time put in. Great place if starting in sales, just not for seasoned commission salesmen"
good,Your metrics are more important than the service you provide to customers. Management is more concerned about reaching their own metrics to really care about your issues and concerns.
good,Be an output horse and you will be fine here. The Farm is a safe secure way to provide for a family. You are always at there mercy with changes but it is still a safe opportunity.
good,"Its a good job if you enjoy being a seat warmer. They dont believe in life work balance. They throw SF swag at you for incentives, but run entirely on outdated systems that they are constantly throwing bandaids on. 3 stars because there are a lot of great people there, management is just severely lacking."
good,"Would have loved to have worked at State Farm for many more years, but there was a disconnect from the employee as time went on. There was so much appreciation early in my employment for the you as the employee. Then the focus took a turn and management would often use the term "" you need to be glad you have a job"". That was a hard pill to swallow knowing that you have given your all to a company for so many years. Upon leaving I also found how underpaid we were for the amount of work that we were doing. All in all State Farm is a great company."
good,"It really depends on what you’re looking for. I wouldn’t choose this if you’re looking for a part time job. If you’re looking to grow in a career and are a good communicator, go for it."
good,"Trained employees and handled customer concerns. "
good,I have worked with State Farm for 17 years and really enjoyed my job but they added in Work Force Management and Metrics that just does not work for the kind business we did. Heavy work load and time off can be difficult because only so many people can be off at a time. You may put in vacation for a week but may only take 3-4 days due to people choosing to be off on Mondays or Fridays. They do pay pretty well and the people are who I miss the most. Had some amazing managers. A lot of people have left due to the strict Work Force Management.
good,"If you like cold calling, this is a job for you.  Typical sales environment, will try and get you to sign up friends and family with state farm.  Almost like they pay you for your contacts"
good,"management is great. teammates are amazing,"
good,"Enjoyed working there until the downsizing which took place in August, 2018. Moved from the automotive credit area to a ""flex-team"" which assisted the first mortgage, home equity & automotive credit teams."
good,"Fast and quick claims is the key to success."
good,"The work environment was a bit stagnant, but the knowledge gained was quintessential to my overall office experience. Good benunitefits and an overall cohesive unit of co workers"
good,Working for State Farm was simply a continuation of employment in the insurance business. I sold all lines of insurance to new and existing customers.
good,The company culture is awesome and offer job security. Management has been promoted within the company so they have a lot of work experience at State Farm. State Farm is one of the few Companies that still offer pensions.
good,State Farm is a Great company to be apart of. Great benefits and good pay. Supervisors not so much. One Overnight supervisor at the Tempe hub in particular will stab you in the back and get you fired.
good,"State Farm is a solid company.  However, they seemed to be pretty rigid with their typical business practices, how they train their leaders and marketing tactics still being used to beat out competition.  Great reputation in the industry but found that insurance was not my ""cup of tea""."
good,"Enjoyed all temp jobs I had at State Farm. "
good,"My role was in State Farm's call center as a claim handler. Almost every day I would come in to a queue of calls on hold, constantly over 100 people on hold waiting to be answered by our team. The customers we spoke too were calling on their worst day for any number of reasons: their brand-new car was in an accident, or they caused an accident but think it was the other person's fault, or they just lost/killed someone in the accident, etc. It's definitely a high-stress environment. The company wants you to take responsibility for any wrong done by any other department to avoid displacing blame; great in theory, but it takes its toll on the mental and physical body of the person taking on that responsibility multiple times each and every day. "
good,This was a good internship opportunity to learn about Statefarm and the insurance industry. I would recommend to young people looking for an entryway into the field.
good,Not a difficult job if you are knowledgeable. Can be fun getting to work with so many people. Some customers are difficult. Not great work life balance.
good,"Cold Calling, following up with clients, answering policy questions."
good,"Employees are asked questions about changes that are already in motion to try and get their buy off on change. "
good,Overall I did not mind working here however I will not be continuing a future in insurance based off of my time spent working as an intern in the field.
good,"Depending on the agent. There is no rating the company as a whole, except that the systems to manage sales and service accounts are terribly fragmented."
good,There is definitely job security @ State Farm but the pay does not match the job requirements. At one point the claim associates were not allowed to work claims regarding receipts and those claims would have to be reassigned to the claim specialists but now the claim associate is required to work those specified claims.
good,Good company to work for with a change in responsibilities daily.  So many things to learn and do.  Never a dull moment and many wonderful people at State Farm.
good,Trainers in program are not held responsible for passing rate of assessments.  Everything falls on learner to prove statefarms expectations are met.  Expectations about the role were unclear from the beginning.  Assessments were not the same across the board.
good,"I enjoyed the work itself, but not the people I worked for. They do not value their employees or a work - life balance. Unemphatic to unexpected life events in employees lives."
good,"Very busy and fast paced. Team environment and as long as cars are on the road the office is opened. Rain, sleet, snow and tornados. Plenty of opportunities to relocate to different states. Bonuses offered for dedicated workers."
good,Nice people and culture. Work life balance is perfect. The company cares about employees and provides stable environment. Pay rate is below average unfortunately.
good,The culture depends on the agent. Also how many people  work in the branch.  How many service hours do sales agents complete daily?  This will determine how many hours you have to sell and earn.
good,"Working in an Agency, hundreds of phone calls to perspective buyers trying to sell them some type of insurance product to fit their current need. Home, auto, life, banking products, commercial insurance, etc.."
good,"State Farm is a great Insurance company but as an Employer lacks the ability to retain employees  Schedules are rigid and unflexible =,  PTO for family leave is strict  I had a brother with Cancer and a couple family emergency they would not approve for PTO or leave.  They are not family friendly about absences"
good,Hard to reach goals and little to no help from management. Unrealistic expectations from employers to employees. No room for advancement and very limited pay increases.
good,"It is a food way to Start your career, and get hands-on in to the finance work, you will learn to do many things, but i feel like the growth there is not enough."
good,In the beginning I loved State Farm as a company. It was a place that molded its people to be the best. As of late it’s more numbers driven and the culture that was in place has been erased. Sad but true.
good,"The company is number driven and has lost focus on the customer. They have force a lot of their senior claim reps and experience mangers to leave and seek employment else where. The metrics system they use is design for you to fail. The company is fast pass, high volume and demanding. The stress level is very high."
good,"fast paced environment working in a team atmosphere. "
good,"If you are working for an agent like I did, you basically do all the work and the agent gets the benefits. I enjoyed my job, but never felt we were paid fairly in comparison to agent commission from our sales and work. However, every agents office is different. The agents are allowed to determine how much they pay you and if they give you commission etc. I know some people in my same position at state farm but at other agents offices were paid very fairly and given commission. I was only given a set salary. Also, I had no benefits, health insurance, only my salary. But that is also up to the agent you work for. And you do not get discounts on your own personal insurance as an employee. I worked there 6 years and overall I liked it. I just wish they gave me health insurance and a raise. I only stopped working for State Farm because my office closed when my agent retired."
good,"It honestly depends on what side of State Farm you work for.  Fire, Auto, Bank, etc.  Every department is different and it just depends if you have a direct supervisor that is good or not.  I had 5 different ones and only 2 I would consider a good leader.  Everything else is really fine about the company."
good,I worked her for many years (almost 31).  It was a stressful environment but for many years a very fair company.  Most of my co-workers were long time employees also until the company decided to centralize and in order to keep our jobs we had to relocate
good,"State Farm is a good place to work at if you are adaptable and open to changes.  Management was good, however, they did not have much say, since all direction was coming from Senior Management."
good,State Farm used to be a solid employer. There is still a career available for people who want to move to a hub location. The work is steady and a fast past call center environment.
good,"SF is changing from supporting their employees to making it a non friendly working environment. Management unfamiliar with actual work by teams, Management not communicating with employees."
good,The job was great. The morning is usually service calls and the afternoon is usually out bound sales calls. The management in the office was not very helpful when approached with a problem. It was kind of figure it for yourself and hope you get it right.
good,The company gives you an opportunity to advance if you produce the numbers that will allow you to prosper as an agent. Fun and creative atmosphere that you have a chance to help create.
good,"State Farm is an established company with a solid and professional atmosphere and an open environment that makes working between lower management and operational employees an inviting workplace. "
good,I believe that state farm gave me a stable life. I met some amazing people working here. I've learned how to navigate between two monitors. The hardest part was that the calls have been back to back making it a bit stressful.
good,Insurance was a learning experience for me. The environment was sociable. You have to be able to sell insurance products to get commission and goals have to be met.
good,Working there now has changed considerably since I have worked there. Working there at first felt like family but that is no longer the case. The main objective is all about the bottom dollar.
good,"It was a good place to work benefits were ok and work life balanced was good.  dealt with customers as their issues, the branch owner owner was never in.  customers can be needy and annoying."
good,SF was a good company to work for before changes.  The work-life balance became a problem for me.  The benefits package is what kept me with them for almost 20 years.
good,"ok job. the company culture is two faced, the are there for their customers and do pay out quite a bit for claims but the claims that dont make it get ugly"
good,"Good atmosphere, well managed. A lot of the job required getting my own leads which took away from the time able to sell. Good products and good training."
good,"Overall, a sold company to work for.  Since the company has been in transition for the past few years, many offices are closing.  Thus, causing a lot of stress for families.  The vision of the company has changed, as the main focus is on the numbers, and less about the people.  Direct management that you report to is very good.  Very sympathetic and works hard to accommodate their own employee."
good,Benefits and pay were great but the new business model made for an extremely stressful work environment. Direct management was great but the focus on the metrics was to such a point it didn't always align with the best solution for the situation.
good,Very corporate environment. Mixed messages and conflicting information was an issue. The company itself tried to be fair to both employees and customers but past employees who abused benefits has made the company distrustful. The pay was okay but not enough to really enjoy living in Atlanta. Traffic was also an issue and many of is wanted work from home opportunities which we were always told was illegal. We learned later it is not and this caused a lack of trust in the company.
good,"I was just looking for job when I got here, but I quickly learned it had potential to become a company I could retire from. Insurance just doesn't interest me which is the main reason I left. "
good,"No pressures with enough leads a day"
good,High call volume environment with many inquires into policies and accounts as well as an abundance of claims to be filed. Very little down time in between calls.
good,"Rather not say at the moment,  but there is room for improvement needed in areas of training management as well as the employees.  The promised salary needs improvement as well."
good,"I believe state farm is a great company to work for , but when you have to work for agents that are only looking out for them selves and not for their team kinda makes it hard to even show up especially when you don't meet their goals they start to threat you with your job. It creates a very toxic work place environment ."
good,"Not for everyone. Plenty of opportunities, great people, and working area. May be slightly difficult to cope with certain factors of the working environment itself, such as difficult management and overwhelming circumstances of unrealistic expectations set by higher roles."
good,"Things are always changing, you must be willing to adapt to change.  You may experience different managers throughout the company, which have different styles of management which would give you a different opinion of the company.  Overall, it depends on your work ethic.  If you can not be on time, do not waste your time."
good,"Every day, as a sales representative you got a dose of outbound sales calls, inbound service, outbound sales business visits, and in-person meetings. All-in-all, it was a good first job. But ambitious, progress young minds should try finding work elsewhere that better tailors to your self-worth if your end goal isn't to be a State Farm Agent one day."
good,"Do work out side of job scope or level without the raise"
good,Good for beginners. Most independent offices have entirely different pay scales and commission earnings. The only one who makes money is the agent in charge.
good,"Great people who care about their employees and clients."
good,State Farm is a great company. Great products... I just signed on with  the wrong agent. If you're looking to make a comfortable living working with State Farm ask around the office about the training and turnover rate before you agree to work for an agent. Also make sure that the agent or an experienced team member will have time and be willing to train you.
good,The Employees care about each other and want to help you learn and be successful.  There is opportunity to learn different skills and perform different jobs all within one company.
good,"You learn how a significant enterprise operates while still feeling like an important part of whatever team to which you're assigned. Change in the company comes slowly, but that's only because State Farm has been around for so long. Advancement opportunities come in time, but if you want to progress quickly, then you need to be incredibly motivated and dedicated to the goals of State Farm."
good,Pretty good place to work. The workload in most claims departments is demanding as I assume most Insurance companies. Many changes going on here. Work life balance is really not a priority even though it’s spoke of my upper management.
good,"State Farm was a fantastic place to work, however with the restructure going on, many changes are taking place.  "
good,"Over the course of my career with State Farm there has been fun times, sad occurrences and extremely stressful situations.  It is a fast paced job and even though it has it's stressful moments the outcome of being able to provide & assist the customers during a difficult time in their lives is also rewarding."
good,There are many great things about the organization as well as many thing that need to be reevaluated. Most of the leadership is great and want to provide opportunities to progress in the company....but those opportunities are few and far between.
good,"State Farm is a nice place to work for people seeking long term employment and like a decent pace at work. State Farm offers good benefits, pension plan and have a good work life balance"
good,Very team oriented overall a great place to work. I am an employee of the agent themselves and am not considered an employee of State Farm. Each office is run differently.
good,"Good company to enter the corporate world with. Good organized training. Pay raises very small. They make you sign an incumbency for certain positions, meaning you cant post out or apply for promotions outside of your department."
good,Very fast -  paced work environment.  Nice company to work for.  You are paid salary and if you don't finish your work you stay over to finish it.  The co workers are very nice and helpful.  The pay isn't terrific.
good,As a contractor St Farm continually threatens everyone that they will be going home soon.  As an experienced claim rep they left me alone and I was allowed to do my job but this was not an ideal work environment for those new to the industry.
good,"In years past State Farm was employee centric.  It gave high regards to employees who demonstrated exceptional customer service and industry/department knowledge.  However, growing concerns surrounding expenses to do business and available technological advances has changed the companies focus.  Repetitive and repeatable processes are favored along with defined quantifications for employees performance reviews are the mantra today. As a result, the company culture is changing.  Be aware of potentially  two different views you may read elsewhere.  Prior reviews will likely focus on autonomy and company recognition on the individual.  More current reviews will likely focus on procedural and performance expectations.  With all this said, today, if you are adaptable and aren't necessarily looking for a forever home, this is a great place to work and learn the industry or hone your skills."
good,"It was my starting point and unless I intended to pursue more in that career field, I felt stuck. Unfortunately my career path took a dramatic turn, but I am thankful for what State Farm taught me in terms of office setting work, sales, under financial products and a company in which you can grow."
good,"The job wwas not hard at all. My supervisor is the reason l left the company. If I could've switched teams, I would still be there. The pay and benefits are really good and I would do back if I could."
good,"State Farm became a numbers driven company that lost sight of the employee and the customer they intended to serve. The bar between success and failure was only as low as the BEST person on the team/in the department. It was usually them that had to assist anyone else. The mentality became ""If they can do it, why can't you?"""
good,"The environment of the State Farm Bank is similar to a call center. It heavily relies on both customer and employees of State Farm calling in with questions or in need of assistance. When I arrived at State Farm Bank, I was unsure of my superiors and that confusion was still there once I was fully trained and put on the phones. This made the job more stressful as there was no apparent supervisor for myself and the others under the vendor (temporary contractor that supplies employees). With the constant changes, the calls with other employees were stressful but informative."
good,"Let's be honest, sales can be difficult and State Farm provided a structured environment to help nourish my sales skills! It was not fun cold calling but that is necessary in order to learn how to handle rejection and adapt to the conversation at hand in sales. The office I worked out was small and seemed cramped, however I believe if you can sell insurance you can sell anything so highly recommend to someone looking to add experience."
good,"Good work life balance.  Manager was great.  Agent was absent.  Learned a lot about all aspects of insurance including Life, Health, Property and Casualty."
good,I have had the pleasure of working for State Farm for over 24 years and would continue working there if I didn't have to relocate. I would recommend them as an employer.
good,"There are very few people of color in management. For the time I've worked at my office, I've counted 5 overall out of about 30 supervisors and managers in St. Louis, and I've been there for a long time. Even though there are a lot of workers that have college degrees and work experience, the management tends to cling to the name of certain individuals and those people are the only ones that seem to move ahead. I was told that they already have an idea of the people they want to promote, meaning that if you are not part of that idea, you should plan on doing the same job despite your efforts to advance. I think the company could be a great place to work. They offer great benefits. But if you plan on advancing your career, you need to get name recognition and be liked by upper management. They'll tell you you need more education or that you should complete an advanced project, only to move the goal posts over and over again. Don't depend on skills and knowledge. It wont get you far there. "
good,There is a lot of uncertainty about the future. Many offices closing and employees stressed and untrusting of executive leadership. The Indy office is closing NLT 2020.
good,"I came to State Farm with no Call Center experience. The first few weeks were strenuous education - The company really does drill down on how to work in a call center - you do not leave class unaware or with no knowledge. They teach you and make it to where you are READY to hit the floor running. "
good,"I was given an opportunity to work here and I am glad that it happened. My specific office (they are all individually owned), the management were really tough on me. I had a hard time adjusting, and I also just realized that selling insurance wasn't for me. My bosses were very understanding and we still have a good relationship today."
good,Answering phones and making outbound phone calls. On the computer all day. Hardest part of the job is making people see the value in the product opposed to a competitor. It was a fun place to work and the people I worked with were awesome.
good,"after the big relocation to the 4 major hubs, there is limited growth, constant procedure changes with little frontline employee input, .family enviornment is great but does not make up for compensation (which is low by comparable standards at other major and smaller insurance companies)."
good,"No career advancement in an agent's office. The next step would be to start your own agency. The hours were great. 9-5, M-F. But the pay was stagnant."
good,"It was a nice place to work. Unless you want to be an agent, selling insurance is a dead end job and there are rarely any benefits, if any at all. You are paid a base wage and commission on top of that, which is nice but you have to meet those life/health sales!"
good,"I enjoy helping people and make what seems to be a difficult experience simple and un complicated.  I have the ability to connect with people and was told daily they appreciated my attention, knowledge, patience and kindness."
good,"Lots of turnover recently with increased demands on consultants. Good, stable company to work for though. Benefits include pension plan and are continually improving."
good,State Farm is a fast pace environment depending on the office you are located. and it's very customer service orientated. Every day is different and you are always learning something new. There is not a dull day in the office.
good,Also learning new things in a fast paced environment. Many different department with a variety of people. A large fast moving company trying to keep up with technology
good,"No review - everyone's experience will be different. I would like to find a position outside of the insurance industry. Just like any other job, pros and cons."
good,Great place to start off your insurance career. State Farm has great training to help you succeed with the overall company. Big brand name with a lot of business opportunities.
good,"good people to work with hard company to work for,"
good,Workplace culture was relaxed and positive. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to interact with a variety of people on a daily basis through both phone calls and in-person interactions.
good,"It's really a nice job for someone who doesn't plan on advancing in their career. It'a law office so the work is pretty consistent and repetitive. Tons of micromanaging. Management notices when your 5 minutes late but doesn't know when you're actually caught up on all your work.  Management notices when your late submitting work but doesn't factor in the fact that you inherited someone else's outstanding work due to the switching of teams. Teams switch every 6 months. Attorneys seem to think that it's their own private firm and forget that we all work for state farm, not you."
good,"Not room for advancement. "
good,"Fast Paced Environment, great employees and co-workers to work with.  Great benefits are offered and you can find a career if you really want to drive to the top and work long hours."
good,I only worked for State Farm for about 6 months. I was required to call and offer House and/or Car insurance. I was simply doing it as a part-time job while I was in college. I had no interest in advancing any further in the insurance field.
good,A typical day at work is a day to day grind. I learned a lot about how the Auto Insurance Industry works from a Claims and Underwriting perspective. Management is friendly and willing to help.
good,I worked for State Farm in different offices on several different occasions.  They do not offer benefits of any type and vacations and sick times are determined by the individual agent/owner.  No room for advancement unless you qualify and are educated to become an agent
good,Work/life balance is ok. Interesting place to work. Everyone seems to be really close knit almost like a family. Most people have been with company 10+ years
good,Great company but too many changes as recent with changes coming from above. The work  schedules are not great. The recent changes are currently in progress; therefore the morale is low.
good,"Enjoyed working here, currently going through some changes, if you want to relocate, you may find a great opportunity.   Management was great and the co workers were like family."
good,"great place to be for a short period. But working through the temp agency isn't worth the drive. Need a more stable position, closer to home, and room for advancement."
good,a typical day usually conisist of filing claims and and trying to keep a good consistent pace. Calls are usually based upon catastrophic weather events around the country.
good,Working as an adjuster can be difficult. Most of the companies are about the same but the compensation can be great depending on the contract/assignment you are on.
good,"When I was interviewed, they asked if I had a ""hot list"" of friends.  They did not say that I was only going to be able to use that list for the first two months.  I was only able to get 5 friends to buy from me in the first 4 weeks, so they let me go.  I got no leads from the agency.  I received very little training.  I wasn't even given a business card.  I got to the point where I was just trying to call people through the phone book."
good,This is a call center environment so employees spend most of the day in the cubical on the phone.  The people are amazing to work with.  I don't miss the job but I miss the people.
good,"In the morning, you check emails and beginning of the day activities."
good,State specific underwriting information data entry.  Insurance is a very complicated field with regulations.  Management is pulled in alot of directions with little knowledge of associates duties.  work culture is one that feels depleted. Peers make the job worth performing
good,"They move people around too much in this business. I was with a great team and a great manager. Got moved to a good team, but the manager sucked. He could not manage anyone and basically was there if we could not get in touch with someone on the lead line."
good,When you first get there you here all this about being remarkable and the training for customer service is incredible but the people are not. It's very clique-y and they have unrealistic expectations for new employees and handling time.
good,"Every agent is different. Not fair of me to give a definitive answer about what your experience will be like."
good,I have been here for over 2 years and they have always been understaffed. Not much room for growth unless you want to open an agency (business owner). No real benefits either. Pay is okay but you make a killing on overtime. If you meet sales goals as an office you get to take trips as a team which was awesome.
good,"The job is relatively easy with sales call and office management. Daily meeting phone call requirements and sales goals can sometimes be a struggle. The job atmosphere is good, with a few stressful situations when closing a sale or at least trying to get a sale."
good,Customer focus is priority. Fluid environment that fluctuates in order to provide a better experience or the customer.
good,My shift is currently at 10am to 6:30pm and will soon be changed to 11am to 7:30. There is no flexibility - I can't ask for occasional flex out hours.
good,This was a startup business that was going though the normal growing pains that any beginning company does. I would still be with the company had they been able to support the salary for my position.
good,"Creativity by external consultants is not valued.  State Farm continues to remind consultants that they are outsiders who may not benefit from the trust and respect afforded to internal employees.  "
good,"Good place to work for a younger person or someone not interested in underwriting. State Farm is going through some changes and most of their jobs are moving out of state. No advancement opportunities in underwriting. Most of the management are good people and the co-workers are very helpful, nice people. I enjoy working with all of my co-workers."
good,"Coworkers are nice. Laid back environment. No benefits, low pay, not many hours promised. Not a lot of room to move up the ladder."
good,"After my long drive that should take about 45 minutes, usually closer to an hour or over because of traffic jams, big trucks and bad drivers and lots of stress, I get to work and soon will have to clock in.  Can be written up if absent or late on occasions. So I must leave my house at least and hour and half before scheduled time because of traffic and 29 mile drive one way.  "
good,"I like the company of State Farm, but I think they need to do more work on their internal tools. Waiting on hold for 20+ minutes consistently for a vital resource like Underwriting is not acceptable. I also think the agency structure needs more supervision by corporate officials so they don't lose out on key talent due to mismanagement. They do have good claims service and customer service goals, but they need to be sure that sales goals don't outrank keeping customers long-term."
good,"The typical work day included taking inbound calls, and processing medical claims from injured State Farm customers."
good,This is an interesting company if you are into going into work and just doing your job then leaving. If you need to feel accomplished this is not for you.
good,"The team environment is more virtual than anything. It was very hard to get to know people outside of initial weeks of training, especially with frequent shift changes. I'm a very people oriented and compassionate person so this was very hard for me."
good,State Farm is stable and it's a good place to work for people with a family who desire to work for a large corporation.
good,"State Farm is a nice place to work. You just have to make sure your schedule is pretty open, not much space for life. The atmosphere is nice, and the employees are fun to work with."
good,"A typical day at State Farm was becoming innovative. I learned, the company that was once known for its family and more matured consumer base has managed to gear its organization toward a younger generation and more of a diverse consumer base internal and external, leaning more toward a technological industry. I applaud the company for adopted a marketing strategy in a more sports related industry. Management within the organization appeared antiquated, and micro managing. Hence, a micro managing leadership style did help me to develop great organizational and time management skills. Never the less, leadership is well knowledgeable of the companies history and not shy of keeping the new employees abreast to the importance of the organizations history which plays a huge role in the companies financial stability. I leaned to appreciate the company's history and gained a wealth of knowledge to pass on. My co-workers were of a diverse culture, which made learning and presenting new ideas an asset. If i had to express a difficult part of my responsibilities at this organization it would be, experiencing a death of a policy older and and explaining to a loyal policy holder that has been with the company for many years and who has made no claims, ""how come their premium increased"". I became the best. One other, adapting to new changes while launching a new underwriting center was challenging, but beneficial. The most enjoyable part of working with this organization, was the customer service internal and external, and coming from a sales industry of tenured and new agents and having"
good,"The phones rang at a very fast pace which was very good as far as being able to service the clients and assist in quoting rates for new business. What I learned was to keep a positive attitude no matter what type of negative energy you may be corresponding with.    Management, co-workers and clients were wonderful to work with.  The atmosphere in the office was upbeat.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the follow ups which would consist of 40 to 60 a day, most of the follow-ups depended on the client getting information back to the office which left me feeling helpless.  The most enjoyable part of the day would be arriving early to get work done before the phones went on."
good,A typical day started at 8:30am with 1st phone call & goes on until 5pm. Management was very understandable. Helpful co-workers.
good,"State farm expects you to be to work on time but yet only give employees 35.50 hours but on the paperwork I signed it was said 40 hours"
good,"The typical day mean logging to phone and talking to people who have been on hold for approx. 60 minutes.  They're upset at the hold time. They feel cheated because of the cost of premiums.  The company has changed it's approach to claims handling creating a place where really honest good people are forced to put replace their best asset with a colder, more calculating version."
good,"I worked for State Farm for 3 years. My initial job was deemed irrelevant to the company and ""sunset"". This forced me to interview for another job within the company. I obtained a promotion to a new job which was also deemed irrelevant and given and expiration date. It was a frustrating experience that led to my decision to leave the company. "
good,This company has a great reputation and great customer service. I left because the pay was too low and not sustainable for me. Great job or career for a college student.
good,My day revolves around providing direction and supervision to auto injury claim handlers. I facilitate in the development of employees.
good,"""State Farm Nice"" is a real thing. Cannot stress enough how polite everyone is. With rare exceptions, advancement only reserved for those with most time served. New ideas slow to be embraced. Great variance in amount of time spent actually working. Leadership often seems to operate without a plan."
good,"gave us a years notice of department relocating,   There was not a lot of growth potential and then they closed the department.  We got a nice severance package and was handled very professionally."
good,"Atlanta-great  benefits, low pay, managers are ok. Takes time to move up. The hardest pay of the job was the overwhelming workload and the crazy customer calls."
good,"A typical day at work will include production and a few hours of training. "
good,"You will learn a lot about state laws, negligence, how to be detailed oriented, make decisions in a fast paced environment."
good,"I work auto estimate and handle incoming correspondence for property damage."
good,"State Farm is a great company in itself. You have the ability to meet a lot of wonderful people, and learn a lot about the world of Insurance as it pertains to you. However, I feel that State Farm has some work to do when it comes to taking care of their employees. State Farm is a CUSTOMER driven company, something to consider when applying. The pay is mediocre for the amount of data entry that is requested. Management is ""alright"".  All in all, it is a great company to get your foot in the door to the workforce"
good,"Enjoyed working at State Farm, however the job security is not there.  Some of the management people were great while others were incompetent.  Job Culture is not positive."
good,"This job was a great start after I graduated university, unfortunately it falls flat in advancement."
good,"Overall I have enjoyed my experience working at State Farm.  The insurance business is  24/7 nonstop.  My job was to bring new business to the agency I worked for and I did this through marketing our office, cold calling, emails, and referrals.  Met a lot of great people here so far that have helped me grow into a better leader and salesperson.  This job is for those looking to pursue their own agency. If its not then don't waste your time."
good,"Wanted to retire from there however, always downsizing.  Other peers were a pleasure to work with.  I remain in contact with them still today"
good,Sales. Sales....what can i said its an insurance agency. The office manager is awesome but the owner is hardly there. Its a typical 9-5 job. The location is great for insurance.
good,"Working as a customer service representative was a great job experience. I would talk to many different people all day, learning what customers are most interested in hearing. Following up with clients in order to complete a referral for a quote, giving clients information about our products and possible ways that they can save money on their insurance. I would follow up with clients calling them letting them know about any past due balances, cancellation dates, or terminations of policies. The management here was not very good. They would often misread commission reports and make changes to the rules that are included in the handbook suddenly without giving the staff an advanced notice. I enjoyed working in this position mostly for the experience and work environment that I was very comfortable in."
good,"typical day consist of a multitude of blended responsibilities and roles. I would say that this job can throw a lot at you at certain times, forcing you to split your attention to many areas and manyy different lines of insurance, but that is a valuable aspect as you will gain experience in almost every line of insurance there is."
good,"In general, my experience with State Farm was a positive one. They offer great benefits and pay raises tend to be substantial. Opportunity for advancement is very realistic if the employee is serious about it. Management can be good or bad: I had both."
good,"Strong well known company with entry level opportunities.  Great co-workers. Typical day at work on phones taking in claims for customers, fast paced. Learned auto claims. Most enjoyable part of job is resolving customers issues. Hardest part maintaining company goal of service to as many customers as possible in as short amount of time possible."
good,"Long hours, low pay, people are great though."
good,The co workers are all pretty cool.  Expect long meetings though...
good,Great entry level but the pay is very low and the commission is a joke. It is a easy job!!!
good,"A typical day at work included, investigating and evaluating the facts of a claim, which could include damage to property or injuries to people. Settling claims within my authority level. Working under management supervision with attorneys, in the defense of lawsuits. Using State Farm claims systems and other technologies to perform job duties."
good,"Helping in the claims procedure of our clients. Searching for, quoting, and writing new home, auto, life, health and bank products business. Creating new and effective marketing solutions to grow the agents book of business. "
good,State Farm Insurance is a very stable company. They have grown from a little company in IL to a large global force
good,"I've enjoyed working with State Farm, but there are no benefits or room for advancement, which is why I'm seeking further career opportunities."
good,The people I worked with made the job more enjoyable and my boss was a really nice guy. I learned a lot about insurance and I am glad I had the opportunity to work with State Farm.
good,"Many cold calls need to be made. If you enjoy speaking with people on the phone and you can handle a decent amount of ""no"" responses, this is a good role for you."
good,Depends on which agent you work for and their ability to demonstrate accountability for the office results
good,"*communicating with people on the phone"
good,"Office that is highly customer service oriented with a strong push for daily sales to meet weekly, monthly and annual goals."
good,Create and maintain strong personal relationships with clients
good,"In insurance, there is always something new to learn. Just when you think you have the hang of it, a new situation will come up. That would be the most enjoyable part, in my opinion. Customer service has its ups and downs, though. The most difficult part is dealing with angry customers who demand answers but don't listen and continue yelling. This, of course, has nothing to do with State Farm and more to do with the person on the other end of the phone."
good,"I spend 23 years with State Farm, the first 15 of which were very good. The last 8, however, have not been as satisfying for me. The company continues to have not well thought out reactions to the marketplace, after sitting with their heads buried in the sand for years as their competition ate them alive in the marketplace. Now, it's catch up time. They are spending billions to modernize their outdated systems and in advertising trying to convince the population that they are not your father's insurance company. Who knows, it may work. But, it's been frustrating for me as an innovator to watch for all of these years as the company sat on the sidelines."
good,I worked there for five years and became very frustrated by the fact that I took an entry level position I got stuck. They would hire people off the street for jobs because they had degrees. They did not even look at the fact that many people like me had a degree but took a job to get our foot in the door.
good,"Okay place to work, not a lot of advancement opportunities though."
good,"Great place to work if you need something part time. Entry level pay is not all that great, but they offer additional hours. They are also really flexible with scheduling"
good,"Typical day at work would be an everyday routine. Get in and do what needs to be done. Never stayed in 1 spot doing nothing, always found something to do. Learned more about the P&C as well as the L&H insurance field. Management could have been better. Co-workers were great, but could have been better. Hardest part of the job was getting along with Management. Most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help and assist our policyholders."
good,Long days but satisfying about I was able to connect with the customers. Improving customer service and retention was critical to what I did at the agency.
good,The company has become more focused on numbers and production style type claim handling since it has closed down its offices. The culture has shifted toward numbers rather than people.
good,"Nice people to work with, easy relaxed working environment. Customers are hard to deal with and demanding at times, so staying calm is very important."
good,"Decent place to work to get started in that industry but overall flawed. I was not a fan, but it did feel good at times. Depends on what your goals are individually."
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers. We had great team building actives. Middle management was very supportive and caring. Compensation/Benefits was the best.
good,There could have been improvement in the Job/ Work/ Life balance to where employees did not fear of being penalized or fired when dealing with everyday life.
good,"Management is Good, Work Place Culture is OK, and Currently I am the Senior Employee in the Agency. Hardest Part of Job-No Licensed Representative. JM"
good,I enjoyed the 25 years I worked at State Farm.  I am no longer in the loop since my retirement. State Farm no longer have Claim Service Centers in the San Antonio area and have since moved employees to HUBs.
good,"I enjoyed this job, but my biggest regret is that I felt like the employer ""sold"" me the job.  He said that the base hourly pay was $12/hour but most of my pay would come from commissions.  After showing me the possible sales I accepted the job.  It turned out that NO ONE working in the business was make a 1/4 of the commissions that I was shown in the interview.  I didn't even make 1/4 of the commissions that I was shown and I sold more auto insurance policies most months than anyone in my office.  My advice is to make sure to ask for a set salary or a higher hourly pay."
good,"It's was ok to work at State Farm the parking was at time frustrating, the pay was a bit below others but manageable. The supervisor was not always available"
good,"Bodily Injury had 3Xs the work load for the same pay as Team Managed. Stressful, but the training and experience gained is highly coveted by other Insurers in the market."
good,It’s a typical corporate job. It had a fun atmosphere but the management was a pass or miss. Some of them utilized their position to uplift and push employees to their best potential and others for selfish pleasures.
good,"Too many calls and not enough people answering the calls, watched 24/7 like a hawk. Screens being looked at secretly at a consistent level. Numbers driven company, run. Great pay but with everything all added in, no paid sick days, not able to pick schedules you want, no help with others and the constant managers hovering over your shoulder literally in your personal space and not even acknowledging that they are even there is a NO GO FOR SURE. "
good,Change is the word of the day.  A constant state of change.  The pace of change can get old as it seems processes aren’t vetted fully and trial and error are the norm.  That doesn’t boost confidence in the company or its leadership
good,Would be nice to be compensated more when you kill your self everyday to make a living commission structure is awful but I really like my boss and I am very good at sales with over 20 years experience don’t even apply if you have less than 10 years in cold calling
good,"When I started at State Farm (which is blue jean heaven)  the employee was treated as a valuable asset.  Then we had a change of CEO and it became the opposite.  All that mattered was making sure the numbers were met.  Then they started a reorganization that eventually moved all representatives to one of 3 ""hubs"" which was fine except the only way you could transfer with your job was to pay your own relocation costs.  Very poor treatment to people that had been there for a long time."
good,"Co-workers are gold here, great people, great benefits, and a good culture. My only issue was my manager. People don't leave their jobs, they leave their managers. If I didn't feel like I would never be able to move forward with the company due to his lack of confidence in my abilities, I would not be looking for work elsewhere. It is not the job I am leaving. Mangers - employees are a direct example of the time you spend leading them, if they are failing, look at what you are not doing to help them grow and learn. If you have done nothing to help them, they will fail! Bringing them down will only hinder their growth. I am begging you - please read this and understand. I did not want to leave my job.. I was simply shown there was no other way."
good,The best way i can describe working for State Farm is through the perception of how officers view in society. There will be time that you meet people who genuinely welcome your present but most cant stand you until  you are needed. I'm saying this to deter anyone from working for State Farm. The career is very beneficial depending on your work location. From the optional means of pay/compensation to the fact of set business hours. It makes plan your personal life outside of the career very convenient. Due to the fact that in every state at least auto insurance is state mandated it offers very good job security.
good,team handling of property claims with focus on time and production metrics.  Micro-managed schedules with little flexibility to take time off.  ever changing shifts.
good,"The leadership staff and employees are very welcoming and there is tremendous effort put forth to make you part of the team.  However, in the claims area, the customer servicing platform is very old and has little automation as you may expect for a corporation of its size. Your ability to help the customer is dependent on the agents that previously accessed the claim and how well previous conversions were documented. To begin, it is explained that quality is most important, but the reality was that work was very much production driven. Claim files suffered greatly due to this and it was difficult to take ownership of customer issues with any consistency as processes and procedures varied from leader to leader."
good,State Farm is a very friendly welcoming office. Only thing was during training trainers had scheduled meetings and no other team leads or managers were available for questions.
good,This job is not a hard job at all. Once you learn how to do your job correctly everything else will slowly come to you.  The only thing is they don’t teach you everything right away durning training and I always felt as if I were doing things wrong or incomplete.
good,"Steady, stable employment, with opportunties for advancement, for conservative employees."
good,Corporate structure changed when CEO changed to be a lot less family oriented. The pay and benefits are really good. Work hard you will be rewarded. Managers do play favorites in...particularly in the South...but a good work ethic and product can translate into a pretty substantial career.
good,Lots of changes within the environment. Young management team easy to advance if you can deal with constant changes and strict call flow along with quality team
good,State Farm was fast paced and had a nice culture. The team really was interested in moving people forward in the company even offering their agent aspirant program to move you into your own agency!
good,State Farm is really great at ensuring customers and employees are well taken care of. I enjoyed educating policy holders in their claim transactions.
good,"During my time at State Farm, the company underwent a major infrastructure change that shifted the focus from developing inter-personal relationships with internal and external customers to an intensely metrics-driven environment. Every task an employee completes and every expectation is tracked, measured, and analyzed to improve work performance. "
good,Constantly meet new people.  Depending on managing agent you can learn a lot. Team work environment. Cold calls can be scary but allows you to be creative. I loved the entrepreneur opportunities.
good,Steady pace  environment. A bit stressful at times in the office. Files were not handed off correctly and did not show up as a new alert in the file queue.
good,"If you have a good agent who's is fair, fun and a good guy, you will have a good time working at an office. The agent makes his work environment as they like."
good,"Worked for a really nice agent. Learned the essence of selling insurance and became very knowledgeable of the many insurance products state farm offers. Great hours, used pto whenever i intended too. Very fair workplace and agent was very patient on productivity. Selling insurance for a living is probably one of the hardest selling jobs anyone can do. The idea of selling an intangible product where multiple companies offer the same concept is tough. Enabling one self to sell insurance without the idea of price in mind is extremely difficult. Society has become a strictly price based market. And if your price is not within the selling point you probably just wasted about 20 minutes of your time no matter how hard you pitch it. Unless one intends to be a agent there's really no room for some type of advancement unless you transfer to the actual state farm."
good,I worked in two different offices with two completely different dynamics. My previous office had a high turnover of employees with a constant hiring and firing process whereas my current office has had staff members for years. I love my coworkers and my boss though.
good,"The job culture was great the job was great as well but I was looking to advance into claims, management wasn't the best in helping advance into another field. Very difficult to move from one field to another without experience in the other field, when hiring a large group they sometimes only allow external applications which make it harder to find an opening in another field."
good,"As an insurance account representative, you need to get your insurance licenses.  You will process payments, service accounts, provide quotes, and bind policies."
good,Customer service all day.  Sell insurance and take payments on current accounts.  Advise clients and process claims.  Friendly office. Enjoyed working with public.
good,"state farm is a great insurance company the united states. it has a great reputation and achievement and honor throughout the country."
good,"At one time SF was the place to be for work, however, due to many changes the company has faced, an extreme number of employees have had their job reassigned or terminated by office closure or departmental downsizing."
good,There is not a requirement of working extremely long hours. If you are good at your job you will be promoted. There are many people with narrow skill sets so an individual  with a good skill set and willingness to learn will be valued by leadership.
good,"A typical day consisted of 70-90 calls. Leads were generally online leads or referrals. Every Agent has a different management style, therefore really depends on who you are working under"
good,"Assist customers with their premium payment, transferred as needed to the appropriate area, email ID cards, update address and phone numbers and financial information"
good,I worked for an agent so it always depends on what you are going to get . I worked for a new agent and didn't get any benefits at all as he was just growing and trying to make it work. The sad thing is I have worked insurance more than 12 years and the pay increase hasn't even kept up with the cost of living.
good,Its a good part time job for someone just starting out. The employers who worked there are very helpful to new people and the managers will help as well if you ask. Overall its ok. A job is a job.
good,"I spent the majority of my working career with State Farm. It's a solid company and for the most part I enjoyed my time working there.  However, the culture and environment changed dramatically over the last 10yrs.  It is now all about counting widgets and micromanagement.  Long gone are the days of a family environment. Loyalty, engagement and collaboration has given way to chasing the carrot of efficiency at all costs.  I've seen a lot of good people either be let go, or ground down to mechanical uncaring clones.  It's not the Company it once was...and that is sad."
good,"Just like many companies,  State Farm is going through transition. So changes are inevitable.  We've seen a lot of people leave and many more come in.  We seen procedures change today and then be obsolete tomorrow.  So, it's about being flexible and adaptable.  Your willingness and openness to change makes the transition easier."
good,"This what a standard insurance office, but it gave me the ability to work on customer service skills and develop my ability to work through adversity. the hardest part of the job was that a lot of people like to yell and curse at you as the representative and it can be tiresome some days."
good,"Just wished state farm stayed in ny area"
good,"I do enjoy working for State Farm. There has been opportunity for advancement, but with restructuring there has been less opportunity. There are benefits for part-time employees which is difficult to find."
good,State Farm is a large enterprise that allowed me to gain additional training and educational opportunity.  This allowed me to advance into other roles within the company.
good,"SF cared about their employees & made it a fun workplace. After our new CFO took over the past couple years, they started laying off the experienced long time employees and replacing them with college graduates."
good,"My overall experience was okay, I was definitely underpaid for the amount of work I did, but that wasn't the company's doing, it was the agent. I did enjoy working in the fast paced environment."
good,"Great company, management sucks. If I ever return To SF I would hope for more accountable supervisors. They do nothing in the sales department. Not only one it’s several."
good,Company is great to intern out if you want to learn anything about insurance quotes being a receptionist I really had no complaints. I work there in order to complete my high school project to graduate at the end of the year
good,Company is ok. I welcome change but being forcefully reassigned to a position is not what was expected. Company is downsizing a lot. Turnover rate is ridiculous.
good,stress to keep resolutions in a certain amount of time. Resolving in a specific amount of time was more important than working WITH the customer. Sometimes I feel I am rushing the customer.
good,Good job to work at i worked through temp agency so it wasn't as stable for me good pay and paid weekly I was working the catastrophe campaign and I loved it.
good,"I've always been really proud to work at State Farm. There's a ton of support available, excellent benefits, and they work hard to engage their employees.  Day-to-day work is fast paced and busy, but usually manageable.  The work itself (in claims) can be very tedious, even boring, alternating with extreme complexities that require support from team managers and above. "
good,State Farm has no work life balance the company was changing so much that there was mandatory overtime regularly on top of management not assisting with all the changes being made. This company exhausted me beyond belief. If you have children do not work here.
good,The coworkers are great.  Learned more about the insurance industry.  Opportunity for advancement within the company if you want to become an agent.  Low pay depending on office.
good,"The day is usually 7.45 hours or 8.5 if you have a 45 minute lunch. 2 15-minute breaks are provided. The most enjoyable part would be the activities and my co-workers. The hardest part was leaving because I couldn't move to Georgia. I really liked my management team. However, at the end I learned to not get comfortable because things change when the Corporate management changes: and not always for the best."
good,overall a descent company that needs to work on management and constant changes in procedures. Low pay for the industry but great benefits. Caring coworkers that are like family
good,"Very high volume fast pace must be very organized and self .  motivated.  Great compensation and benifits.  Hard to move up into Management,  Fun coworkers"
good,"Great job, great training staff, good environment."
good,"State Farm is one of the largest private companies in the world, so it is extremely well capitalized.  They still offer a pension and until recently this was a very nice place to work."
good,"I happened to work for a wonderful person. I was not paid what I was worth and the job was very monotonous. I work really hard and would sit for all 8 hours cold calling. It was nice to have walk ins and regulars. "
good,"This job was my first job right out of college. I instantly new that is wasn't a job I wanted a career in. There were opportunities for advancement, but the company was already pushing out a lot of the jobs to other locations to the bigger hubs. So I would of had to move, which I didn't want to do. The benefits were great and there was a lot of opportunity for overtime. You had to work a given holiday and sometimes were chosen to work more than one. I probably would have stayed if the job had paid better, but I also think that office isn't going to be there much longer."
good,"As the role of Auto ILR grew so did the number of changes that we went through. We were expected to meet metrics and keep our call times low but we kept getting more work piled on and didn't receive any pay increase. And there of course is the infamous point system. I watched plenty of my friends and coworkers get fired over absences that were beyond their control because they got too many points. Like many places, there are all different kinds of managers, so hopefully you will get a good one because a bad one can make your life miserable. It wasn't all bad. The benefits were good and the pay was decent even though towards the end of my working there, we had significaly more work added to our job description with no pay increase. We were even forced to help do another departments work that wasn't our job at all and if we didn't then we would be accused of not being a ""team player."" Even though there was plenty not to like, I am really glad I got the experience and I grew a lot from working there. Just don't plan on staying long term as there is nowhere to move up in this role, unless you get moved to a different department."
good,Company provides a midwest feel with a medium paced workplace. Overall the people are nice. The company is currently changing though and the work is now valued a lot higher than the people. Work in the hubs is very relaxed and more focused on work /life balance than that at Corporate offices.
good,State Farm is a good company and their agency system is well-run but being an Insurance Agent just wasn't for me. I was good at the job and always met or exceeded my sales goals but the lifestyle was depressing.
good,"Working towards metrics and cycle time was the least enjoyable. The number of shifts bids, that were not based on seniority was a reason I left the company."
good,"The company is going through so many changes and seems to be going the route of many call centers.   Because so much institutional knowledge is being severed out of the company, the volume of work is too much for untrained new hires to handle.  It's a difficult culture, with processes and structures changing rapidly and continuously."
good,"I loved learning everything about IT. It has helped me in my daily routine, while working. The management could have improved with their communication skills."
good,"typical day could be stressful or relaxed.  there is fluctuation in how much work there is to do.  there is no micro-managing, but also very little development from management.  IT area is a bit behind compared to other companies, but that is typically attributed to the whole ""big ship takes a long time to turn"" mentality.  overall, average benefits, average salary, and decent stability.  however, those ""average"" benefits look pretty good compared to many places that don't provide any."
good,"Very busy, learned multiple jobs. Management was great. Was a excellent place to work, diverse cultures. There was nothing hard about my job. Maybe challenging.  The most enjoyable was to work for State Farm Insurance."
good,"State Farm claims consisted of managing a high volume of complex claims, litigated files, and managerial work. Fun place to work but the work life balance could be better."
good,"It's a great company. However, State Farm has lost it's way. It's not as customer focused. It's more number driven. Have several metrics you have to meet on a daily basis."
good,I enjoyed working at State Farm but management was not supportive enough for me to want to stay. The people that you work with are always respectful and the campus is nice.
good,"The agent that I work for is the best boss I have ever had and I don't think I will ever have another as good as him.  With me being on the sales side, I was able to come and go as I please for the most part (as long as I was making him money he didn't care what I was doing).  "
good,"A typical day included 45 phone calls inbound, pressure to make metrics and yet personalize a call be be available for a customer in need. Mu position dealt only with Auto claims, but other positions that took initial loss reports for fire policies were unable to answer questions about coverages and left customers frustrated. I myself am a State Farm policyholder and will be taking my business from the company."
good,State farm has great culture and amazing management.  The benefits are also pretty good.  They also offer college classes at the HUB sites free of charge. The only downfall is the low pay.
good,"This is a highly structured organization with very little opportunity to advance.  Every couple of years, most employees move laterally from one job to another regardless of their performance.  The majority of managers are ""good 'ole boys"" with almost no management skills or understanding of human motivation.  In the past State Farm NEVER let go any of their employees, no matter how poor their performance or attitude was.  Instead, long-term contract consultants were let go with little or no warning, and for no good business reason.  There is a small minority of good qualified managers and executives who understand leadership, but they are too few and far between to make a substantial difference."
good,"This job paid very well. For someone like myself however, no amount of money could overshadow how difficult many of those phone calls were. I would recommend if you're familiar with a call center setting."
good,"Originally hired as Receptionist and promoted to Customer Service Rep after completing requirements for state insurance licensing. "
good,"Agency work is not the best, specially with how high insurance rates are in Miami. I would recommend trying our corporate. Pay is alright and time off is just 10 days."
good,"Make sure you meet quote for the day or managers become cut throat. Very stressful if you've never been in the call center environment. Business was very casual, not really a dress code."
good,"My experience at State Farm is an overall good one. The work culture there is fun and relaxed. However, there is not a real work/life balance. The commute there was the most difficult challenge I faced. My most recent manager was by the far the best person to work for. He understood that his employees have a life outside of State Farm, which a lot of supervisor there do not. State Farm demands a lot of your time with their 9-10 hour a day shifts which doesn't allow much time for your personal life."
good,"Hello all. Sales are great, referrals are the key to bad I cannot afford to work there anymore. Good luck to all who read this and have a wonderful year."
good,Everything is very structured. You are required to use a tool to record every move you make. You even have to account if you go to the restroom for longer than five minutes. The work is tedious as well.
good,"Casual attire was allowed. Maybe too much.  Some of the phone staff actually came to work in their pajamas.  Unprofessional"
good,The networking amongst associates and management is keen if you are considering moving around in the company. Remember to smile and be friendly to others.
good,"State Farm is a great company with great benefits and chances. The only thing that has raised an issue is management. It can be a little micro-managed depending on your Manager, and the training is very general compared to the complexity of the role. Sometimes it can also numbers and metrics based which can be very overwhelming."
good,"Decent company, but if you are new it takes 5-10 years to get integrated with the ""family"" and be accepted as an employee.  Until that time you are considered new and don't have full support of the good ole boy network."
good,The pay way awesome but the boss wasnt very easy to work for.  She would fire people just because they didnt have the same lifeatyle. Sales goals would have been obtainable had the owner been more detailed and motivational.
good,Working at Cenlar for State Farm Bank loans is challenging. we receive a variety type of calls with different situations. Our goal is to help our customers and exceed their expectations.
good,"It is nice to work there. I enjoy the people I work with. I enjoy assisting clients. Sadly, moving up has proven to be difficult in the agency. It all depends on the agent."
good,"Great turnover ratio, but in the PIM department it's hard to earn promotions. Management hold you accountable for every mistake, no matter how small the mistake."
good,The work/life balance is very good.  The compensation is competitive within the industry.  Staff and attorneys had a good relationship.  Management could be difficult at times.  Company scales back on offices every so many years so job security could be lacking.
good,"Very stressful work environment, very high number of claims. The work is demanding and if you miss you are behind. They use to have a lot of overtime."
good,"Handled getting insurance licenses, developing marketing plan, and developing prospect list for new insurance agency, Involved in all HR and hiring and firing decisions."
good,"I loved working here I learned so much to customer service to inputting information on the computer , I also learned how to take inventory , take and make phone calls ."
good,"My opinion may be a bit on the negative side because of my immediate management. Overall the organization is balanced it it's approach to work they encourage employees to give feedback. As a company, they seem to be going in a healthy direction."
good,"When you work in an agent's office, you DON'T work for State Farm Corporate.  You are working for an independent contractor, so your experience will vary depending of whom you work for."
good,"Organized and solid company to work for.  Great support for staff and agents.  "
good,"State Farm is a good company to work for if you are a person who is okay with being micro-managed. A typical day as a Customer Service Representative includes answering phones, and having team meetings. Work/life balance is good, as long as you report to work in a timely manner."
good,"I feel like the only way to really be content working at State Farm is to be the lead agent of the business. I was just a sales representative at the business. State Farm's commissions are terrible. It's like 10% for auto sales, 20% for homeowners sales and 40% for life insurance sales. "
good,"Working for this company for the amount of time, I've  had with them. I did not have any problems with then,nor any complaints about them. Leaving them was a tough choice,but I wanted to peruse something else, for my career."
good,"I know a lot more than I did before about insurance. It was a great experience and I gained a lot of knowledge from working at State Farm but personally not for me. May be for you, definitely doesn't hurt giving it a try especially if you find an agent who will provide you learning materials and pay for your exams and prep classes."
good,"Their customers are ignorant to the the claims procedure and new initiatives it enacts through their employees. The procedures change every few weeks while they bring in hiring waves of hundreds of people to enact similar procedures every couple of months. They want to make the claims process quick and easy for the customer however you have to say and read a certain script based off of whether or not the customer has time or not. Also you have little to no say-so over what shift you get, and whatever you do. DON'T BE LATE!!!. Not a good job if you have transportation issues or if you're a single parent with not a lot of help at home."
good,My most favorite part of the job is working with People. I love to help them in their life and all aspects of insurance needs. I love talking and gaining their trust and allowing myself the opportunity to meet and talk with the clients and to make them happy to do business with me.
good,"Boss has been extremely flexible with doctor's appointments, time off for sick kid, etc.  Very nice benefit that doesn't show up on paycheck monetarily; but, it is still a benefit that can be very helpful."
good,"There isn't many that haven't heard of State Farm, but many don't know all the products available through State Farm. It's not just insurance: mutual funds, car loans, bank, credit union, and fixed annuities. It's a very large company with a family atmosphere. My personal experience has been a good one, I have a wonderful supervisor and our team is amazing. Very caring group of people. I work in a call center helping agents and customers. The toughest part of the job is sitting at a desk all day, but it is a great feeling being able to help others."
good,"I like to work in a State Farm because it is very pleasant to help the customers in all their needs."
good,"Great company to work for, love the agents and staff.  Pay is not comparable to industry and no room for advancement unless you want to become an agent or move to Dupont."
good,Only stressful at times of cold calling. Laid back environment full of people who are professional for the most part. It was long at times and being seated for the amount of hours required did take a toll on the body.
good,"Answering phones, sales, customer retention, a lot of service work."
good,"Schedule is from 8am to 5pm. Early part of the day consisted of training. After training, applications were to reviewed for new and existing coverage."
good,The hardest part of my job is for me to going to job on time i used to go to job late but i always used to finish my work on time and thats what even my manger like in me
good,"Direct customer interaction positions allow for an excellent opportunity to develop customer service skills. State Farm requires a level of Remarkable customer service, and coaches associates to  achieve this level of service."
good,I enjoyed working as a insurance customer representative.  I am always looking to learn more. Almost the entire family worked in this office.
good,"A good place to be introduced to the insurance industry and also, enjoy working with my co-workers and the current hours of operation."
good,They are independent contractors. Find one who will pay good commission for your work. Other then that its a normal 9-5 office job. Weekends off.
good,"	Bring a positive and happy atmosphere to customers"
good,"everyday is different , we get to meet and help out customers who are unique in their own way. Meeting business owners and their staff. I love hosting events."
good,A growing work place with supportive management.  A work place that allows for personal growth and development. The most enjoyable part of my job is being available to help others succeed.
good,Worked as a Cyber Security Intern for an Insurance company. Learned various Cyber Security technologies and different methods of implemented security in a enterprise environment. The most enjoyable part was being able to work with other interns.
good,I worked in a small office with two other sales/customer service representatives. We were a very cooperative group and coordinated well together.
good,"it was fun learning on the job and watching all the babies grow up and move on to having families of their own."
good,"The environment is a production environment where ""quiet time"" is a major part of the day. Training is ongoing due to trying to improve the product."
good,"I answered the phone, responded to underwriting requests, took payments, and assisted those who came in or called."
good,"While the job itself provides many an opportunity for compensation and achievement, the workplace culture lacks in consistency and consideration."
good,"I really liked my boss and the other lady I worked in the office with. I felt appreciated and I felt that my ideas and innovation was very much appreciated and used.  I had a lot of input on certain situations and circumstances.  I was given recognition and credit for things that I did or improved upon.  I felt both of us in the office were very much appreciated and treated very well."
good,Call center speaking with policyholders about claims. Plenty of opportunities to move around and advance.
good,"ILR- fast paced call center environment. Favoritism is shown to people who spend time gossiping about other people. Management could be better, its not together. That may be due to the ever changing work environment. Nice place to work overall. If you're the type of person who stays to yourself than maybe not. If you have no problem gossiping and walking around all day instead of taking calls, perfect. Pay is decent, benefits are decent, opportunities for advancement are numerous."
good,"Great job, great company. Lot of work, little pay. Assistants do the bulk of the work, and there is constant training that is really inconsistent. Benefits could be better, but a good job for long term."
good,"State Farm Mutual auto insurance claims processing department was an overall decent place to work. Employees ranged in age ranges, cultures, and varied experience. A nice reflection of the real world. "
good,"The culture is pretty laid back. However, we were given one side of the company during training and everyone was different once we got on the sales floor. They know exactly what they are doing to get people to work for them then once you spend the time training they show you a different side of the company"
good,Its a good place to be if you like being indoors and having a steddy schedule.  The training in severely lacking with causes a very steap learning curve.  There are no benefits like WC or retirement.  You do have the potenial for bonuses.
good,Provide customer service along with selling financial products.
good,"I enjoyed working at State Farm, however was fully licensed and wanted to pursue a job as an Agent for myself and family."
good,"It is not a field I am interested in pursuing"
good,"Calling customeres to remind them of late-payments. Calling customer's to ask if they need any more coveregs for Auto, Home, Life, or Bank Products"
good,Is a growing company and you have lots of room for advancement.
good,"Kept records of invoices and support documents. Consulted manuals which include rates, rules, regulations, and government tax and tariff information. Verified compiled data from vendor invoices to ensure accuracy and revised billing data when errors were found. Answered mail and telephone inquiries regarding rates, routing, and procedures. Typed billing documents, shipping labeled, credit memorandums, and credit forms, using typewriter and computer. Compiled cost factor reports, such as labor, production, storage, and equipment."
good,"Learned how to identify customer's needs and match them with our products. "
good,"Insurance sales, inside sales, outside sales, process of payment and insurance, coworkers are great when I was there"
good,"A typical work day at State Farm is busy in the morning, slow in the evenings. I have learned a lot about home and auto insurance, especially when it comes to the process of claims. Management at State Farm are truly great individuals. They know how to keep their employees motivated in a positive manner. My co-workers are great at their jobs. The hardest part of this job is to keep my calm while training 40-80 people individually when the call volume is high with them not knowing exactly what to do. The most enjoyable part of my job is hearing the sense of gratitude and relief in the customers on escalated calls."
good,"Really nice place to work with the majority of people being really nice and friendly to work with. However, management is not so good and the training for the position I have is really bad"
good,"Typical day was a very busy one which was much enjoyable and challenging. There was never a dull moment. The people I worked with provided a pleasant environment since we all shared a common goal: to provide a good product and do it with the best attitude no matter the circumstance. We all would help one another through anything and we all respected one another intellectually and personally. The value of a customer first and sales second, gave us all common ground to work from at that office. There was a lot of data entry and cash receipts involved every day as well as account retention that I worked on at the beginning of each day. We all worked under little to no management most of the time since the owner knew he had a reliable team. The hardest part was dealing with someone who just lost someone with inadequate life insurance."

We all worked under little to no management most of the time since the owner knew he had a reliable team. The hardest part was dealing with someone who just lost someone with inadequate life insurance."
good,"State Farm has a very diverse work culture, but is strongly migrating to a Managed Service framework. I have enjoyed the recognition given me over the years for my work performance. I have enjoyed working in different roles of which I have fully developed in, and then been promoted to a Lead resource on many occasions."
good,"I had a good experience working there, but left to seek out job opportunities outside of the cubicle."
good,"A typical day at work included seing customer , recieving high volumes of calls and learning abour state form insurance and banking products."
good,Did not enjoy my time with State Farm. Managment heavily micromanages and make it very difficult to acheive a balance between work and personal life.
good,Overall good place to work. Salary on the low end. Flexible with schedule.  Not many opportunities for advancement.  Good culture as far as attitude of staff
good,"The employees were great to work with, but the job had become more like a call center.  We were expected to keep the phone calls short, so we could take as many calls as possible.  This was frustrating because we were talking to customers that may be confused, upset or injured."
good,"The best part of working here is the work/life balance and amount of time off given. Pay is low (at least in my department) compared to competitors in the industry, but most managers are great people and supportive. I can only speak for the department I am in though. I would say my biggest complaint is poor communication and organization at times. But if you like flexible schedules and a great work/life balance, then this is the place for you."
good,"When working for State Farm, you work for the agent not State Farm as a whole so the pay is usually pretty low and there aren't really any benefits unless the agent offers which is not usually likely."
good,"This is a good company to work for, the benefits offered outweigh are what kept me there for 14 years. Compensation is not the best but the benefits help to cover that difference."
good,"I was utilized during my internship experience to get real leads instead of just doing busy work like other internships.  I made cold calls to create leads and continued existing leads from the full time sales staff.  The management was at times a little too intense and critical for me, but it's understandable that they want you to help make them money.  It was a good learning experience, and I got a lot out of it."
good,"Was a good company before you just became a number,  Hard to move up in the company. Was a family oriented company before this new CEO took over. Commute is long"
good,"Good days, bad days. Your teammates and agent can really make or break this job depending on how much workload you have. "
good,"Enjoyed my time at State-farm and wouldn't trade it for anything. The environment was relaxed, casual workplace, and the call-center building had lots of amenities. I did not like how reviews of work, management, and the workload were handled."
good,State Farm is a great place to work. They have excellent pay and benefits.   State Farm has a large claims work force and is a great place to put your customer service skills to the test.
good,Throughout employment have continuously worked with interesting and enjoyable co-workers.  State Farm brings employees to be a part of their family...
good,i could take my time to eat and not have to rush to get back to work. usually at other jobs that i did have i had to focue on that. but this job was still starting out so couldnt say to much on a developing agent office
good,It was a good place to work until the customer service and employee relations suffered under constant management reorganization.   Centralized handling of claims made customer service suffer and reduced the overall company rating
good,Pay is alright. The point system for being late makes this plaxe a revolving door of new employees. Not a good place if you have small children or sick parents that require your
good,"State Farm should have more employee interaction events and activities for the employees. Working at State Farm feels too robotic. It's really not a fun place to work, but the benefits are great. There should also be a few more breaks during the 10 hour work day due to the number of calls you take on any given day."
good,"I enjoyed the staff that I worked with, but the pay was not the best.  The company worked many claims and some Saturdays was a mandatory schedule. "
good,"A great place to work, as long as you have the right agent to work for. A fast paced environment with a lot of great customers. Must be detail oriented and follow through with things."
good,Ok I'll be dead honest.  They expect you to be the genuises behind the scenes for the agents and take however the agents come at you with out batting an eye.  There field agents are clueless as heck literally...how they got licensed is beyond me...don't believe me go to an office ask a series of questions and I gaurantee at some point they will call you while attempting to run a quote...all they care about is QA...my manager was dope tho lol
good,"Great coworkers"
good,"FAST PACE environment. State Farm need to create a permanent dress code because Express environment was very GHETTO.  However, benefits are OUTSTANDING!!!!!!"
good,"Great job to introduce you to the insurance world. "
good,"State Farm is a great company to work, at least for my area. Work balance is great, may be too great basically no work just life. Co-work are friendly and helpful. Because the complicity of the business, the company's tech stack pretty advance. "
good,"I have been a bodily injury claims specialist for almost two years. I have been prevented from putting in for other positions.  The only positions to move to are lateral positions or management. Currently I'm not to move into another lateral position, due to business needs.  If you fine with just working in claims, then State Farm is good for you. However, I wanted to have the opportunity to change positions and cannot."
good,"Overall the work space was excellent. The only disappointment is the wage. The poeple are great, the work is very competitive. It is fast paced environment that offers discounts."
good,Promotes from within and is a very conservative and traditional company. Very family oriented and employees genuinely care about one another. Salary can be competitive for high achieving employees.
good,"Received great training and information as a stepping stone into insurance. No work life balance, the company does not care about their employees.Nice bonuses, but very hard to move up in the company unless you are well at being a managers favorite. Very micro managed."
good,"Typical Sales Position"
good,When I started with State Farm it was a great company to work for however after our previous CEO Ed Rust retired the company was not the same. I use to be able to recommend people to want to work for such a great company however; over the past few years they treat their employees like they are only the bottom line and not people.
good,It was a good place to work just not the right fit. The people were very nice and accommodating when I questions and it proved I am still a smart person passing the property and casualty testing.
good,"Besides becoming an agent with my own State Farm agency, there is nowhere for me to go in my current position.  The pay is mediocre at best and my benefits are non-existent.  Due to the competitive nature of insurance sales, especially with the increase of price shopping done online, State Farms business model does not make me want to open up my own agency.  I feel like your neighborhood State Farm agent is going to be a thing of the past, similar to your neighborhood Blockbuster store (Rest in Peace BB!)."
good,Overall had great experience up until my last team manager. The company was great when it came to volunteer work and great when it came to working with college students schedules.
good,"A typical day was spent working the phones. If you are someone who is productive on their own and doesn't like working as a team, this would be the job for you. Yes, the position is within a call center, but we were not allowed to work with teammates to confirm appropriate action in a situation. Some direct managers were more relaxed with how they ran their teams, others, including upper management, were not and would micro manage everything you did."
good,"The company has been around for many years. That's says a lot.  They have had their ups and downs.  it is definitely a different company from 10 years ago, some good some bad. I think it is still one of the best companies to work for as long as you know where you want to be in the company."
good,Always something new coming your way.    Constant change.   Doing more with less.    Decreasing pay and benefits.  Hardest part: working with Customer's when there was no coverage.   Best:   Meeting new people and learning new processes.
good,Claims is a high stress environment with daily conflict interaction.  You need to have not only technical knowledge but also knowledge for customer interaction and conflict resolution.
good,"Every company has good and bad branches. The first Agent I worked for was a nightmare, but my co-workers were awesome. The second Agent I worked for is the best boss I've ever had, but my co-workers make working there miserable. The pay is good depending on what Agent you work for, we are all salary + commissions. I am part time and my boss is very flexible with me missing work for my toddler. No benefits for part time, but the boss makes sure we all know we are appreciated with group perks and gifts. State Farm as a company needs better systems in place. If you like working behind a desk it's not the worst gig in town for the pay."
good,"The metrics are unbearable. State Farm is losing customers and great employees because of the micromanagement of each call. Average handle time is recorded daily and ""coached"" in front of the team on a daily basis if not met. It's nearly impossible to give the quality of customer service that State Farm customers need and deserve during a claim call during the time allotted to do so."
good,"State farm is an overall good company. Needs a little bit more work, need to care about employees well beings instead of numbers. Management needed more work. Co-workers were nice and easy to make friends/family. Compensation and advancement is dream that was told to make you stay. You really have to work hard to move up and have no family to take care of. CAN'T MISS work lolol. If I could go back and work eehhhh it'll be part time"
good,I actually love working there.  I work in a true Agile team supporting a web-based application that provides positive input to company's bottom line. Problem is with job security right now.
good,"Typical day very different for customer service employee, my job.. Learned that the insurance business is having to know many rules, regulations"
good,"Working as a business analyst with State Farm allowed me the opportunity to develop critical thinking, communication, and technical skills. The work, for the most part, has been enjoyable. Due to some issues in the industry the culture within the organization changes leading to negative attitudes and unwarranted stress for employees. Fortunately, the first line leaders within the organization have done and still do their best to make the work environment productive and enjoyable."
good,"Typical day of work consist of being very busy. The phones never stop ringing and you will sometimes, most likely at least once weekly have to deal with angry or upset customers."
good,"Management likes to micromanage sometimes. Sometimes workload or queue is very large. Way too many meetings to attend yet work queue will pile up on you. Many employees feel like they cannot leave because they have invested too much time of themselves."
good,The training was in need of some polishing and updating.  There should have been more emphasis on quality of the service provided and not the bottomline.
good,"If you are looking to be an agent, I would definitely recommend state farm to you. This company is a great one to work for and I truly believe it is the best insurance company out there. A lot of time there are little benefits and low salaries with the potential to make a good living on commissions."
good,"I had a good experience at State Farm, but it just was to slow paced for me.  There is now a lot of competition and honestly it's hard to beat the prices of other competitors such as Geico, as well as the distance of other local insurance companies.  The amount of commissions for policies were very little.  You did not receive commission for policy holders that renewed their policies.  I am sure there are areas that have more incentives, and offer a more competitive salary."
good,"A typical work day consists of conference calls, negotiations, and maximizing settlements with both insured and uninsured parties.  I have learned to utilize my resources to maximize recoveries.  Management is readily available to assist with any issues and collect ideas to help better perform specific job functions.  Hardest part of the job is to understand the opportunities for collections as different laws vary by state, knowing who does/does not have potential for earning capacity, and know when to draw the line in negotiations.  Most enjoyable part is customer satisfaction and business results."
good,"state farm is a cool place to work. the benefits are great, however if you're not able to multi-task, this is not for you. it is a fast paced environment and you have to be willing to change with the culture at state farm."
good,working was a good experience and under a great manager/owner.  taught me a lot and showed me many techniques for marketing as well as insurance and financial things.
good,State Farm is a great company to grow with. Great benefits. Slightly hard to move up to management positions unless you have been with the company for a very long time.
good,"Everyone's outlook will vary depending on the agent you work for. I currently work for an agent thats been in business for 20+ years. It is a very low pressure job but can get very stressful depending on your agents commission structure. I joined in order to open my own agency however, I am the number one producer in my office and I can hardly afford to support my family. If you are single and are looking for your first job then by all means, this is a good job for you."
good,The supervisor had to be constantly assuring people that she is the boss and no one else. Authority problems. Please tell us more about working at this company in Your Review.
good,"They base pay for the company is $15.50/hr which is fantastic compared to other companies. For the paraprofessional level jobs, there is no education requirement. If you do wish to move further within the company, you will definitely need to further your education as well. Even for jobs you don't even need a degree to do. Just having an Art History degree will get you further than someone who has been here 15 years, but does not have a degree. "
good,"Now that they are consolidating to ""hubs"" if you aren't willing to pay to move yourself you're going to lose your job.  I love what I do but I can't afford to pay to move from Indianapolis to Texas when it wasn't my choice.  If I had made the decision it would be one thing, but I didn't so I don't feel I should be penalized for wanting to keep my job by having to pay to move with my position."
good,"I work for an agency in the Las Vegas area. I focus on providing financial security to new customers transitioning to State Farm. It's a tight knit office, we all get along and work well together in helping exceed our goals."
good,loved the people and job.No micro-management at all. I worked remote half the week. Downside is there are no benefits and the goals can feel unattainable at times without pouring in 70+ hours a week. That amount of time is ok but I expect the compensation to reflect that and it doesn't.
good,"BOD, underwriting emails, selling and quoting of new or current business. Retention, maintaining customer service and that clients leave with knowing that their needs have been met and willing to let others know about there positive experience with State Farm."
good,"* told exactly what to work and when to work"
good,"I did not work directly for State Farm, but I worked in an agent's office and corporate is very hard to deal with on occasion, but there are some that will go above and beyond to help you."
good,I liked working with state farm and it was very educational. i did not get any benefits such as health insurance or 401K. it was a small office so everyone was close.
good,I worked with the mail a lot. I opened daily mail for the paper dept. and delivered it to the correct person. I also did filing and some data entry. Management was very nice. The job was only a temp position.
good,Its a good place to work with supportive management and peers. Using open sources and new technologies are being used. Its lacking in few technologies and not very handful when it comes to working remotely
good,"Being an office representative at State Farm requires a lot of outbound calls trying to sell insurance policies. "
good,"Did not enjoy the position. Work and co-workers were good, but employer was not and I felt I worked in a very hostel environment."
good,"Never the same job each day.  Very  Educational and Rewarding . Being able to preform my administrative,  managerial & customer service skills each day,  provide direction , build relationships and know you have made a difference each day is very rewarding and motivating."
good,Very important to get right on the phones and start calling people to sell. There are constantly inbound calls coming in that you have to answer to handle service work as well. It is important to stay focused on sales at the same time though.
good,"The place looks nice, but state farm has and continues to hire so many sales reps the sales are distributed so you only get maybe  1 or 2 sales a week now so there hardly no commission. You get hired on as part-time and trying to get a full time shift is set up to be almost impossible. There are 2 types of sales supervisors at state farm those who are generally a good supervisor, and then the bad ones that are on a power-trip because they are in a supervisory position."
good,"Claims ILR associate. The new point system is going to be a game-changer. New associates, be mindful of the attendance policy as you will not go far if you do not adhere."
good,"Great company to work for with amazing benefits. "
good,"A typical day at work involves making many calls to our policy holders providing the best customer service experience possible. I have learned data entry, analytical skills, insurance training, sales experience and much more."
good,The position I work isn't for everyone. It's mentally high in demand and takes a lot of tolerance. But our support is critical to our internal state farm employees and associates. It's a rewarding feeling to be able to help keep a business on it's feet.
good,Very fast and productive workplace. Everyone is very nice and management is outstanding. Can be a little much at sometimes. But was a great learning experience.
good,"Assisted insureds with auto and medical claims regarding motor vehicle accidents. Verified liability by researching police reports, statements, and damage. Upheld the rules and policies of the insured and explained coverage options."
good,"State Farm has been a wonderful experience, with several learning opportunities.I feel there could have been better communication between management and employees.  They have great benefits.  Very different bonus structure then, other companies.  The company had the worst training structure, they need to revamp the training across the board."
good,"a typical day at the office for me would be opening the office, responding to emails, taking calls for payments, policy changes, setting up new policies for the insured's needs. Processing bank deposits, servicing walk ins etc."
good,"There is a ton of change to adapt to in the work environment. Supervisors, procedures, systems and shifts change very often. "
good,State Farm is a great company which is cheapening it's business and thus is creating an environment in which it's employees can not make enough to support a decent quality of life and also is creating a culture in which errors have become a constant problem with no end in sight.
good,I dealt with customer service for the most part and it helped me improve my communication and speaking skills. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to learn about our customers when they came into the office.
good,"Required to give the best customer service and product knowledge consultation as it relates to current and future life insurance needs. Consult existing and prospective clients, create an initial relationship with clients, educating clients about product and coverage options, schedule review appointments as well as client information updates. Face to face appointments are required to conduct life review, writing up the application and closing the sale with signatures and payment. In addition to this I am responsible for a few select callers who reach out to our existing clients, collect referrals and set appointments for our team of specialists."
good,"Worked directly under Property Manager, reviewed leases, produced tenant leases and acquired vendors to work on properties.  Provided any administrative duties to Property as well as Senior Property Managers.  This was a grooming position in becoming a Property Manager which isn't the most glamorous but was a great experience in seeing what it took to become a Property Manager.  The most challenging part of this job was doing all the daily duties of a Property Manager but not actually being one.  What I enjoyed the most was being part of a different aspect of the Property Management industry and having a great responsibility within the company."
good,Great supervisor & co-workers. I learned a lot about propoerty & casualty insurance.
good,Great summer job. Pretty decent pay for a college student. You sit for 8 hours so if you need to move around this isn't for you.
good,"The company has excellent benefits and compensation, The opportunity for advancement and job security is also amazing. The thought by management that all employees eat, breath and live for the company is false and makes working when you have a family not pleasant."
good,Great Company to work for considering the benefits are excellent.  The pay could be better your salary slowly creeps upward with hard work but at first the pay is not your highlight of your job.
good,"The people at State Farm Operations (call center) is a real good place to work. The people are easy to get along with. Most managers a easy to talk to (but not all). Easy part is taking the calls and going thur the motions, the hard part are individuals patience."
good,Call Center environment with a college campus type environment.
good,"As a contractor:"
good,"Work hours: Monday - Friday 8 AM - 4:15 PM"
good,A typical day at work would be meetings everyday before you  logon the phone
good,Not for the faint of heart or those who aren't willing to put a lot of work in for not a lot of money. Good experience for office work and dealing with a lot of different types of people.
good,Great work environment. Hands on Management. Weekly goals and progress was reported. 
good,A typical day of work included a lot of phone calls to various internet leads and direct mail leads. It is important to be highly organized and on top of your workload as this position requires a lot of follow-up conversations with clients. I learned how to manage my time effectively and how to prioritize my days. Management is extremely flexible and it basically comes down to being self-motivated and working through the grind. The most difficult aspect of the job is the amount of sitting behind a desk and phone calls you have to make. The most enjoyable part would be the work-life balance that you can enjoy from this type of position.
good,Company focus on gaining the best talent out there; focus on brand recognition to gain more business
good,Enjoyed my time with the company however found myself bored to death often which made me seek out a much more thrilling career field however this can be the perfect spot with someone whos okay with not getting the most from their career
good,Sales driven position. Manager was amazing and really helped/taught me a lot. You will require customer service experience as well as sales experience.
good,"Like any job, there are ups and downs, but overall the training is great, and they give you a lot of useful skills to use in the job. The skills thereafter, are mostly learned on your own over time. Team meetings were inconsistent in a time where they were most needed, and TM support was not a top priority."
good,Middle management is going the wrong direction. Have not bought into the digital transformation and fight to maintain the legacy hard. Leadership is trying to not let go of middle management but to be successful they will have to
good,You can learn a lot about the industry. Very much micro managed so expect a lot of feedback. There is very high turnover. If you are looking to advance it is difficult since the metrics MUST be met in an extremely high volume environment such as the auto department. They can and usually hire for advanced positions from outside the company.
good,"A typical day at worked started consisted of me answering phone calls regarding clients' claim status.I learned things about auto and home insurance that I didn't know in the past like adjuster information and deductibles. I also learned that my managers didn't always have answers to my questions, but provided me tools in which I can obtain those answers on my own. The culture working at State Farm is very family oriented. And I say that because it feels like a family. Most people who worked there have been working there for more than five year. What I enjoyed most about working there was the bond I built with my co workers."
good,I was in a department where you could submit tons of ideas and create training etc but your ideas are rarely ever given true thought. I was one of the few remaining people in my department that was well versed in almost every issue I could possibly encounter. The training for new reps was a joke. The assistant line that reps would call if they had issues had people answering that had never even worked that position prior and had scripts to look through to try to help the reps. Overall poor management/higher ups since new CEO took over and started changing everything. Many people quit the company after this.
good,State Farm was a very professional work environment with a fast paced crew of employees.  Everyone took their job seriously and were determined to give the best customer satisfaction in the business.  As an intern the hardest part was acclimating to the already established work environment.  I was in charge of setting meetings for the agents and helping the owner of the office with any tasks he might need assistance with.  Overall it was a great learning experience and I enjoyed my short time with the company.
good,"The job became more about speed and volume more that assisting customers."
good,SF was a great company until they introduced a call center environment with call center metrics and an EOM management philosophy to handle auto and fire claims.
good,"Significant experience working in a large environment where moving things along can be challenging, the matrix organization has its challenges with accountability. This place taught me how to weave my way through these"
good,"I was not a licensed agent so i had very small tasks, when i would try to ask questions i would be ignored and not given a direct answer. Although I did learn a lot about the insurance business."
good,"I really loved working for State Farms corporate office. I wanted to retire from this company, but they started having problems and started laying off many people and that's when I started looking. I didn't want to be one of the many that were laid off."
good,I enjoyed my job but recently they have begun downsizing.  Several employee that have been with the company for a long time and were very dedicated lost their jobs due to downsizing.  This made the employees very nervous and concerned that they could be among the next cuts.  This made the job very stressful.
good,I worked for my employer for many years prior to my territory being eliminated. I enjoyed my job and continued to learn new things that were changing during that time after I knew my job was ended. If my position had not moved out of state I would have continued to work and enjoying all aspects of my job. I thrive in a challenging environment.
good,"I was hired on before they built the new location in Tempe, our department was new and literally only had 30 employees. When we changed over it was micromanaged and management was constantly on our backs. They really do try to get you to move up which is really nice."
good,Various work environments each agent is different to work for.  Each office environment is totally different.  It is a competive market and must be ready to sale sale sale
good,The State Farm structure to becoming an agent is very restrictive and not so easy as everyone may believe. In order to become an agent you have to meet specific requirements that are somewhat restrictive to certain demographics in my personal opinion.
good,"A very friendly, comfortable place to work.  Everyone is very respectful and kind, making going to work a pleasant experience.  You really got a sense of being connected and having an impact on the business as a whole even though the work was repetitive and tedious.  However, this workplace is hard on attendance, FMLA protected or not. Look to spend a lot of time at work and working OT."
good,"Good company to work for. There have been some fairly dramatic changes in compensation and retirement packages recently. State Farm has good employees, but consistent, knowledgeable management remains a problem. Solid profits for every year I worked there. Excellent bonus progra"
good,My experience is only limited to my internship experience. The workplace was relaxed and slow paced but very routine like with little chance of acquiring new skills.
good,It was hard to leave a company with such great benefits. I had to relocate to another city and there were no other job opportunities there. The company has changed greatly over the past several years. It is a very stats oriented type environment now. Management styles with definitely vary from department to department. The hardest part of the job is remaining extremely flexible since you could get an assignment a few days before you have to train the material which makes it stressful.
good,"State Farm has changed too much that they are now forgetting about the employees."
good,"Day to day operations were easy to manage and benefits were great with the company. Great peers and management. However, the company is focused on making use of available space in hub locations. Entry-level employees do not have access to relocation benefits thus creating a shrinking job market and many layoffs as operation centers outside of those hubs close."
good,I worked for State Farm for 40 years.  Compensation and benefits were good.  My management was great to work with.  I worked in auto claims. I also worked with a great team.
good,"Diverse. Computer program usage - Connecz, Rumba, Quest, Skype, Outlook, Company program used - T2, many websites, rate manuals, process guides, auto memos, state specifics. I worked there from 2013 until 2018."
good,"inbound calls-learned about auto/fire insurance and a lot things I never understood in the insurance realm. Working weekends, is the most unenjoyable part of the job."
good,"Having to deal with angry customers because we have been having premium increases, the company does not notify there customers of an up coming premium increase"
good,"Its a good company to work for with great benefits and a clean work environment. Downside is the shifts don't change for  months, so if you are on a 10hr schedule you will have it for awhile"
good,"Each person has their own preference and reviews. This was just simply not the job for me. If you enjoy working with customers, this is the perfect job for you."
good,Freedom to accomplish assigned tasks.  Management believes in their assigned associates.  The people at the company are great and make work enjoyable.
good,"Although scheduling was extremely flexible, everyone had to work a weekend shift every week. If you got lucky someone would pick up your Saturday or Sunday shift."
good,"The office is very relaxed, but since the competitors are so much lower than State Farm in price it is hard to make sales. Market more towards older people because they care about the agent experience instead of the cost as much. The service side is horrendous- using outdated systems from the 80's and no idea if changes went through for weeks. The agent I work for is the only reason this job is nice. It's not corporate feeling and very relaxed - but that means less pay is coming in making your paychecks sad."
good,"State Farm implemented new work methods You are very micromanaged, including when to take breaks and lunch, which can change at any time. The goals are reachable, but you feel you are set up to fail. Morale is low. I was so anxious about meeting my ""numbers"" it affected my ability to do my job as efficiently as I wanted to. .Some thrive in this environment, but most hate it and are more stressed than before State Farm made the changes."
good,State Farm is a great company to work for. I did not particularly like the office I was in because there were no benefits and the location was not busy. It was hard to make good commission because it was not a busy location (and there were 2 state farms super close by) and he had too many agents working in a slow office.
good,Great work environment! I love the people and management here. It is very relaxed. The  only problem is the compensation if you are just starting out.
good,"State Farm is a great insurance company to work but it also depends on the agent you work for.  There are no employee discounts on insurance for auto, home or life."
good,"I work as a contractor for StateFarm. "
good,"A typical day at work is calendaring deadlines; e-filing, prepare settlement documents; request settlement and mediation checks from claims.  The work was not hard, but I was let go because they felt I wasn't getting it.  I felt I had a target on my back from day one.  Very cliquish. HR showed favoritism.  The job still appears on job boards.  I would never work there again."
good,"Working at State Farm afforded me the opportunity to not only complete claim work, but to also understand and complete settlements with both customers and their attorneys. It was a good company with opportunity for advancement."
good,"The most ethical company I've ever worked with.  The culture is informally called, ""State Farm Nice,"" at Corporate.  The perfect company for people who want to focus on their families, because taking vacations is mandatory, and the ebb and flow of work correlates with the school year. "
good,"I answered phones, greeted clients, made bank deposits, ordered supplies and set up appointments."
good,"great company to work for because its a reputable one. but does not offer benefits."
good,"Management does not always no what there doing. They need to be retrained. Well at least my Sup did."
good,"Micromanaged environment"
good,"State Farm is a good company to work for. Insurance isn't fun because the every day customer has no idea how exactly it works, but that comes with any customer service position."
good,"State farm is a great place to work, they really do work with you and want to better you as an employee. They see you as an investment but the only problem with them is their management setting. You have 4-5 bosses each breathing down your neck about the same thing you did wrong so that's 5 people lecturing you but on the plus side you have 5 people trying to show you how to do it right"
good,"State Farm is a great place to work. The benefits are great and the atmosphere is great. However, the pay is inadequate unless you work a lot of overtime. Other companies in this industry pay almost more than half for the position I'm in than what State Farm does. Pay is the only drawback here."
good,A typical day at work is making people happy and feel secure. It is a very pleasant atmosphere to work in and I enjoy what I every day.
good,I assisted the agent as a telemarker in opening his office back in August and the office staff was wonderful. Best staff yet! Then in San Antonio I worked with another agent he was just at great mentor as my first boss.
good,"Schedule is 8 to 5, Monday throught Friday. Grab coffee and call on sales leads. Most of the time people don't answer their phones when they don't recognize the number. If they answer, quote their insurance and try your best to sell the company's value because State Farm rates are often not competitive. If they don't answer their phone, leave a voice message, prepare the quote to be as enticing as possible, email it, and send a text for good measure. Wash, rinse, and repeat for a week or so, in hopes that you can get a response. All the employees that I work with are really cool; not dramatic or gossipers. The Agent is real cool and patient. Their is quite a bit of a learning curve. Learning all of the ins and outs of insurance, getting your sales pitch down, building your confidence takes time, and building the habit of making alot of calls. The most difficult part is selling enough policies in order to make decent money. The best part is the schedule and chill environments. I've learned alot about selling, communicating effectively (knowledge, technique, emotion), and generally finding away to get people to buy. Obviously, you are going to have alot of people who will say ""no"" because of price. You can't win them all. You have to sell the company as being the best."
good,The company gave many opportunities to learn. Empoyee friendly company with many of the people ready to help in need professionally.
good,"When I first started here, my trainers and the seasoned employees all professed how much of a great company it is to work for. I also feel that it is a great company to work for, but there are definitely some cons to working here. I feel like there are a lot of inefficiencies in the procedures and systems that my department uses. It is very hard to get time off. There are only a certain amount of hours allocated to each business day for time-off. It does not matter if you have plenty of vacation days. if you do not get you request in at least a month or so in advance, then you probably will not get the time off you need. Things come up unexpected and sometimes you just need a day off to go take care of them. It's not very easy to that here. The hours of operation are fine, but they do prevent challenges if there are errands that you need to get done before or after work. Most other businesses are not open in the morning when and most are closed when you get off. The starting pay is definitely a con. Another con would be that you have to stay in your department for a full year before you could go to another department. If you don't like your department, then you are stuck for a year."
good,"Customer focused"
good,"A lot of cold calling in a agency, and pivoting to products to service our clients the best."
good,Great work environment. A typical day at work was calling people to sell insurance policies. I learned sales was not for me. My coworkers were vey nice and became great friends.
good,"Overall my experiences with these companies are good, nice working environment and good work life balance."
good,"Great place to work at, everyone is very nice, it is with agency, so no benefits."
good,"A typical day at work is usually comprised of answering phone calls, issuing work orders for estimates, reviewing electronic correspondence, and updating calendars. Company is focused on teaching their employees how to work in a team enviroment, manage time wisely in between phone calls, and working at a high production volume. Management is very supportive of their staff and strive to help develop their skills. Co-workers are easy to work with and knowledgeable about the field. The hardest thing about the job is dealing with complaint calls on a regular basis from hostile customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is working in a climate controlled environment."
good,"Employee experience depends on the agency. Agent team members are employed by the agent, not State Farm, so compensation, benefits, training and day-to-day experience will vary depending on who you work for. Good place to get your feet wet in the industry."
good,"At the time sf was an amazing work opportunity with tremendous room for growth and advancement. I left for personal reasons, but had I not had to do so, my entire family and friends know I more than likely would have retired from there!!!!"
good,"Nit very competitive salary, & not many paid days off, not employee benefits, However is a reliable job & stable job, mayor holidays off, i had the best boss but pay wasn't good for my needs"
good,"Being in a fast paced environment is good but when you're constantly taking back to back calls because of under staffing, it drains you. Besides that, its a good environment and good company to work for with good benefits."
good,"Overall, the job itself wasn't so bad. The job description was pretty accurate. The only negative is that it doesn't include or inform you of how fast paced the environment is."
good,the job got old really fast. If you dont mind settling in a good company. This is for job is for you. They want you to grow within them. Not even the money could get me to stay. I had to follow my own dreams.
good,"Contact Center keeps you restricted when it comes to opportunity."
good,"Open and close office, made and received calls, filing, help manage employees, sold bank products.  Company was not great but I had a great boss.  Would only recommend for new people entering in the business."
good,"Benefits are good.  "
good,"It’s hard work, especially if you travel. They keep track of everything you do as far as schedules and metrics . They do a lot for their employees to encourage a fun work place but working in claims can be stressful."
good,"Could work a flex schedule"
good,"I did not like their point system that they have in place. If you called in and it was unplanned, you will receive 4 pts. If you call in another day it's an additional 4 points in which you receive your first drop file. If you have a stroke on the job and have to be transported to the hospital...points."
good,A typical day is spent in a faced past environment. State Farm has a strong culture and trains the employee adequately for each role. The only downside is that they pay lower salaries than the competition.
good,The people I worked with were very nice and nice office space.  Beautiful view from the building in downtown Tacoma.  Had parking for employees which is important in Tacoma.
good,There is job security as long as you are doing what you are doing to meet and exceed metrics. The company is going through a variety of departmental changes. Its a great company to work for as long as you are used to transparency and change.
good,The co workers are all a team working together . The customers are very important to us and care about them when they are unhappy with their policy . We all work helping one another and providing the best service we can for the customer.
good,"Positive environment, great staff and friendly customers. Always something to work on while on the job, lots of mutual respect of personal time and taking time off."
good,"I love not having weekends to work, but it can get confusing with all the information that is required to know for the job."
good,"Our local office has been a very good opportunity while I had children living at home.  Through this job I have learned leadership, accountability, and motivation.  My co-workers have become family and we socialize often outside of work hours.  The hardest part of the job is working with the public however, a lot has been learned for the sales/service piece of this job."
good,"The current position I have at State Farm, is claim processor in the Health Response Center. I take call from all states, I provide verification of coverage to providers, claim status to providers, policyholders and agent staff. State Farm agents sell, Medicare Supplement, Long Term Care, Disability (individual, short-term and mortgage disability), Supplemental Indemnity & Individual Limited Hospital Surgical policies. I also, have to check state mandates for coverages. In addition, to knowing policy coverages, I am able to assist providers by reissuing benefit payments when payments have been lost or sent to incorrect address."
good,"State Farm is a group of insurance and financial services companies in the United States. The company also has operations in Canada."
good,"A typical day at work is busy with not a dull moment to spare. I have learned to accept the unexpected and learned that every claim is not the same. Each manager will handle situations differently. My co-workers are great to work with. The hardest part of my job is adhering to the numbers that corporate wants us to meet, however, my most enjoyable part of my job is communicating with my customers and handling each claim in it's own merit."
good,Remarkable environment from top down. They teach being remarkable inside and out they also push education. The managers main job is to make you a better employee to move up get promotions and educated.
good,"Typical day @ work was answering incoming calls, taking loss reports. Issuing checks, and any other task from the adjusters,"
good,"Not many complaints about this company. great pay. great team environment. great people. Thier business structure is set up a little differently than most and it takes some time to get used to. Auto claims is a lot of hard work though. Benefits structure is a little hard to understand and use here. But overall, pretty cool place to make a career."
good,Enjoyed the atmosphere and culture but of course that is not what pays the bills. Ended up transitioning to another company that paid me significantly more for the same role.
good,"Being a claim rep is not for the faint of heart, you have to deal with customers directly in frustrating situations and people pretty much are the worst. However, State Farm compensates well, the work-life balance is incredible, and the benefits are the best benefits I have ever had. Overall, the company is amazing, the job is taxing but you can leave the work at the office at the end of the day."
good,I worked here for a while now and it’s tome to move on with my life and change it up a bit. I really enjoyed my time there. It was a good experience. But now i shall move on.
good,There is not much that need to be said great company diverse and opportunity to grow. Wonderful benefits. Like any company 1 bad apple in leadership can ruin your opportunity out of hate. Be careful who you rub the wrong way.
good,"Everyone is friendly and they job is a breeze, just make sure your coming close to target and you know what you doing when closing deals. Sometimes getting a customer can be tricky"
good,"My working experiences at State Farm, was awesome and I truly enjoyed my peers and the management team I interact with as a Senior Technical Bank Analyst."
good,"I come into work sit down and work on claims all day. It was easy, it was fun moving vehicles to Body Shops. I work for Agero. I worked all of the State farm Accident calls. Looking to expand my knowledge in vehicles even further"
good,"Productive and calm environment. Pride is on providing a remarkable customer service experience. Most of the managers are great, open minded and straight forward."
good,"Laid back environment, learned a lot about the insurance industry in regards to home, life and auto. Great supporting management staff, with a very diverse culture. Hardest part was learning not to use certain lingo with customers, all around job was fairly easy."
good,"Excellent morning routine, easy going day to day duties"
good,great job for someone starting out in the work field. great co workers some great manager not my typical ideal for a call center job
good,"An average day, would include phone calls answering emails, providing customer service to customers who come in the office, complete cash handling."
good,"The State Farm Service Center was being relocated out side of the Greeley Co Area therefore so were the employees, I was contracted to come in as an Administrative Assistance."
good,"Insurance, my job is to open policy for each customer that walk through my door. Everyone need it and should have it."
good,State Farm was a great company for encouraging their employees to be the best they could be not just for the company but in their health. They offered several programs including a work place weight loss program.
good,A typical work day is easy going. I learned skills on the computer software and insurance polices. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping a stressed out customer with their problem.
good,"-answer existing client inquiries"
good,was laid off but overall very relaxing and fun place to work. once you get past the training everything slows down and you can start to breathe again. gained a lot of weight working here tho
good,"Quiet workplace with very supportive management. Very small staff in the office which had its benefits and setbacks. Found the work to be very challenging as I don't see one of my strengths as being a sales person. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers in person, and learning how to better communicate and really get to know them a bit. The Service Specialist was first on the phone, billing, and other maintenance work in regard to billing."
good,State Farm is a good company with a fantastic structure built in. It's important to know though that you don't always work directly for State Farm most often you were working for the agent and if your agent is not willing to be a great manager and fantastic leader you may find yourself overburdened overworked and underappreciated
good,There isn't a whole lot you can do within an agency before you cap out on advances and salary increases. Agency roles are acceptable for individuals out of high school.
good,I worked for one State farm agent for 4 years & then another for 20 years...
good,I love State Farm the company but my agent has no clue as to what he is doing.  He has only me to work with right now since the other two have not passed their licensing tests or background checks.  This all should have been completed prior to opening day.
good,"make calls to people to tell them that policy was up renewal ."
good,I enjoyed my time at State Farm but I don’t think it’s for anyone other than people wanting to peruse their career in insurance. It’s a lot of work and tests to take in order to work their and be successful
good,"You are required to sell banking products as a licensed insurance agent.  If you do not meet those banking goals they withhold your commissions for Property & Auto sales.  So you may be a rock star agent selling 50k or more is personal lines but you will not get your commissions unless you open bank accounts and loans for clients,  That just sickened me.If I wanted to work in banking I would not have chosen to be in risk management.   You will be paid your Life commissions because they have to pay those regardless.  Also each Agency owner does things quite differently.  One agency may have better carriers to work with because the agent actively participates in programs and options designed and put in place by the ""mothership"".  Where other agents will not. So do your homework and ask to see the companies you can place homeowners with before coming onboard.  Otherwise you may be left with the JUA as your only option in the south Florida market.  Be sure to discuss what the monthly goals for bank products you will be required to meet in order to receive those other commissions before you choose any captive agency."
good,My opinion is based on one particular agency which is no longer owned by the same individual. There are good agents out there who are very good to their employees.
good,"Dealt with customers."
good,enjoy working.. its a good feeling knowing you are not only selling but providing coverage and support from a good company.  Obtaining positive feed back from your policyholders.
good,"Review of basic auto claims."
good,I didn't enjoy my time there. I was not cut out for insurance sales.  I was to have been doing bank loans. each day the job duties would change. I wanted more structure.
good,In order to know be able to perform job duties one must be an independent learner to carry job duties. The co-workers in the office are very friendly but not available to help so often. Every day is a learning experience since all of the situations are different but a happy customer is the rewarding part no matter how difficult a situation may seem.
good,Had unrealistic sales goals. Agent always threatening your job. Puts other employees down in front of their coworkers. Our agent was like a high school bully.
good,"I am not a behind the desk person so this job was not really for me. I did it to get some experience and try to have it for future advancement. The experience was good, but I want to do something more geared towards my degree."
good,8:30-5 daily. You must complete service and sales work individually. Leads are internet based as well as depending on referrals. Not much marketing unless you paid out of pocket.
good,"The management was poor. The agent had been in business for many years, she had a lot of business but very short handed. The employees did not receive proper training, support, or the help needed to maintain a good work flow."
good,"My advise would be to run. The culture sucks, pay sucks, benefits are ok. This is a sweat shop. They only care about their bottom line. Management and culture sucks."
good,"I learned a lot about insurance and was proud to work at State Farm. However, the agent I worked for was a toxic boss, paid males more than females regardless of qualification, disrespectful toward/gossiped about clients, also gossiped about employees, made comments on physical features or appearance, and threatened employees. Also did not comply with labor laws or policies, however, State Farm doesn't actually monitor agents' hiring practices."
good,"I learned a lot about the computer system.  The hardest part was learning their system.  The most enjoyable part is working with the coworkers.  A typical day includes answering customer questions, adding and deleting vehicles, and quoting insurance products."
good,"State Farm is a solid company. Premiums are ever increasing which frustrates customers and makes retention and new sales more difficult but not impossible. That said, the numbers are okay but not great. A more competitive market would make all the difference. There is no career advancement and no benefits. I love the customers and the position, I hate that I have capped out at my salary and advancement potential mid career. State Farm seems to encourage its agents to keep salaries low and benefits non existent which is sad. We can't have the products we are most encouraged to sell."
good,"typical day at the office learned about insurance coverages, hardest part of my job was getting sales from cold calls.."
good,"In a typical day, I would review customer's policies and make sure they issued right. Also, I would make calls if there were any pending issues with customers as well as answer calls from current and new customers. Many clients walk in to make payments, make questions, or start new policies and my job is to help with any of those activities. I have learned to deal with different types of customers from different ages. Our manager is barely in the office and my co-workers and I work very independently. Each one of us knows his/her tasks and performs accordingly.  The hardest part of the job is when policies do not issue correctly and I need to find out why. Also, finding the product that fits customers' needs can be difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I help customers with a claim and when I deliver checks to cover for the damages."
good,Would not work here unless I were to be a agency owning my own agency
good,"State Farm is a fantastic company.  The corporate employees care and are very kind.  "
good,My typical day at work would be calling clients to remind them about there payments or to take payments. Filing paper work. I learned how to you a fax a machine and scanner. The hardest part of the job was to make sure you remembered who to call and who made what kind of payments from car to flood insurance. The most enjoyable thing was learning to work in an office and getting that experience.
good,"State Farm is an agent operated company, so compensation and prospecting very quite a bit. Overall the company and products available are outstanding!"
good,Here's the thing. I LOVED working in insurance. I love working and pivoting to people the different things we had to offer. I don't like MICROMANAGING.
good,"Adequate "
good,Very enlightening but shortly enjoyed due to no advancement opportunities at the time. I would advise anyone looking to work here to do their own research
good,"State Farm is a great company but in the past couple years they have made such unrealistic, vast changes that it has caused an ridiculous amount of turn over at the corporate side of things. most of my job is spent arguing with underwriters, and service people who don't know what they are doing and have made horribly costly mistakes. There appears to be no training, accountability, or coaching at the corporate locations. If you want to have something fixed or done right then you usually have to bark super high up the chain. lots of business was lost because of mistakes made at a corporate level that no sense of urgency was shown to resolve issue."
good,100 calls a day 8 quotes and 2 sales needed for every day - monday to friday- could take your work home on the weekends to attempt at making more commission
good,"State Farm is a great company, but long term didn't see growth potential or benefits of staying.  I worked for an agent who was in their first year and it was a lot of work with little benefit."
good,"Service existing clients and cross selling different lines to better protect them, call and obtain new business through leads that were provided by the Agent of the office."
good,had their picks and showed favor to some employees always was rude callers and nothing was done about it. I learned that the customer is always right people that work don't have a say so or opinion or feelings
good,"Start the day off by knocking on doors to offer prospects a free homeowners insurance quote. I was able to learn what State Farms best products were, so I was able to determine what business' I should research and go offer them a free quote face to face. The management is very good, if I have a question I am able to ask anyone in the office and they would all be happy to help. The culture is fine, nothing out of the ordinary. Hardest part of the job is going into over 40 business' a day and having owners tell me no. But the way I look at it that's just one step closer to hearing a yes. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help my clients in anyway I can. I also sleep well at night knowing that the policies I write have the proper amount coverage with an affordable price."
good,"The company is pretty solid. Although, there is a change in the atmosphere where disconnect between leadership and staff is ever so present. No longer a boss employee family style environment but is now based on numbers and graphs to determine your keep.  So you must be competitive in all that you do, as you should! "
good,"I worked with this company as a temp and when it came to get permanent I was told no."
good,"Very grateful for this company because they were the reason I got my license in property and casualty. Management was ok, but it could've been better. but in a lot of ways I owe my career to this company."
good,"Your position consists of taking inbound sales and service calls from either customer service or directly from the agent's office."
good,"My typical day at State Farm was a fun and relaxed day. It was an easy job position and I enjoyed working there. I was mostly on the computer all day typing things, doing internet research, answering a lot of phones calls making sales calls ect."
good,"I think State Farm is a great company at the corporate level, however, being stuck with a poorly run office that underpays and lacks good office culture and management structure lessens my opinion of State Farm at a franchise level."
good,"Calls All day, you take inbound call and may have to do Outbound, "
good,"If agency is able to delegate then an agent can make money, but if you are required to write every line make sure you have excellent time management skills"
good,"In the most recent office that I worked at it was very noisey with my co-workers, and boss for that matter, constantly talking to each other across the office.  It was almost never anything work related and was disruptive."
good,I was not happy. The owner was a bully. Had favoritism and pay was horrible.  I was not satisfied with my position and every day was a headache due to my employer.
good,"unfortunately i was not employed very long with State Farm. I was able to further my education upon leaving, and felt it was a better opportunity for myself and my family"
good,The job entailed spending a majority of your time at work doing cold calls with high sale goals to reach. The work environment will vary from agent to agent - some agents have limited insurance knowledge.
good,Can’t control unexpected rate increases which leads to a loss in many customers . If you don’t meet the impossible sales goals you don’t get any commissions . Been working here for 2 years and haven’t seen any commission in my check ever .
good,"I would not be considering leaving if I had better management. If you have an issue with the agent your employed by, there really isn't much you can do about it. You can request to transfer agencies, but the requests are not always honored. There's no chain of command to go to get help."
good,I liked the job overall but the training should be done by a program that teaches instead of an employee. Everything but the insurance questions was hard to keep up with.
good,"Good stable job, but hours are not flexible at all. Little to no part time positions. When I left the company there was two options for all part-timers; go to full time or quit."
good,I really loved the competitive feel I got at Statefarm. Money always drives me. What better way than to give your self your own paycheck with how hard you work. Of course you need a set salary to pay the bills that never change but if you find a decent agent with a competitive salary structure your able to make a decent amount of money. Put in work and you’ll have your own clientele with in a small business itself.
good,It was indeed a productive workplace but I was never offered the incentives and benefits that the other employees were offered even though the workload was equal
good,Loved being apart of a company that care for customers. They have been in business for many years so their service is reliable. State Farm is the number #1 insurance company in America
good,"Working beginning of day and doing service work on auto, home or flood policies. Handling monthly and past due accounts. appointments and pivoting to other policies."
good,"State Farm is a great company for their policyholders.  It is a premier product for the person looking to bundle their Household policies into one place, with a promise to protect what is important.  I have worked for two very different agents.  Agents are required by management to maintain a certain number of household policies and to add more monthly.  A lot of times these agents are competing for the same business.  It does create a since of micromanagement at some locations for the desperation of ALL employees' time being used to recruit business."
good,"The people that I worked with were what made the job enjoyable.  The job was stressful and we were often given unrealistic objectives to complete.  For the most part, I would recommend the job for a young single individual."
good,Every office is different so one cannot reflect on all. It all depends on the management and how the office is ran. It is a hard field to learn but once you do it is pretty easy and enjoyable
good,"I didn't like working for something I didnt believe in"
good,"Each office and Agent requirements are different.  Clarify job expectations and decide if it fits with who you are.  As a State Farm insured and an employee of the company, being employed there was an advantage."
good,This is a company in transition which is in an industry which is also in transition.  There are many opportunities if your willing to work hard.  Inside culture is not what it once was but this is still a good place to work.
good,The company itself is wonderful. The work load flow is okay but how well you do and the opportunities vary from agent to agent. This job offered no benefits packages
good,It can be a great job if you have a good agent.  The rules and office setting can be relaxed and even fun if your agent is a good manager.  The training and compensation all varies based off the agent.
good,"As a service representative, not any room for advancement. Job duties monotonous and not any gratification for job performed."
good,"SF is highly matrix driven however, if you exceed expectations there are no rewards for the additional work.  SF will not pay bonuses and their pay is lower than the competition.  Schedules/Managers change  every 6 months which require a lot of flexibility in your personal life."
good,"Constantly busy taking care of customers' needs whether it be taking claims, payments, selling policies. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the flow. The office was always short-handed so you learned to multi-task and work effectively in a high-pressure environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help clients with their insurance needs."
good,"Employees didn't really matter as much as 'pushing numbers'"
good,"State Farm as a company is great to it's customers, but working for a State Farm agent is different from working for actual State Farm. Each agent is different and there is no room for promotion and growth in an agents office most of the time."
good,Called on agents to help them grow their business by means of offering/selling financial service product to existing P&C policy holders and prospects.
good,"working at state farm abled me to learn more on balancing books daily, and more customer service"
good,I think this is a very good company to work for especially if you are a mobile employee.  They are very flexible with your hours and there is great people to work with.
good,I loved my coworkers. We really worked in a team enviornment
good,"It's a great job if you like sales and customer service, however a lot depends on the agent you work under if you work in an office. "
good,"Poor management, going through transition, must be mobile to be promoted"
good,"Nice buildings, Nice town, Nice people (other external contractors) - but if you have ever wondered what it is like to work in Saudi Arabia as a guest worker, this is your place. The internal workers do nothing but attend endless meetings and pretend to make policy and schedules -- The external workers do all of the real work."
good,I loved this position as interim youth pastor in that I was able to assist student in reaching their potential and inspire them to be better adults. Taught caring and compassion
good,Interned briefly and was grateful for the experience. I was able to understand the process of updating customer information and addressing calls received.
good,"Management is always change and they are not consistent across the board.  "
good,"My over all review was not pretty much as expected , I was so excited to try and give it my best for this Agents office but it’s hard to work for an Agents office that does not value a single thing you do."
good,"Definitely a place you can move from position to position, but not a lot of room for true advancement. Great company and overall place to work though."
good,Onboarding took 5 weeks and was difficult. The schedule must be adhered to exactly or you will be considered non compliant. Had to punch a time clock and very rigid in rules.
good,I liked it and it was fun for a time but after a while its insurance. I can t believe there is a minimum in these reviews that they are forcing me to do on here
good,"Answering phones and questions to move their claim forward"
good,"The benefits are great.  The management is something to be desired. Team managers aren’t always knowledgeable about how to handle claims. There’s isn’t consistency in claims processing, therefore there’s no accountability or reward when necessary. This makes for a stressful environment, especially management does address the work force’s concerns and lack of camaraderie."
good,"if you get stuck at a local agency tough luck.."
good,"The job duties and environment is completely dependent on the agent you're working for. Unfortunately, once you're working for an agent, you can't move to another agent without quitting. So be sure you select the right agent to start with from the beginning."
good,"Very nice place to work, but no room for advancement. I worked very well with my co-workers. My boss was very caring and very family oriented. It was a great place to work."
good,"The insurance world can be a complicated one, but you can grow to love it if you're willing to push yourself!!"
good,"There were extenuating circumstances throughout the entire training process which changed the entire role I applied and was hired for."
good,A lot of times things were not handled in a timely fashion.  The general mood was poor around the office.  Not a lot of people liked being there.   Poor attitudes about being at work from co workers.
good,"A typical day at work could be long."
good,Good for those looking for a high pressured sales opportunity as that is what is needed for advancement.  Find a good agent or manager but be picky as a bad manager is a killer.
good,Toxic Environment for mental Health. OK hub shut down so workload increased at all other hubs. Not good for mental health. Great Benefits and an ok temporary job.
good,All ok to work for with a pretty good training program. Just the different styles of managers. Commissions could be good if your sales were good. Varied from month to month. Salary before commission were ok also.
good,"Typical day consisted of inputting data regarding Medical and No-Fault forms, management was friendly and helpful, hardest part of the job was the tediousness of data entry, best part was flexible work hours"
good,"When I worked there SF as a whole was a great company to work for, I was just in the worst department ever. Leadership was terrible I don't know how much has changed since then."
good,"Sales is always driven by numbers.  However, in my role I was not given much support in having leads brought in.  The lack of guidance and leadership lead me floundering each month with my sales.  While I learned a lot about the products, I had little help with marketing and prospecting.  Overall, each agent is different, I did not have a good experience with mine unfortunately."
good,"No real complaints , company is currently going through a massive restructure every department is affected and layoffs are very abundant right now ...."
good,"great company to work for.  a lot of the work is on your own, so you have to be self motivated and focused. compensation -can be great if goals are attained"
good,"I've been an administrative assistant and account manager for a State Farm insurance agent for going on 4 years. The pay is good for an entry-level position, but as I've taken on more responsibilities it really doesn't match with the level of work and effort I'm expected to give. "
good,"Answering phones, helping current customers with payment and insurance questions.  Hardest part of the job was not having answers for the customers due to me being new, and my manager always being too busy.  The best part of the job was helping the customers with their questions when I did know the answers."
good,"A typical day includes sales, service, claims, billing questions and concerns."
good,"Management does not seem to care as much about work/life balance as they used to, they seem to think they can hire anyone to replace you."
good,"Large restructuring has resulted in most of the operations and opportunities for advancement to be located in Atlanta, Dallas, and Phoenix. "
good,"Great company to work for but has its own disadvantages, I learned a lot working here, but the managers are just the complete opposite of what this company stands for."
good,This company is great to work for. The compensation was not very good however. The schedules are not tailored for the working single parent.
good,"My job was in sales/marketing. I would service current customer policies in order to ensure quality to our customers. Every member of the team was a team player, and we made sure that we all were learning."
good,Over all this was a good company. They just have a lot of out side contractors that they pay less money too so they could fire full time employees
good,"A typical day at work is full of customer interaction, constant activity, high expectations and the need to multi-task and show great customer service."
good,"Arrive 1 hour before everyone else, get all reports & lists ready for agent & myself for the day.  Phone turn on at 9:00, spend the rest of the day answering phones, taking payments, helping customers on things I am able to without being licensed.  Helping customers that come in the office.  Scanning, faxing, filing, anything that anyone needs done I do it."
good,"typical day...reminders of past due premiums, quoting & writing insurance applications, customer service in person & on phone, working with underwriters to complete policies, contacts with 1 line customers to save $ with multiline, servicing policies, making changes to coverages by request, banking, & more."
good,Good place to work and good environment to learn new things inter act with customers and seeing them happy with there quotes you give them and recomend more customers
good,It was very enjoyable and inspiring.  Learned how to relate with clients and provide the best service.  Unfortunately I am inactive for the time being.
good,The owner had been an agent for 20+ years and did not have enough staff for their number of policies. Pay was not even a livable wage. Disappointed...
good,"I learned how to deal with cash, learned excellent customer service skills. It taught me how to be a team player and work at a fast pace. It gave me the organizational skills I have now."
good,It was fun and sometimes hard. Most days I just answered a bunch of questions. Pay was okay nothing special. Bonus structure was okay nothing special.
good,State Farm is a great company to work for with a great deal of portential growth. It is important to understand the every office has it’s own agent  and it’s own rules
good,"In a typical workday, I had many tasks I had to complete, in which I usually did. Unfortunately, the management was not professional or polite. There were many times that I had to explain why I felt this way and it was never resolved."
good,"Salary $50K, stand in line to clock in- micromanaging to the minute.  Where have you ever heard of an employer refusing to allow you to work off the clock to learn to do your job better."
good,"The hardest part of the job is knowing how to deal with the many different types of people that came into the office, also State Farm seems to be always changing their systems and programs. RIP ABS."
good,Culture is lost and agency is a cutthroat environment. Really wish State Farm would reward P&C more than life but it is what it is when your home insurance rates are so high.
good,"As a temp, my typical started with prepping my fellow coworkers with the necessary stock need to begin production in PIM."
good,Very hard work!  Rewarding and stressful.  I enjoyed the clients and reviewing what there family needs were.  It was rewarding knowing we were helping educate them on what their current and future needs were.
good,Working for an agent can be great or horrible. Many agents from past typically don't have to work because of old contract. New agents have to scrap for everything.
good,"If you're an agent, then your job is pretty secure and your success comes from your drive and hard work. If you're not an agent, then your job is expendable."
good,No training and throw you right into it. Customers can tell you haven't been trained well. Co-workers didn't care to help at all. Manager was hardly ever at work but frowned when certain employees missed work.
good,"I've worked for 3 agents. One of which was absolutely amazing. I had all benefits, and they helped me advance. The other two, not so much. It really depends on who you work for...as you're not technically working for State Farm, but an independent agent."
good,Its has been a long time since I worked for them.  At the time of employment everything was fine.  Enjoyed working storm duty.  Would get to meet new people and help with recovery work.
good,"Working for this company with eventually be a dead end. They are eliminating the need for underwriters, management, claims handlers and licensed agent staff members."
good,Not much room for advancement unless you want to own an agency. No benfits offered at lot of the agencies which makes it not much of a career in my opinion.
good,"Agent changed the employee on types of sales and the Value of their sales.  This would change often on sometimes a weekly basis and provided the employee with a poor view of the future changes that may be made,"
good,"I enjoyed the team of wonderful people I have worked with both in office and across the nation. State Farm has opportunities to do a wide variety of jobs, allowing you to change careers in the same company."
good,Gained valuable experience but salary was minimal and commissions lacking.  No real incentives to grow with the company and no opportunity for advancement.
good,"Your desk would consist of several different subjects of work. Each day when you start you would prioritize your day and workload. Over my 15 year tenure, I learned how to change client names, beneficiaries, address, SIN numbers, birthday's, adjust payments, set up and distribute death and disability claims. All levels of management were approachable and available to provide new information about company changes, new systems and support. The hardest and yet most rewarding part of my job was death claims. They were hard to deal with the death of someone but you felt good in helping their loved ones to be at peace and be able to pay for the services. I also loved the people I worked with."
good,"Generally worked alone on production machines. Had goals to meet every night, I loved listening to my music and getting my work done. Coworkers were available if needed."
good,Had sales goals to hit that seemed lofty and year by year they raise their rates but yet expect you to still be able to sell the same amount of policies
good,"If you apply to work with State Farm or any Insurance Company it is best to get your license prior, since you will have to complete other passed training through their own State Farm University. I Enjoyed working with the Customers and Staff."
good,"I have been an IA with State Farm for a total of 4.5 years.  I love the work environment and process there, however, I disagree with the necessity for adjusters to leave their home state and travel hundreds of miles for months at a time. when there are opportunities in their own home cities and states.  I believe a lot more IAs would be more productive if given an opportunity to work at home."
good,"Things have changed at State Farm. Lots of changes have been made. Some good. Some bad. "
good,I would show up sign in take calls and help any new people to come onto the floor in our section because i was very good at my job. I was voted to join the State Farm Leader program because i was so good at help people transition from training too taking calls live.
good,"When I first started with State Farm they were all about career advancement. Then they started to freeze promotion. Even taking away promotions from people that had earned them.  It started to feel like you would never get out of the position you were in. Once they finally lifted the promotion freeze (6 months later) there were no jobs to apply for within the company.  They pay less than all the other insurance companies but they do offer a Pension which is a bonus. They also took away sick days and instead you have to use your own PTO for it. They also moved to a points system where if you accrue to many points you will be fired. Keep in mind you will get a point for clocking in from lunch 5 minutes late and if you clock in from lunch a minute late they take it out of your PTO. Everyone was on edge and standing at the ""Clock-in"" machine."
good,"long hours poor life/work balance  exceptional salary from I A firms"
good,"In this type of retail business, expect the same kind of obnoxious clients as walmart, except you're talking to them. They are the ones who never pay their bill (although it's the law), they have excuses as if it mattered in my paycheck, or some of them are upset with me because they cannot seem to be responsible for their own spending."
good,"I loved my boss and my team but the insurance world grew tiresome. Long hours, complaining customer and to many elements out of our control set us back constantly. Not to mention constant rate increases which made it harder to sell new business and retain clients."
good,I really enjoyed workin here for the time that I did. I felt I was not advancing to the level that I think I should be at given my education and experiece.
good,"Many jobs are leaving and moving to the Hub locations, Dallas Phoenix and Atlanta.  If you do not have the flexibility to move, then you need to start looking.  This has tanked morale overall and people are running for the hills."
good,"Great company benefits, clean working environment and good office culture, but very low pay. Training was very detailed for 8 wks and quite extensive. Documentation somewhat overwhelming."
good,State Farm was on the cusp of major change at the time I left. It was a great 14 year career for me and I made a lot of friends. I value the knowledge and experience I gained while there.
good,State Farm is a good company once you get in the right department under the right management or team but most departments are overworked and understaffed. The company whole has a high turn over rate/ They provide good benefits if you can over look everything else.
good,The job wasn't bad at all. I had my own little office. The days were very slow and the job itself was nonproductive. I knew about 2 weeks in that the job wouldn't last long.
good,Workforce at this company is shrinking due to high stress.and people retiring. Management expects employees to do more and more with less and less people in a much shorter span of time now than at the start of the year.
good,"for me personally was a very steady repetetive job, i like challenge and something new everyday. it was a bit boring. i did learn a lot about all different types of policies.  but there was always down time."
good,The company has changed.  A typical day varies from one office to the next.It is increasingly difficult to make sales because of the strict underwriting guidelines.
good,Job Security can be an issue and they push sales very hard on their employees. Pay is another issue because compensation is at the low for what you sale on a daily basis.
good,A typical day at work consist of sort thru large stacks of prints and getting them prepared for mailing. Prepare certified mailings and also attend daily team huddle meetings.
good,"No two days are the same.  The phone continually rings and there is always something to do. Whether filing or marketing calls to make and writing insurance for autos, home, motor cycles, boats, RV, etc...Also have all banking products such as checking, savings, cds, IRA, auto & mortgage loans etc.."
good,Great place to work if you are single with no family. takes a lot of commitment and drive. If you can put in the time the pay is incredible. Benefits are awful no health insurance or life insurance. Work hard and dont be afraid and you will do great
good,Liked coworkers they were very friendly and wanted to help you in any way that they could. Lunch breaks were nice and long.
good,"Plenty of opportunity for advancement. Sales limits are endless. More localized training is desired. The most enjoyable part of the job is to work for a local agent and being able to work with my customers face to face, building a special relationship with each and every one of them."
good,"Typical day at work would be start with cold calls. Then our morning meetings of the day game plan and numbers.Some customer service calling for payment, checking correct addresses, filing paperwork in alphabetical order, faxing some paperwork, sorting and preparing mail for post office.  The hardest part for me was starting with the cold callings.The most enjoyable part was the set time schedule. After working in retail, having a set schedule became heaven for me."
good,Fun customer friendly atmoshere. Great traing programs for emp[loyess who want to advance. Mystery shoppers evaluation once a month.
good,"State farm is a great place to work. A typical day at work consists of answering the phone, and greeting walk in customers. It's a fast paste enviorment, movement through out the office. Mangament is great and very helpful. The employees are more life family, we get along very well and help one another. The hardest part of the job is explaning to customers their premiums went up. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping out or clients and giving them the lowest premiums as possible and giving them discount options always makes people happy."
good,"I scanned document and entered claim numbers into the computer. I loved this job, and thought I had a chance to grow with the company, until they closed down my department.I made alot of friends at this job that i still stay in contact with today."
good,"This position is wonderful for that person with a Sales mentality as sales drive the entire workplace."
good,This job taught me alot first out of college about working. The hours were good and the environment. It was a good mix of coworkers.
good,"I enjoyed being with the agent in that office. Unfortunately, the company was receiving low numbers."
good,provided me the opportunity to wow the guests with outstanding customer service and their absolute satisfaction to encourage future visits as repeat guests.
good,"High paced.  "
good,I would supervise over 75 collection representatives on a daily basis. I would listen to selected calls for monitoring and answer complaint calls. I was working with vendors to secure better phone and recording systems.
good,It depend which agent you work for they are all different and some don't have benefits.
good,I love the people I work with. I love that I am doing something that I understand and helping people while doing it.
good,"small office, no room for moving up quickly, fun workplace, awesome coworkers"
good,"I made some very lasting friendships while working at State Farm, and have many fond memories of my time there."
good,"A typical day at work is usually pretty laid back, but it can get very busy, very quickly. "
good,"Good work environment."
good,"Was 440, and Bank certified for customer assistance. Facilitated policy construction and daily office deposits."
good,"sales and service of insurance and bank products offered by State Farm. Process daily bank deposits, open and close office."
good,Days are unpredictable and rewarding. Office is typically small with no more than two employees assigned to an agent. There is also lots of online training for changes.
good,Took phone calls did quotes data entry helped people with claims billing
good,"Was an employee here for a great many years, gave them my all and when something came up that was unable to accomplish they turned their back. I blame this on Management as exceptions are made all the time."
good,"State Farm is a great place to work as a Customer Service Specialist.  The environment is very professional, but relaxed.  They need to up the pay!! 👍🏼✌🏼"
good,Strong infrastructure and management direction offer a great potential for success.  The internal customer does not exist unless made a priority specifically by management as it is not State Farm policy.  Fragmented culture is the biggest challenge.
good,I got this job when I was in high school. My teacher was friends with the associate there and got me the interview. But I didn't work there for long because I was still in school at the time and they were looking for someone with a more flexible schedule.
good,Its a good company overall.  Recent changes in the last several years were not a good fit for my personal situation.  The workload had become unreasonable and time off was difficult to obtain.
good,"When I started at State Farm 28 years ago, the company was very family oriented.  Over the years it has become very much  more structured and numbers driven."
good,I was really looking forward to joining State Farm as a Claims Associate however once I began going through the training process I realized the job vastly differed from the position I had reviewed and applied for online.
good,"It is very tough to start with a new agent who has never had State Farm experience.  They do not know the ins and outs of the State Farm systems.  State Farm is currently running 5 different systems and trying to merge into one.  It causes a huge headache and mistakes to often happen, due to one platform not updating into another platform.  Until they can get this figured out, there will continue to be frustration for employees and customers"
good,"Depends on the agent in charge what tools, training, and compensation you receive. One person quit in our office but our agent was so dependent on her, he gave her massive compensation package to return rather than training the team he had. Now our compensation suffers as he gives most commissioned cases to her. Newer agents are probably better to work for. Or just more successful ones."
good,I learned to have better customer service due to dealing with different kinds of people on a day-to-day basis. This job taught me to have more patience with customers and to be able to juggle all of the different needs of each customer.
good,"Special circumstances led to my dismissal with full unemployment benefits. Fair place to work. Ownership and escalation is a bit distorted however SF follows the trends."
good,"Good atmosphere, pay on low side commissions no where near expected. Mom n pop type agency has pros n cons . No room for advancement. Great customers and staff! Excellent training!"
good,The job was part of the marketing team in which we did the same exact thing all day everyday. After a few months I just didn’t see myself going anywhere with the job. The people were nice and I made some great friends. The manager was awesome. We did have one fun night as an office team and did some fun activities. The job is good if you want an office job where you mainly sit all day.
good,"Great work/life balance"
good,"The change in CEO has really altered the company culture. Work Life balance has all but vanished. Concentration on metrics, scheduling every minute of the day, and inability to get 5 days in a row off, make for low morale and less than optimal working conditions."
good,State Farm insurance is the best insurance company to work for except there was no benefits offered to sales associates. If you work hard and sell you can make a good living but besides that it's really demanding to sale!!!
good,Fast paced daily work environment.  Must be able to multitask! Establishing customer relationships is the key to long term success. State tests are required.
good,I enjoyed all the things i learned and the people i worked with. My mangers were always horrible but the agent himself was a very pleasant guy. I had no benefits or insurance which i found ironic but other than that it was surprisingly enjoyable
good,"Call centers aren't very flexible and any time off the phone is scrutinized closely, the life center had very little advancement, breaks were pretty ok"
good,I enjoyed my team and my job duties. Their internal interview system is more complicated then their external interview process. Plan on applying several times and if you can't sell yourself (no matter level of experience) you most likely will not get the job.
good,Learned a lot about the professional culture. Helped me become a reliable employee that is eager to help others. The boss truly cares for you and will help you grow as an individual and a professional.
good,Has potential to be a great environment to work in. Once the pay aligns with the job description. Alot of change taking place with very little direction and to many unknowns.
good,"I've been a satisfied SF customer for 28 years, and now I'm able to introduce those in need of different types of insurance and financial products to the exceptional service provided by SF agents."
good,"Lots of work available to do. Since I was a temp got paid less than what you honestly deserved, but it was still more than minimum wage. I liked my co-workers. It was sad because on holidays, we did not get PTO so we just ended up missing a day of work without pay,"
good,"On a typical day in the State Farm office requires interactions with a diverse clientele. I work with individual clients on opening home policies, auto policies, taking payments and phone calls. Helping clients with claims needs reading bills. Working with State Farm has help me improve my communication skills making me great with client conversations. The hardest part of the job is advising a customer that they have chosen to only get liability insurance instead of full coverage which doesn't cover their vehicle in an at fault accident. What I enjoy most is customer interactions as well as my co-workers which make it an easy going office. I have been able to delegate work to others and get things done as a team and try to enforce a team environment."
good,"I learned a lot about insurance and working with customers helping them with their insurance needs, but I felt like the office I worked at was poorly managed and the boss was never there.  The responsibility fell mostly on those under staffed."
good,"Many structural and leadership changes have resulted in a different company culture than it used to have.  Company no longer takes care of it's employees, or it's customers."
good,"Fast paced job , inefficient processes, poor antiquated systems, consistently demand more without compensating accordingly. For leadership you are an asset but they will not hesitate to overwork to cover organizational misteps"
good,"Besides the work schedule and management, everything else was great. The job was not too stressful. The training was great. They ensure each associate knew and understood the process before releasing them to the production floor."
good,I do not have an opinion that i would like to share.  I am only completing this section because I cannot finish the review without completing this particular section.
good,"Difficult to make a difference in this large organization.  People are friendly and open.  It will take the organization some time to fulfill on their commitment to evolve into a customer focused organization, however, through their recent reorganization efforts, the future is closer than it once was."
good,It was always busy and mostly a stressful environment due to all the things you had on your plate. The workplace culture was great. I enjoyed my coworkers very much. I learned how insurance worked.
good,7:45 hours per day with multiple tasks and strict metrics involving injury claims with possible litigation.  Negotiation and evaluation skills a plus.
good,"Training was provided and it was extensive and also thorough.  Handled various issues for Auto First and Third Party BI and PD claims, some to conclusion."
good,The work environment on a daily basis was moderate. Only because of the other friendly and welcoming employees there. Management was almost a nightmare to work for or to tolerate getting up in the mornings to go into work.
good,"You can do many types of jobs here.   This includes technical jobs, java, data movement to financial and claims jobs.  You have opportunity to move into management."
good,"Good company to work for. We  earned 30 hours of vacation after finishing training, the job was not very stressful and we were granted 30 minutes every day before our shift started to catch up and prepare for the day."
good,A typical day at work goes by slow and long. I haven't learned much but I have learned a couple new facts about life and health insurance. Management is calm and helpful but very goal oriented.
good,Lots of changes to the culture of what state farm stands for. Average day can take 30 or more phone calls and work hundreds of tasks a week. Ever changing environment and policy on how to do the job.
good,"Alot of change at State Farm, we'll see if it was a positive or negative in the coming months and years.  Hopefully, it will be a positive change to strengthen our brand and us in the market place."
good,They job itself as a producer is fantastic. There's a little bit of a fend for yourself mentality though. As someone who's completely new to the insurance world I have had to teach myself everything about sales and the inner workings of the company.
good,great people to work with but job was stressful for the age i was at the time learned how to work systems more and got the hang of customer service face to face as well as over the phone.
good,"I think that the Corp. world is either for you or its not. Meetings, personalities, presentations, transformation. This was a very interesting journey"
good,"I enjoyed my time at State Farm but the pay is very low. "
good,The company itself is second to none in the insurance industry but some of the agents are questionable and the one I was working with did not know how to manage very well. It was very difficult to stay steady in an environment where the expectations were constantly shifting and communication was very poor.
good,"Always kept me on my feet and I was never bored because there was something to do all the time"
good,I am in the medical field this was not meant for me. It was nice for the time being. Recently moved here from CA. Learned a lot from working here and met great people.
good,Workplace was fast paced. My office had a large amount of sales incentives. I was rewarded for my work in various ways through the office and company. I would recommend work for State Farm.
good,"But if you work for the agents you do not receive any benefits like the company employees do, big down fall. If you are working for a company you should get the same benefits"
good,I have worked for a local agent for 6 years and I have learned a great deal about insurance in my time there. Everyone knows the State Farm name and that will bring you a lot of business and interest alone. I have noticed in my time there however that the quality of service has regressed from the internal support staff and the company now places more restrictions on what their agents can write due to corporate being concerned with overgrowth in the market. State Farm is a VERY conservative company
good,The hours and benefits can vary from office to office.  The part I didn't like was the changes the company made over the last 10 years that were not customer driven.  The Health Insurance they put forth had no regard for Women's Health. They are more numbers driven than people driven.
good,"Very conservative company, large company, not a lot of upward mobility opportunity. Fairly stable employment (they don't layoff very often). Lots of support, excellent training."
good,I had to call a list of numbers everyday with the hopes of getting a new customer. The management team was okay but was mainly gone. The other employees never talked
good,"work hard, training provided, advancement opportunities, great job culture, good incentives, job security, lifelong friends, great management, follow the rules"
good,State Farm is a great place to work at with good pay and good benefits.  The job is pretty repetitive and comes with a lot to learn.  Job security is something that no one can be 100% comfortable with due to minimizing and relocations.  Overall a good job.
good,"I had a great experience working with my agent in oder to get licensed and become a State Farm team member. In order to be successful at your job, you should not want to come in and expect business to come to you. You must work hard to become successful and create relationships within the community that could help advance your career. You must be known in order to create business for yourself."
good,"The daily activities were to answer incoming calls, process payments at the clients request, send email to agents office to have follow up calls to be processed at the clients request.  Transfer callers to other necessary departments."
good,I enjoyed working with State Farm for multiple reasons. I love the diversity in the customer base. I also love the team workability. I like being a part of a team to accomplish goals. I enjoyed the type of work I needed to do as well. I just never saw myself there long term and did not want to waste their or my time any longer.
good,"Each State Farm office is own by the Agent and run according to their values and guidelines. It depends on the agent. "
good,Everyone got along well together. The day started handling items that appeared on the computer for immediate attention.  I learned the data bases in the State Farm system.  The workplace culture was diversified.  I enjoyed dealing with people and being able to solve problems.
good,Overall State Farm has been a great company to work for. They have wonderful benefits and very competitive pay. With recent changes work/life balance for most employees has been overlooked. Company is moving towards a call center environment in central locations.
good,"Very stressful, very fast paced, difficult to manage workload and difficult to balance work and life. Difficult to take time off, do not treat employees like adults."
good,"State farm is a company that has a rich history of treating both the employees and customers well, however as of late it seems to lack the passion it once had. It is currently shifting towards a more mainstream place of employment and removing many of the practices that made State Farm a great company to work for in the past."
good,"Typical 8-5 job, though additional networking is required to be successful. Pay and benefits based on agent working under. Hardest part of job is attracting new business and cross selling."
good,Depending on the office you are in this can be a good job. Try to get a good feel for the office before you accept the job because a lot of your experience and job satisfaction is going to be based on what office you work in every day.
good,"I worked with friendly people, the job was not too difficult, it was so close to home I could get there in 8 minutes.  They were interested in me as a person."
good,"Decent company, but very low salary. Slightly backwards thinking and upper management does not understand what front line employees deal with. Some areas are micromanaged terribly and benefits are slowly being taken away."
good,Easily exceeded goals on a 24hr shift and was 2nd to none in production. Paid for every issued policy with the opportunity to track binds and processing applications.
good,"My everyday consists of reviewing and processing new claims, following up on claims and preparing the for the future handling. Answering phone calls assisting customers with their everyday questions and concerns with their claims helping them get through a very overwhelming time after an auto accident."
good,"Had problems with commison, hard for customers to qualify and get good rates, overpriced.  Needed better structure within the company and management, training needs improvement."
good,"State Farm is a great company to work for. Coming for health insurance industry this was a little different. Training taught me what was needed and being on the floor I was able to adapt and learn more. Manager do not seem to care if life happens. It is either you're at work, working under pressure or you're home stressed out wondering if you will have your job wen you go back in."
good,"easy work, constant change(not bad)"
good,"you come into work, check your email, get a message advising you not to log into the computers early, trying to maintain my self ina environment that wants precision but refuses to accept the fact that people with different mind sets and skills sit at the desks is quite difficult, but when it melds it melds really well. Managers who do not enjoy the fun aspects of a personality are the hardest to get along with but it is a chaotic mess that can be fun to be around oh and they have good cold drinking water."
good,"I loved working at State Farm because I had the opportunities to serve people, being on the phone all day and make sure costumers leave the phone satisfied."
good,"28 years ago I started out as an agent owning my own business offering products/services provided by this company.  After 16 years of successful business ownership, I made the move to management and for another 9 years it was a great experience to help other agents have the same opportunity I had.  Four years ago the company made major decisions that totally changed the culture of the organization, the experience the customer received and the workplace environment the associates had.  This was a 90+ year old company that did wonderful things and treated us like 'part of the family.'  The over the next 4 years leadership direction changed which changed the culture.  New processes led by the concept of ""Excellence in Operations Management"" were implemented and the company began abandoning the small communities that were so good to them in favor of hubbed operations in one of four cities.  I read the reviews on indeed.com and I get so upset to see how many employees, that were so faithful to the company, have to leave because the decisions that were made and especially on the operations side the impression is that it is 'all about the numbers.'  Overall this company gave me and the team that worked for me a great life.  I am no longer there because of company reorg.  I appreciate what was done for me and sad that many people in the future will not have such a fantastic experience."
good,"The company provided great opportunities of learning about many different types of insurance laws besides automotive. "
good,"The company is focuses primarily on profit. After reaching goals, theres always something more to be done and no time given to take a break. It isn't about the customer. I heard many times, ""I don't want that customer"" and thereupon being the appearance or wallet of the customer."
good,I loved the marketing team was great working environment where i could express myself freely and correctly project my goals. My supervisor was freindly and correctly responded to feedback that was given by us.
good,I worked for an agent as a customer service representative.  It was a 9-5 workday with no weekend or holidays. An insurance license is required to work in an agents office
good,"Multi Tasked Environment you have to be ready to handle customers with a variety of insurance needs and questions. "
good,Good opportunities for advancement. Friendly work environment and easy way to learn more about the field of insurance. A typical day consist of calling random number and servicing clients. The hardest part of the job is constantly being let down by potential clients. Depending on how large the town you are working in it is easy to make good money as a producer.
good,I basically taught myself how to do my job. State Farm is a good company to work for but if you work for an independent agent they do not offer benefits.
good,Fast paced environment with high productivity expectations. Long hours working six days per week with limited time off. Contract work for limited time. Did not work for State Farm directly - this was a temporary assignment via a hiring agency.
good,"State Farm is a great company to work for because of all the different and exciting products they have, but you want to make sure your agent is willing to invest fully into your development.  The agent aspirant program is a great program to teach you how to run your office."
good,"Agent was easy to work for, but has decided to retire.   The office staff is very knowledgeable and helpful.  The new agency owner is a new hire, so not too sure how all that is going to go."
good,I have worked for the company for 26 years.  The company used to be a very strong employee and family oriented company.  That is slowly changing.  Overall the company offers excellent benefits but employee empowerment is gone.
good,I obtained many years of insurance experience working as a Team Member for the Agent. I was compensated for P&C & L&H NC Agents Licensees.
good,I decline to review this job at this time. I would really your understanding with my choice in not review this specific job position.
good,Experiencing so many changes. A great place to start in the insurance industry. Pay is not comparable for the work required. Other companys in the area pay more
good,"I worked in an Agents Office as a Salesman servicing accounts and tackling incoming leads.  I performed this task well for over two years."
good,"I work in an agent office so there was nowhere to go. The office was small and it was based on direct sales and business retention,"
good,At state farm it was a lot of work and not enough pay. you worked long hours and traveled so much that it was not enough money a the end of the day.
good,"Enjoyed my time with State Farm. Constantly networking with prospects and clients is what drive me. If you are willing to invest the time with State Farm, you will eventually be able to advance with the company whether that be in Claims, Underwriting or Sales, etc"
good,This was a great first job for a college student fresh from college that is looking to learn different parts of running an office.
good,Fun office. Not very good at training new employees on the State Farm computer program though.System was not similar to any other system I had used in the past
good,"This location, employs a lot of different vendors or temp agencies. No room for growth or permanent employment. You get to know your coworkers one minute and the next they are gone. Letting people go because its slow."
good,My overall experience has been great. This is a great step within your professional career.  I have learned the importance of adaptability and flexibility.
good,"I've been working for State Farm for year and its been fun but nothing I can see myself doing long term. No security, No benefits, I went from salary plus comission to just comission."
good,"My daily job activities involve maintenance and development."
good,"Due to the working dynamics of the workforce. State Farm has trended toward a virtual environment, which does not fit the need of its customers."
good,"Each agency independently owned, not much information on advancing"
good,"I would go into work at 2:30 pm every other day. The work schedule was very flexible and perfect for a high school student. I would sit in the front of the office to greet clients and help them with any basic billing or insurance questions that they might have had, I was trained to use the State Farm data base and was also helped with other basic computer skills as well. I was a receptionist for State Farm so I was also picking up incoming phone calls and directing them to the agents. I helped the agents with any paperwork and dealing with other insurance companies as well. I was also able to help maintain a clean and neat work environment. My co-workers were a great team of people who were there every step of the way and they were willing to answer any and all of my questions. The management at my particular location was slightly lacking but the office as a whole was strong. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the in office personal problems. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers fully and thoroughly due to the exceptional training I received from my peers."
good,Fast paced work place with opportunity to earn based upon commission models. Insurance Account Service with strong multi-tasking skills necessary. Very strong team building and training environment.
good,"Great place to work. Management was very involved. Department was making transitions, but the team made it comfortable."
good,"A typical day at work in included arriving at the office every day opening the office at 9am and closing the office at 5pm. I was a key holder of the office. I am a Personal Lines Licensed insurance representative. I would put application in place for the customers needs, advise them on what is in the policy they selected. I also received phone called on a daily basis for regarding billing questions and payments. "
good,"Typical day was 9-5. I learned m any things about different cultures working with the public. I learned how to adapt to a fast paced working environment. In insurance there are many different hats which must be wore to accommodate customers. The co worker was easy to get along with. I would be the one to go to systems training and come back and teach the office how to use the network systems. Hardest art of the the day was down time. Also, paperwork which had to still be filled out by hand because there was no application for it."
good,The office I worked for was in an overly saturated market making it very difficult to succeed. This ultimately resulted in our newly opened office closing in a very short time. The result of this was the end of my employment with State Farm.
good,"Work is very busy, I learned that there is multiple insurance departments. Management was very helpful. Noticed there was a huge turn around within the company. The hardest part was testing for new positions. The most enjoyable part was learning something new everday."
good,This was probably the most enjoyable of all the experiences that I had as hands on.  Being able to offer our products and services to all and everyone we encountered.  Getting to know the public and the potential to offer a product that is beneficial.
good,Enjoyed job and customers.  Benefits were none and pay not great and no room for advancement.
good,State Farm is a stable company. The ratio book of business to number of staff members is inadequate. Long time staff members are very knowledgeable.
good,"I worked as a temp with the Contact Center. It was a very professional environment, with lots of different kinds of people. All in all my experience there was pretty good, but I will say that when management changed, often they did not bring in people who were even close to qualified for the job..."
good,"My typical day consisted of Beginning of day tasks, while reviewing anything from a previous day that needed further attention, and taking and making calls to clients. Management was often quick to determine a mistake but did not give much in the way of direction. My coworkers were fun and upbeat. . I enjoyed being able to work with great people and making a insurance office welcoming and enjoyable."
good,"My day would start by opening the office and forwarding the phones.  I would then spend some time processing my emails and doing the quotes for the leads that may have come in over the internet.  Follow up with that customer and send email quote.  I had to answer the phones, take payments, process claims, adjust policies and make changes per customer request.  I think we needed a few more people in the office to handle some of the claims and other paper chasing of forms.  Napoleon was putting more pressure to sell more products all of the sudden on me.  I sold more policies each month and was about to pass my life and health exams, which would have opened up a bunch more products for me to sell... I really wasn't enjoying working there and it showed.  I enjoyed my coworkers like always, just could have used a little more help.  I loved helping the customers and meeting new people."
good,"great co workers, learned a lot about doing business, and learned a lot amount managing people and an office. I was able to learn sales tactics, cold calling technique, client service, systems management, asset management, cross selling, brand representation and digital organization. My co workers for the most part were great to work with and later after my promotion to office management were easy to manage. The easiest part of the job was getting the office was paperless. the office was both more organized and more environmentally friendly. The hardest part of the job was attempting to coordinate customer records with our massive corporate structure."
good,great position. A lot of sales and communicating with community is expected. 
good,"While temporarily employed during closure of facility, I gained valuable friendships and resources to advance in my future as a valued employee. "
good,Very stressful job that requires much diplomatic skill working with the uniformed public.
good,1. Claims investigation & resolution
good,Management micromanages employees
good,Was Happy until they downsized. Loved my co-workers. Loved the hours.
good,It was a challenge keeping up with quotes and telemarketing.
good,"overall, it was a good experience.  I learned what it took to make a claim and follow through. There is nothing bad I would like to say.  Learned a lot"
good,Good solid place to work. Very good job on training to prepare your for the job. Felt once on the floor I had a great understanding of what was expected of me
good,"Very structured and textbook. Negative life/work balance. If employee has no PTO or it can’t be covered by short/long term disability, you won’t last long here!"
good,Working for State Farm overall was a good experience. It is a highly sales driven company which requires you to be highly motivated. I felt there wasn’t much room for growth within the sales position.
good,"I was hired through a temporary agency to assist State Farm in their claims department.  The Estimatics division in Vallejo was closing down and moving jobs across multiple states, so there was a limited amount of time for the employees at this location to get work completed.  For me, the most enjoyable part of the job was that I didn't have to answer the calls that came in.  I worked directly from email."
good,"Not a great work environment for me, not paid fairly, no benefits. Get treated unfairly. Team members don’t communicate with me. "
good,"Nice family atmosphere. Take phone calls, greet customers and take payments. Qualify customers for home and/or auto insurance. Balance petty cash and make bank deposits."
good,Worked as an intern. It was a very productive experience. I learned about many things such as working better as a team player. The workplace was filled with driven individuals.
good,"Pros: great for young generation with small kids that need time to spend with their family and has lots of enthusiasm.  "
good,I worked for an agent for 5 years. Your experience is going to vary based on the agent you work with. Each office is independently own by the agent so the pay varies from office to office and most agents do not offer benefits. It can be a great career if you work for a good agent but if not it can be overwhelming just like any other job. You can work strictly sales or work doing customer service.
good,This company was great to work for. I learned a lot about the workings of an insurance company while being presented opportunities of growth within. At the time I was focused on building a family and now that I’ve done just that I am ready for my next venture into the workforce.
good,I enjoyed working with some of the best claims specialists in the insurance industry.   Mid level management was always helpful and made time for any concerns during the claims process.
good,office duties- a lot of sitting at a desk and talking on a phone. Answering emails and occasionally face to face meetings. You become a trusted adviser for clientele and can actually make a difference. Good work/life balance is encouraged. Family/team atmosphere.
good,"From your car insurance to your laptop. State Farm truly is dedicated to meeting consumer needs, and making sure they are prepared for all life can throw at you. I loved working here, meeting people, and growing my "
good,"Family environment.  Answered phone calls, made outbound calls, set appointments, commission based income, banking was my favorite part.  Not enough money."
good,If you enjoy working with customers and up selling.  High pressure to sell if you work for an agent but can also be very rewarding helping people with their needs.
good,Everyone is nice and very helpful. Benefits seems good so far. Schedule is a bit weird with the shift bidding so be open to changes or if you don't like your schedule
good,"Cool place to work You are allowed to wear whatever you like.  Mant different eclectic people.  Different areas to work in, such as life, auto, homes, etc"
good,"Great people and great environment.  "
good,Overall great company. Left to advance my career. Working for individual agent. Salary plus commission. Sometimes making cold calls and AOT of follow-up.
good,"Commission job, some hourly pay (minimal)."
good,I had the absolute GREATEST supervisor on earth. (Washington) Intelligent Funny Happy Relaxed Peaceful.... He made the job worth coming in to work. And the customers were great.
good,State Farm company handles a lot of claims and you have to be willing to work hard and talk to a lot of people. Its a great job and company to work for.
good,Extremely large amounts of work to keep you busy.  Metric based work. Friendly workplace. Great health benefits.  Must be willing to relocate to advance your career.
good,Injury segment is a hot mess adjusters are miserable and ppl are leaving every week. Horrible work life balance in injury they should really restructure injury segment retention of employees would be much better. Other than that it's not a Bad place to work. Guess it depends on your dept and Manager but it's hard to get out  of claims once you're in. We miss the old State Farm!
good,"You must be willing to self-learn and continuously add to your knowledge set. You will succeed if you can manage yourself and prioritize your day's work without abusing the free time you may find. Some offices have unrealistic sales goals that they push while other offices ask that you set and meet your own. On average, the base salary is nothing to look twice at while the commission can make a world of difference. "
good,Overall a good company. A little slow on making changes with regards to being strong in the market place with rates. Claims can be handled fairly. Worth looking into.
good,"It's a good place to work. Sometimes it's stressful. Other insurance companies pay way more than them. However, It's a relaxing work environment & they have great benefits and a pension."
good,State Farm is a great to gain knowledge of customer service experience and helps you learn how to multi-task under high volume calls while completing everyday tasks.
good,"I worked at state farm for a few months while i finished my last semester of my business associates, it was a temp job for my final class project....."
good,Very busy environment. A lot to learn. Training should be a priority and more likely away from the office. Every State Farm office should have a receptionist to just answer calls.
good,"State Farm is an insurance company with coverage in many of states in the U.S providing Auto, life and property and casualty insurance. Being one of the best company with employee experience rated as . We were provided exposure to work on many tools to experience and to reduce the stress with your job duties. "
good,"Good place to start out in learning insurance. Work is typically quick paced with scripts to follow, for almost every situation. Most of the time you work within your hours, however typically there is a weekly push where you work over and have pizza."
good,"I enjoyed learning something new every day, enjoyed working with clients in office and on phone, lots of computer work, very fast paced, much to accomplish each day, days went by very quickly"
good,"Is a nice place to work, just like every office job. Some days are slow some are busy. You do have the time to talk with others, this office is small too everyone can talk with each other."
good,"Working Marketing events were fun while working at State Farm. The job is a little stressful when you are dealing with unhappy customers who want to make sure their policies are up to date. Besides that, it was fun"
good,An enjoyable company to work for. The culture is great. Hours were flexible with work/life. A pleasure to be part of the team. I learned a lot to further pursue my career.
good,"I love this company; I wish I didn't have to leave. Due to outside family needs I was forced to leave my position. Once I am able to return, I plan to."
good,Customer oriented company and management.  The office is located in a small town and management always made customers feel as though they we speaking to a friend when they had questions or concerns.
good,"Great environment , fulling job, enjoyed helping clients with their needs. If you want a solid insurance base foundation. This is a great company to do it for."
good,State Farm is a great company to work for. I love being able to help other people on a daily basis. There could be more room to learn and grow on the job.
good,Great place to work. I worked in customer service in the underwriting dept for auto. Provided customer service to the agents. Management was responsive.
good,"Working at this office was quick paced and a bit difficult, but overall it was a good job. Hours were great and flexible, and the lunch break was more than reasonable."
good,The business has changed. It used to be about family now it is about the money. I was laid off after 16 years and asked to moved to Nebraska or Arizona.
good,Great company however when you retire from your own agency you do not own the rights to sell your book of business. Enjoyed the agent I worked for as well
good,"My position was in an Agent's office. I was responsible for answering calls, solving customer issues, taking claims and payments and other general customer service dur=ties."
good,Happy for the experience and learned a lot while there. I was successfully coached and put in the position to learn in grow as an employee and manager.
good,"If you work for an agent whom is active and looking to grow expect a busy environment. Working at a State Farm office has allowed me to grow as individual in aspects such as customer service skills, time management, proper business emails, and learning to multi task. The culture is based on the expectations of the agent. In my case sales is a focal point. the hardest part of the job is dealing with premium increased and attempting to retain customers during those times. Sometimes price can exceed the value one provides. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers with insurance needs."
good,"i enjoyed working with State farm, the days went by fast, no down time. people in the office were great. I learned a lot. They had great customer service and great rates."
good,"At 6am you arrived at your desk, checked voicemails and phone calls from the previous day. Then you would call claimants and attorneys to try to negotiate and resolve claims within the policy holders limits."
good,"I worked in the sales department. Good money while in school, but not a lifelong career. Good benefits and they offer tuition reimbursement and a matched 401K, which is great."
good,"Competitive unless you are in agent program, potential is capped as a team member. Good for people becoming agents. Work/life balance is good if you work for the right agent."
good,My management and workplace culture was the best. The hardest part of the job is needing to make sales but people not needing the insurance you need to sell. The best part of the job was the environment and the people I worked with.
good,"Cut my teeth in the insurance business with State Farm.  At that time they really took care of their employees and we, in turn, took care of the customers."
good,"I was fortunate to work for a great agent, unfortunately that is not the experience that everyone has or had. The pay is not enough to live on, but the work can be intensive"
good,I think that you can get very lucky depending on who the agent for your office is.  I think everyone can find a spot at the right office.  I'f your looking to work here do your research on the agent.  How hands on/ off are they?Because some aren't in the office ever
good,Great place to work. Allowed me to be self driven. Worked remotely but commuted monthly to meet with team members and discuss our progress. Very fun atmosphere
good,"I enjoyed working for State Farm, but when I become ill I needed two surgeries that had complications and missed too many days which I was terminated for after 8 years of service."
good,"Quick pace, call center environment. You were always busy because you had a phone connected to you while working at all times. The workplace was easy, but stressful when busy."
good,"This was and has been at times recently, a great company to work for.  However, there has been a transition for the last few years and the stress level has gone way up.  The workload is at its tipping point for most people and several changes made across the enterprise are not in line with what always made SF a great place to work in the past.  Its a strong company financially and they traditionally provide good job security; however, it seems a lot of decisions being made are not with employee's best interest at heart or are made to improve the bottom line without much input from the employees.  What did not appear to be broken, is now trying to be fixed.  SF always took care of their employees well (i.e. pension, benefits, salary).  But money isn't everything and as a result more and more people are looking to move on.  Its harder to find great things to say about working here with each passing week."
good,"Even tough I've worked entire life in one of small business, it really depends on their boss. "
good,An overall great place to work provided you align yourself with great mentors and/or managerial staff.  A great place to build your professional career.
good,"As an account representative, I manage accounts for the customers who pay via the payment plan, on a monthly basis."
good,My favorite part about my current job at State Farm Insurance is that I get to build lasting relationships with clients and team members. Each day is a new learning opportunity.
good,"Honestly, as a person in their 20s, I don't recommend working for State Farm at all. Almost all of the ""agents"" and sales leaders are women facing mid life crisis issues and menopause. Cranky old ladies that treat each other like a high school drama film. Customers are of the worst type, very entitled and seem to want everything in life free. Pay is alright, commission is alright, much better alternatives out there."
good,I worked at this job for 18 years of my life and learned a lot about myself and how to handle stressful situations.  It was satisfying knowing you were helping others in their time of need or in just making major purchases that were exciting in their lives.
good,"Customer service calls, billing, account changes, dealing with customers. No place to grow unless you are interested in working in insurance the rest of your life and want to sell or want to open your own agency."
good,"They were probably the most organized place I'd ever experienced. But they had very few opportunities to be creative.  It was straight hard coding.  The specs were so tightly written, it was nearly impossible to make a mistake.  Their programming standards were such that even the working storage variables used in a piece of code had to be alphabetized and adhere to numerous specs."
good,Was a fun place to work. The agents can make your job a whole lot better for the employees. It is a company that I think is well ran and will do well.
good,I do not wish to participate in this survey. I do not feel this arena is appropriate to inquire to ones experience in an environment. It is my professional opinion that being forced to provide an ambiguous opinion should not be part of this process.
good,"My first developer job. Expected to learn new technologies and advance my developer skills. Ended up learning endless internal routines. Relaxed environment due to involvement a lot of people in simple processes. Sometimes something that can be done in day or half takes few days or even weeks. People are friendly, but don't want to take slight risk or tiny extra responsibility. Reluctant to change. Something nice can be introduced not because team decided to do so, but rather because someone above said enforced it. Mushroom management to some extent, features and requirements arrive from management, no one on bottom level can explain why something is done in such way and how it is beneficial for company. Many dev teams are working for enterprise, so your experience may vary."
good,State Farm agency  is a stable.  You can learn a lot from working at State Farm and they have been around a long time and working for State Farm agency can be rewarding
good,Every State Farm office is managed by different owners and every experience working for the company will be different. It is not possible for me to review the entire company.
good,This is a great place to start your insurance career or if you are closing in on retirement.  No opportunities for advancement and the pay is average at best.
good,"Love the company and comradery. Great positions for students, night owls and earlier birds. Beautiful campus with a great location. College courses and tuition reimbursement offered."
good,"I have been with State Farm as a part-time customer service person for almost 3 years.   My primary job is to answer the phone, take messages,update payment information and let Policy Holders know if a payment did not go through and try to resolve the issue.  Set up monthly auto pays and assist with other office needs.  It is a very flexible job and only requires less than 10-15 hours a week to handle the updates."
good,"Consolidated Claims is not indicative of the entire State Farm claims experience. It is generally agent support and recording of claims paid through agents' offices. Extremely relaxed with a fair bit of freedom. The associates are some of the best people you will meet, while most of management (save one) is rather lacking in knowledge, expertise, and empathy. They will definitely not usually go the extra mile to help the associate. The pay is quite lacking compared to some other area insurance companies; benefits are rather expensive and lackluster, even though State Farm often brags how great their benefits package is - this may have been true int he past, but does not hold true any longer. All-in-all, it was a nice experience, tinged with some of the usual negative aspects."
good,"It's a good company to work for. The company provides an all inclusive workplace. The company provides excellent benefits, time off, 401k, etc..."
good,It was an okay place to work. Boss was never there so if you have any issue you have to figure it out yourself and if you are new and everyone is busy you are in trouble.
good,The operations side of the house is a great place to work. The claims side was a high pressured environment. The supervisors really tried to make it better by providing opportunities to have some fun through team competitions during special events or holidays. Every so often they would cater meals.
good,great working environment with friendly people who care about insuring their clients. State Farm really markets the loyalty to their customers and you feel that when assisting and speaking to them on the phone.
good,A typical workday included working with customers to help them with their financial needs whether it be choosing the appropriate deposit products or getting them a lower rate on their auto loan with a refinance.
good,"State Farm was an excellent company to work for at first, but over the last year and a half, there has been so much change that it makes it hard to feel valuable. There's been many lay-offs and money saving decisions being made. It makes for a stressful environment for customers and staff. The people there do make it worth it. Management tries to be a good resource during times of difficulty. PTO is great, and the 401K is wonderful."
good,"State Farm paid for my 4 year Accounting Degree."
good,I dont have much of an opinion of review for the company. Its a job that pay the bills and provides benefits. Give than a chance only you are able to judge that.
good,My time spent at StateFarm was intriguing unfortunately the agent had to close down the office.I would like to work in the insurance industry again as it was a new and exciting experience.
good,"I've worked for three different State Farm offices, each of them being very different.  I took each job seriously and dedicated my training to all job aspects.  I can only say that State Farm in general, is a great company to work for.  There is a lot of growth opportunities, if management would allow it."
good,This is a nice cube environment.  69 hours per week while working as a catastrophe adjuster for automobiles.  Working long hours during weather catastrophes is expected.
good,Large company.  Engaging work place if you find the right mentors.  Your experience will be directly related to the people you work with.  Hard to summarize the entire corporate culture because it changes from place to place and with different leaders.
good,"Unfortunately this position was eliminated as the proposed agent did not receive his ""permanent"" contract from State Farm.  Interim agent did not generate the volume of sales needed for the office to be competitive."
good,Days were long with calls of angry customers. Hard part of insurance is the delay in communication to get people started properly. Lots of data entry and customer service. Management was swayed by friendships. I learned lots of office management and team culture.
good,Answer phone throughout the day satisfying the needs of customers having technical problems. Document every call with specific information related to the caller and the problem as well as the solution.
good,The job isn't hard but there is no real consistency in management and no answer is set in stone. It can make for a frustrating time when all managers give different responses the the same question
good,"State Farm gave me my first job into the insurance industry. A typical day consisted of new assignments, making referrals, answering phone calls, weekly meetings, and meeting with policyholders, agents, claimants, and legal. The culture was one of nepotism and whose umbrella of protection you was under. The most enjoyable part of the job is the daily challenges, nothing the same from day to day."
good,"Working at State Farm on a typical day was exciting. My office manager was very professional and was always willing to help so you can exceed at your job. I learned many different things on a daily basic. The work place culture was diverse, There wasn't really anything hard about the job because my office manager was very helpful and made sure we were very well trained in our position. The most enjoyable part of my job was speaking with the customers on a daily basic."
good,"Typical work day is taking in-bound sales/service calls. The environment and job duties are constantly changing.  Also, occasionally you have difficult customers.  The culture has changed quite a bit over the past 2-3 years from a nice, productive, and welcoming feel to a more stressful and numbers driven environment.  The hardest part of the job is the constant learning curve, but it is doable."
good,"-Took 50 to 80 phone calls from customers, agents, and agent staff members, regarding status of new insurance policy, death claims, and insurance documents receive via email and the US mail. "
good,"The hardest part of the job is taking phone calls from people who are often dealing with strong emotions or stress from being in a car accident or dealing with unexpected expenses. A majority of the calls are not escalated, but it can be tough if you can't say no or keep perspective on the scope of your role. Overall, I really appreciated my manager,and all of my teammates."
good,Each franchise is an independent owner for State Farm. The better the manager is the better profit that can be obtained. This company requires a lot of sales and cros-selling.
good,Start your work at 9 A.M. by checking your email and new sales lead that came overnight. Reach out to those loeads and follow up on previous leads you had in the past. Your goal is to be on the phone talking to people as much as possible so your sales reflect this activity
good,"A typical day consists of calls from policy holders and task work."
good,Bad Culture.  My immediate Manager was great.  Relax dress code - dress how you feel.  Benefits are great with pension vested in 5 years.  Currently going through a restructure.
good,We are currently experiencing a layoff in my department. Very difficult to get time off. Benefits are OK. The pay could be better. There is no life-work balance ans they say.
good,I would work here again in a different role. My supervisor let me go because I was recently diagnosed with diabetes and was falling asleep in training after lunch because my blood sugar was uncontrolled.
good,"This company has always been a great place to conduct business as  customer and a great to work as an employee. It has transitioned into a different company in the past years and they don't seem to value employees/family as they have in the past. This is simply due to more competition and cost cutting, I would imagine. "
good,"Learned alot, good job, wish I had better pay and benefits."
good,They made it fun to be at work. They always rewarded you for long work days. I love their 10 hours schedule because it allowed you to be off for 3 days.
good,State Farm provided excellent training opportunities from all staff members.  They strive for a comfortable work environment.  There is usually opportunity for advancement depending on management.
good,Sold different types of insurance. Assisted with claims and payment questions. Answered phones and took payments. I truly loved working with the clients. Manager was inexperienced but a great person.
good,This company has been a great company to work for.  They are going through a transformation and although I have been with the company 39 years they are deciding to move a lot of jobs to Bloomington and our Hub locations.
good,State Farm was a great place to work.  They are closing a lot of claims offices. A good company for college graduates. A great place to gain work experience.
good,The agent was great to work for and was very flexible with the work schedule if needed.  Every agent is different and I found it difficult to move up within  state farm outside of the agents office.
good,Cozy yet compact work space with friendly management. I learned the proper way to display an advertisement effectively and the inner works of an insurance agency.
good,State Farm was once an amazing place to work but is going down fast.  It is so worried about competing with other companies that it is losing customers and employees.  
good,Overall the company treated the employees fairly and the benefits were good based on my experience.  The people that I worked with day in and out are what made my job enjoyable.
good,"great place to work everyone is very friendly "
good,"Statw Farm was a very stable employer and had an excellent training program, awesome benefits, and competitive salary. As with any job, this one had its high stressful periods (especially during bad weather) but of that is something that doesn't bother you, then I would say go for it!"
good,I spent all day in an office chair. I would handle the entire customer experience. A lot of cold calls. High volume of calls.  A lot of customer complaints/issues.
good,Good company to work for. It just depends on the agent you work for that will determine if you like it or not. Besides that it the company has a good base though.
good,"State Farm is a fair work environment, but boring.  I would not recommend it to people who have trouble sitting still.  The hours, management, and work load is reasonable."
good,"Great benefits, even though compensation and 401k match is low. Some people are able to advance as long as you have a degree and can meet the right people. A turn off for me was the strict timecard policies, inconsistencies in managing employees, and lack of a work-life balance."
good,The software here is very tricky and outdated. Depending on your agent it can be relaxed or stressful. Pay is not the greatest but does vary between owners.
good,Great Place to work. Outstanding opportunity. Good leadership and employees. Commitment to continuous improvement. Great pay and benefits. Recommend this a good place to work.
good,"Normal office/cube farm environment.  Fast paced job, the faster the better.  Nice office building with a lot of nice people.  Great training program."
good,I have learned alot and have alot to bring to the table with the knowledge I received and licenses I have obtained.they have great benefits and pension plan. You work alot of hours. It's hard to move up unless you get more degrees under your belt and doesn't have to be about insurance to move up as long as it's a degree. They do pay for licenses and certain schooling.
good,"Company is experiencing growing pains keeping up with a fast-paced, increasingly digital market and competition. Very routine work. Simple sales conversations."
good,"At State Farm there is a deep seated culture of family. Regardless of any work challenge, I was able to make it through the hardship because of the others working next to me. The work is tough, the hours are long but the people make it easier to come back the next day."
good,"decent place to work to get some experience. However no work life balance, they have a points system for attendance, which is ridiculous. some of the managers were cold and un-welcoming."
good,"reason that I am seeking employment elsewhere is for benefits.. health, dental, vision, 401K, life... State Farm does not offer any of these none of this is offered"
good,"My coworkers were very helpful and understanding, answered any of my questions and helped me when I was unsure of certain tasks. the workplace culture was not as diverse, overall it was a pleasant environment."
good,The issues with working in the small business world is large fluctuations in the local economy effect the business significantly. This was a great place to learn about insurance and the industry.
good,"Employment Group places individuals in temporary roles until a full time position becomes available.  I've never worked with another temp. agency, but found this company to be very helpful."
good,Good job with great benefits. standard work day with a 45 minute lunch. Difficult to move positions/get promotions. Good company culture very laid back atmosphere.
good,"Busy, phone calls throughout the day ranging from simple to complicated. There is always the opportunity to learn something new as situations vary.  Most of the duties are enjoyable with an occasional unpleasant or unhappy individual."
good,"Working at state farm in eastpointe was a good job in many ways, Also it had its flaws. Customers would get mad at you for things happening in their policy."
good,"Great solid base to learn a multitude of skills like customer service, account management, sales and leadership. Lots of team building. Very little room for growth and large raises in pay,"
good,"A typical day at work was repetitive work, I learned about auto insurance and customer service to name a few items. Management was fair. The workplace was very diverse. The hardest part about the job was that there was no work/life balance. I most enjoyed working with my peers for 20 years."
good,"Very fun environment, learn a lot on the job, fun people to work with. Trying to get licensed to sell insurance. a typical work day is to call leads and answer the phone."
good,"The company and the industry are very fast paced and they require an employee to be a fast learner and somewhat self sufficient; however, the trainers are there to help you when needed."
good,"Great place to work with great people. Good pay good advancement. Was a good start to understanding what a good work should be."
good,Overtime always offered.  Case loads high.  Was new system we moved to.  It took sometime for them to streamline the process.  Having to learn 9 states instead of just Texas.  Most people left in Houston and other offices due to the closing and relocation to Dallas was required.
good,"Rates are always changing, and it is hard to work with underwriting.  Rules and standards changing all the time, and it makes it much harder to have a smooth start with new customers."
good,"Indiana - Company relocating jobs to other states, currently scheduled to close office in 2020.  Office processing Underwriting function across all states as needed."
good,"Not a bad place to work. Decent benefits but lower than average pay. As a huge company there will always be lots of competition, and designations/advanced degrees are not valued as much because more people have them here, and company pays for you to obtain them."
good,its the number one auto and home insurance for many many years - because the local agents are known in their communities and develop bonds of trust and respect
good,company upper-level personnel have create an ongoing stressful environment for claims personnel to provide continuous high level of customer service to claimants on a daily basis..

good,"State Farm is one of the biggest Insurnce companies available, salaries could be more competitive. Other than than that the company is cool friendly environment"

good,"It was busy, I have learned a lot. I did not really get along with my manager. In the end got laid off . Its tough business . you gotta be strong and sell a lot all the time. in the end think about it , everyone needs insurance ."
good,"I enjoyed my time in customer service taking calls from insurers.  Desks were ergonomically set up, computer screens were perfect for the programs that were used and managers were on the floor readily available for questions."
good,"State Farm i a good place to work , Everything is very systematic over there , a process is followed to conduct all the minor or major task , it helps in following up better. People are friendly and good in behaviour.There are fun activities at time to time."

good,"Helping polices holder with their insurance needs every day. Sending reminder for late payments, ordering office supplies. Helping customers to be properly insured correct and to understand the insurance."
good,I enjoyed the fast-pace of the environment. I learned great time-management skills as all tasks were broken down to the minute. The management team was supportive and a manager was usually available should the need arise to speak with one.
good,"A very controlled environment.  Very little work/life balance.  A young person who does not care about what hours are worked, may be ok with this job."
good,"Enjoy working the agent and my coworkers"
good,"stable job, no advancement unless owner dies and then only if you can buy the agency for a ton of money can you ever move up. It is stable and medium stress."
good,"State Farm is a reputable company with good benefits, great co-workers, and very diverse. However, it is hard to change departments, no work-life balance in proximity positions, low pay, and management is more concerned with numbers than than the employees."
good,Small nice offices with small group of people.  Work day starts at about 8:30 to 8:45.  Need to be certified in insurance.  Depending on the agent the day could be flexible day.  Culture of the office is also determined by the agent.
good,The lack of training made the job very challenging at first but once you know the systems it isn't bad. The fact that there are no benefits offered is a big con.
good,"A customer orientated environment that is constantly changing."
good,Very flexible hours. Great entry position into becoming an adjuster. Pay is very good for what the job entails. Very laid back environment. Job is very easy.
good,Work 12 hour days 7 days a week as an independent adjuster. Never interacted with State farm TMs. Very laid back company. Hardest part is moving around from place to place.

good,"I enjoy working at State Farm.  My boss is great to work for.  However, I need a position where I am not constantly sitting at a desk.  I enjoy the small office & dealing with the clientele."
good,I enjoy meeting new customers on a daily basis.  I have learned so much in the auto industry and the importance of having insurance. The hardest part of the job so far is learning the state regulations which is important in order to obtain my state license
good,Great company but too many big changes at one time. This company used to try and keep long term employees and now they would rather get them out the door and hire inexperienced people off the street.
good,"My department was like a family. We cared for each other and always had each others back. The company provided us with good benefits which I enjoy in my retirement years. Management was forth coming and the work place culture was one of love, caring, helpfulness. I enjoyed some of our new technology to make my job easier but most of all I respected and like that State Farm was customer focused even in my role as compliance manager."
good,"Small office, which allowed for employees to be effective and self motivated.  Agent wanted all employees to get insurance licenses so we were able to write policies and be more productive."
good,"I worked here for 15 years in administrative services. Great company that values family values. Great employees and management. Lots of areas to work in like Auto Company, fire, life, ad. Services, and fire and auto claims. If customer service is you're cup of tea, then you'll love the atmosphere and job duties required from State Farm."

good,My typical day at work is opening incoming mail from the Pre-sort Department and prepping mail to be scanned and indexed for the Claims Examiners. i do enjoy this job because it's a production job and I'm able to challenge myself on a daily basis.

good,"On an average day in the ILR Role, you assist customers with filing new auto or home claims. A big part of the job is maintaining a positive tone and providing outstanding customer service. Management is always available to answer questions that employees have and are dedicated to their team members. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the relationships built with other employees."
good,"Great company"
good,It was a great place to work including the other staff members. Professionally run with daily morning meetings to focus the days goals. Intense attention to customer services and proper sales.

good,"Answered calls all over the U.S. Helped customers set up claims Auto/Fire after being involved in an Auto Accident, Natural disasters,Fire, Vandalism, and Theft. Was Generally first contact and had to be sympathetic to what the customer just went through. Sometimes there were fatalities. I learned that every call is different and should be handled geared to each customers needs. Management was encouraging and supportive. My co-workers were a a great support. The hardest part of the job was when there was a fatality and speaking with the family members hearing the pain in their voices. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of being able to help the customer get the claim part out of the way and making it a seamless and easy process during a very stressful situation."
good,"I called clients and sales leads regarding home, renters, auto and Life inquiries. I also sold banking products. I schedule client review to ensure they were property insurance."
good,"A typical day at work was answering the phone all day long. In between this we helped clients with their insurance questions and got them the answers they needed. This management team was disorganized. I feel the ripple affect drifted all the way to the administrative employees. This was a family owned business. The hardest part of the job was being overlooked due to a family member wanting to be advanced. I got to meet a lot of different types. Most of all of them were nice. However, we did get a few cranky people whom we treated the same as the nice one's."
good,"Overall State Farm was a great place to work, just didn't end up being the line of work I wanted to be in."
good,I liked the management. As long as I did my job I didn't have a problem. I was not in management. I was a contractor through Randstad.

good,I have only worked here for about a year and four months. So far I have learned a lot working in the insurance business along with obtaining a license in property and casualty which has only benefited me in adding to my qualifications. Its a face paced company and have to be aggressive to work for them if you want to make some serious money. Its a good reputable company.

good,"Good work/life balance. Sales focused with commission"
good,"We were promised full time hours after a certain period of time and it never happened. That was the only downfall."

good,Good employees and leadership. Very professional and strict. Requires employees to be very committed. The company truly believes in their brand ( drinking the Kool Aid).
good,"Typical 8 hr cubicle office work.  Learned all about how the insurance industry works- for the betterment of the company and the insured.  Hardest past was days on end of cold calling.  The most enjoyable parts were being able to, sometimes literally, hold an insureds hand thru the process of a claim and get them the help they needed."
good,"Management was very intense. Constant worrying about how well you handled a call. Management also would be over your shoulder. Great people work there, benefits were great micromanagement not so great."

good,They will get you license in P and C when the time comes for it. It's great to be able to speak to so many new people everyday.
good,"Typically you do paperwork, write policies, and quote insurance policies. You have to be able to multitask. The work was not hard but you need to be detail oriented."
good,did a lot of customer services. answer the phone and call customer to remind them about the billing. Help customer for their need.
good,State Farm is a great company to work for with a strong history of customer service. Working inside the agents office has afforded me the time to sharpen my knowledge in the insurance industry. My day usually consist of Marketing out in the community and handling customer calls for policy help or adding on to the policy. My goal is to move back into a leadership role so I can help guide others that’s starting in the insurance industry.
good,"I really did love my job. I honestly planned on retiring from SF however, because other people's OPINIONS were able to change the way my direct supervisor viewed me I was made out to be something that I wasn't"

good,I've been able to learn many new things about business and computer here. My agent has been very helpful in my upbringing.
good,"on a typical day at work, we debrief and talk about how we should go about the day, how many people we are checking in and if there are any special customers that needs assistants. All my coworkers were very helpful and fun to work with. The hardest part is dealing with customers who does not listen."
good,I was able to utilize organizational and time management skills. Interacted with the public through the management of personal accounts. I was also responsible for daily deposits and maintaining financial records
good,The workplace is nice but the only thing is the point system that they have. My coworkers were good to work with. There was a lot to learn and the guidelines for taking calls change constantly

There is a great work and personal relationship between all 5 employees that work in the office.

good,State Farm was a very good company to work for along with the agent.
good,Great place to work with great environment. Enjoyed all the time spend at J P Morgan Chase.
good,"Once I get to work I look at my to do list and follow through with what is on the list.  This may include calling customers to remind them of their payment due date, following up with appointments that was set or just calling a prospect back to see if they was interested in setting up an appointment to come in and get a policy started.  I would answer the phones and assist current customers with making policy changes such as adding a new car, taking off a car, or possibly adding a new product. With each customer I handle their issue and try to add one.  This means that if a customer only had auto insurance and they called about their bill I will answer their billing question and then say I see you do not have renters or homeowners insurance and then go into my pivoting.

good,A typical work day for me starts at 9am and I immediately start to juggle mulitple tasks. Being able to interact and assist customers is the most enjoyable part of my day. The hardest part is not having enough time to get everything done. My boss is great and so are my co-workers. We're a small office of 5 and we do our best to keep everything cohesive.
good,Very nice place to work for a married woman. Not much pay and no benefits. Nice job if you just want some extra income.
good,"Worked here almost 15 yrs. Obtained an entry level position and worked my way up to claim processing (having draft authority) to pay certain claims without having to pay an adjuster a higher salary to. This was a nice promotion, but had limitations."
good,"A typical day at work for me was a little boring. I would ask for my projects to complete and they never had anything for me to do. I didnt feel useful and thats important to me. I would answer the phone, take payments and enter any extra work they needed into the computer."
good,Reviewing polices and seeing clients. Had a great boss and two wonderful women that I worked with. Selling life was really difficult in the econmy. Loved all the people.
good,"A typical day at work involves customer service, sales, problem-solving, money management, and high levels of insurance technical skills."
good,"State Farm has been a great company to work for thus far. I have awesome co-workers that make our work environment fun to be in. A typical day at work consists of service work, sales calls, quoting and hopefully writing new business. The hardest part about the job is keeping up with the service and also making the business profitable by selling. The goal is to obviously grow the business and help people with their insurance and financial needs (which is the fun part), but keeping up with the ""whirlwind"" of service and the customer phone calls can take up more time than I would like which makes the job tough at times."
good,"Iternal and External customer focus. System enhancements that focus on production. Opportunities to instruct classes for peers, upper management and agents. Most enjoyable part of the job were the opportunities to assist insureds and agents with their inquiries about policy or new underwriting processes."
good,"Open office check all e-mails, answer and correct any requirements needed. Set up appointments on existing clents for reviews on policies.Assist and assign incoming prospects and policy holders to staff.As a manager you must be able to communicate with staff and be able to lead your team to success by selling to the clints needs and servicing properly.When you love what your doing there is no hard part of any job it's what you make of it! The most enjoyable part of my job is satisfying the customer and building a good rapport with them."
good,"I enjoyed my working conditions, the agents I worked with, my hours were great, I had a good salary."
good,Its a great place to work for. I have worked for more than 7 years and its the place.
good,"Working with customers on insuance needs. Quoting and issuing policies, while servicing existing clients."
good,You are allowed to come in and do your own work. You gain experience while making a living. Alot of people of turned it in to something bigger than an entry level position.
good,State Farm is a great place to work and has great people to work with.
good,Very good insurance company to work for. Recommend job for only full time employers.
good,"This office was new, just opened, I did telemarketing sales to bring in new business. I enjoyed the job."
good,I love the company but I'm not thrilled by the rate of advancement. Most people who make it to leadership roles with reasonable income and flexibility have been with the company for at least 20 years. The stay for decades and pay your dues mentality isn't great for keeping new talent.
good,"Its not for everyone but provides a great benefits package"
good,High turnover. Fast pace. Room for advancement. Training   is excellent and is set in a classroom setting for 2 weeks before going g out on the floor.
good,"Good company to work for, comfortable environment, reasonable pay, flexible scheduling, ability to make more money, but my specific company did not offer any benefits."
good,Every day was full of surprises because it was always a different task to accomplish. Every customer has their own set of issues. Every person is different in how you approach their issues. It was very interesting meeting different people & helping them resolve their issues. I had to talk a woman through a very difficult time.
good,Nice place to work.  Good benefits and pay.  The harder you work the higher you can get and more money you can make.  6 and 7 figure potential if you work hard enough.
good,"It was ok, but never followed through on anything.  Office manager/salesperson was never there so all duties were left on myself and another associate, including sales quotas for the office."
good,The company culture has changed since I started.  The better years were in the beginning of my career.  Currently I am inundated with work with no relief sight.  It is very fast paced and a lot of responsibility.  The pay is how they keep employees.  Management varies depending on who you get.  I have had a great manager currently but I've had others that are not as flexible or understanding.  We are not machines and sometimes it feels that way.
good,"Great company & flexibility. The commission based is low,  but State Farm as a whole is a great company to get into. It just all depends on who you work for"
good,"a good work experience "
good,I was always pushed to create unrealistic goals and then was questioned as to why I never succeeded in those goals. Regular lunches was a nice plus though. The commission structure wasn't very beneficial to the agents.
good,"To be clear, i worked for an agent, not at the corporate headquarters. Since each agent runs their own office their own way, with their own pay scale and benefits package, this may not be very helpful to most. The best thing I can say about working for any agent is that candidates should interview the agent as much as the agent would interview the candidate in order to ensure a good fit. Make sure that the agent is offering what you are seeking. In my case it was a very small office and the agent did not offer health, vision, retirement etc. believing that the commission you earn would more than pay for those benefits on your own. However, I believe that State Farm is a great company to get behind . Customer service would be key in any role you take at an agent's office."
good,Worked day to day workload using task management programs. Interacted with policyholders via phone and email. Worked in a team environment to complete daily tasks.
good,"I worked for two agencies in two different areas and had a wonderful experience with my first and an awful experience with my second.  My first agent allowed me to learn at my own pace, get excited about the industry, encouraged going to function, events, and conferences put on by the company as well as Mastermind groups.  Only reason I left was relocation."
good,"Competitive at all times.  The pay and hiring were not really up to the company, but whoever owned the office.  The Agent of the office established the culture of the environment and all."
good,"Starting from on-boarding to orientation to the first project, SF provided resources to help get you started with minimum complexity. It was a collaborative work environment that promoted success in your projects."
good,"Wage is above average but so is the level of stress. Also a long commute depending on where you live. If you're willing to relocate, there are advancement opportunities."
good,"Learn fast and apply quickly was the motto. If you are quick study, this is definitely the place for you. The training however could have been more intuitive, to assist with retaining the information needed, for when you left the classroom setting. Other than that, the company was a wonderful place to work with great perks and employee discounts."
good,"The positive is that the benefits are good, and there are educational materials provided for personal finance (CYFF). The negatives is that if there is a harassment situation, management will turn the other way and ignore what is going on. Advancement availability over the years hasn't been great, but in the new facilities advancement is very much possible (due to turnover and lost talent from retirement and not relocating after office closures). Supervisors are hit-and-miss, some are amazing while others are just horrible, and everything in-between. I've had multiple horrible supervisors with high turn-overs due to the disrespect they show their employees, and I've also had multiple positive, encouraging supervisors who bring out the best in you and help you meet the high-volume and high-accuracy work that's expected of you. You have to be careful with sick days off, because you will easily get written up for taking ""too many"" sick days off (i.e. 6 occurrences in a year even if they are only one day each). Expect micro-managing; it's the new thing."
good,Great job amazing benefits but agents know what to use you for. You will be over working yourself for the satisfaction of your boss. You must acquire licenses as well.
good,"But there is nowhere to go when you want to advance. If you want a lateral move, you can train for another hourly position. But to advance to a salaried or leadership position, don't go to Sales; it's toxic."
good,"Overall State Farm is a decent company to work for, however I would not recommend working in any aspect of claims. Working in claims changed my outlook on the company to being somewhere I could see myself spending the next 30 years to wanting to work somewhere else. The reason I say that is that mismanagement is rampant and there is a clear lack of direction and communication. Other departments within the company are not as bad and I would recommend especially for those who want a career."
good,Not a bad company. No advancement in Jax. Site is closing permanently. If this location had not closed I would have stayed. Other locations available. Am not willing to relocate
good,"The job/company is okay but the attendance policy is too strict doesn't really give the average person a chance if driving a long distance more than 50 miles one way to work.  Management, some or okay but others tend to not fight hard enough for the employees ho really come to work and do their job."
good,I worked at State Farm while going to school full time and SF was flexible with my schedule and allowed me to attend school and work. I was very appreciative for that option.
good,The training is lacking and the positions are stressful.  The emphasis has become meeting metrics and not the customers who support us with the purchase of their policies. More emphasis and basic customer service needs to be highlighted again like it was in the past.
good,"I enjoy working with my team.  I have gained considerable knowledge of the insurance industry in the last 18 years of employment, and have met some wonderful people."
good,"All agencies are ran differently. Sometimes things change and the company does not give you formal training, which is not the agency fault. They give you access to videos. Makes you wonder if you really are being set up for success."
good,"State Farm has decent pay and great benefits, but their corporate culture is very much dog eat dog.  They have institutionalized the ""it's not what you know but who"" into the very fabric and requirement of advancement. It also seemed that once you were in one area such as auto claims there was no hope of transitioning to any other such as technical, no matter how much experience you had."
good,"Not sure what the atmosphere is like there now but in the beginning it was awesome.  I intended to retire there and then, after seven years, they hired outside company to come in and change everything. Friends (tenured employees), with years of knowledge were let go or forced to work crazy hours. "
good,"Im sure it differs from office to office. My manager was very flexible with my coworkers and I as far as scheduling. The only downside is that it was hard to earn commission with the high rates we are offering. Also, since you work for an independent agent not the company, you aren't going to be moving up in position."
good,"I have always loved working here until recently. Due to staffing changes, I'm no longer sure how much job stability there really is. Until this, I was planning on staying with the company until retirement."
good,It was nice. People are friendly and the environment is relaxed. Managers can be a bit lacking when it comes to product knowledge. PTO system isn't the most ideal
good,Enjoyed working here. Good location. Nice people. Competitive workforce. Can be flexible depending on who you work for. Overall good experience. And most likely will recommend it.
good,"It seems like a nice place to work, people are nice and helpful."
good,Great company to work for during these trying times for the industry. The workplace culture is what yo make it because each agent is the business owner. You really learn to manage people more than processes.
good,This was definitely the place to get an education in insurance. There is no doubt when I was there education courses and accreditation were very much a focus. The schooling and licensing I received prepared me for essentially a 10 year career.
good,"Buena organización, responsables a la hora de resolver incidencias, respuesta rápida ante cualquier duda. Buenos compañeros"
good,"Company environment is changing."
good,The agency you work for will determine your experience. It is hard to judge what the job will be like unless you hear it from those that work under the same agent.
good,"State Farm is a good place to work if insurance is your thing. I took this job because California was too expensive. Working in a call center things get redundant. You take the calls and file the claims. Read the same word track etc. It's gets a bit old day after day and it can be hard to consistently be empathetic and on point in customer service. Pay is better than most entry jobs in PHX valley but much lower than other insurance companies. The training is pretty good but it's textbook training and differs greatly than what you're expected to do on the floor. Promotions are spotlighted in training like they give them out like cookies, but that's far from the truth. I would love to have more variety in my work or at least get paid more to deal with the boringness of it. Benefits are good, and there's a good culture there. I just need more money and am looking elsewhere."
good,"Each office is it's own entity, so if you have a great agent who has been around then you could have a great time as I know others have been with their agent for many years. But if you were unfortunate like I was to have a bad agent who lacked communication skills and mismanaged then you will hate your time there and not enjoy the job."
good,"I got hired by a relatively new agent and he was everywhere constantly. Sometimes I wondered if he actually knew what he was doing. State Farm was a decent company over all to work for, just make sure the agent you end up working for is vetted and experienced."
good,It was a nice place to work and the agent was great. It is a good way to keep up with all insurance regulations. The system can be a bit difficult to use.
good,"I have learned a lot working at State Farm, mainly how I would be if I was in a supervisory role. The job culture is great, work/life balance is horrible, you do not get discounts if you are a State Farm customer, management needs to be retrained in the Claims process, they will tell you that it is easy to advance but no matter how hard you try, no matter how ""green"" your board looks - it is not easy to advance. The environment is competitive, unstable and there are so many people who take leave of absences due to stress, it is ridiculous! The pay was good and the benefits were good too - but I chose happiness over my paycheck and health as well."
good,It was a great place to work at until hours started to get cut due to too much growth in the position that I was in. Very fast paced job getting calls back to back. Great location due to it being new buildings
good,I did get certified with my P&C and Health and Life Insurance Licenses.  It was a very competitive and stressful job at times with all the sales required.  It was very rewarding if all monthly sales goals were met
good,"There always seemed to be an agenda and rules that would change when it came to compensation.  Also, I was asked to take an office over an hour away because the one closest to me wouldn't be available for years when originally promised right away"
good,I worked as a contractor which was much better than working as staff. Staff employees would always complain about the low pay. They start you off with a pension but have to do a ton of overtime to make up decent salary.
good,"State Farm above all, trains it employees. The training is excellent, the benefits are good, and salary is competitive The only down side is every few years the Company ""reorganizes"" under new executive leadership, and employee mobility is necessary to accomplish this."
good,Good for junior positions. Hard to go higher. One of the biggest environments in US. Good team. Good benefits for internals. Not very good for contractors.
good,"The culture of State Farm was considered great while beginning the job. But after a couple of years of employment, the morale was seen to be low. The management does not care for the employees. I worked for State Farm bank and they laid off the employees in the city of Atlanta."
good,was a very good place to work. good hours. very good with letting me take off when needed for personal reasons etc.  learned a lot about insurance with good training.
good,Fast paced and rewarding workplace. Long hours. I would recommend State Farm to someone looking to get into the insurance field. They are a reputable and solid company.
good,"The company was a great place to work. Advancing to a higher position was harder to do without getting Insurance Certifications. The facility at worked at is closing, or has already closed since I've left."
good,If you are just getting into sales and looking to make little money with nothing amazing in commissions to get a feel for insurance sales State Farm is the place for you.
good,"Handle walk-in and answer phones"
good,"Room for growth, and lots of locations to transfer to, easy to learn applications and provide leads.  Good systems.  Depends on who your agent/boss is."
good,"The company has lost its heart. It used to take care of the employees, who took care of the customer. Now it is a numbers game. Also, the ""point"" system for absences does not take into account people have lives, children, families."
good,"Worked at three different offices and all had a different way of running. First was competitive and had its calm moments, second was calm all day long and third was fast pace and busy but never too stressful."
good,I love working at State farm but feel like I've gone as far as I can go with advancing. After 10 years of dedicated service I only have 7 days paid vacation and no benefits.
good,"My daily routine would be handling anywhere from 15-40 calls. Assisted with finding repair shops, towing vehicles, locating rental car companies, etc. The worst part about my job would be being able to stay calm while someone else is hysterical after an accident at the accident scene. The best part about my job would be the rewards and praises you receive from the customer being thankful of the great job you've done. I've learned patience and no matter what you do in life, patience and customer service skills will take you a long way."
good,"State Farm is a good company with decent benefits.  They are working and changing with the times to make their environment, salaries, and benefits more appealing to the millennial generation to be more competitive in the job market for those under 30.  However, for older generations, the pay scale and employee appreciation is not what it should be or needs to be to maintain the loyalty of any long-term workforce."
good,"Handle inbound calls from State Farm policy holders who needs assistance filing a claim. "
good,"As management at SF, some of the ideals were outdated and upper management did not want to hear about new thought processes, I left because it was clear change was going to be slow."
good,"The clientele are wonderful, everything up to date and time flys by, never a dull moment. non stop everyday always a learning experience every day. and that is all I have to say about that at this time."
good,"State Farm is going through many changes, consolidating departments , most jobs will be in major hubs.   Most of the jobs will be call center environment."
good,"Tried to make it as enjoyable as possible.  Not a lot of help when needed, computer glitches were our problems and I was penalized for there system malfunctions."
good,A typical day at work was starting the day with an office meeting. Review sales results and went over sales strategies. Work culture was minimal due to 3 people only working in the office
good,"High paced, high energy atmosphere. They really are about the numbers there guys. Keep your numbers within the span they allow and you have no worries."
good,"As a whole, I have enjoyed working at State farm.  The organization is undergoing a major change within the information technology area.  As a part of change, the company has changed in a way that causes a lot of stress and a feeling of unrest.  As a scrum master, I am attending as many as 4-6 meetings a day.  I enjoy the scrum master role.  I enjoy the freedom I have to do my job.  The work hours are flexible for the most part.  This allows you to have some type of work/life balance.  I am only looking for a position as my current position is no longer guaranteed."
good,"Inbound with lite outbound calls providing information on new and pre-existing Vehicle, RV, Boats, and Motorcycle loans for state farm agents. fun times"
good,It is in my opinion that State Farm is a good company to work for with good opportunities. Management could use more training to assist in employer promotions.
good,"We worked on a metric system, which meant you are timed on everything thing you diid while you were there. You are on the phone the majority of the time, and if not you are doing tasks which are also timed. It is very stressful, and you are expected to do 100% everyday. The workplace is nice, and the people, but alot is expected of you. I am sure different position are all different mind was extremely difficult, because you were timed and watched constantly."
good,Ok work/life balance. Fun place to work. Employees are nice. Management could use some work. Difficult to be promoted. Overall its ok. Somethings could be better.
good,State Farm offices of agents are owned and operated independently so you are working for the agent NOT State Farm Mutual itself.  My agent was pleasant and I learned a lot during my job at his agency.  There were no benefits and my pay was very low but this was a very long time ago.
good,It was a numbers based department that graded you against your peers on how much work you processed for the day.  The benefits were really great along with vacation time.
good,"Producers must be licensed, so have motivation and dedication. The insurance products are straightforward, and there is no deception. Tend to be conservative in criteria for coverage."
good,"The office I am working in is closing and I was unwilling to relocate to Texas or Arizona. So I am looking for a new job, and the environment is no longer a place I want to work in any longer."
good,"over all good company. Great Company,culture and environment. very great learning environment.Customer focused. the hardest part was dealing with disgruntled peers."
good,Pay and job expectations very reasonable for staff counsel. High volume but good support and technology.  Additional training and opportunities available.
good,Constant fast packed work environment that you would have to be willing to adapt to constant work flow changes on daily basis. Plenty of advancement opportunities especially if working at within one of their hubs.
good,"I've worked for State Farm for nearly 4 years. The company is great, honest and ethical. Their rates can be a little higher but it's because they give such great quality in their products. My first boss was AMAZING. He was truly a great agent and good person. My last agent I was with was terrible, absolutely rude and didn't care about his employees. It's a hit and miss with some agents but the company itself is great."
good,"Great organization to grow and develop if you're willing to work hard. Benefits are good. In recent years opportunities have decreased as the company is right-sizing, closing offices, and going through transition."
good,Family friendly company that is feeling the stress of not growing policies/customers.  Net worth growing but operations currently losing $$$   Huge customer/policy advantage over competition is now within striking distance.
good,"I was on the operations side of SF and it was difficult to advance unless you were willing to become an agent. Also, the company always had threats of closing or relocating to a major city."
good,"Although I enjoy working at State Farm the hours are less than desirable, and there is little opportunity to advance due to immense competition, and Non sufficient training and expectations for job performance."
good,"State Farm is a great company, however if you are looking to advance in position or salary, agency is not the route to take. "
good,very fast paced and time goes fast.  The people are good to work with.  I really like working there however it has become very unstable and uncertain about the future.
good,"I applied for the full time job as advertised.  I got hired along with about 20 others!  We got paid while training.  Our licenses were paid for.  And then it came time to start, and the jobs we all trained for had morphed from full time to ""part time for now.""  After six months of waiting for more that 15 to 20 hours, I asked for full time as we were all promised or else I would have to leave.  I was told that more cut backs were coming as the After Hours Quote and Bind was running out of steam, and State Farm could not compete with the cut-rate phone and quote ""Progressive General Types.""  But I'll give State Farm this:  They were very good at doing fair risk and exposure assessments to give good quotes up front.  The cut-rate guys low ball quote and bind first, just to get your information for driving history and other risks... then in the next billing cycle (likely to be monthly) the rate increases to a fair market rate!  State Farm does not do that."
good,"State Farm has undergone significant changes since 2007 when I started there. The have closed many offices and are relocating to more tax friendly state i.e. Arizona, Texas, and Georgia. The used to provide very comprehensive training to associates, but they have scaled this back and now hire more independent contractors. The Frederick MD office was a very great place to work, however this office will be closed effective 2021 and many employees will be displaced unable to relocate.  "
good,"Maybe good for a college job, but not a career option. I had some great coworkers but management was not my favorite. Honestly, commission based payments are not my style."
good,"Working at a State Farm was my first rush of additional education. I learned a lot about how to manage my personal, auto, home or life insurance, not to mention the processes. "
good,"I come in and would handle all the marketing calls out. That is probably the most difficult thing to do, just in terms of producing results. I have gotten to learn all of their systems and how to really ensure that people are protected in terms of insurance needs."
good,"State Farm has been a good place to work and develop a career. You have opportunities to move into new roles once you are an employee. A lot is changing right now  in insurance, so it is an interesting time at the company."
good,State Farm is a good place to work.  They will send you to training for about 8 weeks before hitting the production floor.  The company it self offers full benefits at the start of your first month.  This includes 401k and full medical and dental.  However They have been moving all their jobs to their main hubs.
good,I liked working there just didn't make enough money. Did not get any sick time but when my kids were sick they were understanding and didn't get snow days was open no matter what
good,"State farm aka the farm, started off great but as leadership changed so did the culture. Rotating shift bids can really make a good work life balance a challenge depending on what department your in."
good,"*Handle claims deal with customers"
good,You learn a lot about insurance and offer great benefits. Hardest thing to adjust to is the different requirements for the difference states. Typical workday includes coming in reviewing and making changes to policies.
good,"N/A...all good. loved it, but the pay was extremely low for the level of work expected. Really nothing more to say. All was good. Yeah, it was good. All good."
good,I love the environment of this company but they will be closing the office in 2019.  Many of the employees are moving out of state  to our Hub offices.
good,"Great Company! Must choose a good agent to work for. Bases on keeping quality not quantity. Sales driven, the better the sales the better the environment."
good,"It's a great company with lots of oppurtunities for growth, but the point system attendance policy was rigid and unforgiving even with doctors excuses or family emergencies"
good,"I loved the people I worked with. The environment was a pleasant place to come every day. But, there was no management direction or incentive. No benefits provided. I was there a year and had ONE review and no raise. I was paid unfairly for my skills based on where I came from. I felt unneeded and unappreciated by my boss. The salary I started at was a joke. Beware the agent you work for. Make sure they are fair and compensate you well."
good,There is an on-going IT Transformation.  This is the right thing for the organization.  We will be more efficient and responsive to our customers once complete.
good,"It honestly depends on the agent on whether you are going to like the position. I've worked at two State Farm offices so far and I got to see how much management effects my opinion about my job. The current agent I work for has made it difficult for me to continue in his office. I would recommend working at State Farm but I would consider really getting to know the agent before accepting the job. Once you accept the position it is a very lengthy starting process. If you are not currently licensed it might take you 2 months before you can even make a sale. These are all things to take in consideration. If you are interested in applying for a position because of the incentives, I would say there is a lot of opportunities to sell a product."
good,"The immediate employees are great. All of the co-workers and management have great attitudes and are easy to talk to. Sometimes the outside offices can be a bit rough to work with, but overall this is a good place to work."
good,"The hardest part of the job is dealing with the stress of ""numbers"" over people.  I was always on target but I saw good people get let go because of ""numbers"""
good,"I would get there and check the messages on the machine, call back the costumers in the order they came, and then concentrate on sales for the rest of the day, unless a client came in."
good,"One of the best jobs I have every worked. Friendly, relaxed environment with unlimited potential for advancement. Undetermined shift and continuous weekend schedules created little work life balance. Salary wasn't competitive compared to other competitors but all other benefits were beyond reasonable. I would definitely work here again if I had a set schedule and competitive pay. Unlimited training and development opportunities and overall a very enjoyable place to work."
good,"Worked as TPA versus IA.  Little to no advance warning on job displacement (2 days).  BI settlements worked in a production mode which is a bit different from traditional.   You are switched to a different State for handling of claims, going behind others who have not followed instructions; customers are angry and impatient by the time you receive them.   Bulk transfers will play havoc on your production numbers against goals set.   "
good,I worked for a State Farm independent agent for 10 years and it was great. If you're ok with repetition and handling people's money this is the job for you.
good,It was a great company to work for and you could move up quickly in salary and position but things have changed.  Job has become very stressful with the company trying to keep up with the market.  They have good training but need to get up to speed with compensation.
good,"no benefits, and not great of pay. each office is individually owned and run. lots of cold calls. some offices have leads generated and some you need to generate your own leads."
good,"Being a injury claims adjuster was very stressful and demanding."
good,"State Farm is a great place to work if you want to get into the insurance industry.  Licensing is paid for and there is a comprehensive training course that all new agents/phone reps are put through.  The atmosphere is relaxed, but competitive at the same time. The only draw back is that everyone starts out part time, or at least they did when I started there in 2015.  Getting full time hours is difficult.  "
good,Experience working with company has been fine. Great people! My work mainly consisted of working for an Agent who was no longer engaged. Many barriers to success. A lot more micromanagement then what would be expected as the agents are not employees of the company.
good,"Working at State Farm provided myself and my family opportunities that would not have otherwise been available. However, the work-life balance suffered tremendously."
good,"Honestly, the flexibility this job offered was the best thing about it. i am also a student so my agent let me take time off for that. I enjoy working for a great company like State Farm, but not as a team member under poor management."
good,The office I worked at has a relaxed atmosphere. This position can be fun when business is good but can turn stressful in slow periods. State Farm is a great company to work for.
good,"You can make money working the floor but you have to be obsessed or bend the rules. I feel as if State Farm has a good formula for service, but is not as heavily geared towards compensating nice, service oriented employees. Definitely a sales environment. Also 6 day work weeks killed my health."
good,State Farm is a god company to work for.  Classroom and Field Training is provided.  Catastrophic Duty does offer the opportunity to earn extra money.  Upper Management works closely with adjusters.
good,"Performance is based on a metric system that is very flawed, but there are ways to hit the desired numbers, however, quality may be conpromised. "
good,"-Easy work"
good,"some work days are unexpectedly slow while others very busy. Whoever works here needs to be able to handle often stressful times and be prepared to face all questions and objections from customers. Highly recommended to be very knowledgeable of company's regulations and products as well as insurance in general. I learned a lot by being hand on and learned so many things on my own without anyone helping you. The longer you work for the company the more you learn. Workplace culture really just depends on how agent and co workers are. Anyone could make it either boring and miserable, or fun and positive. The most enjoyable part of the job is feeling good when a customer appreciates your help."
good,I worked with an agent for four year right out of college.  It is one of the best decisions I have ever made.  My agent that I worked under was professional and taught me the ins and outs of the sales process and how to contribute within his agency.
good,"answer calls, provide quotes, provide service (taking payments, making policy changes, etc)"
good,This company is as corporate as you can get with an insurance company and still they seem to care about their people. If you are in the right place you can go far here.
good,"Typical work day Workforce at this company is shrinking due to high stress, and people retiring. Management expects employees to do more and more with less and less people in a much shorter span of time now than at the start of the year."
good,"A typical day was spent doing sales, retention and customer service."
good,work is Mon- Fri   9-6 it is a good place to work. people are friendly a I really liked working there. it is very demanding and they want you to get your license us I wasn't able too
good,"working with State Farm is very satisfying and the coworkers and  Agents are super nice, friendly and understanding. you get to learn a lot of things while you are working with them"
good,"The insurance field is a place where you really get to mold your sales and customer service skills. For my personal liking it was a little too slow paced but, it was a great internship that allowed me to get real world experience while still in college."
good,Learn to multi task very quickly. Need to be able to deal with the public and have people skills.  And listen to your customers and be empathetic.  Need to have extreme knowledge of the company's products.
good,"Other than brand name, State Farm lacks in marketing.  The efforts at the agency were outdated & ineffective.  Price is not competitive in the middle to upper class market.  Surprisingly, the niche market is the struggling individual.  In this niche, the price is competitive & the company will work to retain this business.  Activity is very high, closing is very low. Quality coverage is not a concern. Company is more interested in life sales than property & casualty."
good,"State Farm is a leader in the auto insurance industry.  In addition, State Farm has a fairly diverse portfolio of products, i.e. Health Insurance, Live Insurance, Annuities, and other Financial Products."
good,Great place for growth and long term opportuniry. Schedules are random but set schedule for about a year. Great benefits at start date and others available later
good,Long work days. ALways there for the customers. Calls are graded and that makes an employee feel as if they are not doing the job correctly. When you are able to talk to co-workers and get input on better procedures to help time.
good,"If I had worked in an office with a named agent, I would have loved the job and company. Unfortunately, the constant changes in leadership caused clients to lose faith in the company. The potential agents had high levels of anxiety because of the financial risks, time commitment, and pressure to pursue their contract with no guarantee."
good,A State Farm agency is a great place for someone to start their career because of the lessons you can learn by being more professional.
good,"State Farm is a good company, it is a great way to start a career with almost to no effort in a great way. Taking incoming calls and selling the policies or giving quotes is a simple task, as long as the calls are coming in."
good,"decent place to work overall. Entry level jobs are difficult to promote out of, great benefits though! a typical day at wok varies by the many different positions. State Farm has a learning culture, so mentorships are always available to you. Theres always encouragment towards educational goals and continued learning."
good,"My typical day ranged from completing quotes for new potential clients to working with existing clients to support their insurance needs.  Walking through their claims and billing issues."
good,"this company is a good company to work for. my coworkers were extremely friendly. customers were very nice, and it was fun helping them learn about different types of insurance options."
good,"An enjoyable work environment with pleasant co-workers.  The administrative support is diverse, depending upon the Executive's needs."
good,"Account Managing and Sales "
good,Customer Centric focus.  Great organization to be affiliated with.  Has afforded me many opportunities and I consider it a blessing to be a part of the State Farm family.
good,"Greeted customer pleasantly, make sure I provided great service to the customers, co-workers mood is accordingly to how busy the day has progressed and the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet people."
good,"I recently retired and would like to continue working in a mid paced environment, working week days.  I have learned that I have excellent customer service skills.  Working well with others.  I enjoy assisting the customer to the fullest.  In the time I worked with State Farm I had the pleasure of meeting wonderful people.  I enjoyed each person for different reason.  Each person brought their own personality and talent to the table.  "
good,Had a good work environment. Good team members. Had learned many job skills from the project. Had played many crucial roles in application.
good,"Slow paced environment."
good,"State Farm is a workplace with a very large portion of long-time employees holding the same position for years, even decades. The lack of growth and ability to evolve keeps hopeful employees from advancing in any real way until someone retires."
good,"State Farm Insurance is a solid company. They offer great benefits and a yearly bonus. However, I feel that they could benefit from listening to their employees a little more and understand that we drive in addition to the customers."
good,Great product to sell. The company is preferred and well respected all around the country. This job and my boss/mentor has really helped me establish good business and practical skills. My sales confident was established here and my overall knowledge of property and casualty insurance is phenomenal to the average person.
good,"Handling claims is a very busy business.  One is active all day. The work, generally, is diverse so though one is doing the same, but different activities on each claim. Co workers are friendly and helpful. The Company works to maintain quality work product and customer service is always stressed."
good,"This company has a lot to offer. Great work environment, pleasant co-workers and very nice work place. Resources are very well accessible and help is always around. Lunch is very short but food locations are readily available on-site. The company is rather large so the management team micromanages to the highest level. Great potential to move up in company. A lot of employees stay for a very long period and even make it a life long employer"
good,"Answer phones, write policies, account reconciliation enter vehicle loans, process payments, process bank loans and credit card applications."
good,"This was a part-time position.  My manager was new and unsure of himself.  The other employee was great working with!"
good,"Uncovered clients insurance needs based on needs analysis and provide affordable insurance solutions."
good,"A typical day at work for me is sitting at my desk in a Call center answering phone calls and servicing customers with personal claims. This environment is constantly changing and adding new processes and procedures to the workflow. State Farm keeps you on your toes and always challenges your learning. The knowledge I have gained within the Insurance industry is broad. I have learned to handle auto claims from fender/benders to Total losses and have been selected along with my team to assist teams in various States with their workloads. Management is very open about whatever changes the company are going through, they are approachable and very supportive and responsive. The most difficult part of my job is the sitting, I love to be active with customers and clients, person-to-person, I love the ability to look into a clients face and she the ""Ah ha"" moment occur, as Oprah Winfrey, says. The most enjoyable part of my job is servicing the customer, offering Remarkable Customer Service and satisfaction, I love when I hear in their voice how satisfied I have made them. For the most part State Farm is a good company if you like sitting and being on the phones."
good,I enjoy my work. Its a pleasure to meet and greet people. To hear their life stories and to be able to help them by customizing a plan that will best fit there lifestyles. The hardest part is that Its too far away. I drive over 100 miles to get to work everyday. Its rewarding to be able to help people. The team members are a pleasure to work with.
good,"Large client book of business, with prominent community members and always busy writing new policies. Great incentive bonus with ability to telecommute instead of commute."
good,"customer service"
good,Great Grassroots Programs across the nation. Fun environment and great employees. Always room to grow within the company. Can do anything from marketing to being an agent.
good,"The only issue with State Farm is the low pay.  Every other aspect of the job was a great experience.  I was promoted twice during my two years at State Farm, however, I was only earning 33,000."
good,"If you like an atmosphere where there is little to no micro management then this job is for you. This role comes with the freedom to create your own script, daily activities, appointments, etc"
good,"There is a lot of support for your personal and work life. There is no need to worry if you have kids because there is coverage put in place if something comes up. The advancement is slow and not guaranteed. The jobs are pretty routine, but the workload is great. If you cannot meet deadlines and handle a heavy workload, then this is not the company for you."
good,"Maintained a strong work ethic with a total commitment to success each and every day. Responsibilities: planned strategies, developed leads, scheduled appointments, identified customer needs, and market appropriate products and services. Co-workers were good. With self – motivation and  a strong organized effort I became an asset."
good,It's a pretty easy job once you get the hang of things.  The only downside to the job is the drama in the workplace.  Management is pretty easy to handle and everything you need to know is right in front of you.  The hardest part is finding everything so quickly.
good,"My typical day was quoting, phoning clients, answered questions and filing. I learned about the insurance world. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude clients but all in all I enjoyed meeting new clients and helping them in any way I could."
good,"A typical day:"
good,"This is a great company to work for, they just need to compensate more for the work that they're wanting out of the associates."
good,"There was no job security as the job was contingent on whether the Agent liked you or not. Working with the policy holders was challenging in a very enjoyable way. Work was salary however working eight hours a day was almost impossible, most days were 9 or 10."
good,"I am on the sales team at a local agency; I work with great people, and the products State farm have are top-notch. My issues stem from a lack of formal training (which would be especially helpful for those new to the insurance industry) and a lack of a defined career path- there are no 'growth milestones' that let you know how you are doing. In my agency there is a lot of cold/ warm calling; the hardest part of the job can be the daily grind, and dealing with difficult customers."
good,"State Farm is a very busy and fast paced place; you get to enjoy meeting new people helping them to your best ability. My best experience is with the management, I have learned a lot from her and will enjoy following in the management field after my degree. Being honest and following laws and regulations is a very important issue with this type of work. My co-workers so far were great; we had a great bond and I will dearly miss them. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with irate clients and trying to calm them down, to always remember let them talk and get it out of there system, to never interrupt; keep a calm voice to let them know you are listening and are there to help them with there problem. What I loved the most about my job is meeting new people."
good,i learned a lot about the insurance business and many other clerical duties. the office was filled with great people and had great times. easy work
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is making sales"
good,"The office that I currently work at is a fast paced, high producing sales office.  I have learned how to sell various insurance and financial products.  The agent is the manager and he is easy to work with and open to new ideas.  My co-workers are reliable and competent, and work well as a team.  The hardest part of the job, is the pressure to constantly produce at a high volume.  The most enjoyabe part of the the job is dealing with our clients."
good,"•	Good experience in implementing different design patterns such as MVC, Singleton, Business Delegate, Session Facade, DAO, DTO."
good,"Great company to work for. Located in fast pace area.  Management stayed on top of tasks at hand and trained employees to be alert, polite and quick with checking out process."
good,I really enjoyed my time with state farm and was sad when it was time to make a change.  My only issue was the amount of time required.  when you're single without kids it's no big deal but when you get married and have a child it becomes very hard to manage them both.
good,"Helping customers with inquiries about insurance."
good,"A typical day at work is writing insurance policies for customer, explaining what their coverage mean to them. Making cold calls during down time to try to bundle the agents book of business."
good,"State Farm has a great competitive product. I like everything about the company and product. That being said, work environment is different amongst independent agents."
good,State farm is a good company that I enjoyed. Building relationships with the staff and customers alike. We held several community events to educate the community on the benefits of insurance and I enjoyed that.
good,Family oriented company with high emphasis between balance of work and home life.  Supports advancement and educational desires.
good,"State Farm is a great company to work for, and learn the industry."
good,"Continuously learning aspects of insurance, claims handling, and sales."
good,assisting clients with their questions regarding their coverage and policy.
good,"new career field for me, I do not have a long time in this industry to give valid input."
good,"a typical day at work- Non typical, something different every day"
good,Large company with small office atmosphere and good values. Constantly challenged with new customer situations and the ever changing insurance world. The ability to adapt to change and multitask is necessary.
good,"Dealing with customers face to face and over the phone"
good,A great opportunity for on the job training. Great management
good,I enjoy my work and the people I work with. The workload is challenging and the rapid change I embraced.
good,Coming in doing the beginning of the day which consists of contacting policyholder for payments . Making calls in regards to households that may have auto policies but no homeowners and visa versa . Taking calls pivoting to bank products and life insurance policies . Daily activities calling policyholders that have had claims seeing if I can be of any assistance.
good,"•	Conducted JAD and elicitation sessions for user interviews to gather requirements. Worked with business partners to document detailed business requirements. "
good,Best coworkers I have ever worked with.  Job was interesting and I loved helping the customers to save money and solve issues with their policies.
good,"Typical office setting supporting insurance agents. The clerical"
good,"Overall State Farm is a great company to work for but there are two very different cultures within the company."
good,Great sales experience. Enjoyed working with clients and educating them about their needs.
good,Great place to work especially coming out of college. I like my manager who has great interpersonal skills and managed staff well.
good,"Answering multi-phone lines, customer service, sales, quotes, starting policies, reviewing policies, data entry, filing, accounts receivable, setting appointments, maintaining a clean office, opening and closing office, working in a fast and slow paced environment"
good,"state farm was a great oppurtunity fo me , with good pay. lod my co-workers, hardest part was maintaining sales month to month , best part of job was working asn agent"
good,"Working at an insurance office is very repetitive, and you are stuck inside all day, but the work is interesting. Learing about the insurance industry was very interesting to me, and I loved the corporate atmosphere of State Farm."
good,i will just answer calls from customers regarding their policies and claims.
good,Working with State Farm was a great experience. Seems to be one of the few last sales jobs not commission based only. Enjoyed working with co workers as well as clients in surrounding area.
good,typical day at work would be customer calling for quotes or adding a vehicle or maybe has just purchased a home. Write the policy for the client. The phone will be ringing & customers will be coming in to make their insurance payment. A customer will call to ask why there rate has gone up. A claim will be taken. Documents will need to be scanned. The most difficult part of my job is explaining why the rate has gone up again!! Or telling a customer that their claim is not covered. The most enjoyable is telling someone their claim is covered  & my co-workers
good,"Typically the day consist of a normal routine; answering phones, reviewing lists of different policies and assisting clients with problems."
good,Overall the company is a great company to work for. The hardest part of the job is the inconsistency. Working here i've learned you cannot succeed in a toxic environment and workplace. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help people protect their assets abd family.
good,Great Experience. There is much to learn and a lot of resources to assist along the way. All managment are polite and helpful. The hardest part of the position can be the policy holders which usally comes from frustration in not understanding the coverages or payments which can easliy be corrected.
good,Quiet environment
good,"In my office, there was no hard part of the job. Everyone was a team player and we met our sales goals daily. Great management team and coworkers but the company itself needs some work. My Agent didnt get his contract because he was his fathers successor and they thought it was bad for business. Other than that, best job I have had."
good,"My job consisted of daily customer service and organizing files, I learned to deal with money and deposit checks over the computer and assisting customers over the phone. Good and reliable management. my co-workers were friendly and helpful. The Hardest part of my job was getting used to handling checks over the computer in the beginning but after I learned it became easier to me. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting a happy customer."
good,Pretty good work and life balance. Can get team leader experience. Can advance to different departments.
good,"Small ageny, high expectations, good training to meet the expectations. Pleaseant people to work with."
good,"I have worked for this company for six years. I love the values of State Farm, however working in the CAT department doesn't allow a work/life balance to the employees. Management does not lend to allow growth from the internal employees either."
good,I learned to operate as a CSR as well as sales and marketing. The management was very approachable. My co-workers were all very professional. The hardest part of the job was late-night cold-calling. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers to get their insurance needs met and their questions answered.
good,State Farm offered the Loss Prevention Specialist autonomy to schedule and address employee and building safety issues. They treated the Loss Prevention Specialists as professionals and allowed them to be empowered to make decisions.Covering many facilities in the past before they went to combined leased facilites was often difficult to cover especially when the unit went from six to two.My co-orkers were friendly and supportive.
good,Learned alot about the insurance industry. Agents were very special and enjoyable to be with.
good,Busy with many calls in to the office regarding insurance quotes. I learned a lot about how to handle insurance claims and how to properly protect my family and assets.
good,"After working here three years I finally resigned. I still love this company, the benefits are great and so is the pay. However if you get a bad manager, it's no longer worth it. Especially if you can't get out for under them. It's sad that I felt I had to leave after 3 years all because of a manager I got moved under for training in a new position."
good,"It was a fun place to work."
good,"On a daily bases you will come across many great customers that make you smile and a laugh. You are able to help them through some of their worst of days when accidents occur or damage to their homes happen. On those days you are educated in claim handling so it will help you later in your career path. There will be days when someone cries in front of you or gets upset and those are the hardest days, but you just have to be prepared for them. Overall, I learned a great deal about insurance and underwriting while working with State Farm."
good,Working at State Farm Bank was productive and great place for learning. But it all depended on who your boss was. Some bosses did favoritism in the work place. Some favored women more than men. Some did not like new people succeeding quickly.
good,"The hardest part of the job is dealing with nasty customers on the phone all day every day."
good,In the office there was a lot of gossip and blaming culture that is easy to get sucked into. Aside from that it all depends on who is your agent and how they run their business. There is always something to do and to learn.
good,"I started out working in the Word Processing Department for 18 years and then worked in Learning and Development Department as a Learning Support Coordinator.  I was laid off due to department closing in the Concordville, PA location"
good,"I enjoyed working for State Farm. Overall the training, coworkers and leadership were good, though occasional issues arose as with all employers. There was stagnation in company culture, however, and at times it felt like concerns were not addressed quickly enough."
good,I really enjoyed working with a valued and well branded company. The agent that I worked with was amazing. The company offered competitive promotions and was definitely a sales position.
good,"Fast paced- but doable.  "
good,"Great company number one claims company in the world, learned a lot of valuable claims handling experience which I utilize to this day. "
good,"They are consolidating smaller offices into corporate and three main hubs. Internally, many departments are reorganizing which has limited advancement opportunities."
good,"Great company for advancement, I would recommend joining State Farm. Hours are good if you like the 9-5 and weekends off. Sometimes you have to work the weekends but its rare"
good,"I enjoyed my time working there, ended up doing more than what was required of me.The other employees were helpful and nice and overall my time there was pleasant."
good,My job experience with State Farm wasn't great but wasn't terrible.  If you are looking for a job and you have a P&C license it's not a bad job.  I enjoyed the people I worked with it and the boss was nice.
good,"I liked the trainers and the program they have in place. I did not like their business practices. We were the customer service department but we really were an answering service for after-hours agent's offices. 90% of the calls are resolved with ""contact your agent, we can't help you"". I didn't feel like I was making any difference."
good,"Good culture, pay could be better for the stress. No say in schedule and always a shift bid. Good insurance…. like I said typical call center. They sell you on advancement but its harder to come by then you think"
good,It was a great opportunity for the right kind of person.  A huge amount of cold calling with few leads as there are so many offices that cover the same general area.
good,"The position I work in isn't the fit for me, but it's a good to have a foot in the door with a company like State Farm. I'd like to be able to feel confident when applying to other positions within the company, but it's common to hear that we are currently unable to do so."
good,"A great place to work, they are flexible to a certain extent, if you come to work on time and can follow procedure, you're good to go! Really will miss this place."
good,the workplace culture was fun and the job was enjoyable for the most part. just super hard to compete with other insurance companies quotes which made it hard to sell policies.
good,"State Farm gave me a great foundation to start my career in the insurance industry. Gave great training and continuing education.  Also, has great possibility of moving up in your career."
good,"Great place to work and would highly recommend this company.  The claims end of the enterprise can be very stressful, but helping customers recover from unexpected can be very rewarding."
good,Overall the work culture is good. It was not a high stress job for the most part and it my coworkers were great. I learned a lot while working for them.
good,"I enjoyed state farm but each location is different, with a good agent this can be a wonderful place to work. If not, life can be miserable. All benefits vary as well depending on what your agent provides."
good,"Great company to work for.  I worked for State Farm for 4 years. I only wish they offered Heath Insurance.  There bank products were amazing.  Overall, great company!!"
good,"Very structure, great place to start an insurance career and learn the industry. Excellent facilities. Convenient central location for public transportation."
good,"Overall, it's your typical call center environment focused around metrics.  They have a campus with plenty of amenities such as a Starbucks, Mountainside Fitness (pricey but convenient), a breakfast/lunch restaurant and a cafe. There is a good mix of stuffy shirt types and down to earth people too. They have advancement opportunities but it feels like you're competing with thousands for one job, since there's thousands of people on campus. They aren't very forcible flexible with schedule scheduling unless you are going to school. They do however, have a wide range of shifts to choose from, if you're lucky enough to get one."
good,"As any company should, they are restructuring to be more modern and their approaches are ill executed in regards to employee impact. A lot of areas, especially technology departments, are severely under manned and have a workload that is unrealistic.  The management restructure was not efficient and left a lot of management that should have been moved or released.  I will say, they are trying and possibly listening to our opinions (after the fact).  A great stable company to work for, great pay, great benefits, and many advancement opportunities."
good,"I would clock in, sign in to my multiple systems, hit ready and take incoming calls, help customers with paperwork, location of items, disbursements of funds, file claims. Note all interactions in multiple systems, complete case is needed"
good,"I have amazing clients and boss. unfortunately there is no room to grow in the position I am currently in. There is no opportunity for advancement. The most rewarding part of my job is helping my clients, even if that means going above and beyond."
good,"When I worked for State Farm the compensation was low for it being number one in auto insurance. However, I have learned that they have increased their starting wages tremendously (from $12.40 to $17+). I enjoyed working there, but didn’t like that they would change your team up about every 6 months. Both managers I worked with were new in their roles and still learning. My second Team Manager had just been promoted from Team Lead and was of no help to me any time I needed her. She mostly talked about going out drinking with her other subordinates. Hopefully she’s improved since then. The benefits were great though. Enjoyed having a gym and cafeteria on-site. And they trained us pretty well over 8 weeks."
good,I worked here for nearly 6 years and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I started in customer service and after some time I decided to get my licensing so that I could sell a variety of insurance products. I liked getting to know my clients and having the ability to build personal and professional relationships with them.
good,An exciting place to work with a great work/life ratio but if you are looking to advance or make use of your time there it feels like you are wasting your time. I do see people moving up and being successful but the people who I see put in the time and the hard work are not seen or heard.
good,"hours good, pay not so much.  good first job. customers are good. cold calling is not too exciting. if you have a good agent then you will succeed. if the pay was better I would stay"
good,"Opportunity to advance, good work place culture. Lots of customer interaction. Helpful coworkers. Commissioned sales allowed you to set your income level."
good,I loved SF but was unhappy with how my manager handled certain situations and felt like I wasn't being heard. I felt taken advantage of and like I didn't matter.
good,Very nice place to work. The agent was just getting on his feet so not a lot of money in the budget for payroll. I was in mutual agreement that I would find another job.
good,"I left a loved position to start a promising career at State Farm, but was very disappointed to find out that there had been low job growth for the department. I didn't feel that the training gave me the confidence to handle phone situations on my own due to the complexities of the job.  Ultimately, I left because I didn't feel the job was worth the  daily hour to two hour commute."
good,"Excellent management, a true leader that is down to earth - helpful and admits when they are wrong and need a helping hand. Great customer service with customers consistently acknowledging our efforts. Great office culture, with smiling faces and collaboration when a goal is on the table. Our manager always offered competitions for a variety of perks- more leave, getting off early for the day, extra commission, etc. The consistent acknowledgment of our life outside of work and ensuring we have a good balance was the biggest perk of this agency. Great leaders make great teams."
good,"I learned a lot about the insurance industry while I worked at State Farm for 15 years. I maintained customer satisfaction, and the ability to retain our clients"
good,"Great company to work for. Offered flexible schedule, depending on your agent or office manager . Mine were both amazing and we became more like a family, I enjoyed my customers and built excellent relationships with them."
good,"No complaints. Just not exciting or terribly stimulating. Lots of calling and daily marketing, very repetitive, and rarely compensated for outside of office activity."
good,"Unable to advance beyond entry level positions without a 4 yr degree"
good,"A typical day at work includes helping clients with their insurance needs and policy questions. Taking care of general policy maintenance and finding out the clients financial and insurance needs to better assist them with accomplishing their goals and making sure they are protected should they suffer a loss. The hardest part of my job is the fast pace of the office and trying to stay ahead of my duties, but it is very rewarding to hear a client say that I have helped them. One client called me an angel today. That was nice."
good,This was a data entry job. Required a lot of paying attention to details while pumping out numbers.  The workplace culture was good for me as an extrovert but there has to be a balance since there loads of policy changes that have to be completed
good,"Definitely a starter job and not a job you can support a family with. "
good,I will not rate the company  in this fashion and risk employment.  I would have never thought of leaving.  The company decided to out source our positions.
good,"Nice place "
good,We had a large office and we were all super busy. We also had many customers that had belonged to our agency for 20+ years and then their kids became customers as well. It was a nice friendly place.
good,The potential for job advancement is slow but it was a nice place to work. I personally don't enjoy the call center environment. That was my only major dislike.
good,"I don't have one, I was required to leave this so I am just typing something to move forward in this process. It was an ok company overall. Just like any other."
good,"It was such a nice introduction into this industry. Super small office and the Agent just started out on her own."
good,"great people, and customer service but low salary:(I would stay but not for this income. Overall great management, friendly, helping a lot , answers all my questions and consideration."
good,"The number 1 thing, and this is important, is the people I work with. I work at an agency and my agent is an amazing person to work for. My co-workers are great as well. The thing I don't love is that there doesn't seem to be much room to grow unless you want to become an agent yourself. There isn't many benefits with my agency either. There is ALWAYS something to do and the work load can get piled up on myself and my co-workers much of the time."
good,"Overall great company and great people, I enjoyed working here but my office was closed permanently and the new office location was too far for me to commute daily."
good,"This is definitely the type of job for someone who is able to work independently. My bosses, absolutely wonderful and understanding. The job itself, less than satisfactory. My team made it bearable, but it's difficult working a position where you're constantly facing rejection. Not for the faint of heart."
good,Lots of changes on claim processes but that’s just part of the automotive claims industry. Direct leadership was a bit lacking but company leadership seemed strong
good,"The job isn't as easy as it sound, there is extensive training and you are always learning something new. The hardest part of the job is fixing the accounts. If you can do this job you can do anything. You really leave here learning a lot of knowledge about insurance and billing. It's a team environment and management is supportive."
good,"Currently work consists of production oriented, push the work out with little to no detail to quality and customer service to which I am accustomed to from when I first began with this company.  The consolidation of many offices that focused on the customers are being closed and relocated to ""hubs"" in various parts of the United States.  If you are not willing to move then our jobs are being dissolved.  "
good,Was great until the CEO changed and culture changed. Work life balance became hard to maintain with mandatory overtime and impossible to reach metrics
good,"was the most boring job i've ever worked. do not recommend. i want to find another job, not talk about my previous ones. i already have to fill out too much stuff."
good,"People at State farm were very nice but it was very slow paced, pay wasn't great, and management was rarely onsite. They had 4 producers in the office but there wasnt enough work for all of us. watching the clock wasnt that fun"
good,state farm is a over all great company. You just have to find the right Agent to work for that fits you. great customer service / excellent coverages and great rates.
good,I enjoyed the people and opportunity to help others secure and better protect their lives and assets. I just wish I had not been thrown into it and been better trained.
good,"Big company with lots of opportunity to learn and grow.  Because of the strategy of promoting from within, there are so many directions one can go and geographic regions to live.  Strong investment in its employees and sales force."
good,"I worked there several years ago, hard to comment on how it would be to work now, I enjoyed my job and working for the company for 23 years "
good,"Customers love the brand, good support structure, great team environment. Offices are individually owned (franchise structure). Pay should be examined is the only down side and lack of employee benefits"
good,"Needs a better environment. Very much a 'who you know' company. Discouraging and demoralizing. Work was good, interesting. Angry people on the wrong end of a claim we're always fun."
good,"Employees work in a fast-paced call center environment.  Good listening, multitasking, and decision making skills are a must.  For the most part management is supportive and will work to develop associates for promotional opportunities.  The pay and benefits are good for an entry level position.  The company culture promotes empathy, equity, and accountability.  Unfortunately these ideals are somewhat mismatched with the personal metrics each employee is responsible for.  Advancement within the company hinges on exceeding targets.  Therefore quality and compassion are sacrificed providing an inadequate customer experience.  The impression given when entering the company is to develop your personal brand and market yourself accordingly.  For some, the standard they hold for themselves far exceeds the company's expectations and they must then compromise integrity and service in order to excel."
good,"State Farm Insurance was a good experience. It was my first real administrative job. It was a quiet office but I learned phone etiquette, faxing, scanning and how to manage the database. I think that the employees should have a higher salary and benefits. When I was there, I only made 10$ an hour. I know that the licensed employees did not receive any benefits or bonus for signing up new clients. I think if you had bonuses or salary increases for these workers, they would be more inclined to create more revenue for the company. However, my state farm agent was a very sweet and understanding boss. The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain a great customer service voice when customers were upset. The great part of the job was the company dinners. My boss would take the whole office out for christmas or birthdays."
good,There use of technology is so helpful and makes sales and service so much more efficient.  Friendly outgoing managers that are ready to assist with any ongoing situations. The lack of benefits is not a company problem just an agency one.
good,"State farm is a good company to work for, the area i worked in was located in Richardson Texas, in a campus type setting. The co-workers are great to work with."
good,Everyone is willing to assist you to make sure you succeed and are willing to help you reach your goals.  There are a lot of opportunities for growth.
good,The pay that is received is generous however there is to much restructuring and competition to feel job security. Advancement is to hard. I worked in the same department for 3 years with promises of advancement that never came. I always did everything they said and more and still advancements didn't come.
good,"Company is going through major restructure and downsizing. Only 4 locations to work in. Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix, and Bloomington, Il. If you can work in those locations, I would say it is a good company to work for."
good,The work day is usually involves several meetings on different topic that require flexibility and adaptability on a regular basis. The work requires using different communication skills and working with associates at all levels in the organization.
good,Friendly staff!  No pressure environment for insures as policy options were discussed. walk-ins would be helped promptly and genuine urgency to address costumer requests/concerns.
good,I had great benefits and was able to increase my income but the office manager was always a problem. I worked for an agent not State Farm corporate. Corporate has great benefits also and from what I've been told from several employees it's a great place to work.
good,"State Farm has a personal touch - though a very large company, it makes each employee feel like it has a voice and treats each as an individual. State Farm is managed well - strong strategic vision and execution is focused."
good,"It was ok working for state farm bank, my manager was okay as well. I was laid off due to my contract ending. You were able to talk to your co workers often which was nice."
good,"Typical day at work was making phone calls and meeting with clients. I learned a lot about insurance. Management was great, very kind and understanding. The culture was great. Hardest part of the job was dealing with upset clients. But in the end I learned how to do just that and was able to help them."
good,"Great company, depends on agent on the environment, compensation and benefits. My agent offered a hospital income policy, as well as group paid life policy. My agent was very giving with raises and bonuses. However, there was no balance at work, no organization. Phones rang off the hook all day as well as people walking in. You had to take every call sent to you. Therefore, work would never be completed. There are also no benefits, except for a week vacation and a week sick time."
good,"Offers great skill improvements opportunities, Used to be family oriented, it steered away from that.  There is not much of a job security anymore.  Still a good place to work."
good,"As a leader in insurance industry, State Farm afforded me to learn many aspects of the business.  The commitment to promote from within meant as an employee, you were well trained and prepared for additional levels of responsibility. Best part about working for State Farm was the people.  State Farm employees are loyal, committed, knowledgeable, and focused on providing outstanding service to internal and external customers."
good,"Insurance is a field that your heart has to be in. If it's not, you'll hate it. For some, it's for them and for some it's not. Some days I loved it but it ultimately made my anxiety fly up the roof."
good,"A typical day would be taking inbound calls, handling assigned tasks, taking recorded statements and handling disputed liability auto insurance claims."
good,"Very high paced call center environment."
good,the work environment was based on the lead agent(who ever the office is named after) the agent i was unfortunately paired with was hostile and very job intimidating no where near a good leader.
good,"calling customers, building relationships, and trying to make your monthly sales. great way to help and educate those in need. overall ok job. great way to learn about yourself and priducts."
good,"Production-oriented environment, very fast-paced. Less emphasis on quality and more on numbers. Training at the beginning was good. Future is uncertain for some positions and therefore a stressful environment."
good,If you intend to stay in the CCC branch for your life then the advancement is fine otherwise it will be tough. Most people are pleasant to work with and most supervisors are good. Your day and experience will most undoubtedly hinge on the quality of your supervisor.
good,Lots of attention to detail as well as active marketing. Fast paced environment. If you do not stay focused to stay organized it may get overwhelming.
good,Typical work days were fast paced and challenging but highly rewarding. Great client relationships. I enjoyed managing the numerous accounts that were under me while there.
good,"I like that they allow us to dress comfortably. Our work hours are 10+ and to be comfortable is important. It is fast paced, with continuous changes for the better, and provides constructive feedback to enhance job skills."
good,"If you want to pursue a career with State Farm, working fr an agent is a mandatory step. Unfortunately, the agent you get can either make or break your career."
good,"Good company with good culture and nice people"
good,"Answer the calls that would come in and direct them to who could help them. Some calls I would be able to assist them in. Such as bank accounts, loans"
good,Great organization from a development standpoint. One of the main strength is the development of their associates.  There many opportunities for advancement.
good,It is a very relaxed workplace.  I love helping people out.  I learn something new everyday. Hardest part of the job is being over staffed.  I wish I had better benefits.
good,"State Farm is great place to work everyone is so respectful & Caring. It’s a job that you will be determined to do and love doing it as well. Such loveable understanding people who is willing to help with anything, they bring treats every friday just to show appreciation to their employees."
good,"Agents, of course, are small business owners. I did not technically work for State Farm because of this. This did limit the availability of benefits and upward mobility. I would have preferred working for the corporation itself. Overall, I think State Farm is a great company. My only issue was that I didn't have access to benefits because I worked for agents, and the pay working with agents wasn't as competitive either."
good,"I enjoyed my time at State Farm.  It's very competitive if you would like to advance.  I really liked the fact that we had weekly huddles with the team in addition to weekly 1 on 1 weekends with your manager.  There are metrics that must be met, which may be difficult, but my experience with my managers was great.  They really care and offer assistance with anything you may struggle with.  State Farm really values and takes care of their employees."
good,State Farm has good pay and benefits. Co-workers are friendly and helpful. When you are on the computers though it is hard to just run quickly to the bathroom if needed.  Everything is monitored.
good,"I loved working here . The culture depended on the manager at the time . I wish there was more room for advancement . I would go back, if I had to. I had different experiences with the job depending on who my manager was at the time ."
good,"Working leads, marketing,servicing accounts."
good,"you must view every interaction with another human as an opportunity for a sales conversation...  It's not a 9 - 5' er;  it's a LIFESTYLE!"
good,State Farm is an ok company to work for. They are fair and consistent. The work environment was clean and comfortable for the clients and its employees. It can be hard to sell do to their underwriting guidelines.
good,Worked for State Farm in various locations across the country.  Very strong and talented culture.  New amazing locations in three major cities making it attractive for younger talent.
good,"State Farm was a decent place to work. Hammering phone calls all day isn't for everyone. Getting told ""no"" multiple times/day is something the worker needs to be prepared for."
good,"Lower pay in the industry then comparative jobs with other insurance carriers. If you're willing to put in the work and relocate then they could be a career and lifelong job. Very routine to be working with people that have been with Statefarm 10+ years. That being said, processes change constantly and due to that very hard to be consistent in your work. Explaining a new process to body shops that have been doing it the same way for years is very frustrating. With jobs positions and business changes happening so consistently no way to get ahead, HAVE A DEGREE and the world is your oyster. Without it, expect to wallow and flounder."
good,"Had a great time working for State Farm, however my obligations to the national guard prevented me from maintaining a steady commission. Otherwise a great experience."
good,"Short lived because I had to move, but enjoyed working with a smaller team and had a great agent. Only cons of working on this particular team was there wasn't enough training."
good,Leader in the industry with an excellent brand. Culture has changed a lot as the company continues to adapt to changing customer demands. Very fast paced work environment
good,"A workplace with a glass ceiling. A typical day at State Farm was very structured, organized, and fast paced. The most enjoyable part of my day was collaborating with my team mates to improve daily business functions"
good,This company will be the best if they knew how to treat the employees when it comes to making last minute changes to someone schedule and also when it comes to the workload that is given then the pay needs to change.
good,"If your future goals are not insurance based, you career will not be long lasting. "
good,"Some days you have more walk in customers than others. A typical day includes taking payments; making changes to policies; quoting new business, in person and over the phone.  The agent at my location was preparing to retire, and was not in the office very much. The office manager was nice. The most difficult part of the job is closing the sale. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers and gong the extra mile."
good,Overall the environment is good but is currently very fast paced with no signs of slowing down. Compensation could be better for the work expected but may be in line with industry.
good,"Very busy, fast- paced work environment. Constantly need to adapt to changes and use resources to provide answers to Manager's in department that are needed. Need to be able to work independently and collaboratively without much direction. Office as a whole is not the most stable, not sure how long the building will remain. If want to move further with the company need to be able/willing to move to a HUB location (Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix)."
good,The company is an overall good company with great benefits. The environment it is okay long as you focus and stay to yourself. There is always room to move up in the company. It all depends on how bad you want to.
good,"The whole team is great to work with, we all treat each other like family.   I deal with a variety of personalities on daily basis and get a satisfication everytime I am able to successfully help the customer."
good,Company will be in the forefront of the Insurance and Financial Services for many years to come.  Has many departments and areas with a wide variety of jobs.
good,I enjoyed working for State Farm Auto Insurance though many times Call Center positions can lead to boredom they do offer quite a bit of varied types of calls.
good,"Had a good time working there, money could be better, but since I could walk to work it was worth it.  Nice supervisors, but a little too much micro management."
good,"Starting my career with State Farm Insurance was very positive. I was able to prove my skills and abilities and move up in my roles quickly. Through the years,there were many changes within the organization. The last  5 years of my employment with State Farm Insurance became increasingly more difficult to adjust to the micro-managing nature.  The employees were made to feel that we, as employees, were no longer valued in the way we were previously.  Changes in the structure caused the closure of many offices, forcing my family and I to relocate."
good,I loved for state farm. It is a fast paced well organized company that cares about there employees. The hardest part is dealing with customers when the company has rate increases. I am just ready for a career change
good,Overall great experience with a lot of room to grow. Wish pay was better but as an agent I believe it is. The major frustration was the two different computer systems that we had to work with which at times seemed to work against each other.
good,"Flexible schedule, great coworkers, very helpful learning with new things. Helped get license for everything including property and casualty, health, and life."
good,Working as an agent you are not an employee of the company but an independent contractor.  Salary and benefits are dictated by the owning agent.  Long hours and very little paid time off.
good,"It was an okay job, you just sit on your butt all day take incoming calls. Had to set up claims, had people calling right after accidents or their lawyers. People are so entitled after stuff happens to them, but you had to try to get as much information as possible. People will tell you it gets busy, but it doesn't, it's a really boring job. I would go about 2 to 3 hours without getting a phone call, and when you get a phone call it's about 20 minutes. Only days it gets busy are after holidays or natural disasters even then it's only for a couple hours."
good,Good place to learn how to sell and service a huge variety of insurance products with a company that puts it's customers first. Good reputation and brand.
good,Learn a lot about the car loan industry. Also learn how to navigate credit reports and how credit management helps others. Learned about what is looked for on a credit card application. Overall great experience.
good,State Farm is a financially sound company.  And is a good place to work.  There are opportunities for advancement all over the United States on many different areas and fields.
good,"Worked on help desk which for me was fun also enjoyed the people I worked with.  There training was thorough and complete, always willing to explain what you don't understand."
good,"State Farm is a great place to work because of the co-workers, people, & culture. They offer educational, training and career development opportunities."
good,"The work load is stressful at times, they are very petty at other times, the metrics are crazy, but the core values of the company make the job sustainable. Very high turnover rate.  You are at the job so much, your co-workers become family."
good,"Small local office, earned Insurance Producer License there, learned a lot about insurance and enjoyed customer service.  Manager had a lose management style, it was a very enjoyable work experience."
good,State Farm has a competitive and productive culture that forces productivity and results. The most enjoyable part is to fix the best financial setting possible for the client.
good,At the time this company was a great place to work.  Learned a lot about fire & casualty homeowners insurance as well as auto insurance in depth as well.
good,"I love the people that I work with.  I've only had two managers and they were both really great.  My main issue is that in order to make a great living, you have to work a ton of overtime and sacrifice your social life.  Also, the way that time off is allotted is extremely frustrating and makes planning trips almost impossible."
good,"The company really focuses on rewarding agents, but not so much the operations team. They need to hold more company events and team buildings for hard working call center employees so they feel more appreciated."
good,Enjoyable work environment. I really enjoyed working for this Fortune 500 company. The people there are very friendly and it was a joy going to work each day.
good,This is an easy going job depending on you agent. However depending on your agent your pay will be outstanding or you will be seeking employment elsewhere.
good,"Nationwide emergency after hours assistance for both new and existing customers. Provided detailed support for agents, service vendors and roadside services as needed. Referred clients to regional claims departments in cases of loss reporting and updated file information when required. Communicating in a calm and courteous manner in moment of high stress, using approved scripts, job aids and multiple computer applications, all while maintaining quality, accuracy and professionalism in a fast-paced environment."
good,"Working in my current role is challenging. The atmosphere is relaxed, however phone interaction with customers is very professional. Procedures change according to customers need."
good,"A typical day was extremely busy handling a large inventory of claims. "
good,"State Farm is a good company to work for. You do need to get you home/auto health/life license to work there, but they give you the training tool you need in order to past the test. It is not a difficult job and the offices are small so you get to know everyone well."
good,"State Farm provides excellent benefits such as, 401k, pension (not many companies still offer this), medical, tuition reimbursement among other great benefits. However, they are transitioning their way of life and it has disturbed the work/life balance. They have a point system that doesn't take account for your seniority and depending on the amount of point you have you will terminated with out a doubt. There is minimal flexibility with your shift. I loved the old way they handled time off and their claim handling but a lot has changed and not totally for the best."
good,Good company to work for. The benefits were great and lots of paid holidays.  The job itself could be stressful but there was also a good community of co workers.
good,"A typical day at State Farm Insurance would be to start by greeting customers, assist them with their needs, answer phone calls, post payments, process paperwork as needed, prepare bank deposit, prepare for the next business day."
good,Very friendly people; work schedules accommodated the large contractor workforce with many not working on Fridays. The sad part was that the continuous process improvements over the 6+ years I was there wound up obsoleting my job skill.
good,"While it's a great place to start at, and there is a TON of room for advancement, one bad manager or team can completely ruin your chances of moving up."
good,"a typical day at work are answering all calls and direct to the most appropiate department or person according to situation, multitasking while listening to person taking notes and or having to send email for caller. upon taking calls there will be back-to-back calls in which we learn more on how to better direct calls and prevents workers from handling external devices."
good,"Great company, great benefits, New CEO, has since completely changed culture and implemented new time off policy for employees who are penalized for emergencies and sick days, requiring them to lose jobs.  For the first time are implementing ""lay offs"""
good,The company is large but the office I was employed at was small - only two employees.  At the time of my departure there had been a change in ownership and changes were being done to the structure.
good,"Tremendous amount of households being insured by StateFarm created a great need for client / customer support to facilitate The application and underwriting process, policy support and claims.  As an agent assistant producer, i found that everyday was a learning experience."
good,"The staff was fun,the office was laid back but was always prductive. You spent a lot of time answering e-mails and making phone calls to prospective and active clients trying to discern what was in their best interest and some times that could be a challenge.  However if you are outgoing and willing to ask the right questions you will succeed."
good,"The new State Farm building at Park Center 1 is nice. The people make the company if you are between the ages of 21-45. If you get a good boss, you will enjoy your stay here. They only match around 1.5% on your 401k so that was not great. They also don't any discounts on insurance if you work here because of a law and the discounts to other businesses aren't that great either."
good,"I really have nothing more to say about this job, I will not burn bridges, nor will I say anything bad about one person or another. I feel that everyone will have their own experience and will make a decision based off of that experience. Avoid any temp service work."
good,All employees are great and the work environment is great for maximizing your sales. The management for the region is very friendly and they help you feel welcomed to the company.
good,State Farm Insurance is a great place to work.  I love helping others.  at the location I work the customers are nice and friendly and the staff and my boss is like family
good,State Farm is a good place to work if you're looking for a good pension and benefits not if you're trying to advance your career. Lots of red tape and politics if you're trying to move up.
good,"I enjoy working with others. It is a lot of hard work, but very time consuming. Sales must be a strong point. But I love meeting new people and making sure they are taken care of with their auto, life, and home."
good,"Excellent stable company, however the growth potential seemed limited.  Worked on an old outdated system that was being updated.  The distance and traffic to get there was wearing on my health."
good,Great work place with a lot of benefits. The offered a lot of vacation and PT time. It was clean and structured. Maybe too structured. The clock was more important the the work completed. There was no advantage to completing the task better or more efficiently.
good,"A typical day at work would be getting set up; checking voicemail boxes, sorting through work on your desk, and preparing. What I learned was how to work at a quick, but calm pace. The management wasn't good, lack of communication to employees. My workplace culture is to work as a team, but know how to work independently, and organization is the key to success. The hardest part of the job were the lengthy hold times on the phones. The most enjoyable part of the job was working together as a team when the team was there, accomplishing a days worth of work and not walking into it the next day, and learning new things."
good,"I do not wish to provide a public opinion. I had my ups and downs in this job, but it was an excellent experience opportunity and I learned enough to help me become more career oriented."
good,Everyday was the same routine but high volume of work. All work needed to be done on the same day if not you will be behind the following day. Good people to work with.
good,great staff and always helping customers with their insurance needs. quick and personal service for all customers.  Professional environment for all types of customers and staff.
good,State Farm is a great place to work. They empower you with responsibility and decision making abilities. They have excellent training and development opportunities.
good,"The people who work for the company is very hard working.  Just my observation of being there in the company for quiet sometime, some management are very hard, they would fire people that they think is not performing or was hated by another manager.  I don't why managers don't help others to become better and that would be the award for the manager.  helping someone succeed in a field makes me feel good but not sure why some of those manager does not do that."
good,"It was a great place to work. Building was state of the art with all kind of facilities. Made many friends. Learned a lot about Test Cases, Matrix etc."
good,"Great place to work but sales have become repetitive over time - great place to learn & grow & experience a variety of product knowledge, customer relations, branding & sales experience"
good,"I assist our policyholders and our claimants by providing quality customer service."
good,"Although collections is hard stressful, it is a way of curing delinquency and finding ways to help people fix their problems. I learned a lot of communication skills and excellent customer service. It is very hard to take the backlash from customers but there are ways to help them calm down and help you help them.  Management always providing proper coaching and training. Great environment and coworkers. Everyone minds their business."
good,In the agency training program you are exposed to a lot of valuable information and work with top notch people who really know the sales side of insurance.
good,"Great place to gain experience in the business field."
good,Coroporate environment with very structured guidelines and expectations. High volume and fast paced. Plenty of resources. Perpetually changing direction with regards to workload.
good,"The office is located in a busy financial area, which was good for business. My colleagues were friendly and cooperative. Our agency's boss was extremely helpful and supportive."
good,I extremely enjoyed my time working with State Farm however it was a family business and sometimes family and business do not always mix.  With that being said I'm am looking to take my skills to help further another company.
good,"The organization has a rich history of being customer focus, employee development and managing the business effectively I most enjoyed getting to know all the wonderful people.  Management styles depends who you get, but overall it is like working with a big family.  Big on having mentors, and at times is who you know that helps advance with the organization."
good,Dependent upon the office you work in. The agent's all run their office very differently. I had to work sometimes 10 to 12 hours a day.
good,Enjoyed my time at State Farm.  Wish the corporate culture hadn't changed.  Great benefits and room for advancement and growth
good,"Its been great experience working at State Farm insurance,higly organized and great management.We have team of 4 person and all are very friendly and helpful."
good,Excellent in being the top Auto Insurer! Excellent in initiatives to manage expenses! Excellent in seeking customer focus goals...
good,"Manageable deadlines,  able to cross train in each division of the company; learning company policies in auto, life, health, claims, and more. Specialized areas make for your skills to be ulitilized on a daily basis. Co-workers were a joy to work with and Managment was great and flexible."
good,I great place to work.  I enjoy working with many different types of people and they have helped me to adapt the many different company changes.
good,"no comment at the current time"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility of the job. They were willing to work with me while I was getting my MBA.
good,State Farm has a comfortable work environment. They have very nice amenities is the work place. The employees there are pretty friendly.  I have learned to really mutli task in this position. The stringent time restraints that are put on the the work day are the part of the job that I don't like. I am used to working in a more relaxed work requirement. I had daily and monthly deadlines in my previous job not the minute and hourly time frames like this one.
good,"Was a good position but new agent and under funded so position was terminated. Went to different agent"
good,I really enjoy the team atmosphere and enjoyed the majority of my co-workers.  My managers were helpful and knowledgeable about processes and help us in coaching us up to be better handlers. The hardest part of the job was the workload and the lack of flexibility.  Most enjoyable part of my job was actually resolving claims and helping people that needed it.
good,The daily reward was helping people recover from the unexpected in regards to providing a resolution to their claims. A typical work day consisted of the intake and management of claim files within a timely manner along with investigating and indemnifying customers based on policy statutes and state jurisdictions.
good,"My favorite was meeting new people each day, and who I worked with; other than that I could of done without but I learned from my experiences all the same."
good,"Advancement opportunities are extremely limited, and the company strongly values having a degree over real-world applicable work experience. The workload is maintainable and easy to manage, however working in a team environment on insurance claims can provide it's challenges."
good,"I've been working for State Farm for almost 3 years as a Express Claims Associate this environment sucks. You will live life on the phone solving customer's issues and concerns. Great job to get you acclimated to insurance claims. Workforce management is a pain and can dictate your life everyday at work. Lots of overtime if you can mentally stay. Promotions are not really promotions most of them are lateral moves to different departments. Promotions are only given to family members, brown nosers, and people who network better than their work product. Managers vary and change almost every 6 months I have had 7 since I've  been at the company. The pay was increased to accommodate and keep people in the Express dept. But still doesn't make me feel any better as there are allot of Masters and Bachelor degree holders here when most claim specialist have no education and still get paid more to do less work. Seen plenty of promotions to different departments where people with mediocre work records and no experience get to higher paying jobs by simply meeting the bosses. Coworkers are great made allot of new friends here. They believe in developing you as a whole and like to keep talent in certain areas forever. A good solid company overall I just want them to promote people on skill vs who nose is browner."
good,"Management at this company was a pleasure to work with and everyone worked as a team!  This was a great place to work. I had my own work space and a team of 16 people. It was always a group effort. The company was very family oriented and the benefits were great. On the flip side, the company was down grading and there was no job security."
good,A nice environment with great co-workers who are willing to help you succeed. Manangement could've been more educated on what exactly we do as phone or back office reps. Good benefits. hardest part of the job was training because it was so much information to retain. After development and coaching along with experience in the field the job got easier.
good,Excellent place to begin a career.  It is great for young people to begin a career that can lead to incredible growth.  I highly recommend this company for someone who is willing to put in the energy and time to make it happen.
good,"Worked as a supervisor of approximately 20-claim associates handling auto & medical claims.  Handled property damage functions as well as the evaluation of the injury claim & settlement."
good,"I like the ease of merit promotions and the ability to move up with in "
good,The job was very fulfilling and challenging. I had a lot of friends there and made time go by faster as well as stressful environment dealing with speed of machinery.
good,"A typical day in the agent's office consisted of primarily of customer service and sales.  The agent's office was small and consisted of three other employees besides the agent and myself.  I was able to devote my time to the employees when needed and provide customer service to our clients.  As a Senior Claims Processor for the corporate office in Murfreesboro, TN, I had great co-workers who embraced the idea of teamwork.  Management was always in close proximity to answer any questions or concerns that we may have had.  The hardest part of both positions was dealing with large numbers of claims.  We worked diligently to get the claims handled and to make sure the clients were satisfied.  The most enjoyable part of the positions was supplying good customer service."
good,"This job provided an opportunity to use my management skills and work with policy holders to make a positive experience for everyone involved.  Making sure policy holders were properly insured, protect their assets and their future was the priority.  Setting priorities overseeing office duties was part of the job which was done efficiently."
good,State Farm is a very solid company that offers many options in careers. You can work in the corporate environment or in agency.
good,"It will vary slightly depending on the agent you work with. Under my agent, I make sure each policy holder's requests are addressed and taken care of. I take payments and provide proof of insurance for when they are requested. To keep up with each of our policy holders, I set up insurance and financial reviews for those who are interested. I keep a schedule of all the hourly workers and manage the agent's calendar. There are many day to day tasks that cannot simply be listed that I do to help make things run more smoothly in the office. The most enjoyable and unique part of my job is that my agent is part of many philanthropic committees, and I get to do my part by editing presentations, pamphlets, handouts, and various other items for these organizations."
good,There is room for growth but it takes a while. Mid-level management needs to improve more. The benefits are good and employees won't wait for 90 days to be a regular. The metrics are not hard to accomplish but it takes a lot of effort to be the best.
good,"A typical day at SF consists of cold calling, answering telephone, and quoting and binding. My co-workers are easy to get along with and we look out for one another. The hardest part of the job would definitely be the cold, making hundreds of call only quote one to three people is tough. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people daily and providing a service that helps."
good,Mostly 9-5 with some nights for prospecting. Small office can be tough to getaway and complete tasks. A lot of community interaction due to the name.
good,"When I came into this position as a receptionist. Started with basic payments, customer questions and would look for possible up-sells to send to the other sells representatives. As time passed I began picking up more responsibilities which led to me preparing and getting my Property and Casualties License. That led me to start selling State Farm Products myself as well as help with claims. I also began reconciling the all State Farm Transactions. This was actually a different experience. It was a small office with about 3-5 other employees. Management was tough on us to meet goals but I just helped to build a team environment. We all help each other reach our goals. My favorite part of this job was when I was able to help a customer get through a tough claim from start to beginning. It was rewarding to see their happiness and that I was able to get them there. The hardest part would be when I saw that a customer would leave us. Not because we were a bad agency but because we couldn't match their premiums to what they could afford."
good,I enjoyed working at State Farm daily speaking with customers over the phone. I have learned how to personalize conversations with policy holders by providing them with a caring seamless interaction. Management was always available to help advance your career. My team and I were supportive of each other and focused on the goal at hand. The hardest part of the job was not being able to fully commit to the customer and their needs because others were in need of assistance. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to be self productive under little supervision.
good,Work/Life balance is good; if you have a doctor's appointment you can leave to go to it & come back.   There are celebrations for your anniversary and birthdays.
good,"Come in review voice mails and emails that may have been left the night and or weekend prior. Follow -up on internet quotes, and calls that I made to multi-line.  Depending on the day a sales meeting.  Then I review my sales to see where I am in regards to obtaining my monthly goals.  I have learned that its takes patience and I have to continue to put the work in to get the results I want.  Management is cool as we are a close knit office.  My co-workers we all try to assist one another as much as possible, without stepping on toes.  The hardest part of the job would be at times the cold calling.  There are  new relationship that have to be formed and  re-established.  As well as trust that may have been loss with prior companies. However, it just teaches me how to be there for each and every client.  As there are individuals with different needs that need to be met."
good,"Customer Service Representative"
good,Great team members and positive environment. A fast paced office but went beyond customer service in many instances and team members were willing to help others in the office despite a heavy workload. The agent often had lunch brought in for the team and overall provided strong leadership and motivation to reach goals.
good,"Typical day begins checking emails and responding to things that came in over night, answering and returning calls. Marketing to new business, as well as trying to sell additional policies to current customers. Management was very helpful. Co-workers very organized and hard-working, great communication. Hardest part of the job is stopping customers from cancelling policies due to premium increases. Most enjoyable part is helping customers in a time of distress and confusion."
good,"The staff was great to work with. I enjoyed helping provide daily home and auto quotes. A typical day at work for me was to open and close office,file paperwork,answer phones, help clients with open and closed claims on their accounts, and provide excellent customer service."
good,"Worked for an agent.  Small office.  No room for advancement.  Excellent educational meetings for team members.  Good work/life balance.  No benefits, small commissions.  Great customers."
good,"relaxed atmosphere, fortune 100 company with a strong history and strong future."
good,"State Farm is a great insurance company."
good,"Busy office, learned a lot about insurance, friendly people and co-workers, was a nice environment to work in.  Good job opportunities"
good,"Typical work days went fast, fast paced environment, great team work, highly motivated."
good,"Typical day of client interaction in a predominantly Hispanic market place. "
good,Overall great company great training;the hardest part of the job was the disconnect of upper management with process.
good,"My position responsibilities included assisting clients with their insurance needs. Upon request I would work up a quote of premium for various insurance products. i.e. auto, homeowners, flood, life and health products as well as banking products such as Certificates of deposit, checking and savings accounts, auto loans and revolving credit accounts."
good,"I began working at State Farm in September 2014. To date, the experience has been great. The training has been some of the best I've experienced over my 25+ years of working. My only issue is that the position is part-time with a low hourly wage. Based on the information shared in training and the overall production expectations, this position is grossly underpaid."
good,"Part-time service agent, 8:30 to 12:30, check beginning of day activities on State Farm website, check in box for documents that need to be mailed for signatures, attached signed documents to computer files and sent to Corp. office, made necessary collections calls, notated all mailings in computer for each individual and completed all daily activities required.I learned some basics of State Farm insurance practices."
good,A great company a lot of products offered. Coworkers are awesome not too much room to grow though. No room to advance in salary wise.
good,Excellent place to work especially If you are looking for an environment which provides ample space and time to experiment with new things and learn new things.
good,Like any other office environment it can get very repetitive. That's why I try to call as many customers and show interest in helping each of them individually by building a relationship with them.
good,The work line was always open for new projects. The hardest part was learning the training. They trained for about a week or 2 then sent you to the floor.
good,Busy during peak time.  Absolutely dead during slow seasons - all three of them.
good,as long as you have a great manager then you are able to advance
good,"A typical day at state farm would involve me doing service work. I would check underwriting emails to see what needs to be done and communicate with my other co-workers to help them get the work load finished. Also i would scan and attach documents to the insureds policies. I would try to accomplish my day by working towards closing 2-3 bank loans everyday. At the end of the day i would finish by doing the ""bank"" which involved me counting the cash drawer and dropping the money bag off at the bank."
good,"My position took place in a ""new, just starting office"".  There is a big push on life insurance and also your typical weekly one on one.  3/4 people in an office max."
good,"Completed applications for the underwriting process for Auto, Home, Personal Articles and Life.  Serviced and maintained client’s accounts to prevent lapse in coverage. Gathered personal information for insurance quotes for new and existing business.  Posted money to the appropriate client account to prevent gaps in coverage.

good,"cold calling, dealing with customers, greeting them and discussing new policies changes and life insurance."
good,"I loved working at State Farm, I loved my boss, she helped me out so much and learned so much about insurance."
good,Working at State Farm is a fun experience. The culture and work environment is one the best ones i have experienced in my short career. The only problem is the compensation is relatively low. Thew commission strusture is not as good as I hoped.
good,"Training: On-boarding activities were a blur. HR did not appear to have all there ducks in a row and could not answer the simplest questions from the trainees. "
good,"At State Farm, day by day, i learn how to deal with every single customer in a complete different attitude. every person is unique in their own way. i love the atmosphere and the team work in tackling complex situations"
good,This is a strong Mutual Insurance company that focuses on the customer.  Decisions are made with the customer in mind.
good,"Working for the State Farm call center has a lot of job security. Do your job and everything works out fine. They aren't very flexible with regards to balancing the home/work life. Your schedule is set in stone. That is until they do shift bids. If you don't have the seniority (years working there) you'll end up with the worst of the available schedules. However, you can bypass this with excellent work performance and high ratings from your supervisor. The job is moderately difficult but can be done with training and practice."
good,Each day was challenging trying to sell insurance products. Success required hard work which was rewarding.
good,State Farm is a great place to work and I have had many opportunities. The company is going through many changes which makes it hard to know if your job will be moving somewhere else or not.
good,"Customer service, sales, office management, bookkeeping, applications,  "
good,"Working at State Farm Insurance was a great way to learn the ropes in an office environment. I learned the essentials on clerical work that I will be able to carry with me in my future jobs. My daily routine involved answering phone calls, doing service work for the agent, faxing certificates of insurance, handle customer billing, email internal and external customers, and answer customer's inquiries regarding their coverages."

good,"A typical day normally would consists of administrative and clerical duties. Creating individual profiles for potential clients. Inputting all required information so that customers receive accurate quotes for property, casualty, life & health insurance."
good,Fun environment with lots of caring people and tons of support.  The hard part of the job is being on the phone and the most enjoyable is to help others get thru a tough situations with a smile.
good,"State Farm is a great company and their agents are very dedicated to both the Company and the clients. "
good,"People-oriented"
good,"If the compensation and subsequent job security would have been better I would have loved this work.  As it turned out, agents struggled and often ran into hard times where staff needed to be limited. The company did a great job at training staff."
good,I have learned how to handle the most irate customers in this industry while maintaining your composure. Selling is a must in this job field and you must know how to manage your time wisely. Management can be a bit tough a times but what management isn't. My co-workers there are excellent and I enjoy going to work and working with them. The competition in this industry would be the hardest part of this job and knowing how to overcome particular obstacles. Closing the sale is by far the most enjoyable moment of the day.
good,Everyday is differant than the day before.  Helping cusomers is the most rewarding part of the day. 
good,"Collect policy holder’s payments, responding to inquiries, resolving problems and correcting policy errors. Provided quotes and executed online policy changes for auto, home and excess liability, conduct medical history interviews."
good,"Awesome benefits, work environment and managers are very supportive!"
good,"A typical day at work would be marketing insurance products to policyholders. I would set appointments with them to go over their policies and help them to find their insurance needs. I have my Property & Casualty, Life & health licenses. The hardest part of my job was selling State Farm Bank products. I worked extremely well with co-workers and management. Rarely if ever is there a conflict. The most enjoyable part of my job was showing people their insurance needs and helping to protect their assets."
good,Good experience. Great company values. Compensation based in sales production; you can qualify for extra bonus.
good,"SF has many opportunities through its diverse operations and locations all over North America. Unfortunately, sometimes it is difficult to navigate a career path through the layers of corporate maze."
good,"Typical day a work entails answering customer calls, investigating issues as it relates to technical inquires. By working to actively resolve business partner’s queries by using corporate documented procedures and escalating to the appropriate support areas. I have learned valuable lessons in handling various types of customers, both internal and external. Gained important critical thinking skills, as well as developed investigative acumen to quickly identify areas of concern and work to resolve them. Working in a team environment enable to be collaborating with tea members to develop solutions, create new workflows, and work as a single unit to advance the companies goals. The most challenging part of the job, while at the same time most rewarding part is keeping up with the pace of change, adapting to new work requirements and thinking quickly."
good,Required to answer phones and help customers in any situation they are in. Make and follow up on any changes to their policies. Suggest better ways of savings and coverages.

good,"This is a good stable company, although it's hard to move up in leadership."
good,"With a decent pay compensation and and a stable company, I feel State Farm is an excellent employer. There are many advancement opportunities once you get in the door, however its all in who you know."
good,"Worked part time while in college. Completed office work, answer phones, and updated database. If interested in insurance, this may be a great opportunity for you."
good,Worked M-F 9-5. Very fast paced and non-stop e-mails and phone calls. Loved it. But State Farm decided they did not want to write insurance (even car insurance) in S. Florida and 35% of Agents retired in 2010. Went independent and have loved the experience.
good,They claim to be flexible but not so much. Management claims open door policy but not so open. Too many changes and no one on same page. Co-workers are great.
good,"Good company benefits, training is done by exceptional team from Illinois corporate department, co workers are good and friendly, lunch times were recently cut from one hour to 30 mins, and due to the economy, recent cut backs and lay offs have taken place."
good,"On a typical day I would log into my computer, send out letters to clients with over due payments. I also scan documents into the computer for the other ladies in the office. I mostly answer phones, and/or take messages and take payments throughout the day. Here I learned how to deal with different people. I interact with the clients, helping them with what I can. My co-workers help me when I am stuck. They tell me when I do something wrong to help me correct it for the next time. The hardest part of the job is sometimes remembering old messages or names of the clients, for that reason I jot down all information said to me. The most enjoyable part of the job is answering the phones and taking payments."
good,My typical day as a first line leader in a production environment involves interacting with not only me team but employees in the whole department to ensure service level targets are met. I lead a group of paraprofessional/support level employees through performance management and environment management while establishing new direction. I lead or participate in department or company projects as well. State Farm is a very family oriented company with a positive environment.
good,Provides you with a variety of areas to gain skills and knowledge in.
good,"a typical call center, on phones all day helping people with bad situations. very fulfilling"
good,"I enjoy taking care of customers safety, needs, sales and their continued value as a State Farm policy holder."
good,Overall a good company to work for. Slow to react to technogoly advancements. Very political.
good,I worked 3rd shift running updates on over 20000 servers.  Sometimes there were no issues and other times there were.  It was challenging yet fun to work to resolve the issues.
good,"very friendly co workers, working days and hours were no problem management was very lenient and understanding. One hour lunch was a plus able to go market whenever."
good,"The first thing that I do in my job is to call the customers that have pending payments , It is part of my daily task , than I continue with the sales tasks , quotes , appointments , etc . what I enjoy most about my job is interact with the people and at the same time help them meet their needs."
good,Customer service is extremely important given the amount to tough conversations to be had. The best part about the job is the schedule stability. There is a lot of material to help familiarize you with the brand and the products.
good,"The company promotes and rewards employees for continuing their industry education."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, however, it was not a job I was satisfied with. I did not like trying to push to sell people more insurance than they could viable afford."
good,State Farm was helpful in accessing customers needs. They are a top rated insurance provider and are great with customer service. They provide training.
good,I love that State Farm is insurance and a Bank its the best of both worlds. I get to do new loans as well as refinancing and helping people in many aspects of their lives.
good,"Typically 9-5, working some Saturdays depending on client needs. If you're a good performer, eventually you can approach State Farm for the opportunity to own an agency."
good,Not so much advancement. Did not like the point system because life happens and they did not care about Dr notes. Couldn’t be late any more than 6 mins or you’ll get a point. Some were good employees and got let go because of points.
good,It was a lot of I formation starting off but they pay for all your licenses to be an adjuster and give you a couple months training before you hit the floor.
good,"I lived for the challenge of being the best so this job was great for me. As long as you can communicate with your clients and dont sell policies that clients dont need, this is a great place to work!"
good,"Current Employer"
good,Management needs to be reviewed closer in how they document coaching and training to maintain a fair work environment. Coaching should be signed off on by the employee to confirm the discussions were had
good,"State Farm was a good company - initially family oriented with flexibility and good benefits.  A diverse company where inclusion was a priority. Over time, the company transitioned. In 2019, the auto claims operation in Northern California relocated out of state."
good,"I will always be thankful for the opportunities, experience, and pay that I was blessed with while at State Farm Insurance.  Like most large companies, numerous changes were made in the last several years.  That included the closing of the office where I worked for 32+ years."
good,"It really depends on your agent and team members. I was lucky and got a good agent who pays decently and we have leads. Some days its slow, some days its fast. Unfortunately I Need more money in my life so i will have to leave."
good,"Working there was a good experience, the training was above and beyond good. The environment is good depending on your department management usually never around unless you schedule meeting with your own manager. When the company isn’t doing well as a whole they tend to treat employees like slaves. First two years was amazing after wasn’t but good work place none the less."
good,"Well wont let me advance without this, if you don't mind cold calls and getting yelled at by customers for it then this is the job for you............."
good,"Good company to work for depending on the owner of course! Their goals are unrealistic specially as a team, if everyone is not going to be putting in the work."
good,"Some days the calls are back to back can be tiring, mandatory Saturdays when you 1st start, maybe a few years in you will get them off. The employees really try and liven up the work environment, it helps. Good benefits with part time."
good,"fun, easy learning, and a productive working environment. challenges you every time you come in to be your best at work and work hard. friendly co workers and helpful staff."
good,"Most of the job was interacting with customers and contractors on the phone, and keeping notes. Making sure to adhere to state laws and the customer's policy."
good,"Good company with a lot of perks. Sometimes the sales field can get stressful though. The compensation is good, but can be better. The only thing I didn't like was there was no retirement or medical benefits."
good,I would answer phones and write down messages. I would have a list of names around the area to sell or upgrade there insurance. I would invest more time in selling life insurance.
good,"great culture, awesome company, long hours and prices are not competitive compared to the marketplace. made it difficult to sell policies when I could not compete."
good,"State Farm is a wonderful company to work for. Your teams are like family and they band together to make target deadlines. I learned how to influence through multiple forms of communication to meet desired outcomes. Management has been different since the big shake up that occurred awhile back, they are more involved in the work and this has caused some priority confusion for teams. The hardest part of the job is like most everywhere else- how to meet the needs and multiple demands within a set time frame. Managing stakeholders and multiple priorities can be difficult but in the end when Agile and Scrum are done right- the end results are worth the struggles."
good,"Quick pace and a lot to keep up with. Requires lots of training, but provides you with great skills. Benefits are very good but strict time management and schedule adherence is required. Pretty much have to plan time off a year ahead and your hours/days can easily change which disrupts work/life balance."
good,"A typical day at work is getting there, pulling up your various systems. You check your schedule to see if you're scheduled to phones or tasks. You complete the day as normal. Extremely repetitive, but you learn something new daily. Learning there are a lot of logistics and legalities within insurance, and the fines are outrageous. Very relaxed culture... a little too relaxed. Like can come in pajamas and house shoes relaxed. Hardest part of y job is knowing what I put up with everyday and only making 17.25 lol. The most enjoyable aspect of my job is that we are not micromanaged"
good,"I worked for more than one agent so each office runs differently. At my last agent's office, I worked full time. I learned a lot from both the agent (4 year agent) and my coworker (25 years with State Farm). The hardest part of my job was seeing my customers upset after a loss, whether it was a theft, accident, total loss or loss of a family member. The most enjoyable part was seeing the customer happy."
good,"It's a decent job but not a career unless you start your own agency. It's just like any other job, it has it's pros and cons. They key is to find the right agency and culture that fits your liking."
good,"Good Company going through lots of changes. Overall the management I worked for were good people. "
good,"Working in the Ballston Spa OC was wonderful. Great co-workers; Great Managers. My last 2 Managers there were fairand helped me to succeed."
good,Good company overall. Good pay. Micro managed in all depts & numbers are the basis for the company. But that most companies.  But good company overall. Great benefits & meet good people. Learned a great deal. Great opportunities for advancement within company.
good,The pay and culture was adequate but the advancement opportunities were not always clear. The way in which they formed teams was positive. I truly felt my team had my back.
good,this a fast-paced and ever-changing job. Taking time off may be somewhat of a hassle at times. Good health benefits as well as 401K and life insurance.
good,Overall good company and great employees. The manager on my team always talked about the many ways people could be fired so it made it stressful at times.
good,"Call center work. You get out what you put in. Work when you're scheduled, don't mess around, and you'll do just fine. Room for advancement and great benefits."
good,"Good for introducing yourself to the insurance industry, but the pay compensation should reflect the cost of living and the stressful demands of the job. Moving up isn't easy when there is a freeze on your department."
good,"I had worked for State Farm for 33 years in the claims department handling auto claims. It's a very stressful position at times. Recent changes have not affected the job positively for Adjusters.  Our office closed due to restructuring."
good,"Besides work politics great place to work and good benefits including a pension, which most companies no longer offer. The rules and regulations can be strict and unyielding."
good,"I enjoyed working for State Farm in the earlier years.  Then management decided to relocate many of the positions to other locations."
good,"I'm not a salesman. It was a good office with good culture, but the type of work was not for me. I don't like reaching out to my friends for sales, but my co workers strongly advised it."
good,"I had a marketing internship with State Farm. It was good experience, cold calling and onsite marketing. The Agent I worked with was fantastic, really got me bought into the State Farm culture."
good,Very difficult job once the company announced the office would be closing.  Many employees moved or left leaving the remaining employees behind with a very large work load.
good,State Farm moving into differrnt direction with staff. Need to be able to adapt to new systems and processes. Each office differs in management styles. Very little training when you come into the door. Lots of hands on training and modules. Always look for offices that reimburse for licensing fees.
good,"The opportunity is there if you're willing to relocate and sacrifice.  The culture isn't what it once was, but that is mainly due to the competitive market and the pressure to be as lean as possible."
good,"Working in the call center isn’t easy. Customers can rip you to shreds and they monitor/grade your calls. Can get “failed calls” and the smallest mistakes. Coworkers are great, and depending on your team, management can be good. Pay is great for cost of living."
good,"I found it a fine place to work and enjoyed it for several years.  However, it became a bit of a bore and I wanted a new challenge and to move back to my home town."
good,great place to work but not for everyone. need to be able to call and talk to people all day. sales keep it exciting but all depends on the agent and how they run the business.
good,"I basically run the office at the moment. My boss is out of town. I have one co-worker currently. I take payments, explain coverages, help with billing questions. I add auto's deal with complaints, help customers find products they need. I assist in claims, answer phones, balance the drawer and have trained many employees in my 6 year career. The hardest part of my job is when I can't cover a claim for an insured. The best part of my job has been the friendships I have made with co-workers and customers."
good,As a State Farm Sales Representative you can expect nothing but the best from this company! You will spend around 3-6 acquiring your Insurance License and training to transition to the floor. The only cons I would say is that the point system for attendance is no joke!
good,"company is going through a restructuring, most of jobs are being moved to 4 locations.  For the most part if you are in the 4 locations there are a lot of opportunities for entry level."
good,Beautiful facility to work in. Mortgage industry is stressful so having a great office to work in with nice break rooms really helps. People were great!
good,"I really enjoyed working for State Farm. I would go in at 12 noon to 5:00 PM. I learned several things with the insurance business, about the different coverage, how to cancel vehicles from a policy if they were having a replacement then I would forward it to the manager or the other agent. The manager was a fair man. The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with our customers, I enjoy working with people and helping them the best I can."
good,it is what you make it. the most important aspect is to build and maintain relationships. from my experience its about who know rather than the work you put in.
good,"Some Managers micro manage, Most don't.IT all depends what manager you get. They allow you to switch your schedule with other people which makes it really convenient."
good,Great coworkers and management who handle a large volume of claims daily.  Many different departments available for employment opportunities and advancement opportunities especially if you are mobile.
good,"Technological advances causing constant change within the organization, with many staff reductions over the past several years. The company as a whole is forward thinking when it comes to diversity and inclusion and constantly encourages their employees to be the best version of themselves.  They offer on-site community college classes, tuition reimbursement, 401k AND a pension plan, and much more in the form of benefits."
good,"Nice company to work for. I have enjoyed my time with State Farm."
good,I have been satisfied as an agent employee and have learned a lot working as an agent employee. I have worked for State Farm since 1996 and have felt very loyal towards this company.
good,I enjoyed my 24 years at this company however they were making too many changes in my department and making too many demands for me.  I was offered a severance package and took the option to leave and retire early vs. stay and work with the drastic changes.  They conflicted with my values.
good,"My experience was, if you're willing to relocate every few years you could have a very long career at State Farm.  They are continually reevaluating their office locations and work distribution between the offices; your location and/or job function has to be flexible for longevity.  Management was fair and evaluations and raises were consistent.  Their benefits were pretty good, but nothing you really can't find at other employers.  Their pay scale is definitely below the market."
good,Not a bad work environment. My agent was great and she was very accommodating. Corporate priced themselves out of the market so it became impossible to compete and my income suffered.
good,"Every State Farm agency is independently owned, and the work experience varies on the Agent/Owner. This position is excellent for those looking to get in the insurance business however because you are an employee of the independent agent rather than State Farm there may not be room for advancement."
good,"````It's fairly simple job, training could be better, management is very helpful and understanding, you work independently and as a team. Great work/life balance."
good,"Restructuring of the Administrative services department resulted in the Facilities maintenance being outsourced. I opted to take severance rather than competing for a position that o was not interested in. "
good,Prospecting & writing insurance business. Employees were super competitive and proved to be a challenging environment because if you wanted to retain a client's business then you must be there each day and guard your sale.. It was a lack of good management and not being the right fit that caused me to seek other employment. State Farm is an excellent company to work for. If sales is your forte and you are self disciplined and motivated then this is the place to be.There are strict guidelines to moving up in the company and to gain your own agency. They do offer paid training and invest in your success. I recommend this position for college students majoring in Marketing.
good,I worked for an agent of State Farm. Days can be stressful but easy to deal with because my boss and coworkers would help. Each agent runs their office differently.
good,"Great company to work for. Lots of opportunities to move up into leadership roles. Fairly flexible schedules, my office had a set schedule. Fast paced. There is always something to do"
good,"Company just went through a big transition. Many positions were terminated and others were downsized.  Operation Hubs closed.  Some people took the transition hard and left, but Severance was offered to those who would stay till the last day of October 31, 2018.  Others were selected to move to another office either out of state or out of town. "
good,"It had a lot of space for you to make your own decisions and choices to help yourself make money. You really work for yourself, so its very self driven."
good,"The office environment it was really good, great team, but they do not give the opprotunity to demonstrate your abilities, and the customer service interrelationship."
good,"Was ok place to work. People were  usually very friendy. Had lots of opportunity to move and meet great leaders. Buildign HUB locations so if working in a centralized location in one of the 4 cities appeal to you, SF is a nice place to work."
good,State Farm really focused on employee development and transferrable skills. State Farm provided my with the skills to be successful. The management structure was excellent. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendships I made with my co-workers. The State Farm culture is one of the best in today's workforce.
good,"Overall, it was a great starting experience for broadening my horizon with sales. They have a lot of products and options to make a prospect a client/customer but most of what you'll do is quote auto insurance."
good,It is a family setting with great people around me.  Going into work each and every day made it very enjoyable working with my co-workers.  I enjoyed building the friendships and accomplishing many projects with my various teams.
good,The work environment is very stressful and not worth you are getting paid for. It's definetily not for everyone and I wouldn't recommend someone who can't handle customers to work there.
good,"A typical day is getting about a half hour to do email before getting into phone system.  Once phones are ringing, it is normally non stop all day.  The types of calls taken on a daily basis vary and can be an easy questions to a very complicated call that takes research to determine what is needed to solve the problem.  Management is very receptive to new ideas."
good,"During my work day at State Farm, I answered incoming calls, handled property damage total loss for approximate 10 different states.  The hardest part of my job was telling people they didn't have the necessary coverage to process their property claims.  The most enjoyable part of my job, was being able to explain the claim process and handling claims to the end.  I learned from this job not take what people say about you personally and I learned how to understand what people are going through during the claim process.  My main goal was to help people recover from the unexpected after all that's what we did."
good,I enjoyed my time at State Farm most of the time. I met some lifelong friends that I still talk to this day. We were there more than we are with our families so we became close to each other. The company started off great but towards the end of my tenure it started going thru a lot of changes and people were losing their jobs thru relocations and it started becoming micromanaged with work force. Time clocks were enforced and lunches and breaks were determined by work force.  Time off became an issue as well. The morale started to decrease because of such.
good,"Enjoyed working for the company, and loved the people I worked with. My co-workers were like family to me. Culture was fast-paced, competitive, but relaxing at times. There were a few challenges along the way, but worked through them with my team."
good,Stressful because of sales goals (which are hard to hit because State Farm's rates are so much higher than the competition) but it helped my sales skills which positioned me for better opportunities in the future.
good,People were great - lots of change in workforce numbers so very stressful.  Good Benefits and work life balance although working from home was not an option.
good,"I worked with them for 4 years. I loved it in the beginning. The job itself is not hard. However, for me the work balance was no longer pleasing once they got rid of paid vacation, sick time and personal time.  In addition, to being able to borrow up to 1,000.00 which helped with my credit score. Although, this may be the perfect job for someone else. Just not for me after those changes.  But I ALWAYS recommend State Farm. Overall,  excellent company with career advancement especially at the hubs."
good,"Great place to work as a team, not the best place for unexperienced insurance agents as the goals seem a little too high for the amount of actual time in office and time working in this field."
good,appreciated my immediate supervisors and team members.  Had a generous tuition reimbursement program.  Good employees throughout local office.  Were very sorry when our local office closed down departments and is in process of moving out of the area.
good,My time at State Farm was enjoyable. I had many great co-workers. State farm was a great place to work for. State of the at equipment. Highest labor rate in he industry. A great place to work for.
good,"State Farm is a great organization to work for. There are pros and cons, like any other organization, but ultimately the pros outweigh the cons.  I would recommend them."
good,Been with the company for 16 years and going thru immense changes. Only advancement is within hub locations. Expect changes to benefits to be coming soon.
good,"Typical day at work consist of making outbound phone calls to clients. State Farm is a very quick pace environment with making policy changes, updating account, processing payments, and underwriting changes. State Farm overall is a great place to work!"
good,"Worked with a great agent. Work environment was great. Did not get benefits like medical, paid vacation and pay is low. You get to help people in insurance."
good,Relaxed yet professional place to work. Great place for leadership development and career development. However pay is typically below industry average.
good,The people and location I worked with was very positive and helpful. The tools they provided to do your job were outstanding and  very helpful. Lots of close restaurants near by too.
good,"Not a lot of chance for advancement for new people as they close offices around the country they are saving any open roles for people transferring from the closing location. It is good for them to insure people can keep jobs and avoid laying off, however, it does not leave a lot of opportunity for new people to advance."
good,"Great company to work. Very good environment, company mission is closely follow in corporate level. Unfortunately business model in sales changed, so income was affected, that was the only reason I left the company"
good,This is a great company and good learning experience for insurance. The training is extensive however the pay raises are great. The people are great to work with
good,Learned a great deal about process evaluation and project implementation. Developed strong skills in communications and training presentations. Worked in a variety of areas that increased my understanding of the enterprise.
good,Great place to learn how to communicate with customers and help customers meet their needs. Always an opportunity to become a State Farm agent if you save well and perform well.
good,"A typical day includes many changes in the training environment. We are currently in the process of modernization of all training material. This includes creating on demand and virtual training. I have learned that you have to be flexible to change in order to stay at the top. The environment has been stressful due to reorganization related to change. I love my job, but have made a decision to not relocate. I have relocated 3 times in the last 12 years."
good,"A typical day started at 7am and ended at 6pm. At State Farm I worked Auto Express, BI, Weather Express and Total Loss. I was trained for each position. The work environment was well structured and maintained. The most enjoyable part of my jobs was leaning something new. The hardest part of my job was also learning new task and executing them into my day to day work.  I like working for State Farm. I found it to be a well organized professional company with managers that worked to assist and make you successful in your role. I felt very safe and comfortable working for State Farm because of the companies reputation and my own experience with them as a policy holder."
good,A typical day at work consisted of me being on calls all day reading from word tracks verbatim and waiting for my breaks to come up. For the most part it was an easy day except when it was busy those days could be very draining. If u were as efficient at ur job as I was you would get bored easily
good,State Farm has been through a lot of changes in the last five years of me working there. They still have the benefits of secure work environment but the some other things have changed. They have moved from a employee based workplace to a numbers based workplace. The new CEO is a bottom line type of business man and only cares about the profit. In my time spent there I was able to move through three different positions in three years once he came into the position the company started implementing hiring freezes on internal positions until those positions were caught up with the numbers there departments were responsible at meeting.
good,Provide new employees with great training and classes to attend to become a better sales person.  The people you meet thru the phone are really supportive and can guide you the best.
good,"State farm is a good place to work, the best part is sitting down and relaxing. I learned about the computer system and its ways, I also learned that its a good community there."
good,i do not wish to write a review for State Farm. Everyone's experience will be different. I will say it was a pleasure working at State Farm.  No complaints.
good,"Beware of management. If you're anti-social, this isn't the environment for you. Training is fast-paced. Compensation was very nice, and the PTO was nice too....just don't use it"
good,"State Farm is a really good company to get your feet wet in the Insurance industry. With the company being a leading Property and Casualty company, you get a lot of experience in sales and how to communicate effectively with customers. Overall though if you want to advance you need to work for Corporate."
good,Typical day is working with current clients and brining new ones in. not too stressful. don't have to worry about work once you leave. hardest part is making sure you are hitting your numbers. good team like environment
good,Jobs are being centralized in three hubs and corporate.  Causing many to loose jobs or move to a job they are not sure of.  Many workers discontent from worrying about future.  causing tension in work place.
good,The insurance agent test was super hard so study up. However management was great and good environment to work in. The difficult time was customers but that is to be expected because you are dealing with the finances of other people
good,"I enjoyed going into work. Unfortunately, I had to relocate to California to have emergency carpal  tunnel surgery on my right hand. I really enjoyed working  for State farm and really hate that I had to part from my unit."
good,State Farm is solid company that focuses on family and community. Overall it provides competitive benefits and helps to position it's employees for growth.
good,its fun place to work. people here are great overrall its great workplace environment. great management with good working hours with great carrer advancement.
good,"I loved working for State Farm. I really enjoyed CityLine. I enjoyed the pay and benefits. However, I had to leave the company due to Medical reasons and did not have enough short term."
good,I would rather not comment specifically on the day to day work life because I hold a position that is unlike any other at State Farm and the value my opinion provides wouldn't travel into any other position you may be applying to.
good,"No pressure/friendly work culture"
good,I enjoyed working for State Farm overall but When the Tacoma Office closed there was no reasonable options for me to stay with the company. Management and benefits are great
good,I enjoyed working at State Farm.  The environment was decent.  It was extremely hard to advance though.  My only issues were the pay and the lack of benefits.
good,I started as an office assistant in a State Farm office. From then on I advanced to learning more about insurance and its inner-workings. I found great insight learning to ensure that I protected myself by purchasing life insurance sooner rather than later.
good,enjoyed working there. very busy workday. learned a lot about insurance. poor management but it was a fun environment. the hardest was pleasing the boss. the best part was helping customers.
good,I worked in a call center environment handling auto mobile claims.  The work for the most part was fine but often mundane and boring.  There were of course the usual stresses of working with the public who can be particularly testy when it comes to their damaged car.  Management seems competent however vertical mobility seems slow.
good,Fast pace work environment. High volume work load which required you to be able to multitask in order to keep up with the high volume of claims that needed to be processed.
good,"State Farm offers a sponsorship to those of in my major at Mansfield University. They offer computers and printers to the students of Mansfield, and also provide job opportunities."
good,"Great Place to work, great benefits, no weekends. They treat you like family, laid back company, they do have a point system, which you have to use a time clock."
good,"I have really enjoyed my time working at State Farm so far!"
good,State Farm was a good opportunity to learn the business and how to sale insurance. If a person was to put in enough time and have some income saved there would be a chance to start your own agency.
good,"This is a great place to work, but working at the office and be a part of agent's office doesn't give you health benefits. You  learn how to help customers in a claim situations."
good,"The philosophy at State Farm is to provide exceptional customer service and focusing on resolving every call and claim in a timely, prompt, accurate and friendly way."
good,"I'd work for State Farm any day of the week.  Great company, large in scale, many opportunities for the right individual.  Unless you already have something awesome going on, take a job with State Farm and I believe you could be happy.  I'd work with State Farm again without hesitation.  Quality Group of folks."
good,"Fast Paced, Micromanaged time and quality of service given to our customers."
good,"Repaired laptops and peripherals , worked alone. Great feedback from concerns I had about certain locations. Not too many bad things to say as I was always on the move"
good,"My typical day at work is logging into the system, assisting existing  clients, prospects or any leads for sales. pretty much its a daily routing if i am not out of the office cold canvassing. co-workers are very friendly."
good,"I used to LOVE my job at State Farm, but recent years, they have been trying to restructure, a lot of people are losing their jobs and a lot of us are unsure if we will have a job in the next few months."
good,"Standard call center environment, very customer based. Only reason for leaving is due to operations center closing and relocation is unavailable for all employees."
good,"Unfortunately, the company is relocating to accommodate the 24hour customer needs and the employees are suffering because of it. Offices are being closed and relocated in many different areas of the United States causing great employees with lots of experience to either retire early, or leave the company altogether. It is not the company it used to be, but they still offer a lot more benefits than most companies."
good,The time spent at State Farm was beneficial to my future as they provided many free training courses and education to give you the best product knowledge and ability to close the sale.
good,"It was an over all good experience , Fast passed and sometimes difficult to deal with customers who are not satisfied in what services they were provided especially when dealing with claims ."
good,I worked there for 15 years in many departments which had nothing to do with insurance.  I loved my job until my department was consolidated and moved to another state.
good,"StateFarm is a really great company to work for. However, the overall Call Center environment is somewhat exhausting. StateFarm has great principles, pay, and room for growth for employees coming straight out of college."
good,"A lot of changes at all levels, which seemed chaotic at times.  A decision to relocate a group of people only to job eliminate them within 12 months later.  This lead to a deteriating workplace."
good,"I was an intern for one summer at an agent's location (not corporate).  Daily, I answered incoming calls, helped the sales staff and the claims staff, as well as ran the front desk."
good,I was a good part time job I had while I waited for college to start back up. I only had the real job of helping customers with their payments and answering phone calls.
good,State farm is a great employer. They offer competitive salaries with great benefits and discounts to other vendors. marta train station and shuttle bus services are available. the point system is a little to strict. Its not very flexible with life events or Public transportation is suspended.
good,"The environment was ideal.  The staff were very friendly and helpful. However,  there were no benefits and the pay was very low.  It was expected to work a three person job with one person.  Pros:  the training was top notch."
good,Call center environment is improved by management staff and adequate staffing.  There are also a number of ancillary perks and overall a beautiful work environment make this an enjoyable job. 
good,"Great pay, company, and compensation. Competitive market and ability to excel far into company. Friendly people and very supportive in all walks of life."
good,"I would recommend this job to anyone seeking a job in the Insurance or Business Sector or college students seeking a flexible, temporary job while in school. Great benefits, and the company will pay for secondary education (Associate, Bachelor, Master, Insurance Designation Degrees) for approved majors (mostly business oriented). State Farm does not pay for science majors. PTO is added to PTO bank every other week. There are three PTO banks: Community Service PTO, Development PTO, and regular PTO. Great company focused on providing excellent customer service!"
good,"Possible career advancement, not as fast as promised. Supervisors are never at work. Does not hold to promises made in training. You can move around though since it is a large company. Lateral moves are easy, Advancement not so much"
good,It was an interesting and challenging introduction working claims in an entry level position in the Initial Loss Reporting Department taking first notice of loss in a team environment with quality personnel receiving calls from the entire country which made it enjoyable part of the job talking to different cultures of people in different claims situations that I could help them with.
good,"a lot of banking training/knowledge required, rapid changes in procedures, team environment, two 15 minute paid breaks and a 45 minute unpaid lunch in a 8.5 hour schedule (7.75 hours paid)"
good,State Farm is  a great place to work. The only downside is that you have to bid twice a year for shifts and this time around they completely reconfigured the shifts and essentially wiped out the shifts I (and others) wanted. So there was not even similar shifts available. (normally worked 11am to 930pm for 4 days and best shift available for the shift differential was 430pm to 1am for 5 days). The attendance policy is strange as you get the same amount of penalty points for being a half hour late as you do for just calling in for the day. But you do get two grace absences every six months. There is a shift swap board as well. The benefits are fantastic! I only look for work elsewhere in fear that the next shift I am assigned I will not be able to make being 30 miles from work and I always sign up for a shift that avoids horrible Atlanta traffic.
good,"Good place to learn lot of new things on work, new experience, gaining new skills, know how to dealt with new people. Fun and excited place to work with"
good,The company culture is changing.  You will be most successful if you are flexible and are willing to relocate to various locations.
good,Great start with leaning of Insurance field. Awesome workplace environment and ability to move laterally within the company. Awesome paid  P&C Training
good,"State Farm was a great company to work for.  Great home work balance.  The company is great at supporting agents, and yo uare your own boss.  However, you still have to answer to State Farm on things you can and can't do.  You also do not own equity in your business.  So, if you are looking to sale your State Farm book of business you will not have that option."
good,"Can be very stressful at times and fast paced but not that great of pay for the amount of work done. I would recommend this job for someone who definitely does not mind a fast paced job. The office I work at is like this, but keep in mind that some offices are very slow-paced."
good,really depends on your manager. some managers will work for you and others will work against you. on phones all day. hardest part is dealing with so many personalities and remaining professional. Do not get sucked into the rumor trail
good,"I've worked at State Farm for almost 20 years. Great place to work and incredible people to work with. Great opportunities for advancement, educational growth and challenging opportunities."
good,"I really enjoyed working work. Very easy paced and comfortable. Everyone was very nice and friend, just an overall relaxed and welcoming environment. I did CSR work here."
good,"My review will be subjective because while I wasn't into having a sales position, the agent I worked for was a great person. I loved working for her. Under anyone else it would have been a bad fit for me but she saw my strengths and choose to utilize me differently. I would not apply for another State Farm job though unless it was a non-sales position."
good,This job pays very well and takes really good care of it's employees. The only drawback for me is overtime the calls wear you down. You can virtually leave whenever you want to once you get out of training which can be a good or a bad thing depending on how you use it. Their disciplinary system treats you like a number.
good,"My department does not offer much room for advancement or growth. This department is only a small percentage of the enterprise as a whole so this logic does make sense. Also without a degree it's often difficult to transfer to other departments, even without the lack of experience you may advance opposing to having a degree. When I was hired I looked forward to advancing within the company through my hard work and efforts but unfortunately I have pla toed due to lack of education. I have put in the effort to go back to school but my already high student loans I have has prevented this. The company does offer tuition assistance which is great, but you are then subject to the incumbency period. If something does work out that I am awarded to go back to school I will not pass up the opportunity. Overall great company, I love my supervisors support, and best benefits. Just can't afford to live."
good,Your experience will vary based on the agent you work with but the company is ethical and has a good model. You will help people and learn the industry but compensation is usually lower and the product is over priced which makes for a tough sell.
good,"The work is all wrapped up in quantity versus quality.  It makes it a very stress filled place to work.  Too much time spent sitting, fortunately have a sit/stand desk and areas to walk at breaktime."
good,I enjoyed the level of education and responsibility that came with my job.  Assisting clients with their insurance needs and claims was rewarding in and of itself.
good,Lack of on the job training and proper managing can be frustrating as a new employee. High expectations without proper training will lead to unfulfilled goals.
good,could be stressfull but over all it is a really good work environment. co workers are really friendly and helpful. they are really flexible with you and can work with you.
good,"Despite changes going on within the organization, it is a great place for young people to work.  Lots of opportunities for those willing to work hard and show their value."
good,This is a wonderful place to work unfortunately the distance is what's forcing me to look into another position/location. I would recommend anyone to work here.
good,"- Prepare to gain weight (they love to feed you)"
good,"States Farm has good diversity and offers opportunity  to advance. The workplace is ever changing with turnover . The culture is multi generational. What I liked best was the encouragement from management to try to advance to other department areas and their ongoing tools available to help you advance."
good,They offered job training prior to starting in my position to learn their policies and their systems which was nice so you didn't feel lost when you officially started your job!
good,"Great teams and people in general, middle management is better than most companies, although higher ups have unrealistic expectations. Repetitious, tedious at times, but enjoyed my experience thoroughly. Better if you know someone personally in management to get hired, or you fall in a target group they're looking to hire, otherwise you may bounce around from role to role if you're an external."
good,"I like working for State Farm. They are a good company and they treat their people well. If you want to move up, you will need to continue your education."
good,This position was a positive experience.  I enjoy working for the company and interfacing with the customers.  The support network was fantastic.  Interacting with claims and how the company handles them was also a positive experience.
good,"The company treats its employees well, the job environment is relaxed with a well balanced atmosphere. But has a large focus on metrics. Management is a hit or miss"
good,This job is very busy. You have to take calls and answer questions. Most things get passed to the agents. That's frustrating because you can't help people. It pays extremely well and gives great benefits. I couldn't deal with the outrageous requests of the company for a 5 minute or less phone call. Plus the shift didn't work with our family anymore.
good,"My time at State Farm was pretty nice, I enjoyed working along side of 29 other associates to help others get their cars repaired and rentals issued. I'm a great team player and I embraced my role. It was a surprise every day because you could have the calmest customer on one phone call and then you're next customer you could have all types of explicit language but it teaches patience and understanding"
good,The company has changed a lot in the six years I have been here and still changing. Work life balance is a struggles. Salary is good but could be better compared to other insurance companies.
good,"If you are seeking to work for a major company with okay benefits and a somewhat decent salary then this is the company for you."
good,"Great company to work for, tough to advance due to continued organizational changes.  The company is allowing many people who refuse to move to hang on to their positions while many eager and talented leaders are poised to advance."
good,"A good place to work if seeking schedule flexibility.  The job also offers security.  The downside maybe room for upward mobility, but no one knows what the future holds."
good,"I loved the people I worked with and the agent, however sitting behind a desk for 8+ hours a day just wasn't for me. State Farm is a good company though!"
good,I personally would not work for State Farm again just because of the fact I cannot stand the way people thought they could talk to you and treat you all because their premium went up $5.00.  The office I worked for though was very laid back and relaxed and my boss was one of the best Ive ever had.
good,Uplifting environment with high expectations for services. Equal opportunities to escalate throughout the company. Unlimited access to benefits and discounts.
good,"State Farm truly is a great place to work, work with good and professional people! Enjoyed my daily duties as a operations assistant, but I enjoyed more the work of operation of catastrophic disaster sites!"
good,Enjoyable workplace and room for learning and advancement in the workplace.   Continuous learning and meeting new people.  Every day is different and insurance is both a challenging and humbling career.
good,"Learned a lot in regarding insurance domain and using of different tools, Team meetings  so on "
good,Great place to work if you have the right manager. The first couple of managers I had were lovely and was a pleasure working with them. The last one on the other hand was bad enough to make me quit.
good,"If you are a good salesperson, you won't have a problem. If you do not like sales or do not reach your goals, the pay is not very good. It's a stressful environment."
good,This is a pleasant place to work but the monotony of the cubicle can become very dull and difficult to do each day. Advancing is not very easy with out being willing to relocate.
good,"As with most companies, things change; some for the best...some we wonder if it really is for the best.  You just have to be open for change and learn from the people you work with to broaden your mind and skill set.  My favorite part of job was talking and helping agents resolve problems and issue policies.  The hardest part was transitioning from personal contact with the agent to less and less contact."
good,"I worked at State Farm for nearly 27 years and recently retired.  From the start it was a demanding job but there was a sense of family and the company valued its people and worked to help them  grow and mature in their career."
good,"Started with the company way before migration and trained where quality of work was priority. ""Legacy years"" was not only fun, you worked hard and was rewarded well. You attended retirement breakfasts, holiday lunches, you even had team building activities and you enjoyed your job. There wasn't much pressure from management as long as you were doing your job correctly. You always had a sense of security there."
good,"Typical day in production is high stress and pressure to preform as much more as possible. Often given conflicting information between training and floor standards. Information changes RAPIDLY and often you are given no warning, emails, alerts or heads-up other than a kind co-worker whom hears through the grapevine and shares with you."
good,"State Farm is a good company for people who are interested in staying for 25+ years. They have a family oriented background and down-to-earth managers and executive directors. However, if you are young, you might find this place a bit mundane and very difficult in advancement."
good,Great place to work if you are interested in becoming an agent. Requires dedication and self motivation. I have learned how to deal with people.
good,Benefits and hours of the job have changed since I accepted the position.  Work with a small number of people but get to use my expert skills in the day to day.
good,You really have to make the experience yours. The agent also sets the environment so it all depends on the office and the people you work with.
good,"Overall, a nice company to work at. The people and environment are quite relaxed and helpful despite the systematic micromanagement in terms of scheduling and metrics. The training is quite long and helps to build that sense of camaraderie. "
good,Entry level jobs are difficult. Identifying goals is important for development and advancement. Multi levels of leadership and some management is within the Enterprise.
good,"I worked for State Farm Agent Kathy Weebe."
good,"I learned a lot about the world of insurance and how the business works. I really grew a lot from talking to people from business to business, trying to use by best sales pitch. A normal day at work was me simply checking into work and grabbing business cards then traveling to businesses and reaching out to the owners and employees."
good,"Cubical work, Micromanaged too much at times, but manageable. Its mostly just a call center environment. You get to help people which is nice, but they arent very forgiving if you 'slack off' during down time."
good,Its very good comapny to work with.. We receive good response from the co-employees as well as from the management.. Salary benifits are eqally good..
good,Overall everyone involved with State Farm are good people willing to help. Working in agency as team member does not allow a lot of advancement opportunities
good,"It was fun to work there, loved some of the staff. I was a small office but everyone was very nice. The only bad side was that the boss could get very fuzzy whenever you asked for a day off, even if you had vacation time."
good,Typical sales position and trying to upsale customers. Enjoyed working closely with customers and created nice bonds.
good,"We were available to take client homeowner claims calls from allover the USA, to call out for quality first contact and verify the facts of loss, then move the claim forward in the best way. Every assignment presented learning opportunities. Management and co-workers are supportive and capable. The hardest part was denying coverage when it did not apply; The best part was helping people to understand and claim all of their available benefits."
good,"Management structure, knowledge of who really does the work needs improvement. Political correctness overshadows hard work and commitment to the Company.. The compensation, benefits and chances to learn are really good."
good,Typical day at work was supervising my team in a call center environment. Management was not great but not the worst as well. Enjoyed supervisor and helping my employees.
good,"Busy provides job security. Great products offered, easy to market. Great training. Learn how to be an agent instead of sales rep. Not many benefits to agents' staff. Generally, good work environment."
good,I love how we received our commission bi-weekly.Once hired I was able to complete a one month course early and gain my 440 license. While working at State Farm my daily tasks included “Beginning of the Day Activities.” These activities include and policy changes or notices effective for that specific day. From this list which could easily reach 200 a day I am efficient & multitask to use it as a tool for sales. I was able to learn the material quickly & practice sales almost immediately after gaining my license. I catch on fairly quickly & I am able to transition to different sales points.
good,"fast paced environment, focused on providing care for the things we value most.  Can be lots of opportunities for the right candidate."
good,"Overall great company, with some bad managers. Starting pay is lower compared to other industry leaders. A lot of advancement available."
good,"Loved working with the families and community to provide quality christian education, and great room for advancement just found other opportunitys to develop and grow"
good,"I have had great experiences working with State Farm; however, I feel I haven't had the opportunities I need to further develop my career."
good,"Within the company there are advancement opportunities but it is very competitive. Besides requiring management to micro manage their employees, it is a fun lively atmosphere. The people you work with are great and you are surrounded by so many experienced people that you are able to learn from.  A typical day for a claims adjuster pretty much consist of incoming calls in regards to claims and task work, which is updating the claim with documents received or making calls to check status of repairs, update rental reservations, and pay repair/rental bills. I took my greatest lesson from this job, no matter where you work, the job is what you make. You may not be able to control the actions of others whether it be management or your co workers, you determine your success in a company."
good,"Productive and fun workplace, I enjoyed the environment and working with my coworkers. Highly recommend to individuals who want to excel and enjoy their career."
good,"good company to work for, lots of good perks, good benefits"
good,Fortune 50 company with many opportunities in hub locations. Competitive salary and benefits. Strong support for developmental opportunities. The culture is changing and there is an adoption of Lean principles.
good,Good management and friendly work environment. I enjoyed working with people and the sales aspect of it however compensation was not where I needed it to be.
good,By and large the quality of people that I work with at State Farm are second to none.  State Farm has an excellent training program for new agents and seems to search for high quality candidates.
good,"Working for this company can be both challenging and rewarding and the work environment was business friendly. The company's"
good,The owning agent you work for is what makes or breaks working for State Farm. I worked for a horrible agent and then an amazing agent. State Farm is flexible for a work schedule but meeting quotas is the name of the game.
good,总体来说，是一家很不错的公司。我在美国好几家大公司工作过，这家公司的管理方式最为人性化。公司对于员工比较尊重。因为公司是保险行业的龙头老大，所以工作节奏不是很快。对于中年人比较适合，但对于年轻人可能会感觉节奏太慢。
good,My typical day at State Farm consisted of working on customers' billing issues and keeping the office organized and friendly. I built confidence every day while answering phone calls and learning something new about the insurance world each day. Overall my experience with State Farm was a positive one.
good,"A typical day at my last job was sitting in an office for several hours talking on the phone with former State Farm insureds and inputting their information into the computer system. I learned how to effectively communicate with other people as well as strengthening my keyboarding and computer skills. The management was not very engaging when it came to the individual goals of the employees. The co-workers that I had worked with did not work with much compassion for the job, it was more so for the money and because it was an easy job with little expectations. The hardest part of the job was figuring out how to satisfy and say the proper things to the irate customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with everyone whether it be the co-workers, management, or customers on a daily basis."
good,Its a good company to work for they provide the skills you need to do your job. You learn a lot at State Farm.  The also offer growth in education opportunities.
good,"The sky is the limit for compensation as a producer and agent. However, your experience will depend greatly on your hiring agent. If you are able to find an agent willing to take the time to property train you, provide you the assistance and mentoring you need to develop into a strong candidate for agency, you will do fine! However, there are many out there not willing to put the time into your training, and think that the best way for someone to learn is for them to figure it out for themselves."
good,"State Farm is a leader in the insurance industry.  I learned all the facets of insurance sales/service while here.  Most days involve 75% service and 25% sales.  I have learned that I have a knack for dealing with people, even those with complaints/concerns.  I take the time to get to know them as they call or drop by the office.  My co-workers and I truly work as a team to tackle new situations as they arise.  I would say the hardest part about the position is not being able to resolve an issue to a customer's satisfaction;  I am very persistent in my problem solving and strive to make things right for all involved.  When I am able to satisfy a customer I am truly happy!"
good,"Great company with strong values. "
good,It was a good company great with home and life balance. Just ready to move. It has great potential to move up if your in the right office. Make sure you and your agent have the same goals.
good,"Typical work day follow up with clients regarding anything issue they had the night before, check for any billing issue, help out for anything other issues, greet clients, answer phones, sell insurance products."
good,I enjoyed my time with State Farm.  They used to encourage team work building and fun activities away from day-to-day duties.  It is my understanding that they no longer do this and I believe they are closing the Bakersfield office now.
good,"Great benefits."
good,This company and my coworkers have become like family to me in the past 3 years. Usually a day at work consists of my on the phone most of the day with a 30 minute lunch break. I am the first person that people see when they walk in the door and I always greet them with a big smile! Being given limited time off I am basically there every day and see the day to day operations. The hardest part of my job is that I work there to make a living. I work to work. I never have any extra cash or have been given a raise in years. I enjoy the close relationships we have and how we try to work together to make customers happy.
good,Nice place to work and the atmosphere is great. Co-workers and peers are friendly and make it simple for reaching business goals.
good,"The office I worked in had a very large book of business.  We spent the majority of the work day servicing our exciting customers.  We did very little cold calls.  I would help customers understand their benefits and were they may need to change coverage's.  I would do financial reviews with my customers.  Through the day I would add, replace autos.  Set up new Homeowners, condos, RV, renters and many other policies."
good,"I started with one agent then another offered me slightly better salary. With both the commission plan is not much to look at and there is no benefits. I have come to known several agents in the area and I have not met one that has a decent commission plan or offers benefits. "
good,"Very busy, great co workers, good benefits and raises.  A lot of resources to help your perform the job.  Education benefits--paid for CPCU.  Can learn a lot from co-workers--many have been around 25+ years."
good,Very fast paced environment. A lot of selling involved. Great place to gain knowledge and grow. Very big on numbers and not much else.A lot of variety in the day to day.
good,"Some jobs are more satisfactory than others, some management is better than others. You hire on with the idea of spending several years at a job only to learn, once hired, that your employer plans to retire within a year or two,  You give your best effort regardless of what you learn and take pride in your work. The satisfaction in doing the best job you can is paramount. You make friends among the clients and learn what what their needs are, what your employer requires, and how to balance both. "
good,Great experience and great people.  I learned a lot while working for this company.  Improved my skills in selling and dealing with people in a fast paced environment.
good,"A typical work day depends on your job function. However, you come in with work on your desk and you have until the end of the day to complete it. I work with wonderful people who will assist me as needed, but other than that, just meet production requirements and you will be able excel in the workplace."
good,"the company is a good place to work, but need more job security. I enjoy working there and the company was very open to my hrs"
good,A good place to work for a college student not for anyone of reasonable intelligence looking for full time work.The staff walk you through the process to help make sure you do the job correctly.
good,I am an agent staff member and all in all I have enjoyed and valued the experience working for a State Farm Agent have afforded me.
good,"I handled insurance accounts, quotes, payments and any inquiry the customer had. The hardest part of the job was the travel time."
good,"Good workplace and fun too not oo much hectic manageable work"
good,Good advancement opportunities but salary isn't competitive. Great company to balance work and personal life. Free insurance education and designations.
good,"State Farm was a brilliant company for many years...right now they are undergoing MAJOR transformation and have lost sight of all that they did well...care for their employees, consideration of their long standing customers and maintaining a presence in every state."
good,"State Farm still offers a fully employer-funded pension plan AND a 401k with matching. A typical day varies by department. Some depts are more demanding than others; it really just depends on the nature of the work for that department. Overall, it's a really good company."
good,Fast Paced But Low pay but opportunity to join State Farm team through Kelly Services. Each representative must participate in daily meetings where everybody's job metrics are openly discussed including average call time.
good,"A typical days work consisted of customer service calls from policy holders, agents, and their office assistants. I learned a lot about how claims are processed. Management was typical. I met a lot of helpful people while working at State Farm. The hardest part of the job was the schedule. I wanted a full time position, but none came up in the time I was employed with them. The most enjoyable part of the job was the Schedule Trade Board, which allowed agents to post their hours for other agents to pick up and work for them. This allowed agents to take voluntary time off,and allowe others to gain overtime."
good,"This position was ""officially"" the same as my current position, but this office was larger with more emphasis on sales.  I had 5-6 coworkers (only 2 at my current job!) that were all wonderful people, and also enjoyed the clients.  The most difficult aspect was lofty sales goals, but we were rewarded when we reached our goals---both as a group, and individually.  There was also a heavy emphasis on customer service and retaining business, and I enjoyed the challenge of educating people about the basics of insurance and guiding them to having financial peace of mind."
good,"Excellent company to work for.  Thorough training, friendly management and up-beat staff make for an excellent work environment."
good,Very good company to work with . They have good salary structure and benefit plans for the Family. Very good company to work with.
good,"This company has been around for a long time and is in the process of maneuvering to streamline its working environment.  The job is very high pressure and performance driven workplace."
good,"Great company overall, transition to new company causing some stresses."
good,First job in where my professionalism is noticed and rewarded. State Farm Insurance has the best business culture I have ever experienced.
good,helping out people and being humble were priorities for me at this job. I learned how to help others in choosing what was best for them. The management was decent and the employees worked great together. Keeping up with the tasks for the day was the challenge but overall many different things helped me make it through the days.
good,"I wish I would have stayed here but I knew it was time to move on. There is very little room for advancement because of the flat management structure."
good,Followed up on leads and did cold calling to potential customers.  Provided customer service to existing customers.  Provided quotes and information to prospective customers.
good,"A typical day is sitting down for long periods of time, and getting to take calls from all over and from different types of people. Downtime between calls also."
good,"A typical work day will include interacting with customer whether on the phone or in person. the interaction includes, bills, discussing coverages and writing business. I continue to learn because I attend CE classes. Since it is a small agency management is minimal supervision. Co-workers are helpful as I am to them. The hardest part of my job is telling customers why the are being cancelled or denied or life insurance. the most enjoyable part of my job is educating my customers about all the types of insurance."
good,great place to work jut very poor pay. management was great and my team was awesome but i needed more money to live.
good,"A fast-paced, team oriented company. Challenging and rewarding work. It's a place where you can learn a lot and meet wonderful new people. They are interested in your education and with proper training you can be of great  value to them."
good,"I opened the office turned on all computers and lights. Organized and cleaned office took out trash. Next I would check customer emails and voice mails that had been left over the weekend. At 9 A.M. I would  turn the phone lines over from our answering service. I would answer calls, take payments, troubleshoot customer inquiries that were within my job description. "
good,"A typical day at work these days is, answering phones, working tasks as scheduled and you have to pay attention to time! I've learned a lot about auto policies and that some states are harder to work or should I say more time consuming than others. The most enjoyable part of the job is when taking calls, and you can make the person on the other end of the call smile or laugh!"
good,"Excellent underwriters at the home office, very friendly and helpful"
good,I already gave a review of this employment. It was a wonderful place to advance my professional skills and more.
good,"Works in a unit that investigates, evaluates and negotiates property damage claims in a team environment. Handles high volume/low complexity claims; works in a customer facing environment."
good,"I at one time had been a client of State Farm, but left due to my job with Allstate. I have always admired the company and felt great as being a part of the company. My coworkers were helpful and fun to work with. "
good,It was a great place to work.  The job was challenging but rewarding.  I was able to work with some wonderful people.
good,I am a P&C license professional who write polices for current and prospect clients.
good,I learned how to review insurance and understand a little bit more about how insurance works. My co-workers were very helpful and understanding.
good,"My role as marketing coordinator was to develop and implement the marketing strategy for our local agency office. In addition, I was the sales team lead. I made a large volume of outbound calls, saw 1-2 appointments daily, and mentored/managed the sales team. I enjoyed working with clients to protect their assets and achieve their goals."
good,"Good company with growth opportunity, but competition for advancement is stiff.  Must be willing to work weekends,  evening and night shifts. Excellent healthcare and benefits package."
good,"A typical day of a claims processor includes answering incoming phone calls from customers involved in motor vehicle and Bodily Injury claims.  These calls spanned a range of assistance with the Bodily Injury portion of the claims, or the Property Damage portion of their claims.  The BI portions were mostly consistent of questions regarding forms and mail they received from State Farm that they need further clarification on.  The PD portion were customers needing assistance in getting their vehicles repaired or obtaining a rental vehicle while the repairs were taking place.  As a processor, it was my job to assist in getting the vehicles inspected for repairs and setting up rental reservations for customers."
good,Set goals for each day and worked to accomplish those goals. The team was rewarded for hitting those goals that we had set. Everything was very supportive of each other and celebrated their successes.
good,Working for SF was a great experience.  I would have retired with this company if they had stayed in the Las Vegas Area.
good,"A typical day at work would entail, getting to my desk, starting up my computer and pulling up all of the programs that I needed to do my job. I would review our information center to see if any changes have been made, as well as reading my emails for any updates. As soon as I was ready, I would put myself in a ""ready state"" to start receiving calls. "
good,"Assisted Agency Field Executive; scheduling appointments, meetings and maintaining calendar. "
good,Great place to work. Great advancement opportunities. Managers will push you to succeed
good,"A great company that invests in their employees with incentives for growth, college reimbursement, post outs to higher paying opportunities, etc."
good,"I enjoyed working at State Farm very much. I met so many great people. Their compensation and benefits package was incredible. The Team Managers that I worked for were very good at helping me and others have a nice balance of work/life balance. "
good,"My boss was great to me. He has an open door policy where he welcomes questions and concerns, but also challenges you to problem solve. He's very supportive when it comes to you hitting goals (both for the office and for the future) and always asks you if you are adequately challenged with your responsibilities which lets you personally grow. Very much a teamwork environment where everyone helps each other and execute activities that benefit the agency as a whole. Most important he makes sure you understand and very much agree with the agency's mission statement (which is to be the community's leader in financial services through mutual trust and personalized service). From this agency, I've learned that being a salesperson is more than just selling products and hitting numbers, but really understanding what our clients needs and goals are."
good,"as my first real job out of college, this was great experience from an administrative, customer service, and sales perspective. It's a product you can stand behind, among the best in the industry."
good,"I work as a team member in an agents office. "
good,"Fast paste sells competitive environment."
good,"training office, new customers and new problems , new solutions. Never ending learning"
good,"Very busy management is great,and a lot of great people i work with.The hardest part is sometimes the machine give us a lot of problems,and the most enjoyable part is producing a lot."
good,"It is pleasure to work with that company and co- workers."
good,Highly enjoyed my 15 year career with State Farm.  I enjoyed providing customer service to our policyholders. In the Underwriting Department in which I worked we were team players & worked well to meet the company goals & service our policyholders.
good,"Honestly your whole experience will be determined for who your agent is. If you work for a good agent you will love what you do and the company you work for. If you have a bad agent it will either lead you to know what kind of agent you don't want to be, or more likely drive you from the company."
good,Good place to get started in industry. Work environment depends on agent you work for. Great products and industry leader.
good,My expreince at State Farm has provided me with skills & education I will carry out through my lifetime.
good,"State Farm provides quality training and insist upon providing the highest level of customer service. "
good,I don't have much to say since it's been quite a few years since I've worked there and they have had a lot of change lately.
good,All staffs are prompt in responding and addressing client's concern/s.
good,"I worked for the company back in the 80's & 90's.  Back then, there was an environment that made you feel like part of the family.   "
good,"I rather enjoy working for Mr. Revish and State Farm insurance, good company, however I am looking to transition out of insurance, but good opportunity to someone looking for a first great job"
good,"I learned a lot of things about insurance, the typical day was getting there and answering phones, taking messages, transfering calls, scanning and faxing papers. It was a small office with four people including myself, i had a great connection with my co-workers. The hardest part of this job was when angry clients would call about the house increase, and there was nothing we could do. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,State Farm Bank has been around a long time but they had not done the actual processing of the mortgages for their State Farm clients in house before.  This was a fairly new operation when I was hired and I took part in a few opportunities to help with the process while I was there.  With the ability to process and underwrite some of my loans it was nice to be able to have more control over the time frame.  My peers and I bonded over the extremely high volume and constantly changing work flow.  That meant we looked out for each other and worked at making our environment as fun as possible since we spent so much time there.
good,I worked here part time in high school and it was a great job to get me by after class. The pay wasn't amazing and seeing that it was part time it wasn't much but it was just enough for the time I worked there. My co workers were pleasant to work with and management was great!
good,"Respond to inquiries from policyholders, agency force, general departments, regulatory departments, mortgage companies, banks, claim representative via e-mail, phone, mail and/or fax"
good,Weak opportunities in Agency offices unless you are an Agent. Corporate support is fantastic.
good,Opportunities are limited in an agency office. Corporate is much better and very supportive.
good,State Farm us a good company to work for. There is always opportunity for advancement.
good,"Hardest part of the job not really being able to actually help callers that called in with issues because the agent has to. However, they never answer calls or messages. "
good,"Support the under writers and the staff of agents to ensure correct policy issuing, pricing and rating."
good,"Handle service calls greet and assist walk-in clients remind of late pays, translate for claims, assist agent, sales, attend state farm events...Etc."
good,"Recently, there have been some negative experiences with a large program; however, overall, the company is solid and supports its people well."
good,"A great place to work - you'll learn something new everyday! Everyone is friendly. If you're adaptable and flexible, this will definitely be the company to work for."
good,"A typical day at work included delegating for a set number of State Farm agents by serving as a liaison between the agent and their policyholders. I handled cold/warm calls in an outbound call center environment to the agents current policyholders throughout metro Georgia, and scheduled appointments for State Farm’s products. I learned how to lead for my agents and therefore I was promoted to team lead because of my leadership skills. This was a pilot program for State Farm at the time so management was very into the program and its employees. There were a lot of prizes and friendly competition among the teams and co-workers. The hardest part of the job was reaching policyholders during evening hours or on Saturdays. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a great working relationship with the agents, management, and co-workers."
good,Treated Contractor staff with respect - co-workers extremely helpful
good,Call potential clients and learn their needs to help protect thier properties and future through insurance products.
good,Each day presented very diverse tasks and type of work being performed.
good,"Typical day is calling approximately 100 people, leaving 95 voicemails and talking with about 5 people. I have learned different sales techniques with this company. My co-workers come from all walks of life and provide a lot of different. The training provided is another downfall to the success of the companies employees"
good,"A day at work for me is making calls to policyholders, submit claims, follow up on any past due payments, order office equipment, etc."
good,"This was a really fun place to work until the philosophy changed to focusing on selling to everyone you came in contact with an only working on service related issues as time allowed. Since this was a very busy office, there was rarely any time left in the day to work on customer requests, billing questions, problem solving, etc. If you really enjoy the game of selling, this would be a great place to work. A lot of opportunity to earn very generous production bonuses. If you feel strongly about customer service and ensuring your customers are happy, you will be disappointed. There is no time to please the customer. The general idea of the office is that if they are unhappy and leave, just write someone else."
good,Lots of room for advancement
good,"Typical day was busy from beginning to end, I learned to have endurance and patience, management was somehow involve in the employees growth but somehow busy as well with other requirements, we had the pride of offer a great service like no other iand have a great performance in both English and Spanish"
good,"- calling residences, businesses for various insurance quotes; data entry for current clients"
good,"It was an environment full of gossip and dishonesty I learned in the end but in the beginning we all were great. The hardest part of the job was getting others to do their part because it was affecting me in a negative way. It actually was affecting the whole team, but somehow it all fell on me, but I took it on and now I am stronger for that! The most enjoyable part of my job were my customers. They were so loyal."
good,"Great place to spread your wings, however, owner is a dictator."
good,"Family Friendly environment, can be fun at times. No Health Insurance Benefits, Kind or Greedy and all About the company. Does not excerise the main ingredient for success. Happy Employees equates to Happy Loyal Customers ultimately resulting in success."
good,"Agency is great in a lot of situations.  Some situations set you up for failure.  All in all they keep the customer in mind, but right now the big companies with a lot of expenses are trying to get their expense ratio down to compete with non-commissioned companies"
good,"Honestly, I loved working at State Farm. The agent I worked for was amazing, as were the other team members. I enjoyed working with our customers and enjoyed the day-to-day tasks. The things that led to me leaving were lack of advancement other than becoming an agent, lack of benefits, and the pay was not competitive with other employers"
good,"Day was always busy, seemed to fly by which I liked. Loved getting to know the customer and their individual stories. Really liked the challenge of the explaining the State Farm Payment plan cycle."
good,"Learned how to sell Auto insurance, Home, Health and Life. The culture is nice. Also in a nice area. Right in Clearwater. Perfect location for it. Great people inside."
good,This is a great opportunity to lean about insurance. You are in a call center and customer service skills are a must. You have to prove yourself to advance.
good,The job is not hard as an IPS Service rep as long as you take the training seriously and am willing to learn the job. The company as a whole is okay. The work environment is cool and they always have fun activities that you are encouraged to partake in. Their attendance policy is the one thing i have seen people let go for as it is pretty strict considering that they do not accept Dr. notes so those absences count against you and can jeopardize your job. Other than that my time spent has been okay and most times fulfilling.
good,I worked here a couple of years back. I don’t know why im being asked about this now. It was a simple job. I just didn’t like that you had to get all of the licensing while only being the receptionist.
good,This employer is great about training and support but work schedules can vary due to shift work depending on position. Management was supportive and there is plenty of room for advancement. Currently the company is reallocating employees to different locations all over the country.
good,Good opportunity to constantly meet new people and develop marketing skills. We had regular team meetings to help ensure productivity and team morale.
good,State Farm is an excellent place to work! The training process was extensively long and very productive. The pay could be better but the benefits are amazing.
good,good environment to grow as IT analyst. It got almost all the technologies to work on and enough challenges to get satisfied with the work. The culture is great
good,Offer flexibility and freelance dress code . There us always overtime and growth within the company as whole. Its offer state of the art benefits for there employees and families.
good,"Great benefits,  good pay. Slightly micro managed. Great compant for growth opportunities. No company is perfect. Great low key work environment. Always doing something to appreciate employees. Yearly bonuses as well"
good,A huge company with a lot of opportunities. Great support system. If your manager or team lead was not physically around you could easily find support.
good,"Management was inconsistent. Incredible and amazing leaders who truly cared and helped and unethical/crud ones too. The culture was amazing, enough food to feed nations from frequent potlucks, advancement opportunities endless!"
good,"*background screening is extensive-know ALL jobs, even the agencies* With job duties required, pay should be more. Starting pay is good & benefits after 30 days. Traffic is AWFUL-so patience needed. They pay for the licenses but throughout training there are so many ""assessments"" that you feel down if you don't pass. Great company but once in training - I knew I didn't feel comfortable making life decisions on people. Shift bids are done. There is NO dress code - so girls wearing clubwear or whatever. My thought-dress business casual unless told otherwise."
good,The hardest part of the job was getting multiple phone calls at once. The most enjoyable part of the job is being in a office working with different personalities as a group.
good,State Farm is a great place to start if you want to own your own agency and learn about the fast pace world of insurance. The atmosphere is really relaxing .
good,"I learned the importance of Team work, to always listen to customers,  to empathize, to trust but verify. The hardest part is not being able to provide a win\win solution for the insured, due to circumstances beyond my control. The most enjoyable part is being able to make insured feel whole again financially and emotionally."
good,"I love working here, the competitive environment is fun. The employer and employees are always willing to help when necessary. This job has taught me many things, such as how to self manage myself."
good,"Casual work space "
good,"Management could have been better. Work environment was decent, but the ladies in the office weren't always the most welcoming people to be around. Overall, I would say that it was a decent job with decent pay."
good,Working at State Farm was a positive experience. The company culture was business casual with an emphasis on the customer experience. Working part time at night was a challenge. As an employee with an advanced degree I dont feel I was encouraged to apply for positions that matched my education.
good,Enjoyed working there for the most part. My manager around the time I left wasn't the most stellar individual I have come across within the company. I would have continued to work there if I had not switched career tracks to work in elementary education. Overall a positive experience.
good,"A typical day at my office location is really laid back and stress free. A typical day consists of a lot of outbound calls to potential, and former clients trying to earn their business, and handling inbound calls helping current clients with any additions and or changes. I cant speak for every office but the agent who runs my office is a great, understanding and caring person, it is an absolute pleasure working with and for him."
good,"Great opportunities to move up in the company, good benefits, flexible schedule. If you like dealing with customers over the phone then you won’t mind the position."
good,"Call Center environment so can be very monotonous at times, but a great company to work for. there were promoting opportunities but only outside of SFPP ( State Farm Payment Plan)  Most of the managers were not promoted from floor but other areas, so it seemed like unless you were willing to leave department, not much potential to move up in that department. This also meant supervisors didnt know how to do the job you are doing, they were trained to analyze data and make judgement calls, not read accounts. They did have several events a year to boost employee moral and engagement.  i felt like  most of the supervisors and managers cared about their employees.  They have a retirement plan, 401k match, as well as several other financial options to set you up for success. offered insurance almost immediately. lots of benefits, lots of pay increases to encourage retention, but most people i worked with are no longer in that department or with the company. i left due to relocation."
good,Lots of room for growth for those who want to make SF a long term investment. Lots of work. Lots of numbers (meaning stats for performance). Long term stability is certainly there.
good,I would say working at State Farm was a good experience for me because it helped me gain a little knowledge about insurance. I worked with my family so there was no drama. That made it a lot easier to focus on my work.
good,You'll work hard here but be compensated for your efforts. Good corporate culture- industry that helps people. Lots of changes going on in company so be sure to have a good grasp of technology
good,It is a Nice place to work. Do have to train yourself depending on agent. No health or retirement benefits. Most of pay is solely based on commission.
good,make outbound calls to attract new insurance customers. basicly i cold called customers  to find out if they  health insurance . i would then give them over to the agent.    they fazed out cold calling and i was laid off
good,"I worked at a State Farm agents office in Scottsdale. The agent and two other customer service reps I worked with were amazing and were patient beyond belief as I was newly licensed and this was my first job in the insurance industry. I was responsible for answering calls, completing daily reports, daily bank deposits, and writing auto and renters/homeowners policies."
good,"Overall was a good experience I would recommend to someone who is dedicated and conscientious "
good,"State Farm is a good place to work. It is fast paced, but there is a lot of micromanaging. Literally hovering over your shoulder. That's a problem for some whether they're doing something wrong or not. I didn't seem to be to help or see how they could help; it seem to be an attempt to intimidate."
good,Really enjoyed my time there but with all the uncertainty with structure studies and never knowing if your job will be moved to one of the hubs or corporate it was very stressful as I was not willing to move. Overall great experience at my local zone office.
good,Working at State Farm was a good work experience I was happy to be apart of. It taught me a lot for the future. The job it’s self was something that was not for me.
good,This company always went above and beyond for clients. It provided the best service and reliable information to people of interest that established a trustworthy relationship.
good,A nice place to work but you had work to be completed.  The management was easy to get along with but they had rules that you must follow. The hardest part was you had to make a certain number to be finished with your day.
good,Working at StateFarm for my agent was really fun and challenging. My boss was a great guy and most agents are very relaxed but once again also competitive.
good,State farm has a great work environment. I liked that we had the opportunity to adjust our schedule by switching shifts with fellow co-workers without having to request time off.
good,"With working for state farm the culture is one that yo can ask for better. State farm provides a team work environment. Because it's a metric driven environment, management does an amazing job with implementing team building exercise."
good,"Challenging."
good,"When the recruiter initially called me, I asked how many calls I would take as a Claim Associate in a day. He told me around 14. Well, this was untrue....maybe 14 an hour. "
good,Employees need to have empathy for the folks on the phone. Hard job for someone who lacks that trait. Laid back otherwise. Didn't like the phone job. Not for everyone.
good,"A quick paced work environment with ample opportunity to grow in customer service skills and basic office receptionist knowledge of Microsoft, payments, and phone ettiqute."
good,"Developed and worked new leads; scheduled appointments "
good,I have learned a lot about dealing with customers from a diverse case scenario. If you are a person interested in learning about different policies and how you can create a security blanket for families.
good,"Great Company to work for. Recent Agent worked for was very relaxed and generous with bonuses, days off and hours.  There was a lack of accountability at this Agency."
good,"You must feel comfortable talking to people & trying to explain why insurance is necessary. Very sales oriented, little agent engagement which at times makes it hard to hit goals as a team."
good,The managers were very professional. The environment was very casual yet professional. Managers would help in any way in any situation. Co-workers are also very accommodating.
good,Great company to work for.  Very stable.  Good benefits but a little old fashioned.  Currently going through some changes to keep up with competitors.
good,"Company offers amazing benefits but compensation is not competitive with other insurance companies like Liberty, Travelers, Etc."
good,A typical work day would be faced with daily challenges. Some worse then others and it can be a high stressed job field to become involved with. Insurance industry is not for everyone.
good,was a very good company to work for. Very friendly staff and management there...I’d highly recommend this place for any first time job. Also to anyone that wants to learn.
good,"State Farm cares about their employees and does a good job of making sure the work/life balance is there.  They take care of their employees in the event of an emergency and will work with you when it relates to unforeseen circumstances.  Some of the managers there are biased and strict with no give.  Other than that, the company is a good company to work for"
good,"My day would start at 8am. I would check my emails and respond accordingly. After responding to emails, I would then work on policies within the queue for the duration of my day. Some days we had training classes and/or meetings that I would attend. I normally would do overtime at the end of my shift at 5pm, which was the file room."
good,Managment was great and it was a great place to work. It was one of those places that really made you feel at home. decent pay and plenty of work and home balance.
good,"This company is a good company if you are interested in climbing the corporate ladder. With the proper time invested and the extra mile given, you may be able to advance a great deal faster than you may could with a different company."
good,As a Customer Service Representative you will make outbound calls to people to collect payments; while receiving calls as well to make payments or replace vehicles. You could be helping the policy holder understand their coverages as well. Home owner policy information is also discussed throughout a normal day.
good,I feel as if this role at State Farm has provided so many positive aspects to my life that will remain with me forever. I have grown a lot not only as an employee but as a person. I will take these skills and manifest them to further my potential along with a company that aligns with me. I always love speaking with clients and genuinely helping them in their time of need.
good,"it was a great work place, people are very friendly including manager"
good,"The inside sales position was in Tempe, AZ at one of their 3 call centers across the country. The position was receiving incoming calls for auto and home insurance."
good,"Cool place to work once you get past the probationary period. Pot luck based company, great hours, discounts. Yearly bonuses, Gym on location great amenities"
good,Great Company that rewards the employees' efford. Beautiful and modern facilities.
good,"Great place to work. If you don't mind relocating to Bloomington, Illinois, the opportunity can be a great one. Management is governed as you would expect a Fortune 50 company to be managed. Governance and management are separated."
good,"In addition to my extensive customer service experience, I have strong communication, interpersonal, and leadership skills. I have also obtained a solid understanding of organizational objectives and culture. The ability to effectively handle multiple tasks simultaneously in demanding situations and the ability to implement knowledge rapidly have also been key components in my professional development"
good,"I worked for State Farm for 32 years.  There were many opportunities for advancement and very good training."
good,"Enjoyed the work environment great co workers."
good,"Management gave you the freedom to do your job."
good,"The hours are long, but rewarding. I had never adjusted for auto before, and this was my first deployment. The deployment was for 10 days and was extended several times. The total length of deployment was for about three months. I had ended up being the final adjuster for that storm and spent the last two weeks visiting customers at home, and repair shops."
good,"Wonderful overall work environment. Have been here for not very long, but have learned a lot thanks to the years of experience of those around me.  Overall very good."
good,State Farm Insurance company offers many opportunities for growth along with support for cross-skill and up-skill development.  Employees are treated fairly.
good,"The specific agents' offices have the autonomy to succeed or fail based on their own merits. The agents and sales managers set the sales goals. Some push for sales, others do not."
good,"Overall, this was a good place to work. Other companies pay higher salary for similar roles, but State Farm doesn't require a degree. There is technically plenty of opportunity for advancement, but when you work in a department that is short staffed it's nearly impossible to post out."
good,"I believe that State Farm really cares about their employees, but it's easy to start to feel like a number there instead of an individual. Production expectations are not realistic for the quality of work they require. It seemed like the employees that cut corners to make production advanced quicker and more often. Also, the salary is not competitive at all. Cost of living in the Dallas-Fort Worth area is steadily rising, and it was difficult to maintain basic financial responsibilities with the pay received. However, there are some really great people at State Farm. Some of the best coworkers I have dealt with came from State Farm. I also learned a lot about the insurance industry while there."
good,"Fast paced call center environment; every aspect of the job has required service levels to be met; Training is very thorough and resources the necessary to succeed in the job are very accessible; breaks and lunches are scheduled to ensure the best availability for the customers; during high call volume periods, days off are not available; overtime is sometimes mandatory."
good,"The State farm I worked at was slow paced and had a family feel to it. The people I worked for, at that time, were wonderful and understanding of family issues."
good,"I worked at State Farm for appx 5 yrs and was able to double my starting salary after two promotions. State Farm's starting salary ranges are slightly lower than competitors; however, the benefits offered make it worthwhile. I would recommend working for State Farm solely for the excellent benefits & job security."
good,"A typical day envolved a variety tasks including interviewing and highering, responsibility for hundreds of employees and all that entails.  Responsible for leading a variety of projects and appropriate follow ups.  Responsible for make high profile claim decisions individually/holistically.  Tasks included change mgmt and prossess mgmt."
good,great place to work until now the point system was put in place which has a person under a lot of stress your family can be in trouble and need you and you cant leave or  if you do you will get points the point system to harsh they really have lost great people over this people who have been employed for over 25 years
good,The majority of my HR career was with State Farm and I am very thankful for the time spent developing me into the professional I am today. I was provided multiple opportunities to stretch my skill set and learn new areas of HR.
good,When i worked there i worked part time and loved it! I ended up learning a lot about car insurance and banking as well. Which helped me when I got my first car. There's always something new to learn there.
good,During my career State Farm was a Family oriented company.  My fellow employees/peers that I worked directly with were like an extension of my family.  We all worked together to get whatever needed to be done completed timely.
good,Many opportunities available when willing to relocate. Excellent training. Many different career opportunities available. Benefits package is also pretty good.
good,"Despite some days, in general the environment is quiet. Learned a lot about insurance. However, sometimes the cultural difference (Hispanic vs. american) made a little difficult to deal with some parts of the job. Specially, those referred to sales."
good,"Working at a State Farm Agency is completely unique and depends on who you have as the agent. From most of the agents that I had contact with while working under mine, I found out that they are all very nice people. Just be prepared to work hard and meet the monthly quotas."
good,"A good company to work for but change is constant.  I left since I could not relocate, but there was a lot of time before they let people go.  Benefits are provided for relocation depending on if you own/rent a place, which are competitive.  As a larger company, change was slow, but seems to be coming faster everyday."
good,"My first agent was great, however not given enough training in the main system used (Necho) Second Agent Really nice however training style very different, stressful but learned more about the Necho system"
good,"Great place to work. Just be sure you know whether you're getting into sales or service work. Serving customers and working through new needs was enjoyable for me. However, the cold calling was difficult. I was not interested in sales."
good,"New leadership taking company in new and different direction--results of this new direction will take years to determine.  The company culture is changing--again, may take some time to determine the positive/negative impact."
good,Job will vary depending on Agent you work for. In my two years with the company I have worked for two different agents and had very different experiences with both. But one constant between the two is that my role in the office has changed consistently at least every couple of months and there is flexibility for out of office obligations and commitments. I think this is a great place to start your career but not the place where it should be defined.
good,"If you are willing to put in the work, State Farm is a great place to work. Choosing an office that fits your needs and can help you grow is key in finding thwthe  right location."
good,"Management has changed policies after I left the company.  While I was there, the pay was ok, but not competitive with other companies.  The benefits made-up for it in my opinion.  Since I have left, there were changes to the pay (they gave more $) but there has also been an establishment of a point system for no being at work.  You have to speak to a current employee for those details."
good,"great place to work.  Many opportunities for work/ life balance, community service and education. beautiful campus. central location within the greater Phoenix Metro area"
good,nothing too special. gets alittle tiring sitting at a desk all day. lots of cold calls all day and rude customers. but its really not that bad when it comes down to it. better than alot of other options out there
good,Very professional and upbeat place to work. I never had any issues with co-workers or management. Pay was lower than expected but was reasonable. Would have preferred better working hours and not weekends.
good,"Each agent is different but My agent has been great . It is a great place to work, you can sell or do service I find service to be less stressful. Sales is more stress ."
good,I loved it so much. But the newer agents didn't pay well. Thier is a state farm in every corner. The newer state farm agent have adapted to marketing tellers to keep their employees salaries low. Benefits are not good. But over all the work environment is awesome. I enjoyed the clients the structure the way of helping others secure their assets an family through insurance
good,Not having worked in the industry before the most difficult part of the job was learning how to read and interpret the contact. After that it was applying the contact to the work.
good,"State Farm is a good company to work for. I worked in the total loss department and enjoyed the work that I did. However, management was very poor. They cared more about numbers and finishing claims instead of customer service. If you didn't hit the daily quota of complete claims you would hear from your manager about it sometime that same week. Also, they constantly gave us ""mandatory"" overtime. Compensation was great! It was easy to make $18-$20/hour in the department I was in. I have heard since they have replaced management so that one con could have been improved since I left a long time ago."
good,"focus on developing their people "
good,"If you can get through training and licensing testing, this will be a good steady income.  If you get bored there are many different departments and even cross the country, to find another that does interest you."
good,State farm insurance is a good company . very good management.. headoffice very cooperative. In the agency the work environment was good.. sometimes we were asked to stay afterhours without being paid.
good,"State Farm was a great environment in which to work, as they cared about their employees.  We were offered a lot of paid time off, we were given many discounts and benefits.  We had a great work schedule, and time off was easy to obtain as long as scheduled in advance.  The work was quite stressful at times, but job security was good as long as you did your job."
good,The claims department provided many fast paced days that were stressful.  You are always working to help people through catastrophic events.  The employees are great and I have met many close friends while working there.
good,"I used to love this company! I was proud to work for the #1 insurance co. in the world! Until....things begin to change, and it wasn't for the better, but for the worst! "
good,"Having not worked in another business it feels very normal. People show up, get their work done and are generally able to have work life balance. "
good,Working at state farm was always busy but exciting non-the-less. The types of calls received and people interactions changed daily leaving a lot of change.
good,Great company to work for. Especially coming sttait out of college they did give me the skills and prep i wpuld eventually have needed in future jobs. Prepped me for my future employees
good,"State Farm truly is, overall, a great place to work. Your experience will get you far, and middle management is wonderful. The company is struggling with its culture currently and there is a poor work-life balance. Overall, you can adjust and as long as you are passionate about what you are doing, it is great! I would have stayed had they not announced the office was closing."
good,"A typical work day is assisting internal customers with policy questions."
good,Pay as good but I felt bored a lot of the time. I never really enjoyed coming to work because I knew I would be bored. Could bring any food in to eat though.
good,"It's a good place to work, but no job security if not willing to relocate at any given time. Fast paced environment with constant training and requirements."
good,State Farm is a great company to work for as long as you are in the right place. They are working on new business models and most opportunity for advancement are in certain locations. The culture is strong and supportive. Some departments require overtime to maintain currency but compensation is satisfactory. The company provides industry education and works to better their employees.
good,A great office with amazing staff and management. It's a competitive company and there are many rules and regulations when it comes to dealing with confidential customer information. Back ground checks are very crucial.
good,I enjoyed my time at State Farm. I am grateful for the skills and oppurtunities that were provided to me. The skills I learbed working there have only helped to further me in my career path.
good,"Company going thru major re-structuring, morale is low as most of the jobs are not secured. demand for higher productivity and quality is not stressed. they are monitoring number of calls, time spent on each one and how much you can produce but there are a lot of mistakes that someone else needs to fix. management are also under stress to produce but not much consideration to quality is given. Hardest part of the job is managing your inventory and personal life. The most enjoyable aspect was knowing you made a difference in someone's life in time of need and able to provide the funds needed and compensate fairly."
good,"Take continous calls all day for car accidents, file the claim. Get reapirs and rental car set up. Call other parties involved in the accident if needed."
good,"Management is great. Even though we had quotas to meed, the owner would always give his own incentive to make it more fun and not so stressful. Everyone working there got along great."
good,"Currently working there ans a typical day is sales and solving customers immediate problem.  8 hours on the phone, appointment, or walk ins. We had an office quota so that was more manageable than an individual quota. Our agent was there every day to make sure we work together as a office team. Hardest part was Selling to customer who is not ready for extra products but the most enjoyable was the customers, our agent, and selling to customer who understand the importance of Risk."
good,"All State Farm agencies are independently owed and operated so the work environment is completely different at different agencies, I have worked for 3 agents and each have been completely different in the way they manage the office and service customers.  It's really the luck of the draw on whether you will enjoy working for our office."
good,"I had a great Agent that I worked for, but Sales was not my personal interest. Although I was very good at it, I wanted something different that also paid a bit more."
good,"I believe State Farm is a great a company to work for and genuinely care for their employees. However, due to the nature of the job (claims), workload can be overwhelming and highly stressful. The work demand is always so high that I could never recall a time where overtime is not needed. Recently, State Farm is undergoing many changes, most notably offices consolidation. All small regional offices around the nation are in the process of being closed down and consolidated into 3 hubs in AZ, Dallas, Atlanta. Unfortunately, those changes affected many of its employees who could not relocate with them."
good,"Overall, State Farm is a great company to work for. Right now, they are going through transformational change across the organization which is much needed. However, it causes instability and an uncertainty about the future. Additionally, some executives are making decisions in a siloed approach rather than looking at the context as well as the character of individuals. Everyone is a number right now."
good,Overall positive and great people to work with
good,"Currently the company is in a state of change as the company is trying to cut back and reorganize the direction and size of the company.  They are trying to streamline the company to make it more economic for the customer. "
good,The values of the company are to be there for the customer and that they are.  But they are a bit behind in making the changes needed to be successful moving forward.  Now they are making those changes and they are not going about in a way that makes much sense.
good,"Love State Farm. Rates are higher but the quality of service is impressive. Great HR Deparment, managers, and a cafeteria with options. Quit working there for personal reasons that had nothing to do with the company."
good,Processed auto claims to the furthest point. Outbound and inbound calls with customers to determine liability and to discuss repair options and rental. Worked on different tasks daily.
good,"pretty decent place to work, great benefits and pretty competitive pay, slow paced in terms of change, workplace culture is very much geared towards who you know and relationship based."
good,"Typical day is not very busy, but interesting."
good,"The job requires for you to be license and if you are not license it will bring problems due that you are limited to your job, your job is to help the client not lose any client and to get more clients"
good,The work environment was very relaxed but State Farm is the #1 insurer in the U.S. but they are one of the lowest paying if you are not an agent.  I did enjoy working there but the pay was low.
good,"Long career with this company. Was once a fabulous place to be. "
good,"Overall, State Farm is a good place to work, but the work/life balance could be better. I currently commute an hour to and from work, so my scheduled shift is not conducive to my child’s needs as a student."
good,I enjoyed my time with State Farm.  My only reason for leaving was because of my growing family.  I really don't have too much to say  besides it's a great place to work.
good,My State Farm experience was educational as well as enjoyable. Each team I learned new and exciting things about the company and myself. Management was approachable and understanding.
good,"Heavy load of phone calls. The work itself is not difficult. The customers are difficult to deal with. Overall, State Farm is a good company to work for. Flexible schedule and nice staffs."
good,"Current change in upper management is changing the way Systems has been run.  Only time will tell whether it will work."
good,"Each agent you work for is going to be different, which can be a good or a bad thing.  Thankfully, I was fortunate to be hired by an incredible agent who was very understanding that his employees did have personal lives and families. He made sure each day was enjoyable for his employees and loved to have some friendly competition within the office. Because of our location, business was quite slow (small town in Maine), but it gave the employees the opportunity to better our knowledge in the insurance industry."
good,"Though State Farm provided a productive and friendly work environment, I am concerned about the declining need for personnel. It is hard to review State Farm as a whole, since the work environment largely depends upon independent agents."
good,Great experience with State Farm. Good people and managers (for the most part). Great training. Workplace culture was friendly and congenial. Expectations were reasonable.
good,It is a professional environment with good staff. There is training well provided. Many additional training available and growth opportunities provided.
good,"The manager encouraged advancement within the company. "
good,"No room for advancement. Very small vacation package and not much of a 401k match. Very fast turnover at this company. "
good,"I work as an Licensed Auto ILR claims handler. That might sound ""prestigious"" to people, but the reality is that it's call center work. The emphasis is heavily on churning through taking loss reports rather than the quality or care on each call, despite what State Farm tells you in training. "
good,State Farm was great!! I love working for the best and learned how a business should work. I have been certified in office and also have bank certified with State Farm Bank.
good,Assisted clients with new auto insurance applications.  Handled payments for premiums and made bank deposits.  Wrote up Auto claims and contacted adjuster.  Typed correspondence for agent. Took pictures of houses for homeowner insurance.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working at the company and working alongside a team of dedicated professionals. The facility at CityLine was one of the best workplaces.
good,I enjoyed working at State Farm for the brief time period I did. The environment was very relaxed and the management was great. I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,"Working here was very easy, I walk in log onto my computer and see the people I needed to call. After I called them I had to write notes that I made a phone call to them. Then I would answer the phones if they rang."
good,Rapid work environment in the Insurance business with a large System Department.  Transforming from a Waterfall into an Agile work environment. Focus on career development
good,State Farm has been a good company to work for.  In the past they have cared about their employees and have been very flexible with the work/life balance.
good,I worked for different agents.  Enjoyed my time there.  My husband relocated back to Ohio.  I was also pregnant with my son.  I enjoyed working with the public
good,"Good company to work for. Each office is owned by the agent so the work environment can vary, I would recommend State Farm if you are looking at getting into the insurance industry."
good,Was good place to work. There was always room for advancement. The days went by quickly because there was always something to do. I enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed being employed at State Farm.  The only thing that disappointed me was when they started closing down all of the local agencies and claims centers to consolidate down south.Other than that I do not have anything negative to say about Sate Farm.   They taught me a lot of life / work experiences.  I was employed with them for about 10 years."
good,"Lots of miscommunication with agents & CC. CC cant do much, its always a message to the agent (who are NEVER in the office) which does NOT help the customer which causes them to cancel. Recently they got rid of a lot of shifts and now some people have to quit due to the inconvenient times the scheduling department has came up with. Managers are quick to  talk about your numbers but when you need to talk to managers they are not at their desk. Bathroom breaks ruin your metrics . If you are part time expect to work a minimum of 8 hours on the weekend vs 4 hours during the week. Now to the pros. There are great benefits, pto starts building your 1st day of training, you are able to leave early if there is enough staff to cover, pensions,casual dress."
good,State Farm is actually a very good company to work for. IT organization is undergoing complete transformation towards adapting to Agile. This is good.
good,Helping customers with understanding insurance is the most satisfying part of the job. The hardest part of the job is the constant increase in insurance premiums.
good,"I had to retire early as result of over my over agressive manager. While very intellegent, he was not smart in some areas. I would still be working for the Company had I been able to work under a different manager."
good,"Insurance is pretty much rules/regulations, customer service, and sales. The experience you have definitely depends on your agent. My agent was not present much due to finishing a law degree for most of my time working there. She was more focused on building relationships with current customers rather than cutthroat sales. The pay I started at was terrible so I left to go somewhere else. Then I was offered more money and came back. When I left my pay was definitely fair, but there were absolutely no benefits which is kind of odd considering it was an insurance company. Every agent is different. Some offer benefits, but mine did not."
good,"State Farm has been amazing to me, I would love to stay with the company after several years of working For State Farm. it's brought so much knowledge, experience and gratitude"
good,"Working for an independent agency affords some autonomy. My experience has been good. I love my agent, we have a great rapport and the only reasons that I'm exploring my options is soley based on earning potential, benefits and security."
good,Good Place to see yourself grow. Many opportunities job can get stressful during busy hours especially if you do customer service. Overall job is great.
good,"Overall, a good place to work but could be better if they paid more. There are also opportunities for advancement so and no contingency period for any position. A typical work"
good,"Should be ready for anything. Very fast paced and customer oriented, so if you don't like dealing with people then you shouldn't work here. Great opportunity if you are looking to become an agent."
good,"A typical day of work consists of quoting, selling and servicing policies. The level of stress or work can range from mild to high depending on the day of the week or during natural catastrophes. Hardest part of the job is having to deal with complex billing issues that can arise due to multiple changes in a customers policy (i.e. added vehicles or drivers) and consoling customers when they have experienced traumatic loses (loss of a loved one) . The most enjoyable part of the job is developing close relationships with customers. Most agencies have a small number of employees therefore it is imperative that each person be a team player and work well with each other. Being dependable and on time is extremely important. I've learned that no matter how long you've worked in this industry you need to be open to learn new things. Policies, practices, guidelines and requirements can and will be subject to change. One must be willing to adapt and improve one's self."
good,"Paid time off is earned as you work, Work volume is not sustainable as some departments are under staffed. Management is great and the benefits are decent"
good,"loved my job, had to relocate to another state or I wouldn't have left, tried to get picked up by another State Farm but did not have any luck........."
good,Trains well and promotes within. Personalized customer service is key to their branding; it works perfectly and they really take passion in putting the customer first.
good,"A quick-paced call center environment that was also monitored by extensive metrics that each employee needed to abide by. Generous benefits were offered, but employee expectations were unfair and unrealistic."
good,"It was a temp job with one of the agents.  I haven't worked for the corporate office, so I can't speak as to how working there may be.  However, the time with the agent's office was a good experience."
good,"Overall State Farm provided a great experience in the insurance industry, however, there was no room for advancement within the company. After nine weeks of training, you are more than ready to work in your department with the confidence of knowing your job. The work culture was great, everyone looked out for one another, and would help whenever possible. Overall great job for those wanting to get into the industry, but little opportunity for growth."
good,"During my tenure I worked for the a few agents offices, some who were well established and others that were just starting off. State Farm the company is amazing! They give you a lot of hands on training teaching you step by step the process, the importance, and lastly the reasons why State Farm is a good neighbor. As for the agents it is a hit or miss. You could be very lucky and work for a very nice office with a structured office, or you could be put into an office that has utter chaos where it is a dog eat dog world and your coworkers are more willing to steal your sales versus growing business for the office. Aside from that if you are new to insurance and want an environment to grow and learn this is it. If you are experienced and want to have a company you can stand behind this is it. This company as a corporate is amazing, I was contracted for a short period and the Area Field Office was amazing the management team is helpful, and they care about your personal growth."
good,I have been with the company for almost 4 years and there has been lots of change some for good and a lot not so good but there slogan is adaptability and flexibility.
good,"Compensation changed five times in one calendar year.  We all know as commission based sales people, this is something that can drastically change your work conditions if you worry about the pay changing due to the agents wants."
good,I loved working for State Farm. The office closed and I had to find other employment. I loved my boss and the people I worked with. It was very fast paced and stressful with multiple changing priorities.
good,Good benefits including company sponsored pension plan.  Company atmosphere and  goals have changed over the last 3-5 years.  State Farm used to be more about family and employee appreciation.  Since the recent reorganization and change in Executive Leadership over the last 3 years it has gone to a bottom dollar type mindset and focuses more on metrics and numbers than it does the customer and employees.
good,"The company has great work ethics, relaxing, heavy systematic and process oriented. The management is very supportive and team collaboration is good and inclusive environment."
good,"State Farm was a god place to work. I love the environment. The management was great, and my co workers were great as well. I like the culture of the place and I was very secure."
good,"I've only been with the company approaching 3yrs in October and I've already excelled in multiple departments, learning what all State Farm has to offer for my career"
good,I have nothing negative to say. I just wasn't happy sitting at a desk all day. I like a challenge and to be able to be up and down and doing different tasks.
good,A typical day at State Farm would include countless encounters with valued customers concerning their automobile claim. The majority of my day would insist of assisting with setting up repairs and rental for customers who experienced a loss. I would also analyze facts of loss and investigate liability decisions. A lot of my day is spent making sure the customer has a remarkable and efficient experience. I make customers aware of their policy coverage along with going over estimates and issuing payments.
good,High claim volume so I had to be on my toes and make sure all the information and paper work was prepared correctly and complete so the adjusters could go out and assess the properties or claims the clients were making.
good,Working at State Farm was very challenging. There's just so much to learn and selling Life insurance is still one of the hardest things for me but with time it will get better. I really enjoyed my co-workers made it enjoyable to come to work
good,"Working in an agents office was quite slow paced. I worked in a small office with only 3 other employees so the days would drag a little bit. However, it was a stead job with room to advance, had I wanted to. I was only 20 at the time I was working there and was looking for something with less demanding hours to go to school and meet people my own age."
good,A day consisted of answering income phone calls for various questions and situations.  Making cold calls for incoming quote requests and following up on previous requests.
good,"The goal of any insurance agent is to spend the majority of time bringing in new business, a considerable amount of time managing existing accounts and the least amount of time on menial tasks like filling out paperwork"
good,"Could be overwhelming at times, overall good experience.  If the rates were better, the pay would be better and employees would be more satisfied with the overall job."
good,"A typical day at work at SF as a claims adjuster includes adhering to a schedule, inbound phone calls and working tasks that involve outbound calls. "
good,Every State Farm office is a franchise. Pay will just depend on the hiring agent. Hours are typically 9-6 M-F. Sat-Sun By appointment Daily duties involves
good,"Excellent training modules available to all team members."
good,"There is never a day that isn't busy and there is always room to grow.... but the benefits aren't that great. You can keep advancing, which is great but State Farm's rates have increased which can be challenging to sell product."
good,"Headquartered in Bloomington, IL. Supportive culture, helpful coworkers, very standardized procedures with written standard operating procedures for each and every process used in the company."
good,A typical day can range from relaxed to stressful depending on the amount of customers. Management was good and the main office had an excellent support team. Hardest part of the job was probably dealing with distressed customers while the best part was the overall culture of the office. Almost like a small family.
good,this depends on the position you are applying for. We are now offering a more enhanced job application system in which external people can apply and see job requirements. My recommendation would be to go there to find out what your daily duties would be.
good,"At State Farm they really do practice what they preach. Work-Life Balance is important to them, so they not only offer a wide variety of shift lengths, but pay well enough that you can work part time and still provide for a family, or go to school. Commission is offered in the sales role, but it is not seen as the primary way to earn money. Training is thorough and continuous. The company offers excellent health care from day one as well."
good,Company has undergone a large number of significant changes in the recent history that have not all been positive.  Some of the culture that made it unique has eroded.  Their benefits are unparalleled and that is a large portion people stay there for many years.
good,"I learned about insurance - car, home and life. I learned all the regulations, and procedures if you're ever involved in an accident. In a typical day - I had customers come in with policy questions, I would do car inspections, and maintained the office."
good,"great place to work always a opportunity for advancement."

good,"The workers are all mostly kind and Russ is an awesome boss, he worked with me with my schooling and made it comfortable for me to work and move up as I excelled. I would have continued working here, but I had more classes and wouldn't have been able to work very much or very often."
good,"State Farm was essentially working in a sales position with no established customer base and cold calling required on a daily basis.  "

good,This company is a very good company to work for. I agree with their values and desire to put their customers first. If you don't have a degree you are limited to the positions you can apply for but lateral moves are an option. As with most companies a degree opens up more opportunity for growth and advancement.

I felt like I was always challenging myself and realizing that I am capable of achieving much more than I thought I did. Working here was definitely a real test of patience, but it was certainly rewarding nonetheless. My co-workers were the best part of the job. We always learned from one another and never hesitated to give or receive help. I constantly interacted with clients every single day - new and current. There absolutely was never a dull day at the office and time goes by so quickly because it's continuous phone calls and appointments. Management was very accommodating to needs, whether it would be scheduling hours or unplanned and unexpected events."
good,"Worked at State Farm a total of 27 years.  Did various clerical jobs through the years, starting out on a manual typewriter, using a key punch and verifying machines, through to learning about computers and using system generated programs through the last few years I was there."
good,Great Environment  with great leadership. Great job security and decent benefits> I would definitely recommend to someone interested in the insurance industry.
good,"Daily bonuses and big year end bonuses. Not an easy job, if you are a sales person you can make a lot of money but must work hard. You have to ask for referrals and follow the training of the manager. Not much room to adlib. If you come to work everyday and make calls and meet clients you can easily make $200-$500 per day. Agency provides leads for you to call. If you are afraid to hear no, or if you don't like to make calls this isn't the job for you. Management spends a lot of time training, which is good. Should make at least $40k in your first year. If you can do well with Life insurance you can make $50-70. Base pay is nice as well, something to fall back on when you have an off month. Base is guaranteed."
good,"It was my beginning experience in the US as a contractor."
good,Consistent levels of productivity and a welcoming group of coworkers to keep you going. Steady work flow and goal objectives to keep you focused.

Some clients weren't with State Farm Insurance and wanted to get a free quote, Some of those clients switched over to State Farm and some didn't. Some clients already had State Farm and just wanted to switch policies. Verifying insurance with clients. There was no hard part of my day. The enjoyable part of the job was that we had a great team of employees that came together as a team with a lot of ideas. The management was great and well organized."
good,"It is good working environment with all suppertive staff, and also good management, over all its a place where we can get good salary fun and also good work."
good,State Farm is a good company. Agents are independantly owned and being employed with a agent depends on the agent. Is this 20 words yet?? Leave me alone.
good,don't excel at your job. Others will feel threatened and cause problems. SF can't make up their mind and keep restructuring
good,"Finding that last piece of evidence, i.e. witness statement, insured statement, court documents, prior claims history or prior injury history that helped to complete the investigation, proceed to evaluate the value of the claim, and adjust it accordingly."

good,"State farm is a good place to work, just no work life balance."
good,"The work at State Farm in a customer service position was highly rewarding, but draining at times. It was entirely dependent on the customers that called in or came in through the door. Some days were so hectic that you didn't have any recovery time between customers while others it was so slow it could be mistaken for a morgue. The company itself was a very relaxed and fun environment to work in. Granted it had its faults, but no more than any other office environment."
good,fast paced since the agent I worked for was new and we were both learning the ropes at the same time.  I enjoyed the personal relationships I would get from my clients
good,"Easily the most fun I've had while working super hard for sales. Achievements were celebrated, and good sales results meant the agent would take the staff out and have fun, all on his expense."
good,State Farm is a great company to work for. I have had the opportunity to work in different areas of claims with extensive training in each area.
good,A typical day at work is taking payments from customers and calling prospects that I quoted who are interested in switching insurance. The best part of my job is saving customers money on their insurance. The hardest part of my job is seeing customers switch insurance and not being able to do something for them. I've learned how to multitask and focusing on reaching my goal for the month.
good,"Working for State Farm and for a new agent has everyone in the office busy. Due to the nature of this specific office, we had some spills to clean up from the former agent."
good,"Cold calling from a lead list and from the existing book of business is mostly how sales are accumulated, sometimes walk ins. You learn a lot about software and good sales techniques. You need to build relationships with potential clients and existing customers. Management style is laid back. As long as you do your job they aren't on top of you. Co-workers are great, it's like a small family. The hardest part of he job is making sure you don't get side tracked from doing whatever it is you are there to do, such as; ALL SALES or ALL SERVICE. meeting your monthly goals can be difficult sometimes. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping people save money!"
good,Great place to be small business owner.  Great support and products.  Freedom to build business.  Great support systems for claims and technical issues.

good,"I enjoy work for an employer that show appreciation and support."
good,The agent and team are very helpful and closed knit! Agent will go the extra mile for you! It was my first job in Property and Casualty and the team made it as seamless as possible.
good,"i was lucky to work for one of the most successful and hard working agents. She was very understanding and very supportive of our team. She pushed us to further our education and become agents ourselves if that is what we wanted to do."
good,"The State Farm culture is very laid back and casual. As far as promotions go, it's not the grades you make, it's the hands you shake."
good,A good company that offered an opportunity to succeed.  I have nothing but good things to say about working here.  I learned a lot both professionally and personally.
good,"For the most part, my work experience with State Farm has been positive.  Job stress has been reasonable.  The compensation is below industry average, and in fact is almost laughable, but it is extremely stable, and you can get promoted quickly depending on the department you are in.  It's a great way to get your feet wet in the insurance industry.  They have tuition assistance and will pay for your insurance designations.  To make really good money you have to commit to the company as a career."
good,Co-workers are genuinely  good people. The job was compensation was well worth the work and the atmosphere was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,State Farm is a great company to work for. They take care of their employees and there is room for advancement and growth.

good,"I worked with State Farm for a total of 11 years. Great benefits for me and my family. Answered an average to 30-50 calls a day, handled auto claims. Management was great. Hardest part of the job was flexibility, most enjoyable was my co-workers."
good,"We started out each day going over our daily tasks seeing if we needed to return any calls from overnight or before we opened. We checked to see if any claims were made or anyone had any questions or wanted to write any new business. We divided our office between sales and service and I handled the sales portion of the team. My co-workers and I got along well and that made the job very easy. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers. I loved getting to know each and every one of them and learning about their families and the changes in their lives. Many became dear friends over the years. The hardest part of the job was the management and lack of direction and the inconsistency. I prefer singular directives with a singular outcome if that is what is required of me but often times the management would change course even in the middle of conversation. It was difficult to know what was required of me on a regular basis to say the least, however I did run the office and made a lot of sales for the office and maintained the current customers we did have. I truly enjoy insurance and feel it was a good fit."
good,"I'm a claim representative / adjuster handling auto property damage and liablility claims. I'm relocating to Houston in February 2015. Due to State Farm not currently operating in the Houston area, I'm looking for new opportunities in claims."

good,I assist policyholders in filing accident claims/loss reports.
good,"Worked in many roles during my almost 15 years for State Farm."

good,I did a lot of prospecting which I didn't really care for. Gave auto quotes which I enjoyed and learned a lot. Left the job because of pregnancy
good,"Great place to work."
good,I worked here ten years.  I feel this employer is top notch in most areas.  Due to culture and success of the company you are required to conform to the employer.  Not enough opportunity for individual innovation and input during the period I worked here.  Slow to respond to employee needs such as work life balance and other needs similar to other employers.
good,A typical ay at State Farm would be me coming in around 9am and handling anything from phone calls and payments to assisting agents with certain tasks they needed done for 8 hours.
good,"Hours vary, continuing changing environment, there is no ""I"" in team at State Farm Bank"
good,"The Culture is great, it feels more like a family than a work environment. the work can be repetitive and boring. the hours are a bit long but its a good job."

good,"A typical day consists of taking phone calls and nothing else, I've learned more about insurance than I knew existed, the management is great and my co-workers are fun. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers all day and taking hundreds of phone calls a week, also there is more overtime than can be managed. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers."
good,"Working for such a reputable company like State Farm has taught me the value of loyalty to not only the customers, but to myself in what I do.

good,I love to work in a small convinient office. Co-workers have become my family in a sort of way. The office is conviniently located in town. There is alot of new techniques that i have learned while being here. The hardest part of the job is trying to understand some of the ways insurance company works.
good,"I still can't believe I worked there for almost 7 years.  Time flew by and I met some of the best people one could ever meet.  SF is a big company so there is opportunity to move around but you have to be very patient.  Many people I worked with had been there for 10,20, even 30 years.  If you are interested in the insurance or financial services industry its not a bad place to be.  You never know what kind of career a job there might create for you."
good,"Greeted customers at front desk and over multi-line telephones. Assisted them with many different insurance needs; Auto, home, fire, life/medical insurance, banking products and more.

good,"Everyday was great, I got to use the skills that I had prior, very easy to work with, very easy to work with. Driving around the state staying in hotels. being sent to schools to be able to do more work, working on my own. Doing a great job and being recognized for it."
good,This company provides excellent benefits and compensation.
good,"Everyday is different. Fast working office. Phones always ringing, always helping customers manage accounts. The office is a commission/salary base, so you are always trying to mulitline customers. The hardest part of the day is trying to complete everything on my desk. You have to time management your work. I have been at State Farm for a long time and have built friendships with customers. Which makes coming to work enjoyable. My customers always know I will help them and be honest."
good,My experience with State Farm as a whole was overall well... My main issues were on a personal level with some of my coworkers. State Farm has room for growth and stable pay compared to most Producer positions.
good,"A typical day at work included filing the paperwork from clients and answering telephone calls and taking messages for the agent. I learned how to take the payments and put them into the computer, also learned how to work a fax machine. I had great co-workers, we all got along great. Hardest part of the job was being limited on what I was allowed to do for clients. Most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the insurance business."
good,I worked here when I moved to Bloomington From Texas. I took a 7000.00 a year pay cut and later found out I had wait 2 years before I could move up. Though this was a great place to work I could not afford to wait 2years before mnoving up.
good,State Farm is a pleasant and interesting place to work. Both Agencies that I worked with were good with a focus on supporting staff to make a difference for the clients. Good benefits and a caring boss makes State Farm a great place to be.
good,A typical day at work starts at 8:30 and runs until 4:30. We get a 45 minute lunch break. Management is very approachable and co-workers are easy to work with. Hardest part of the job would be at crunch time (end of promotions for agents) and we find ourselves understaffed due to absenteeism or vacations. Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help clients.
good,"State Farm is an excellent place to work, especially for interns. In exchange for a lot of freedom and a great work life balance, employees can expect lower compensation. Additionally, while advancement is definitely an option, the work may not be extremely challenging at times."
good,"I spoke with many people that really had no understanding of insurance . I would go through all coverages , etc to make sure they understood and had all that they needed. I answered the phones and gave quotes over the phone. I learned that people should all be treated with respect no matter what their attitude was. Our management was a wonderful person and a christian , he taught me more than I could ever explain and was a very understanding person with a heart of gold. My co-workers have become life long friends and we support one another to this day. The hardest part of the job was dealing with people that had temper problems, but most of the time I could turn things around , in fact my co workers would send most of them to me to deal with. I loved my job , it was the most rewarding job I have ever had. I enjoyed our customers one on one..When they spot me out and around town they tell me how much I helped them and wish I was still working there."
good,"We had great team camaraderie, and I would still be there had it not been for the downsizing that took place on October 31, 2012. I began in 1997 and learned so many different aspects of insurance by moving throughout different departments. I enjoyed my time at State Farm."
good,"Reviewing new claims, determining liability,settlement of bodily injury claims, securing a release for the insured."
good,"As a college student, I was able to work here and learned a little bit about office management and administration."
good,Selling products and services on the phone/in person to current/new business.
good,"A typical day at work contains learning and staying current with policies and procedures. We have weekly meetings, which allows staff and customers to enhance their understanding level. As a group we review patient records, insurance, and clarify the proper understanding of eob's, which leads to proper payment. My co-workers are family and we are all determined to do our best. The hardest part of the job is realizing that there is not enough time to get to know the customer in depth. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that another satisified customer will be back."
good,State Farm has excellent benefits and the only thing that was challenging was moving up in the organization. You ahve to be able to move around all over the country to move up and you have to have a degree to move up as well.
good,"State Farm is a great company to work for, for the tech savy individual looking to start a career in the field"
good,NA - Unable to speak to the organization as a current employee.
good,learned a lot. diverse work group. very fast paced environment to work in and very heavy workload.
good,"State Farm is a great company to work for. I learned so much about insurance and office work, gained much experience and knowledge about many different things. My co-workers are great to be around; they're fun, outgoing and simply amazing! The hardest part of the job is keeping up with everything when it's a busy day, many customers call in for quotes which becomes pretty hectic but still is a fun task to do. The most enjoyable part of this job is putting the insurance information into the system."
good,"I love the fact that SF has trained us really well, and has helped us understand how important it really is to be extra careful with our clients personal information. I enjoy working in a nice friendly facility specially when it has to be with working with people that I can expand my knowledge. I have learned that it is really important to gain our clients trust (which is not hard for me to accomplish). I enjoy helping the people that does not speak english fluently. I always go out of my way with my clients and hope to do so at a different workplace enviroment."
good,Highly recommend. Great environment. High call volume. Highly regarded in community.
good,I enjoyed working with State Farm. It helped me develop various professional skills.
good,"I worked in the health claims division about several years ago. There was a lot of really good things about SF--they tried to make it a fun place that nutured the employee. Believe me, a company feeds you Holiday meals and has picnics with activities and employee apprecation days and mentoring programs is a good thing. They wanted you to do your best and be your best. I think my biggest issues came from the rules and the strict ""morality"" of the company. There were lots of small things that were hard to deal with, but the one thing that stands out is one time I got written up for having Avon sales books on my desk. I wasn't passing them out or talking on company time about selling it. They were on my desk and I was pulled into my managers office and written up for violating a company policy."
good,"Take heed to continuing your education. Stay active & engaged with both external & internal customers, and you'll grow within the company. The hardest part of the job is the schedule changes. If your in a department that has multiple shifts, it'll be according to business needs."
good,It is a good place to intern. learn many insurance facts that helps one decide what plans to take in the future. The work environment is also enjoyable.

Plus, I truly enjoy helping people out for better common good. To not worry about a financial burden when customer's experience a hard time."

good,Very productive work processes and fun with Management staff on Fridays.  Popcorn and drinks provided on Fridays. Made very good partnering relationships with independent agencies and staff as well.
good,"This position was a great way to break into the insurance industry.  This position teaches you how insurance works, and what the coverages are about, with emphasis on auto.  You the adjuster, are executing the product.  This position gives you the opportunity to put people at ease, with one of the frustrating events they will experience. On the other side, you will have to deal with angry people who may not have coverage to deal with the impact of the incident on then, or that do not understand how fault works."
good,I had a great experience working at State Farm. They are family oriented and flexible with hours and days off. The only reason I left was because we gained more staff.
good,Like a family atmosphere. Focus on diversity and inclusive as well as developing their employees to be successful in both in senior technical or leadership.
good,"Overall not bad. Initially there was a work/life balance. However, that later changed. I never had any problems personally. But things did change over the years for the worst."
good,"It’s a good job. You are in a constant learning situation! There is plenty of room for advancement, but your advancement depends on your success as an agent team member!"
good,"Great pay and benefits, LOTS to learn and sometimes can be difficult due to an overload of information but overall a nice place to work with free parking and good security."
good,"Fun place to work,great employees and bosses, flexible work schedule. I really enjoyed working with the customers on a daily basis.  I was a trainer for all new employees."
good,"They offer medical, vision, dental, and paid time off. They promote from within when possible. There are many departments within the company and there are chances to do job shadowing and stretch assignments."

good,The Enterprise Research Interns mainly do project-based job in Research and Development Center. Weekly or even daily communication with project leaders is guaranteed so that you can be clear about the direction and any updates of the work you are doing. Bi-weekly one-on-one meeting with your management supervisor is guaranteed and he/she will help you with anything related to your life-work balance or self-development.
good,Management available for assistance when needed.  Hours and compensation adequate for position. Corporate could be a little tricky to deal with sometimes but that is typical of all corporate in my experience.
good,"It is an exceptional company with great training, great benefits, and great opportunities for advancement."
good,Fulfilled opportunity to build a quality agency and book of business.  This what I prepared for and was able to fulfill. Built life long relationships with both business associates and clients.
good,"Great experience learned how to step up and out of my comfort zone. Good culture, gave me experience to grow as a professional. Gave me the opportunity to dream big."
good,I enjoy every day working in the insurance industry. It gives me a sense of accomplishment knowing I'm able to assist with protecting families and understanding State Laws.
good,"Just like every company you have ups and downs but there are far more ups with State Farm. Company perks, banking, discounts for numerous things, places, and eateries."
good,I received incoming phone calls for natural disasters in and out of the area. Such as Water from hurricane damages. From the east and southern coasts.
good,I liked working there just didn't like what I was doing and wanted to go to school for something else. Also needed benefits and better pay. But in all nice place.
good,Worked here for over 32 years. It certainly changed over the years but was great learning the business. I'm sad I couldn't get to full retirement age but the experiences and opportunities were exceptional. You must be willing to relocate to get better opportunities and job security but that was the ONLY negative.
good,"I had 4 supervisors in 6 months, but the benefits and compensation was well worth every inconvenience.  Great work culture and care for the health (mental and physical) of employees."
good,"great place to start your career. this was my first real job out of college, and i learned a lot of transferable skills that can be applied to jobs across all sectors."

good,"I would advise anyone to work there. Make sure you start studying for your license and training before working with this company. Otherwise, you will be behind"
good,"worked for agency and learned a lot of agents and team members -"
good,"My typical day of work consists of handling daily administrative tasks, including answering the phone and providing policy recommendations, quotes, and sales if needed.  My main task involves providing service to our clients, including making policy changes and updates, applying payments to their accounts, calling on late or past-due accounts, and directing and assisting clients through policy choices and the claims submission process."
good,I worked part-time as a CSS for State Farm and I loved it.  The job was not difficult and the metrics weren't too hard to meet.  My manager was super cool.  It allowed for a lot of flexibility which worked perfect for me.
good,This company allowed me to grow myself as a person and as a young business professional. The office setting allowed me to get used to working independently and as part of a team.
good,Work day includes making sure your customers and agents request are completed and reviewed to completion. The most enjoyable part of this job is that your helping customer with CSR updates and policy changes requested by there agent.
good,"I enjoyed my time at State Farm. Only thing that I didn't like was there's no sick time, you only have PTO which was tough especially because you have to build your bank up and life happens so it's not always that simple. However, most of the managers there are pretty good, well the ones I worked for and the work environment is chill and laid back. Come to work and do your job. You always will be in a learning environment there because to do the USA job you will never know it all and need to learn. Ultimately if you come to work and be productive then you have job security and great opportunity for advancement. I know people there that's been with the company 10+ years and some even less whose had the opportunity to work different jobs within. You're not confined to one job roll there."
good,When you are looking for a position within the State Farm make sure you always research your agents and how long they have been in business for.  Each agent runs their office different so each environment is completely different.
good,"Great entry-level position, benefits for part-time employees, modern work environment, they like to promote from within, concentrated on customer service"
good,Great employees.  The job is a fast pace work environment as you handle  claims for multiple states.  You must be knowledgeable of the various jurisdictions for each state.
good,"The owner I worked for was great to work for and I learned so much in the almost 5 years that I worked there.  He treated us to a lot of free meals, activities, and hosted a party at his River House every year which was so fun.  I felt very appreciated and respected there and wasn't looking for another job but was recruited and offered more money.  I still keep in touch with my boss there and would still be there if I didn't leave for the money."
good,I enjoyed my time at State Farm. The work was challenging and I learned a lot but it could be very stressful especially handling very complex claims especially ones that ended up in litigation.
good,"Learned lots about different insurance policies, come in get busy and make the sales. Very friendly work environment. Love to work for State Farm Insurance Company"
good,"The agent I worked for was excellent. It was the office manager that was horrible. There was no training, she didn't want to do anything but her personal life, she even wouldn't speak with clients which is why I left. I could no longer work there, if she was gone then yes I would still be there."
good,"I very much enjoyed my time with State Farm; however, the environment has changed drastically since I worked there as an employee and contractor in 2017."
good,"We all worked very well together, daily pulled multiple tasks from multiple states worked to completion, Management was always available to assist us, hardest part was trying to explain/help upset customers and best part was helping customers with getting their medical bills paid and settle their claim."
good,Great agent and team to work with. Each day a new challenge.  Systems allow for good follow up which leads you to build income for go-getters. The best part is getting to know your customers and building a relationship with them. The cons are selling to those who only want to find a cheap product.  You need to go after the good clients as there a very few walk-ins any more.
good,"Great place to work for longevity, relaxed environment I just could not stay in the Georgia area. the building in Alpharetta was AWESOME!!! great place to retire"
good,"While State Farm held high standards, they were a great place to work for. The culture is great, and the mission is something that feels good to stand for."

good,The management was very hands-on and provided a lot of guidance for the employees. There was provided room for improvement. The workplace culture was very inclusive.
good,"I enjoyed working for State Farm. The work  environment was very relaxing and friendly. Even though some of the employees had separate clients they were always available to assist if I needed assistant. State Farm paid for me to take training in order to be able to assist customers with their health, auto, monthly, home, and bank insurance."
good,"State Farm was a great company. I began my career in claims there and went to another insurance company after I relocated. It was then that I realized their training was A1. Every employee was professional and proud to be there. Once the Eastern operations center started handling west coast claims that were on PST, it made work-life balance difficult due to hours such as 12P-8P."
good,"Exciting place to work use your time in the field the get to know people in your community. Have confidence in your skills, don't be shy talking to people."
good,Many opportunities for growth and leadership.  Statefarm provides stability and is family-oriented.  Great place for entry-level or looking for benefits.

The work-life balance and benefits at State Farm are truly spectacular, especially for students or single parents. The work is not without its challenges, but overall I've had a great experience."
good,"work/life balance"
good,Great company to work for. Mandatory paid training with informative trainers and leadership. Very helpful every step of the way from hiring to training and working in the field. Fast paced and always improving policies and procedures. High compensation for good hard work.
good,"Typical day consisted of upwards of 100 contact attempts, checking emails, messages, and setting or running appointments, general housekeeping and filing work."
good,I had a great experience working at State Farm! I was blessed to work for a wonderful Independent agency that valued not only our customer but our own well being.
good,Currently working within investments division at corporate HQ. Really chill and smart team; they know what they're doing. Everyone has an open door policy; really accessible. People regularly stop by to chat or offer help.
good,work a 8 hour work day culture is positive attitude is upbeat nothing really to hard about the job enjoy talking with co-workers and meeting new people
good,"Depending on your Team Manager will depict if you like the job or not. Some TMs are cool, but still get the job done and others are sneaky and “by the book”."
good,While at my job at StateFarm I would sit at the desk and work on helping people out when they called and made payments on the computer as receiving personal information and putting it into the computer.
good,State Farm is a great company with good benefits. The company offers a lot of opportunity for lateral movement or upward advancement to other positions nationwide.
good,"Working for State Farm was a wonderful experience. I managed all of the book with another part time agent in the office. Took all phone calls, walk-ins for service as well as new business for both personal and commercial accounts. State Farm is well known for being family oriented making it a wonderfully connected office to be apart of. The hardest part of the job was not having alternatives for my clients in the event of an increase. Also, selling the term life policies was a challenge due to the high rates. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be the relationships you build with your staff members as well as the clients. It is a very positive relationship oriented insurance company."
good,"The hours in this position are extremely flexible. The work isn't difficult but is tedious and customers can be stressful to deal with at times. State Farm makes a strong effort to treat employees well and diversity is celebrated within the company. Have overall had good experiences with the management with a few individuals as an exception, though I do not blame the company for their actions. The work does not follow you home- once you've clocked out, you won't have to think about work until you clock in for your next shift which is really nice."
good,"no review at this time, i was a contract employee working for a contracting firm, i assisted policy holders during an hurricane event with their insurance claims,scheduling inspections, and assisting them with any questions concerning the claim or the contractor estimates in order to help process the claim."
good,Great company for my 1st assignment in insurance. Kind and friendly staff. everyone was knowledgeable and willing to help the new comers. Would be willing to go back if the opportunity presented itself.
good,"Talk to your your local agent and see what he or she can do for you."
good,Best place to work for benefits. They practically offer everything. They strive for a great onboarding. Nice building. Mothers room for nursing moms to pump.
good,"SF is trying to become product based and is headed the right direction. Executives aren't perfect and make strategic mistakes.  They're quick to make corrections, but change is happening faster than employees can handle. Glad I'm here and don't regret coming onboard 10+ years ago."
good,"It was a slow paced office. I took payments and dealt with the clients as they came in the office or called on the phone. I did the filing, mailing, etc."
good,"I enjoyed working for State Farm. I learned a lot about the ins and outs of insurance and even though I had to leave, I will continue to enhance my knowledge of the insurance industry in hopes to revisit the field in the future."
good,"decent growth opportunity. very structured and balanced. some mishaps occasionally with sales software used but otherwise fairly intuitive. situational, but positive environment overall"
good,Could be better if they changed some things around. More salary based with bonuses based on performance rather than who the owner liked more. Better pay would be nice too.
good,"Your time is very structured.  Claims associates do multiple assigned tasks during the day.  The job is results oriented and the claim associate is timed.  Calls are listened to by  other employees.  The culture is a team culture with the team trying to meet certain assigned goals each day.  The atmosphere can only be described as military.  I learned that a minute counts.  Arrive on time, do not miss work under any circumstance, do not work longer than your assigned shift.  Take breaks as assigned."
good,"State Farm is a nice place to work, have advancement if that's what you want in your career. Great benefits and State Farm have Auto, Home,Banking ite"
good,State Farm is  nice place to work. The Management is good and the company cares. The job I had didn't pay very well but there are other jobs that do. I would recommend the company.
good,State Farm provides the best training for success. Finding the rite agent is key. The support that is given is amazing. I would recommend working for State Farm to anyone who is looking for a stable work environment.
good,State Farm is a good company to work for you gain lots of experience. Lots of overtime if you want it. You have to be flexible with your schedule. Training class is for 12 weeks
good,"Great place to work. Unfortunately the agent I worked for ended up leaving the industry just three months in, sorry unfortunately I wasn't able to work for Statefarm long-term."
good,"Excellent management and career growth opportunities. Fair work life balance. My role was demanding however not stressful. I enjoyed the work I did, as it was interesting and you learned something new everyday."
good,"very fast paced office,  a lot of phone and computer work, good co-workers, never boring, nice office atmosphere in a good location, learn something new every day"
good,"I worked for State Farm for over 11 years and regret making the decision to leave. Though the job culture has changed and has caused a lot of stress for employees that had been there a while, it is still a solid company that provides great benefits. State Farm  supports personal growth and advancement."
good,learning different system meeting new people. the staff was nice I went through a temp service. i left the job for a better pay.  I would got back it a good company
good,This company really cares about its employees.  It was the best company I have worked for throughout my entire working career.  They give you plenty of opportunity for advancement and they invest in your growth.
good,Busy days at work. Learned how to speak with confidence and own a conversation. Also learned how to show sympathy and get work done within a five minute call.
good,"I have been a part of the Statefarm for 5 years as a customer for 10 or more, always good customer service on top of their clients with future services that Statefarm could offer. Don’t have no complaints just my agent retiring."
good,"An overall typical 9-5 schedule. Fast paced at times with seasonal ebbs and flows. Management was fun and high energy, while staying within the mission, and keeping goals first. A competitive but genuine environment, and that would have to be the high point of the job in my opinion. It brings out the best in sales driven environments when people are helping one another while still striving for their own goals. The most difficult part was dealing with cold call lists. They are usually intricate and take time to sort before starting the real work which is getting people to talk to you when they are finally off work and able to relax. It is also very difficult to create much customer loyalty when you get people to do something based solely on price, which for me is why 99% of cold call business occurred."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with.  Working claims setting an expected number per day was stressful.  Management was good.  I learned a lot.
good,Indeed will not let you proceed without filling out information on current or old employers. You will also have to write 150 characters before it will allow you to proceed.
good,I have greatly enjoyed my time working here. I have a great relationship with my department leadership and coworkers. It is great having the ability to assist customers and business partners daily
good,"Good company, great benefits, fun work environment, schedule flexibility, many job options, good management, attendance points system is not great because I could literally get shot and I’d still get in trouble for not showing up"
good,"A typical day at work was laid back.  I learned to Sale Policies to make a difference in peoples lives, such as Life Insurance.  Management was good and the Workplace was good.  The hardest part of the job was selling the Insurance.  The most enjoyable was the customers I waited on."
good,"Not the most exciting place to work as a developer given the industry they're in.."
good,I enjoyed working at State Farm. The only thing I did not enjoy so much was the compensation. There were a lot of requirements for very sub-par pay. If it wasn't for that I would recommend highly.
good,"Love to work with State Farm insurance, Very Good Learning experience and also nice to be here in the atmosphere, Work culture is good, always gives opportunity to think innovative."
good,State Farm is a large and an old company with all the general pros and cons of any large company. They try to keep them updated as per the latest trends.
good,Takes a great deal of patience along with dedication to be financially successful. Having a good relationship with the agent is key. Hardest part of the job is discussing things like death and accidents.
good,The compensation is competitive but itś expected to sacrifice your home life. The workload isn´t manageable and stressful. Work performance is based on statistics.
good,"Worked for a State Farm Agent."
good,"State Farm was a good place to work. It was flexible, interesting and rewarding. I would recommend it to job seeker."
good,Please see ratings listed within.  My 10 years of experience with State Farm was a pleasant experience. I would have stayed with the company had I been given a chance to advance within the company.
good,"I still work for State Farm, just looking to advance my career.  They do not offer any type of benefits, so its hard to make a career unless you are an agent."
good,The workplace was motivational and easy to work in. The agent in charge of my branch treated me with respect and as a professional. Work was rewarding and beneficial.
good,"I was a full time fully licensed representative at a local agency. I have no complaints. My boss was extremely nice and empowered us to make daily decisions. I had a unique role as I managed different aspects of my boss's business such as sales, sales data, premium retention."
good,Each day was different with different groups of BA's. My position was mostly helping BA's schedule meetings and take notes during those meetings. Verifying notes with lead BA.
good,"Great company to work for"
good,"Great company.. demanding but good. Great hours, great leadership and training. Will pay for your training and licensing if required for your position. A lot of room for growth."
good,the agent I worked for was a strange combination of micromanaging and not being present at the same time. BUT not all state farm offices are like that. There are many great agents out there.
good,they pay very well and you learn a lot about claim handling. Be prepared to work 70 plus hours a week. State farm sets the standard in the insurance industry for claim handling.
good,"I've learned a lot about different insurance products and how to sell to customers not knowing what they need or want.  Too much pressure on sales, and not necessarily doing what's moral."
good,State Farm is an above average employer.  The benefits package is exceptional.  Compensation is above average.  State Farm offers career advancement opportunities.
good,"Great training"
good,"The job itself was stressful, very demanding and seemed like production numbers are priority over quality. Management is kind of control, I joined as they were offering work from home in the near future and later decided not to offer."
good,Enjoyed my time working in the Austin regional office. Work enviornment was great and company training for advancement. Family oriented company and great work/life balance.
good,the company has changed since I was last there. when i got there it was laid back and the mangers really wanted to see you advance and do well. Now they micromanage and want to put more work on your plate with no pay.
good,"Overall great company and great people, I enjoyed working here but my office was closed permanently and the new office location was too far for me to commute daily."
good,"A balanced Lifestyle, okay leadership, always an interesting day. Co workers make a difference, pay structure matters. Must be organized, and consistent with follow ups."
good,The supervisors and project lead are very encouraging and supportive and it was a great experience to work with them and the company. I liked the 3 months that I spent there.
good,decent company. good work life balance.  culture is changing from past couple of years. salary is less than local market. career growth opportunities very limited
good,The atmosphere was incredible in multiple aspects. My manager at the time was a family member and gave me an intern position in order to understand what qualifies as office work.
good,"Good company and decent pay, I would recommend this company just do your research on the Agent you work for. This will determine your work environment."
good,"A typical day starts off by checking your email and any notifications and trying to close any and all policies. We also go into any open tasks and complete them. "
good,Great organization that is committed to serving the customer and also providing remarkable experiences. Financially strong and leader in the industry.
good,I enjoyed working here it was pretty simple and easy going. Many people that came in taught me a lot. I also got my licenses in many fields. My manager was very good at what he did.
good,"A typical day in the office would be pretty basic in terms of the pace of traffic with clients paying premiums to phone calls of insureds placing claims or follow up calls from adjusters."
good,"comprehensive training and support, set schedule and competitive pay, benefits are excellent. Diverse and inclusive staff with many opportunities for advancement"
good,"State Farm offers plenty of training from day one and continuously, especially for their culture. Working in the neighborhood in a local office is nice and you are able to meet many people and establish relationships."
good,The State Farm Insurance company in Portage Michigan is closing and that is why I left their employment.  I enjoyed learning about the auto insurance industry from them and would have stayed employed there had they not been closing that location.
good,My manager was amazing and the work environment was happy and relaxed. The job itself is repetitive. You must have a lot of patience and remain calm under pressure.
good,The company offers a clear way to achieve success there. The have a good training program. There is plenty of opportunity for advancement if you hope to run your own agency some day.
good,"Great people to work with and learn.  You can take courses to improve your talents."
good,Perception is everything here.Make sure to always be aware of your actions and who you're associated with. It may hinder you in the future. Work environment also depends on what department you work in. Some are more relaxed than others.
good,"A good company to work for.  Lots of benefits.  They have their own water park and mini-golf!  Relaxed atmosphere.  Many opportunities to learn and grow.  "
good,State Farm provides amazing opportunities for individuals to grow and develop with the company. Your agent is there to help you obtain your goals and set new ones.
good,"Company is good, management does it's best, however, with the current CEO and the profits plummeting a lot of benefits may be going out the door so I would be wary"
good,I myself work for an agent within State Farm. This agent is great with paid-time-off and help with balancing home/work life. He offers incentives for reaching goals and is by far one of the best managers I have ever had the pleasure of working for.
good,I have been employed with this company for 22 years and I have made life long friends.  Everyday is never the same in fire claims.  You are able to meet and help someone everyday recover from the unexpected.  Being a claim representative is very rewarding and fulfilling.
good,"I started at State Farm in the Life Response Center. While there, I took 50-90 calls a day from agents and customers with questions about general insurance or financial issues. I moved to Application Processing after a few months, and appreciated a more relaxed work environment. Both positions were rewarding and well compensated."
good,"Would have to be my co-workers.  We worked had a team and everyone was willing to help each other.  We work all together..if someone had a question, there was always someone there too help."

good,"The agent I worked for took the time to help me understand what it is that State Farm does. I appreciated what I was doing and felt good coming to work, knowing that my efforts were making a difference in peoples' lives."
good,There are many changes being implemented at State Farm. It was a terrific company to work for and I appreciated all of the opportunities that they afforded to me over the years.
good,"Typical day was just call after call. Interacting with the customers is typically a nice experience, but can sometimes get stressful. The rating system for calls, for internal rating, took a turn for the worst before I left. They started judging you on how well you conveyed emotion and sympathy, which is hard when you deal with 10+ calls in an hour on a busy Saturday."
good,"It was definitely the best place to gain experience in many different areas such as customer service, sales, etc. I would definitely go back to working for State Farm."
good,I learned alot about insurance from my boss. The only part of the job that i did not like was the cold calls to people who are not currently looking for insurance.
good,"Call potential review quotes, see if can get as many quotes as possible. Sales goals are hard to reach as only get paid on new customers only. Life insurance different to sell due to most people have term through work."
good,Great office environment.  Loved working with the clients and the office staff.  We worked together as a team and helped each other when necessary.  Nice place to work.
good,"Having never worked in the insurance industry before my training and knowledge that I gained was definitely an eye opener."
good,"Quiet, focused work place. Computer work, faxing, answering phones. Customer service. Hardest part is unhappy customers. Best part is getting along with my co-workers."
good,"On boarding and training were my best moments at State Farm, once they get you on the floor, they like to incorporate ""Non-Optional OT"" If you do not work your share of mandatory hours, you'll be labeled someone who is not a team player. Once this happens, you'll never be selected to do anything besides work at your desk."
good,"The agency I worked at was quick paced, friendly and thrived in a small town environment. It was not my intention to leave, but an opportunity came up that was too hard to pass up!"
good,It was a temporary job. It had it's moments. Management was fair. The workplace culture was good. I did enjoy the positive interactions with the customers.
good,"Good company.  However, chances for advancement were slow. The hours were good but very structured.  I enjoyed my co workers and my time at State Farm Insurance Company."
good,"Great place to work, unfortunately I was a temporary worker and the contract had ended. I would have still been an employee with the company but there were no full-time openings at the time. But I knew i wanted to be a long term employee of the insurance industry."
good,"full time work weeks"
good,I worked @ State Farm when first brought express claims to Dunwoody it was a great experience It was a just wrong time in my life. I was ill I had to leave for personal reason
good,"was satisfactory, overall good job, wasn't much to do, just called recent customers to take surveys and find out why they cancelled their auto insurance policy"
good,Gives great opportunity for professional growth. Loved my time being here. Learnt a lot and made great connections. The hardest part of the job was when we had tech breach meetings and project implementations
good,"I enjoyed working at this company. I came in to work, logged into my workstation, took calls and went home...simple process. Some days the calls were easy, some days I got some hard calls. There were resources in case I needed help so that was a plus. The department was made up of other areas as well including production teams, coaching teams, and techs. Depending on your area you were required to meet certain metric goals as part of the job: Handle time, hold time, wrap time, adherence, quality, and production for example. I enjoyed my job, and my co-workers. I did not like some of the changes that were being made that called for stricter regulations on the employees. That made the job stressful."
good,"Good company to work for, they have great benefits and work with work life balance . They will help you  grow if you put in the effort in wanting too."
good,Assist the claim reps and the management team to expedite the claim to ensure a result that is beneficial to the client as well as the company. And maintained the filing and salvage inventory.
good,"friendly environment, both my boss and co -workers are very friendly."
good,Working at State Farm has been a good time. I enough the day to day work. There are challenges to keep you busy and great help options if you have any question.
good,"very structured, statefarm systems, underwriting and billing are the best. very simple to understand, a customer could walk in and quote themselves, the system is just that easy"
good,I would come in at 9am and make calls all day. I would get off at 3pm. I did a lot of cold calling and got a lot of experience with handling consumers over the phone.

good,Very professional environment.  KPIs are reasonable.  Time off of 6 hours earned every 2 weeks.  Great team environment.  Phone requirements are tough but fair
good,"You will most likely be asked to relocate at some point during your employ. So If you love helping people going through difficult situations & don’t mind relocating State Farm may be just what you’re looking for.  Of course, State Farm has many opportunities outside of claims too."
good,This was my first job in the insurance industry and started in the claims dept. Unfortunately I had to move back home. Otherwise I would have still been there. I enjoyed working there and giving me the experience to move forward in my career.
good,"Overall, the pay was good as well as the hours and benefits. I learned quite a bit and even advanced within the first 6 months. Management was fair with the employees. Everyone worked together as a team and got along very well."

good,"Working in a State Farm agent's office was a very casual experience for me. I rather enjoyed it, however the pay and benefits were not enough for what most people need. I left due to that and lack of advancement options."
good,"learn a lot and learn fast, the shift varies from early morning to late evenings, and can include weekends. Shifts can start off slow, but can quickly get business during weekends and after 5pm."
good,I tried applying many times to State Farm before making it in. They usually don't hire much outside of their walls. I learned a lot in my short time working there. I will say The corporate world is not for everybody and their way of running their operations did feel like a brainwash type of labor. For some people its very manageable if you feel the extra need of job security.
good,It is all about the agent you have as your manager which will determine your experience altogether.  My first agent was spectacular (2011-2012).  My second agent was mediocre (3 months in 2015).
good,"There are wonderful opportunities to make a positive impact with the company and the surrounding community with State Farm.  The character of the people who work there and and culture built is inviting.  Like with any entity, there are challenges to be faced there; however, these challenges give rise to many opportunities one can create for themselves."

good,State farm was a great company to work for and was a friendly company as well. Working as the mail clerk led me to interact with almost every one in the building and I truly enjoyed the day to day.
good,They were a good comapny when I started in 1985 and stayed good for several  years. In 2000 the managment changed to a younger set and the ways to do things changed. We started doing things they way we had but called them by diffferent names. Now the turnover is big and the level on knowledge for the Field Employees has greatly diminished.
good,"I love working at State Farm, in spite of the challenging job security factors. The workplace culture is impeccable for a company of its magnitude. If you simply do what is expected of you, which is quite clearly laid out for you, you are quickly aware of how highly valued your employment is. If you do not meet expectations, the company does a terrific job getting you there without putting you down or making you feel inadequate. If you exceed expectations, you will be rewarded, often with more than just a pat on the back."
good,"I enjoyed working at State Farm and being in the warming environment. I always had assistance when it was needed. Typical day at work consisted of at least 125 calls, spread out, but maintaining time."

good,"I enjoyed my time while there. There is a high turn over rate, but that is normal when you are in a call center environment and there are metrics. If you have a good manager then great, but if not then long days and short nights. Every six to ten months they change your teams and work schedule, putting you in s bidding war with other employees for a decent schedule."
good,Benefits are very good as well as the work and life balance. The workload as a claim representative can be challenging at times but overall a very good place to work!

good,Answering and directing phone calls/clients. I applied payments to customers accounts as well as basic info regarding their accounts. Made deposits and ran errands for the Agent.
good,A typical day would include answering calls regarding customer issues and needs during the claims process. set up repairs and rental cars. make liability decisions and set up subrogation for collection from other parties.
good,State Farm Insurance is a great place it work.  I remember it feeling like the closeness of a small business even though the company is pretty huge!  They do a lot for their employees though.  It's just important that you are willing to relocate.

good,"IT is going through a large transformation that I've been impacted with.  I decided to seek another place of employment.  It's a large place with massive organizational changes that are highly needed.  They are not a high small software/application development shop, as there is a lot of complex integrations that require approvals for almost any type of change, thus not making anything easy.   Moving quickly to an Agile shop, I'd say about 40% of the work here is already agile."
good,Overall it was a good place to work. With any job it has it's pros and cons. I learned a lot about the insurance industry to being a better customers service representative from feedback from management. Working with my co-workers was the best part of the job they were like family.
good,"Loved working this promo event, I was able to meet some new people from all over America. This event payed very well, managers were very outgoing and loved working for their company. Only issue is there are long hours of just standing."

good,"State Farm Insurance is experiencing a lot of challenging changes that are greatly impacting us as the Agents. It is becoming harder to grow our business at the rate we need to stay successful. A typical work day at my agency is balancing one on one customer service with new client sales. We make on average about 100 outbound sales calls each day to generate new business. I learn something new everyday about my team, my customers and people in general. We are self managed as a business owner. I have created processes and procurers for my team to have continued success on a daily basis. My office staff and myself are a very closely net group of people and we take care of each other like family. The hardest part of this job is dealing with all the restrictions the company has created for us.  I do love helping people every day and that is the best part of my job."
good,"State Farm is currently going through a lot of changes as a company. At this time, there is very little room for advancement in the company. Overall State farm is a great company to work for. In the department I support, the workload is very fast pace and can be heavy during peak season (summer months)"

good,"free breaks, flexible schedules available"
good,"Tops off to the company for being so awesome at what they do, however; their choice in management leave questions at the tip of my tongue. Managers are trained to be extremely authoritarian and typically have no room for error with the employees. Most supervisors typically have a conscious when it comes to these matters, however if you happen to have management with soulless eye syndrome, I would relocate your position asap. "
good,Typical work day involves being on the phone most of the day. You learn to develop people skills because you are speaking with customers on a day to day basis. Hardest part of the job is to constantly be on the phones because everyday is different. Especially when disasters hit  there are not really any down times. The most enjoyable part of the days are the few times you get to be off the phones to attend meetings and learn new things. They encourage new ideas to make the company a better place for customers and employees.
good,"For myself, working for State Farm was one of my most memorable experiences. Working for the company taught me a lot about the insurance industry, as well as the terminology and jargon associated with automobile insurance. It provided me with what I needed to launch my career forward and was a great starting position. That being said, I felt as though I had reached a point in this role where I was ready to move on and take on new challenges. As such, I am seeking to move forward with a new role and a new company!"

The management was quite good . The workplace was busy at unpredictable hours and got stressful. The hardest part of the job was the level of multitasking. I really enjoyed the training I received."
good,The opportunity to work for a fortune 500 company was a great experience. Their training system they use incorporates fun activities while still balancing out the learning material which makes it very easy to learn and understand your job abilities. Daily work like consisted of taking phone calls to file claims for their members. On a  daily average you take about 50-60 calls a day. Which is balanced out by friend management and great co-workers so it makes the work load easier to handle. Overall great a place to learn and work for.
good,Would help customers who came into the office or gave us a call. I would write the homeowners for the office. I enjoyed working at State Farm.. with it being a small office it becomes like a second family.
good,Was known for its excellence in training employees and being family friendly. Customer service is paramount. Demands professionalism from its workers.
good,your experience in an agents office will vary depending on the quality of the agent. both of the agentsi have worked for have been pretty good. I like State Farm just not my role. Agency is completely separate from corporate.
good,"The office I worked at provided a supportive and happy atmosphere where the sales and customer service team members could work in tandem. My agent was a great guy; I will miss working at this office, but sales was just not for me."

good,"I would come in and check voicemail, then start taking calls from customer and input the customer claims for their home or automobile in to the system and give claim number and give the agent that will be contacting them information."
good,"A typical day would include answering phones and answering questions our clients had about their policies. My job was to help our customers set up a new claim for their vehicles. I also had the authority to make decisions on liability. The environment was call center type of environment. Management was very nice. My manager always made himself available to us. Before working at State Farm, I had never worked in insurance before. Insurance was very new to me. I learned how to be compassionate towards people in their time of need. I learned about how to manage my time more effectively. The hardest part of the job is to hear people when they call in and describe what type of accident they've been involved in. Some calls can be very hard because you are speaking with people who are in dire circumstances at times. You may hear stories where they've been in an accident and there are multiple injuries or even a death. So, that can be very hard to listen to. The most enjoyable part is knowing that you are helping them. Some are just thankful that you are being empathetic and nice to them in their time of need. That is"

good,compensation with this company is everything. They pay very well. They only offer temporary positions at this time. why am I writing a review right now
good,"They are NOT the company they were 10 years ago, let alone 30 years ago. Don't expect to move up the pay scale like the old days and don't expect to retire from there. Read the stuff on thelayoff.com for all the info you need!"
good,Workflow was easy and working with other employees was a joy! You do have some Managers that likes to micromanage as if you are in high school but other than that it is a great place to work!

good,State Farm was a good company to work for. Offices Nationwide and understood work / life balance. Excellent benefits. Unfortunately closed office in Buffalo area.
good,"At the time I worked at State Farm, it was enjoyable for the most part. I especially loved my position during my last 6-7 years. I was in a position that my integrity and work ethics paid off (not financially). I was in an office pretty much alone, but my work was always done, I was dependable and I received many accolades from my peers, management, and outside customers."
good,Interacting with applicants and customer to provide new hire information. Manage technical support for the analysts and managers in agency career track department. Producing and writing weekly reports; manage recruiter’s file; organizing executive interviews
good,"Liked the job. Worked for a new agent helped set up a new office. "
good,"I believe the company is a great company, just not the agent I worked for. He promised me a lot of things and didn't deliver on any of them. It depends all who you work for."
good,"The calls come back to back, but the customers are totally worth it. I never leave work feeling overwhelmed. Calls are quick and easy. For the most part, we are provided all the resources we need for each and every call."
good,"Busy office, not too many clients walking in most were phone conversations and attending to their insurance needs. Serviced all the spanish speaking clients."

In Indiana the commission pay was much, much higher than Nebraska. I moved to a service role as agents here do not pay much more than service staff for commissions, it was not worth my personal stress about meeting sales goals to do a sales job vs the ease and less stress for almost the same pay as in a service role"

I learned about the policy and meanings better to explain and help customers in need.
good,"I enjoy working at a community who truly cares about their customers. Every decision made is with them in mind. It is a fast paced, constantly changing working environment but notice is always given. They try to have a consistent management style but every team manager is different, you just have to hope you are placed with a manager who enjoys their job too."
good,"State Farm offers a lot of mobility options, decent compensation and benefits, and a stable if unchallenging work environment. Corporate mentality has definitely taken over the formerly more family-feeling atmosphere, but if you need a place to start out, it's good for that. If you can rise quickly in the ranks and are willing to relocate, the benefits are quite nice and the long-term projections are much better."
good,"I truly enjoyed my 8 years working at State Farm however even as an exceeds performance employee they hindered advancement by only giving those opportunities to folks who were flexible to move anywhere in the country, I was flexible to about 5 states and was passed up twice for positions that went to less experienced individuals who had agreed to go anywhere in the US."
good,Structured environment with a heavy focus on production and quality. Great training and with managers that care. More schedule flexibility in a production role vs. contact center.

good,"State Farm is a great company but as an employee of an independently owned agency, you are subject to that particular office which is not governed by corporate as far as how staff is treated."
good,"Enjoyed my time at this company; however, over the course of my employment changes were made within the company that focused more on results than on customer satisfaction."
good,"Set hours with a daily 45-minute lunch, no weekends or on-call duties in my area. Great coworkers, friendly management, and steady work for everyone."
good,Loved working with people and being able to help them plan for their  future. I learned a lot about insurance needs. Did not like the cold calling required but enjoyed conversations.

good,The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people to recover from the unexpected. Every day is a new opportunity to help someone get through a difficult situation.
good,"I worked from 1990 until 2005 at State Farm.   In the beginning, it was a much more work/life place to work than it was when I left."
good,Overall a good company to work for no issues worked there as a temp for 7 months was offered a full-time pay was not want I wanted. I had just moved from another location.
good,"Working there as a call center agent is amazing, the perks are amazing, but sometimes the amount of work is slow and repetitive, by that I mean there will be a lot of free time, in certain occasions, so if you like that, a job that is simple and easy to understand, then this is the job for you."
good,"I have been working at state farm for almost 7 months and can say that it is a great place to grow and gain experience for a variety of careers.  They treat their employees really well and have great benefits.  They provide a lot of breaks,  company parking garages and have a full cafeteria.  The PTO system is really nice giving you quite a bit of time off when you start.  It is definitely a great starting point if you are trying to get into a corporate position because they offer tons of advancement through the company as long as you have good attendance. "

good,"I loved what I did , i take pride in all my positions. I just took a little to long to get my insurance license. I was temporary as well."
good,Company who takes their customers seriously. They know the value of their customers and a lot of the work and training revolve around their clients needs and wants within reason. They take the time to appropriately train staff and provide everything needed so that their employees can do their jobs well. Depending on which department you work in depends on the hours you can work. Sometimes the call centers require late hours that some may not find conducive to their family needs.
good,Fast paced learning on the job. I learned to be independent in setting structure for my daily work environment. I learned a lot about taking care of clients needs and how to search out other needs they may have through conversing about their lives. Management was excellent in teaching the correct way to interact with clients but could be somewhat micromanaging. Coworkers were also very helpful in teaching the ropes of the insurance business. Hardest part of the job was the amount of learning in such a small time frame. The most enjoyable as always is interacting with clients on a daily basis.
good,"I worked at a local State Farm for a short time while in high school with marketing events, and as an assistant at their office. Duties included mailing out insurance quotes, scanning documents, and preparing gift bags for special events. Management was great and so were the hours!"

good,"Great opportunity for young adults looking to work their way up in a company. Only downfall, no 4 year degree means less money. But they will pay for it after a year."
good,"Co workers are awesome, but only thing is its part time and i am in need of more pay or more hours. I love coming in the morning and having our small talks with everyone. Everyone is so nice and gets along."
good,"good learning environment, fun co-workers, great compensation bonuses. I learned a lot of valuable knowledge as far as insurance goes."
good,The workplace was usually busy.There was a lot to learn but training was provided and co-workers were very helpful. I enjoyed working with my customers and my agent who was very supportive.

good,"State Farm Ins used to be a family oriented company in the department I have worked in my entire career up until 2008 when they changed to a forecasting/scheduling culture driven by numbers.  It seems as though they are trying to weed out the tenured employees that have maxed out in their current role in pay and replace them with less experienced, younger and less compensated employees.  "

good,"The days were 8 hour, 1st shift days. I dealt with a variety of customers and personalities. I learned how to problem solve with accounts, deal with difficult and pleasant customers, and write/assess a variety of insurance policies and risks. Co-workers were good to work with as was the management. The hardest part of the job was trying to fix problems with accounts with ""our hands tied"" when corporate ultimately had the power to make the changes. The enjoyable part of the job was the pay."
good,"Good friendly company, having latest technologies and work nature is good. Planning to change just because of seeing better position"
good,A typical day change very fast. It can involve educating clients on the best way to protect their family and then go to a death of a client dealing with getting the life insurance policy paid out. I have learned that nothing is for sure in life through my experiences with insurance. The management and co-workers are always willing to support you and help with you with anything you need. The hardest part is dealing with losing a client but the most enjoyable part is knowing you have done everything to protect the clients family needs.

good,During my time here I not only received the encouragement to continue my education and keep pushing forward to improve not only myself for my family but for myself because everything starts with you and they always made me feel that I was someone and I could do anything as long as I put in the effort the outcome depended on me and what I was willing to overcome to be the best.

This agent was very hands-on and he offered motivation and incentive for our sales and service.  I had many dedicated clients that would deal only with me as my personal as well as professional relationships with my customers were excellent.  I thoroughly enjoyed my job in sales & service and the most enjoyable part of my job was helping the clients with their insurance needs.  The hardest part of the job was the very hectic days especially when there had been severe inclement weather so we would work evening/week-end, etc. to help clients with the claims"

good,"This was an office of 4 employees and 1 agent.  There was no turn over during the nine years I worked there and we all worked well  with each other  which provided a comfortable and happy work environment.  A typical day consisted of helping clients get the best coverage at the best price.  I enjoyed that each day had different and unique challenges.

Working in a field with such frequently changing guidelines helped me learn the importance of continuing education."

good,I got to help individuals make detrimental decisions on various  polices. I got to experience lots of different types of clients and personalities. as well as developing a very strong set of customer service skills  and public relations.
good,"The customer service part was generally fun and quite satisfying. Explaining and educating the customer about the various options available to them was the best part--seeing that ""Aha"" moment when they finally understand what they've been spending their hard earned money for and the advantages to them. On a typical day I might make 20 calls about late payments, do at least one comprehensive review of the coverage a client had and how best to manage it, solicit and write one piece of new business per day, field at least 10 calls with existing clients about needing more coverage for an addition, such as a new car, new driver in the household, etc. I learned that people have various sensibilities that you must always be aware of, and learn to identify and deal with as quickly as possible. Learn which co-workers provide support and assistance as needed and which don't want anything but the boss's undivided attention--for example, which have the client's needs foremost and which have their own private agenda based on their wants and needs."

good,"I loved my job and feel that I was very effective in gathering all the information for the downstream claim handlers in auto or fire/home claims.  I was hired Monday through Thursday 8a - 1p which was a perfect combination with my availability.  I keep my grandson on Thursday p.m. until Saturday and sometimes on Sunday as his parents are Police Officers.  There was a Schedule Bid and State Farm did not accept even one of my first three choices even though I would come in earlier or stay later on those days.  Therefore I am forced to seek other employment.  I was never late and tried to take PTO when I had to be absent, i.e. ice."
good,My previous jobs were very productive and i loved the chance to learn more in each and every one of my jobs.

good,Since moving back to Massachusetts and starting with State Farm I have learned a completely different system.   I worked for the same company in Florida but that was with an agents office.  The hardest part of my job in MA is that we do not write new business and it limits the type of business we can write and we turn a lot of people away.  The most enjoyable part of my day is negotiating the system and helping the customers.  The job is a combination of service and sales.   I work with may departments within State Farm to get the job done.
good,"Answering a lot of phones"
good,"Great company to work for, one on one customer interactions. Working with the public, opportunity to make a difference."
good,A very bad environment to work in if you are over 40 or have any medical problems.  I was told by one supervisor that she would share my medical information with all the other supervisors after she wanted to know about my medical situations.  You can't trust any of the managers the environment is childish and the company lies to you constantly about your hours and schedule.
good,This company gave me the opportunity to explore a different career path within the insurance industry and paid for my licensing and education as an insurance producer.

You should be busy all day with walkins and phone calls and as a customer service representative you will learn a handful of task and objectives. Management by statefarm corporate is amazing, and as far as the statefarm agent i previously worked for, the office manager was very knowledgable about the insurance field and the agent was great just rarely found in the office when needed by customers. Hardest part is just explaining rate increases and assuring that the customer is happy with any financial products they may have to avoid any cancellations, and the most enjoyable part would be those clients that surely show you or express gratitude for the work and attention you have placed on there accounts."
good,"Most days were somewhat structured. "
good,"I enjoyed the 6 plus years working at State Farm.  My co-workers were knowledgeable and willing to help in any situation. The days were long and stressful, but knowing that you are helping people with their life insurance policies helps you get through the day. The hardest parts of the job was trying to get in as many calls as management deemed necessary, adhering to the break schedule when calls go over, and remembering all the state requirements for applications and payment options."
good,A typical day for me is answering phone calls regarding claims. I deal with all parts of the claim from beginning to end. I do work on a team environment so everyone is able to help out. The hardest part is dealing with upset customers. However it is a really good feeling when you turn a bad call into a good call.

good,"Greet customers, handle payments, make cold sales calls, research new products; manager not willing to provide training opportunities; employees obtained individual training ; I acquired my Property and Casualty License; my coworkers were great and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was making the insurance sales; the most enjoyable part was the satisfaction in obtaining my insurance license!"
good,You would learn new things everyday. We sold many different kinds of policies that you had to know each one to the fullest so you were able to give the best advice and service to your clients. Helping the clients was the best part of the job. We worked well as a team and could depend on one another.
good,Enjoyed making people feeling secure with all of their insurance needs.
good,(1) TBD.
good,I worked hard at State Farm writing new business. It was a good place to work. The hardest thing about my job was trying to get our current customers to add more coverage. With the economy the way it was people just don't want to spend money especially on life insurance even though they knew they needed it.
good,I would come to my computer plug in head set type in my password and basically start typing pre recorded insurance claims. A majority of the work was trying to dictate what the claims rep was saying. Management was very helpful for me anytime i had a question they got back to me as soon as they could in a timely manner.
good,"Prospect for new clients, probe to discover needs, and close sales for all product lines (auto, fire, life, and bank). Develop marketing opportunities to increase sales on specific products. Conduct insurance and financial service reviews for clients (face-to-face and over-the-phone)."
good,I worked for over 21 years with State Farm in various positions. My last position was as an Auto Claims Processor. I assisted insurers and claimants with auto claims and injuries. The management of this company was excellent. I made many long lasting friends with co-workers. The hardest part of my job with making hard decision about claims the customers did not like. The most enjoyable part of the job was the training and all friendships I have.
good,"State Farm was a wonderful place to work. My coworkers were all friendly and caring, more like a second family."
good,"Worked their 10 years ago so my knowledge is outdated. However, while there it was a friendly work environment, the work quickly became repetitive so a love of insurance claims is essential."
good,Daily activities included; seeing walk in customers and reviewing policies and collecting monies due. Assisting customers with questions regarding coverages. Quoting insurannce prices and coverages. Tending to customer needs regarding deductibles and policies as well as insurance coverage to suit their needs. Inquiring about life insurance needs and binding coverages to meet the needs of clients.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for State Farm. Very organized, low stress environment. Constant training. Great benefits!"
good,It was great to have face to face client interaction. Small office was a great experience!
good,I loved my time at State Farm and I would go back in a second. I only left because I moved from IL to KY and there weren't any open jobs in KY. I hope to find a job with SF again in the future.
good,"I liked working here, i had a great boss. He was great to work with."
good,Day to day experience about different insurance cases led to gain knoledge in the insurance industry
good,My experience was very good. I had a wonderful supervisor who was instructive but not haughty. Working with customers was a plus. The pace varied quite a bit from day to day.
good,"I would recommend this company to anyone. Great benefits, leadership, and is an all around company."
good,The owner was very passionate about building her business. She was very considerate of her employees. Unfortunately she had to sell the company and move

good,"Complied insurance policies for agents, proofread auto policies. Typed reports and correspondence. Processed incoming and outgoing mail. Retrieved, updated, and corrected files. Accounting duties included accounts receivables and payroll."
good,I enjoyed working at State Farm as each day was a different day. I had many responsibilities to perform each day and I really enjoy the fast pace.
good,State Farm is a great company that really cares about their employees. I enjoyed my time there. My co-workers were great. It was more like a family. I really had the opportunity to learn a lot while I was there.
good,Good job security. Good employer. But career development is very slow and big hierachy.
good,"Overall Statefarm is great company to work for the training is great.  And, they promote and encourage growth.  If you had to choose an insurance company to work for I would go with them."
good,"Handling claims is a stressful and thankless job at times, but it is rewarding when you help someone. There is high demand to meet metrics and it can be stressful, but the team is collaborative and helpful when  you need it, and feedback is often given for improvement."
good,"State Farm cares about the education of their work force, and ensuring they have the tools to be successful.  I would recommend a position where you own your work, instead of working from a queue.  Job evaluation is very metric driven, and not all managers are able to fairly assess their staff using those metrics and other data."
good,I was a State Farm Employee for over 25 years and I had a good experience working this company. I worked various positions and traveled to a lot of different cities. Unfortunately it came to an end because my department shut down due to budget cuts and the company did not want to pay for relocation as they had done in the past.
good,"I liked my job here and I always knew what I would be doing each day, but  I was getting bored of it. I needed something else to excite me and needed challenges."
good,"I worked in a relatively small office, which allowed me to become close and feel comfortable with all my coworkers yet maintain my professional persona as well. A lot of my interaction with clients was via phone call, email etc so I became very confident in speaking and explaining procedures in other ways rather than in person directly. We did also have the daily walk ins or appointments scheduled which allowed me to upkeep and maintain my person to person communication. Aside from strengthening my customer service skills I acquired time management, organization, and accuracy which were all vital roles in the day to day insurance business."
good,Great structure and compensation is fair comparable to the same position overall. Company focus on welfare and believing in further education with the assistance from the company.
good,"I enjoy my time at State Farm, the people around you become like family. The workload is manageable. Just with any call center the calls are tough but if you love helping people you will always get a feeling that you have made a difference"
good,Environment for growth and value as a team member.  Education and tool available.  Good culture and flexibility for a balance of professional and personal goals.
good,"its a great place to work but other places do pay more, the hubs are so huge you are just a number, its a great place to work while in college or school"
good,I am able to use my bilingual and customer  service skills. I enjoy team work and people I work with at the office. Management is extremely helpful. The best part of the job is being able to solve problems for my customers. The toughest part would be trying to keep up with call volume. The most enjoyable part is to socialize with my peers.
good,"I learned how to work with large groups of people on special projects. The work place culture was positive, my manager provided great support. I was respected by the company."
good,I love the fact that I get to help people with making decisions on there home or vehicle needs. This job has really taught me good work ethics and people skills.
good,"Handling claims is a stressful and thankless job at times, but it is rewarding when you help someone. There is high demand to meet metrics and it can be stressful, but the team is collaborative and helpful when  you need it, and feedback is often given for improvement."
good,"I learned a lot and grew in the claims environment as time went on.  Tech changes were manageable.  Good working environment, great co-workers.  Would have loved to continue working with the company."
good,"State Farm offers a great paid training program to help you understand the job and tasks you will be performing. Management and coworkers are always willing to help you, you just need to ask! The hardest part of the job is memorizing state laws and regulations but it gets easier because you always have the information available to you."
good,State Farm is a good company to work for but there is not enough training for claims associates. After training you will go out on the floor not knowing everything and have to jump right on the phone. Work schedules are randomly given out and be prepared to work a shift you don’t want everyone does NOT get Mon-Fri. My Team manager and team members were the best part about my job. If customer service is not your expertise you probably should stay away
good,If you get on the right team if not then managment sucks. Fast past.  Rules and lots of them.  Call center job set and take calls all day. No hang up.
good,State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company is a great place to learn about insurance. The work life balance was also a great and the position was very flexible.
good,I loved my office.  It was a great work environment and I made good commissions where I was.  I only left because of my move.  If they played as well here in VA I would work for them again!
good,"Data entry and customer service, management was nice, busy, very diverse culture, being treated fairly, meeting others and learning about the company."
good,It was a great place to work. At times the claims work was overwhelming but we worked through it handling large case loads. Team work atmosphere. Benefits were great.
good,Investigate insurance claims and determine the extent of insurance company’s liability concerning property damage and negotiate claim settlements and recommend litigation when settlement cannot be negotiated. Overall a great company to growth with.
good,"I really loved working there. I ended up having to relocate. But overall, this job is great. The environment is great and the team is great! I loved leaving the systems and doing all the computer work. The printing, faxing, scanning and all that good stuff. I had lots of fun doing it!"
good,"I worked in the call center so it was pretty bureaucratic, but the culture helps and all of the amenities that they have to offer on the campus make you feel spoiled."
good,The Call Center had long hours with a lot of opportunities for over time. Great benefits but lacked the ability to advance with the company. State Farm gave me a lot of experience and education and that is greatly appreciated.
good,"There are many jobs available and great pay. Although pay might be slightly less than other insurance companies, the location, culture and work load is less stressful than competitors. State Farm’s benefits are also quite amazing! Part timers and full timers both have access to benefits and after 5 years with the company, you’re eligible to participate in the pension plan. It’s a wonderful company that listens to its employees and I’m proud to work here."
good,Most offices have amazing leaders. Not a lot of micromanaging and flexibility was amazing. Overall a good place to work.  Ive worked in 2 offices for State Farm and the owners have always been amazing and understanding. The work is a little redundant but can be very fulfilling if you really care about your customers.   The job can be very rewarding if you are there for the right reasons.
good,"I learned about time management"
good,"Workplace was too big for my taste. No single employee could make much of a difference. Too many managers, not enough people doing relevant and important work."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the fast paced environment  The employees were great to work with.  Strong learning development.  Very diverse culture and enjoyed working with so many different types of people.
good,"The company has gone through a lot of changes recently, jobs were lost, people had to relocate, retire, or were terminated. Lots of tenured employees are gone."
good,"super relaxed  loved working there "
good,"Good company to work for. Enjoyed the relationships established within the company.  Service driven, committed to its policy holders and their insuring agreement."
good,"Although the job could be stressful, there was always someone available to assist. If my manager was unavailable, I could count on another one to provide support."
good,Not the most exciting job. You get yelled at by agents and their staff as well as customers who are unhappy about their policies. The good part was that I was able to attend college while I worked full time.
good,"I had the opportunity to work for two agents while with State Farm. The differences were stark and dependent upon the age of the agency and how long the agent had been in practice. The newer agent was focused on sales and cold-calling, which left me feeling burned out. The more seasoned agent was more willing to work his book of business and did not require cold-calling on leads."
good,"Overall, State Farm is a really great and for filling company that looks less about making that extra dollar and more at helping people be covered with insurance for whatever life throws at them. The only thing that threw me off was having a very new agent. I'm not saying all new agents don't know what their doing, but I would recommend being wary of who you will be working with and how much time you will be spending around that person."
good,"Writing Policies "
good,Typical day would be taking inbound sales calls from customers needing insurance. Culture is laid back but pay is stagnant. Schedule is flexible mostly for students but if you have major bills their part time shedule will not pay you enough. Full time is available but the hours are horrible. 330-12pm to be exact. Mandatory weekend and points system for attendance. Sales position is barely any commision so do not get excited on any commision talk. Overall good company but just pick a well paying position in order to make ends meet. Great benefits no auto discounts. Lots of basic customer service calls in a sales environment and out dated systems.
good,the insurance agent I worked for was welcoming and the door was always open to his office. He encouraged asking questions and was always willing to show me how to use certain programs.
good,"State Farm offered a great work culture.  The training offered prepared you for the role you would take and give you the opportunity to apply the knowledge before you started in that role.  Once inside the company your job was secure and it was reinforced to you.  The company however viewed your role as one that was equivalent in another department, regardless if you had any interactions with that department.  ie.  Claims Adjuster in Automobile was the same as an Injury adjuster or Property Adjuster.  The company would treat you positively but when new roles in other departments such as Property would open up, they would often take inexperienced people from outside the company and train them instead of letting you move over.  Other times they would let you move over, if a position was available however you would not receive an increase in compensation as they viewed the move as a lateral one."
good,"The pay combined with the benefits package makes the company competitive.  When I was there, you could become vested in their pension plan (defined benefit, not defined contribution like 401Ks)  if you stayed for 5 years.  I'm not sure if since then they've moved exclusively to providing 401K plans, but during my time there both were available, and they matched your 401K contributions up to a certain amount."
good,Pay is not large enough for the responsibilities that come along with the position of being a State Farm Team Member.  Management is friendly and laid back.
good,Fun place to work.  Took me some time to get up to speed because I was afraid I was going to miss something on a claim. Once I figured out how to review new claims and police reports I met or exceeded my productivity rate requirements. My first manager was new to her role as well so it was a learning curve for both of us.
good,Best training program in the Insurance industry.  They do an excellent job of investing in their employees.  They have the top insurance products and highly rated for claims and customer service.
good,"The work enviroment was excellent and very laid back, everyone had fun together. There is a very high expectation to preform your job well, as should be expected. Sales members face very high pressure to meet sales quotas and are underpaid for their efforts in my opinion. Also no benefits are offered."
good,"Great place to work and advance . Discounts and different departments galore.  Able to.onatin license and use for a life time. Really need to.move to Houston but there is no hub in that city "
good,Very good morale within the company. Most good jobs and promotions felt like they primarily went to Bloomington (HQ). It was a fun and generally laid back atmosphere.
good,"I worked in a few Agent's offices and the environments differed greatly."
good,Loved my boss and all the people I worked with. Our office had its slow days and had a few days where you didn’t have time to even think. But you learned how to get through those busy days.
good,"Took claim information from customers, on the phone most of the time.  talking to customers, who call in about their insurance claim.  Stressful job, great co workers"
good,It was a calm and enjoyable work environment. My coworkers treated me with respect and kindness. I was not overwhelmed nor stressed out while working there.
good,"Friendly co-workers, great customers.  Agent was under a lot of pressure so it was sometimes stressful, but we all worked as a team to make this agency successful."
good,Great Company to work for. Opportunity for advancement within company is pretty good if willing to relocate currently. On the job training when I started was A+.
good,State Farm insurance is an excellent workplace area the environment is awesome you learn many different things I learned how to write out car insurance and how to pivot to products when making sales for the company the hardest part of the job was the learning process how to use the different software. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday.
good,"State Farm was a great opportunity. Growth from the lawn care business I had started previously was unprecedented and I regrettably had to leave after a few short months. Overall, State Farm was a great opportunity."
good,State Farm provides a very good opportunity to learn on the job as an intern. They have a very good program set up during the summer to get you involved with other interns.
good,"State Farm has a history of being a good place to work with good benefits, pension, and decent job security. They do their best to be open to any kind of person. However, lately the culture has changed somewhat.  In the past it felt like we were all one big family with the same goals in mind. But recently, the company has begun to be more like any other big corporation and job security has definitely decreased. The focus seems to be all the bottom line."
good,"I love working for statefarm, excellent culture and very understandable leadership. Statefarm offers their employees excellent benefits how the salary could be a little better."
good,It's basically just like any other call center but with insurance. I work part time (24 hours) a week and I like it. Some days there will be calls in queue and others there could be 2-4 minutes between a call. Management will always push for advancement if you are interested. I've been here for about 2 years and I've never had any issues.
good,I had a very good career at State Farm.  I worked there for 20 years.  The company underwent an enterprise wide reorganization and my job was moved to locations outside of California.
good,"Underwriting Flood Insurance was my most rewarding job at State Farm. It was complex, but interesting. I provided quotes, reviewed cancellation requirements, processed applications and worked with our corporation partners to update processes and create new positions. The hardest part of my job was leaving it. I loved everything about it."
good,"Lately it's been a great change to work in State Farm. Handling incoming calls from customers during one of their worse times is challenging but being there to help them cope and reassuring them that we are here to help is really rewarding. You get to work in a cubicle with team mates that are around you during your shift, although they may not have the same shift as yourself, they're there to help. "
good,"Office is closing. Most jobs are being moved to 5 regional offices and the company wants the employees to move."
good,You have to be able to relocate...most work is being moved to 3 southern states.  The company provides a great career opportunity for those new to the industry or workforce and able to be mobile in where they are located.
good,"Typical work days are not stressful and the work is pretty easy."
good,"I was given plenty of opportunities to grow within the company. "
good,The company was more employee centric and really cared about their employees.  That focus translated to employee satisfaction and a more engaged workforce.  The leadership had the autonomy to show their employee appreciation through different functions within the office.
good,"State Farm is a great place to work.  The culture has changed and the focus for the company has changed. They are consolidating processes and no longer owe buildings.  The company is downsizing as a result of the need for fewer employees."
good,State Farm Insurance is reliable upon the people they hire.  It takes someone with great customer service skills and being part detective to discover what a client will need.  You must be willing to open up to the client to build a relationship of trust.
good,"Worked at an agency in Powder Springs, GA.  It was a great experience and would continue working with them.  It required lots of cold calling and working with many different types of people."
good,"I’ve enjoyed my time here. The company is going through transition that is needed, but it makes the environment unstable and uncertain. State Farm Insurance will emerge stronger."
good,Great place to work. Stable company. Great benefits. Multiple departments. A lot of job opportunity. Opportunity for advancement. Relocation benefits.
good,"Really enjoyed my time with the company, work environment was awesome very laid back. I loved the staff, but not very considerate home and family accommodations."
good,I was not meant to have a desk job and this was temporary for me as I had different career goals outside of insurance. There are a lot of changes which makes advancement difficult. There are quotas to meet for metrics. It is a call center in the claims department for Express. The pay is less then other companies for this position. The benefits are fantastic though from Healthcare options to the discounted rates for employees for almost anything you can think of. I enjoyed working here. I loved my coworkers. The environment strives to motivate it's employees on a daily basis.
good,Great experience. I love my manager. The company culture is relaxed and there is always a lot of opportunity to grow here. So many different things to do.
good,"I liked working there because it was a small office, so everyone knew you, it was very personal. Unless you pass the exam to get your license, you really aren't able to move up anywhere besides being a receptionist. For my office, my boss did not pay to take my exam, so $70 to take the exam each time you fail, is not good, especially when you only get paid $10 an hour to start out with."
good,"This company provided me with great opportunities and security for over 27+ years.  There was opportunity for learning, advancement and growth.  I'm grateful for my career there."
good,"As a Claims Specialist, you receive inbound calls and record claims.  Using your policy knowledge, you advise the customer of what coverages they retain, and review what the next steps are for vehicle repairs/replacement."
good,Advancement was not only easily achieved but highly encouraged. Management was easy to communicate with and worked with employees to achieve desired advancement.
good,"I loved the office, customers and staff! They had a great training program. I was licensed within 45 days. The agent provided many opportunities for growth and commission so the competition within the office was great for morale."
good,"The company has existed for over 90 years and is rapidly changing to keep up with ever changing insurance market.  HUB locations of Atlanta, Dallas, and Phoenix are great locations for career advancement if you are able to live in those locations."
good,The culture and support for employees is great. Unfortunately the office I work at is being closed. The managers are supportive and want you to succeed. The company is growing and developing which makes it fun and exciting to see how they adapt to meet customer and employee needs.
good,"I was very existed to work at state farm insurance Although it didn't work with my school schedule but it was a very good job ever. "
good,Must be able to multi-task and meet service level objectives.  The company is continually changing for efficient production and customer service.  A great place to work if you perform at or above service levels.
good,Great place to work and management is very helpful when it comes to career growth. The only issue I had is the work/life balance became none existent once the new attendance policy became active.
good,"Typical day includes lots of calling, and more calling. Work place culture is great depending on the agent. Hardest part of the job  is getting people in the office.  We truly are helping families so you do feel good about yourself at the end of the day,"
good,State Farm is a great company to work for in an entry-level role. It is very competitive in regards to promotion and lateral movement. Unfortunately compared to other major companies in the industry State Farm pays their employees much less.
good,State Farm was a great place to work based on the diversity of employees and relaxed work environment. I also enjoyed the task/work in the IT Support Department which was very collaborative and informational.
good,"State Farms is great company to work for, overall they provide you with all the tools you will need to achieve your goals. Great managers, work environment, and excellent co-workers. I would recommend them to anyone."
good,"I wish the job wasn't temporary. It was a wonderful learning experience."
good,"It was an inbound call center for customers and Agents.  My days consisted of answering inbound phone calls handling our Agents needs and, consulting with customers regarding their credit file."
good,"As a sales agent at State Farm, you determine your salary. You can maximize your earnings by increasing your sales and working extra hours. Very little weekend work or travel, and if you find a great agent to work for, State Farm can be a very fun and lucrative place to work."
good,"a typical day is fast paced.  A call center environment with in coming phone calls to handle as well as other off line claim related tasks to clear.  Majority of the job is investigation, conducting phone interviews to gather information, researching state statutes to assist in applying liability and determining information needed for denials.  Also recognizing subrogation potential based on negligence in a claim."
good,The department that I was hired in is closing down at the end of this year. The management there has been changed three times since I've started as well. Other than that it's a great place to work at.
good,"After working 20yrs in Telecom, I chose to change gears and work in the insurance field. State Farm is a great start, but the compensation and health benefits are ugly. There were only 2 options for health insurance. One was HMO ( super expensive) and the other was PPO ( not as expensive as HMO, but still costly). The work environment is Nice. There seems to be no dress code, The pay would be ok if my health insurance wasn't so high. I like my supervisor. Not micromanaging like I see/heard others do."
good,They are good with their employees when it comes to training. Used to be a great place work. Good working environment. Hoping State Farm will succeed with whatever they do.
good,Given the ability to control your own day is always an option if you are getting your things done. Owner helps advise in how to become a better sales team member and make more money personally. Hours are negotiable and easy going atmosphere.
good,"State Farm was overall a good company to work for.  The only negative was the workload.  Dealing with the attorneys, customers, rental car company and auto company can be a balancing act.  It's not or the weak at heart."
good,"a typical day included being able to juggle multiple projects at a time; being able to service customer accounts, quoting perspective customers and making outbound sales calls to high potential clients."
good,"Stay away from the Auto department, Home Owner is a lot more laid back, your Manager makes or break you, it doesn't matter how good you are, if they don't like you you can forget it"
good,"Paid well, always getting training to succeed and excel, friendly people with diverse backgrounds, education benefits, paid time off including special a school day for children's field trips."
good,This company cares about its employees as much as they do their customers. They want you to succeed in the office and outside the office. StateFarm takes pride in remarkable work.
good,"I worked for the Agent for 15 years and I have learned many of the basic clerical skills. I was acquainted with many professionals and enjoyed working with them. I enjoyed the most, interacting with customers and providing them with excellent service. It was my goal everyday to make sure they left happier then when they came in. The hardest part of the job was the many office changes that took place towards the end of my employment, but I managed to work through it."
good,"I worked for State Farm for almost 9 years and was afforded a lot of opportunity for advancement.  I started as an underwriter and left as a corporate manager.  The culture attracted me to the company, they truly value work/life balance.  You routinely see executives leaving before 5 to catch their child's ball game and the corporate building is a ghost town by 6pm. However, the company in recent years is eliminating a lot of flexibility including working remotely and working from home.  These are free perks which are invaluable to hard-working employees.  Can every employee handle the flexibility responsibly? No, but the company should empower and hold management responsible to provide the perks to those who can responsibly use them. I fear the company will lose a lot of talent over the elimination of remote workers and their limited acceptance of working from home."
good,"Everyone there greets you with a smile and they seem like they want to be there, and want to help you and will work hard to make you succeed."
good,"I really enjoyed working here, wish I hadn't left. The office is laid back, but professional. Steady work and interaction with clients. The agent was very flexible. Pay is a little low for the area. Overall a great place to work"
good,"Love going into work everyday, the people I work with are super helpful and extremely pleasant to be around. A very stress free culture because State Farm has many different departments that are very helpful and easy to use if you need a problem solved. My boss is very passionate about his work so it made it easy for me to want to match his intensity and make him proud."
good,"State farm offers great continuous training. I work as an auto underwriting assistant, the bulk of my day is spent behind my computer analysis potential risk and making sure our agents have provided all the necessary details so our customers can receive the best cost efficient polices."
good,"My daily tasks included but were not limited too directly working with customers who have filed claims in order to gather information from them in order to better assist during the claims process. I would then gather and process the information by uploaded and sorting it into organized file systems for easy review."
good,"Great benefits and job security. Heavy workload at times. Insurance, pension and PTO are all great perks. Management can make the difference in your experience. I was fortunate to have great leaders. Take responsibility for improving your work area."
good,"You can practically make your own hours. Everyday and every situation is different. There are lull moments and the job will throw at you a problem you have never seen before. Its great if you are good thinking on your toes and if you are willing to learn. What makes the job the best though, is the people you work with. The staff at Steve Barkers Agency are incredible which makes the work environment incredible."
good,State Farm agents have their own offices but they are required to meet certain quotas which are sometimes unreasonable for the agent.  Management is very informative and shares their knowledge and experience with staff members.  The agents do not have unrealistic expectations and are always at hand to answer questions for all employees.  The most difficult part of the job was the salary; the most enjoyable part of the job was working with friendly co-workers and managers.
good,"I am a part time Claims Associate - Initial Loss Reporting.  A very demanding position since you are talking to people filing a loss due to vehicle accidents or issues with home such as fire, theft.  I enjoy talking to clients from all over the country, but the time constraints placed on the intake process is hard for me to deal with.  The company is a great place for students and younger workers since the efficiency with the extensive computer program seems to come easier for them.  And they offer a great work environment and great benefits."
good,Handling phone calls and general inquires. Management was agreeable but hands off. The general environment can be stressful when busy but is usually a very calm place to work.
good,"State Farm is a company that invest heavily in any employee who was interested in furthering their education whether it be formal or informal."
good,Answer calls about auto insurance. Answer general questions. Take auto quotes. And prices of monthly insurance. Stay busy and always be friendly. Awesome place to work
good,You have your own computer that you sit at and take the calls. We have a certain time frame that you should complete the call in. It's a friendly work place with many different people.
good,"Overall, while the call center style can be demanding since customers can widely vary, it was a good place to work. "
good,"Overall, it's an great place to work. There is room for advancement after 1 year. Work and personal life balance out. That's it!!!"
good,"I took this job as an internship for a college course. It was a great place to work and I enjoyed working with my colleagues, but the insurance industry is just not for me."
good,The job advancement opportunities are there as well as job security. The only improvement that could be addressed is the Managers lack communication skills and understanding you're apart of their team and not just another number report for them in ILR
good,The job was easy to do. Arrive a little early sometimes and figured I could get things prepared for the day. I had the office cleaned and organized and waited for clients concerns. I didn't really close out sales on insurance though was offered the position to translate.
good,State Farm puts a large amount of time and money into training new employees.  The onboarding program is like nothing I have ever seen.  The management staff is friendly and genuinely seems to care about the employees.  The perks and benefits of working at State Farm are nice.
good,"while interning with state farm I got to learn a variety of things.  First thing in the morning I got to handle the bank statement , then I had to go through State Farms system and recruit new customers and check on existing customers. I was also responsible for answering phones, transferring calls and creating data spread sheets for customers bill reliability for each month. My co-workers were great I loved having mentors who could teach me the ropes of the company. The hardest part of the job was learning the phone system. The most enjoyable part was learning the business traits and helping customers."
good,"I have loved every hour of working at the Rani Taweel State Farm Agency. If you are working in agency it gives you a great understanding of how to run a business, whether it involves: Public Relations with your community, Marketing, Managing, or even just the selling aspect of the company. You will learn to develop many skills working there. "
good,"I find it interesting to meet new people on a daily basis, and I enjoy making a difference in someone's day.  It is very rewarding when you hear ""you're a pleasure to work with, we need more agents like you""."
good,"State Farm is a good company to work for.  Job security is better than at most companies, and the benefits are good (they still have a defined benefit pension plan, in addition to a 401k).  Based on my experience, and speaking with other employees, the work environment in departments other than Claims and Underwriting is very good.  Claims and Underwriting are production-based environments more akin to white-collar manufacturing.  Jobs are focused on quality and numbers, vacation policy is rigid, employees feel like cogs in a big machine.  Turnover is higher and job satisfaction is lower in those departments.  In every other part of the company I have worked in, turnover is very low and people are happy.  "
good,"I love the new building that State Farm is occupying at the moment. I never feel like I'm at work when I'm on my break because of the restaurants and modern work/life atmosphere here. I've learned a lot about insurance and the processes claim handler's have to implement. "
good,"A typical day at State Farm, begins with me opening the office and making sure we are in ship shape condition before the work day begins. "
good,"Great Place to your professional career."
good,This is a great place to get sales experience. Each branch is its own entity and you can develop your own processes. There is also room for upward movement to become an agent after 2 years.
good,"Overall the job is very simple, you must learn to think quick, multitask and be efficient. If you show you care about your job performance, Management will not hound you."
good,"I learned a lot at Statefarm.  I got my producer liscense. I loved the customer service part of this job, not so much the sales.  I had great co-workers, and the compensation was great."
good,"good working conditions, good co-workers, good pay and benefits set work hours some overtime available regular pay raises based on performance of job duties opportunity for advancement"
good,"Good working atmosphere and good organization to work for."
good,"The environment is a positive one with the support to advance in the company. Supervisors are very helpful to make you aware of upcoming events and the places you need to work on. The Work/Life balance is a little strict. If you are a part time employee you do not have sick hours, you only get nine non-pay days for three months before paperwork is filed on recurring behavior. If anyone is like me sometimes I get sick at a week at a time, eating that up not to mention preexisting medical conditions. If PTO time is not available, you cannot have time off, even in emergency situations. "
good,"• Responsible for servicing existing clients and advising them on their current insurance needs "
good,"Great company to work for and you can obtain great education and work experience.  And so many ways to move around the company whether its a lateral or vertical move. Will encourage employees to get involved with company and group functions that will continue, inspire, and education growth and experience with company."

good,I love working with people. Company is moving in to the age of technology.  Really great place to work.  Hate leaving after 25 years but the drive is wearing on me.
good,"Great work place environment, with potential growth and development, able to be licensed , and sell insurance policies. Same politics as any other major company"
good,"I have learned the importance of adequately performing a job at high and demanding speeds without neglecting quality. A typical day at work is definitely different than the next day, different events bring along different crowds and I have gained skills in communicating with people of different ages, cultures and languages."
good,State Farm was a nice place to work at.Talking to customer daily made my day go by. I enjoyed making them smile even when so of the customer were having a bad day.
good,"While working at State Farm I would make calls to potential clients about their auto, home, life and health insurance. I would also assist in the daily tasks of the clients that were already part of State Farm. My co-workers were great and we always had a great time every day at work."
good,"The company is a great company, currently trying to require more work out of less people, while ensuring accuracy. "
good,"busy, great work staff, team players, hardest part was getting layoff and made great new friends. best part was being able help the clients save money."
good,"All in all, it was a good experience. You have a lot of people who are able to help you out and give you advice along the way. The work environment itself is very relaxed yet structured, and access to personal, informational resources is abundant. "
good,"Great Company to work for. Invest in their employees, always support employees looking to advance their careers. Visible upper management. Laid back and professional working enviroment"
good,A typical day at work is coming in and reviewing the objectives of the day. Looking through my emails making sure that State Farm has received all the necessary documents. Also my work environment for the most part is calm but there are times where things get really busy and there are customer concerns. I do my best with handling the situation but if there is a situation that I need further assistance with my office manager is always there willing to help and assist. It can get overwhelming at times but I have learned how to stay in control and keep calm which at the end of the conversation the customer is satisfied and it makes me feel better about my job performance.
good,"Amazing floor leaders and team environment. "
good,"Lots of opportunity for growth, however making connections and being involved socially is highly recommended.  Wonderful retirement benefits (pension) and opportunities for annual bonuses and raises based on performance."
good,State Farm has a lot of opportunities throughout the company and across the U.S. It is a great place to work if you are looking for a diverse workforce and interested in making a real impact. State Farm employees are dedicated to helping customers and helping them get to a better state.
good,Leardned a lot about the insurance environment and different insurance products. Worked a lot with others on the team. Interracted and built relationships with our clients.
good,"small office, great people, great day time hours, no weekends! every agent is different but the compensation plan can be tricky"
good,"Getting to work I start with voice mails, calling back. Then getting on Begging -of-Day, all that while greeting clients and answering phones. And especially dealing with Russian/Ukrainian community. I have learned in depth of the insurance itself. My co-workers were funny and very easy to work with them. I tried to do as much as I could for them, so they can work on sales.  The hardest part of the job was describing something to people that are not hearing you. And the joy of it is when with patience,  stability, and simple words, I get trough to them."
good,"A typical day at work is taking phone calls, reviewing policies. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with was like family."
good,It is a very stable place to work with good benefits.  After the first year they are interested in you moving up like no other copany I have worked for. They have a  good training program and the best team spirit ever.  I enjoyed being a part of the statefarm team.
good,"The company has changed. There is not a lot of entry level opportunities for new hires. They hire so many people off the street without face to face interviews and the culture is drastically changing for the negative. Also, they are paying ridiculously low salaries for some jobs. I can't convince new hires of what a great company SF is because of how they changed. Some new hires don't even have their own desks, so the morale is low, low, low! Also, in order to move up, you need to take insurance education courses and study them on your own time. It is a very outdated standard that needs to be removed."
good,"I enjoy doing the customer service part of my job. My forte is keeping our insureds happy, finishing service work, complying with upset clients, saving business, completing changes, basically probleming solving, repairing incorrections on policies, figuring billing, getting paperwork in, following up with customers, keeping all documents organized, having everything ready for quotes, sales and service for faster results. "
good,This job was something different everyday and that is what kept it interesting. Always speaking with clients that have different needs pertaining to their insurance. Seven co-workers that were pleasant to work with. Management was there when needed but you alone to do your job otherwise.
good,"•	Ensured employees followed procedures and complied with the company’s standards."
good,"Typical day at state farm bank would be really busy. From the time i get in to the time i leave we take so many inbound calls. My co-workers are very friendly and fun, we are in teams an its great to bond with a group of co-workers. The hardest part of my job is doing the same thing over and over again there is never change."
good,"I enjoyed interacting with the clients by phone or face to face, always was busy management was a new agent but he taught me a lot about insurance my favorite part of the job was actually doing paperwork , talking to clients."
good,"I am an office manager for a small privately owned state farm agency. I work with a small team to complete sales goals, customer retention/service and employee training. I enjoy my co workers a lot and look at them as family. The hardest part of my job is that their is practically no room for growth and where i am at is the top of the ladder. Looking to move to a company where i can achieve growth and more recognition for my hard work. I enjoy my 3 thousand plus clients and i alos get to bring my rescue dog beaux into work."

good,"I learned so much working for State Farm.  I started out working in consumer loans & eventually promoted to home equity loans.  It seemed there was something new to learn everyday, which I really enjoyed.  I was also selected to train all new employees, which really made me feel appreciated.  My co-workers were also one big family, similar to my most recent job at Bank of America.  We were all there to accomplish the task at hand but worked together to achieve that goal."
good,"State Farm is a great company, good balance of job/life."
good,"I like the work style in office all colleagues are very friendly and cooperative. and i got lot of opportunities to learn new technologies and management skills etc.,"
good,well a typical day for me is that I come in and will need  to add some info on the computer and any other duties that need to be done. then I will spend the rest of the day making cold calls and getting people interested in a free quote and if they are I take there info and pass it on to one of the agents that look up the info for the quote and then they call the person back to make the sale for the insurance. The  lead agent then is great as is the other agents. The hardest part of the job is the cold calls you do get tired of hearing no a lot but the best part is when some does let us give them a quote most of the time we can save them money and I like when we can help people save money

good,"Very professional people, great collaborative environment and awesome management, projects are well executed and under great direction."
good,"State Farm is an excellent company, they pay you while you train for the position you are hired for; although, after training you are stuck with a micro-manager that rides new employees until they eventually quit or get fired due to the stress that is put on you from the manager. If the managers were screened like the employees it would be a better place to work. State Farm has a high turnover because of their managers."
good,As an intern I was assigned many tasks. I always seemed to keep busy throughout the day and I found the experience to be very beneficial to my growth. Management was very positive and helpful over the course of the internship and I enjoyed every minute during my time with State Farm.

good,Stable company with opportunity.  Promote from within atmosphere makes it possible to have many careers while staying with one company.
good,"I dressed up as the State Farm Bear and stood by the State Farm booth and interacted with people of all ages for their enjoyment. It was well worth it just to see the smile on people's faces. The hardest part was trying not to burn up inside the suit, and the easiest part was getting out of the suit."
good,"A typical day working at State Farm consisted of working hard to meet the customer's needs, whether they were internal or external customers. In addition to completing tasks and satisfying the customer, there was a warm and pleasant atmosphere throughout the building, which made it even more possible to work hard and still keep a smile on your face. "
good,"I worked with wonderful people in the short time I had with State Farm. When I was promoted to the corporate office, it was the best job that I had ever held.

We had pot luck lunches throughout the year and it was great because we all came from various backgrounds. What a joy.
good,Good work life balance with very good benefits.
good,"The company had a lot of room for growth. But due to economic changes and fierce competition, the company had downsized. Many departments including Finance was moved out of the regional offices to the home office in Bloomington, IL. Prior to this change the company offerred a lot of opportunity to let you grow as a professional and further your education. Management supported and encouraged me to be the best I can be. Received many special projects to match my skills and knowledge. I worked as a team member with five other associates. We worked together and helped each other so no one was ever behind and there would be no interuption to our customers."
good,I loved working for Bill Hayes and his staff. Due to unfortunate circumstances I was let go since the company decided to change their direction and my position would not longer be needed. I have nothing but nice things to say about them.

good,"face to face and over the phone selling insurance, making claims for auto accidents,damage to homes,I learned a lot when working for the company, like the understanding of how the insurance business works, I gained a lot of knowledge about auto,life, and health. the co-workers were great to work with, sometimes the hardest part was selling when the ecomony was down, everything"
good,"A typical day in the office consists of complete customer service, endorsements, claims, underwriting, billing, explaining coverages, all of which I love."

good,"It is an exceptional company with great training, great benefits, and great opportunities for advancement."
good,"Great place to work and you get to meet a variety of different people. I love the policy of “dress for your day”. I was previously in the call center for sales, but have since moved on to a full time position. I was not a fan of sales, but I’m loving where I’m at now in the company! Great benefits and PTO is very nice. My current supervisor is awesome."
good,"Work day can be stressful as many clients aren't fond of insurance representatives. Some agents compensate well, and like to reward their staff for hard work. Corporate office is not always very helpful when you are calling them to assist clients. My agency was like a small family with a staff of 7-8 people at all times. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping clients when they were in a dire insurance emergency."
good,"A typical day is very diverse as you have to wear many hats, production as well as special projects. Need to be very organized, team player, customer focused, and problem solver."
good,Pay increases can be slow but if you find a team you like it helps. You learn a lot about how to manage multiple people and the customer service side helps you learn to understand people beyond how they appear.
good,Everyone is very helpful and its a great company with many career opportunities. The facility is updated and they promote getting up from your desk and taking a walk throughout the work day.
good,Had the opportunity to work under fantastic leaders while working at State Farm. Very supportive and excellent teachers. There was a good culture with the people around the office.
good,"Our team works well together and we have much respect for each other, We help each other"
good,"The hardest part of the job at State Farm is they use computer systems from the 1980's. Using these DOS based systems if frustrating and causes too much rework and time lost causing our customers to be upset due to inefficiency. "
good,"Typically as an unlicensed employee, I would do typical clerical jobs such as  emailing and calling clients, making promotion packets, sorting files, etc. I have learned to work with others,and complete tasks well."
good,"Excellent opportunity for career advancement. Great benefits provided for employees,  as well as family members by extension.  I enjoyed my time working for this company."
good,"Decent pay, amazing coworkers and management. No commission though. The only full time employee is myself and also the only fully licensed. I should get compensated more for the work I put in."
good,My agent was wonderful. He was always helpful and kind. I learned a great deal. If it were not for life being hectic I would still be working for him. This is a great company to grow at.
good,I worked for State farm insurance for 26 years that should say something.  I worked with people  that  were  35 year employees .How many companies have employee  that stay that many years.
good,I worked at an agent's office which is different from working at corporate. My agent was awesome and provided unlimited paid time off. He also gave me a raise after only being there 6 months.
good,"My years with State Farm were very beneficial to learning how to effectively run a business as well growing in a competitive environment. However, the job itself is very competitive and stressful. Since State Farm is normally not the lowest insurance company cost wise, it did make it difficult to make sales when the quote we were offering was 50 to 100 more a month on a car policy. The brand however, is definitely worth the normally increased premium. State Farm is number 1 in Auto and Home for a reason. The position as agent is extremely stressful as your first year is the only thing guaranteed. Otherwise the opportunity for growth and advancement I feel are unlimited."
good,This company taught me the importance of customer service and how pivotal it is to treat others in the manner you would want to be treated. Great company to work for.
good,I worked with several customers and mostly all of them left satisfied. Any questions asked my customers all ways got the best answer and very detailed!
good,"State Farm is a decent company with decent benefits.  Most Atlanta locations have been consolidated into the new Hub near Ashford-Dunwoody in Atlanta which houses almost all of the adjusters in the area. The office culture is fairly relaxed and overtime is available during busy times. Overall the people are people, but mostly amicable and there will be times when dealing with a customer can create more stress than expected but this is the standard when working in an environment where customer exposure is paramount."
good,Enjoyed protecting clients with their every day needs and to help them become fully protected in every aspect of their lives.  State Farm is the number one leading insurer in the United States and I have loved working for this company
good,"Overall, State Farm provides a wonderful working atmosphere that is fairly relaxed and genuinely interested in assisting its employees achieve their potential, both in work and life. For the right person, there is plenty of career opportunity and management is dedicated to helping employees grow within the company if they wish."
good,"State Farm being such a big company makes it harder to connect, but you get to know those in your department and network with a lot of people. Benefits are great."
good,State farm is more a corporate job most all jobs are call center based so if you enjoy a fast paced micro managed environment and communicating with other people constantly on a regular basis this may be the job for you.
good,I was given many opportunities at State Farm. Being with the company for almost 30 years I had a large amount of PTO.  Due to relocation I am severing from the company.
good,"Great people and customers. Wonderful boss to work for. No time and a half pay offered. No Health and Dental benefits or 401K."
good,"The job requires Understanding enterprise problems and goals, Analyzing needs and solutions, devising strategies, Driving change, and 	facilitating stakeholder collaboration."
good,Everyone at State Farm always came in with a positive attitude. Managers were always willing to go above and beyond to make sure everything you needed to provide excellent customer service was met.
good,I believe the hardest part of the job was selling insurance in general. Prospecting/ getting in front of qualified prospects is the hardest part of selling insurance.
good,"This is a very good place to work, but if you live with mental illness such as depression and/or anxiety you might find yourself quickly overwhelmed and not able to perform to the level in which you are required. Otherwise this was an excellent place to work."
good,I would recommend State Farm as a workplace because it embraces diversity and has an open door policy with regards to it's management style. I have learned a great deal while working here. My only complaint would be my work schedule. I chose the night shift and work until midnight and that takes time away from my family. Other than that I love the team and people I work with and I think the pay rate is fair.
good,"State Farm values their workers, great benefits are offered, competitive pay, but can be very emotionally draining depending on your position, spending all day on a phone can be stressful."
good,Overall I would recommend anyone to work for State Farm it is a good company to work for.  The benefits are very rewarding. It is a company that has been around over 90 years.
good,"It was a nice atmosphere to work in. Very to the point with what you were expected to do. It was a temporary job, so I was only there until something more stable came along."
good,"I worked with State Farm for 1.5 years and I was very happy with my manager and my coworkers. Compensation was good specially if you meet your goals."
good,"The team is real nice. I did not like the fact that we are graded on reading every word of script, even if it does not apply to phone call. You also have to bid for shifts once a year so it is difficult to know what future hours are. Other than that training is great. The trainers take a lot of time to make sure you are ready for taking calls out on the floor."
good,I enjoyed the job I had. It was fast paced and everyday was something different. I was a change of job for me since I was a server before but I throughly enjoyed it. I hope to work for this company again!
good,"Great company, great communication, if your good with receiving feedback and applying the feedback then this will be a great place for you, it’s always changing and have to be good at being adaptable."
good,"I worked for State Farm as a Customer Service Assistant in Auto Claims. I enjoyed the work and my fellow employees. Although the job could be stressful, the supervisors are easy to communicate with."
good,"I was not a fan of the call volume, however the pay was very good. If I wasn't interested in another career field, I would stay. Benefits are awesome!"
good,Most pay is based on commission so pay is not always a steady thing. Must exert a lot of energy to find and maintain customers and customer service is a key factor as well is reliable communication and knowledge of specific computer programming.
good,Passionate in the service that is done for the company and their customers.Yet very little communication to their employees on events that occur inside the company. Yet overall great benefits and flexible hours.
good,"Since the new CEO and leadership, there has been a shift away from the ""good neighbor"" internal culture that we've all been used to over the years.  There is now a focus on financials and some cut-throat decisions are being made in order to achieve those goals - at the expense of a lot of employees, their interests, and their work location."
good,"Fun, fast-paced environment. In my role, you call leads on a daily basis to make sales either over the phone or by setting up appointments for the potential clients to come into the office."
good,I enjoyed my time with State Farm. The manager was extremely friendly and always helpful. Relaxed environment with occasional free lunches. Health benefits and ten day paid vacation.
good,"Sales and service calls both inbound and outbound.  Learned products, overcoming objections and household reviews.  Culture was busy, team oriented and optimistic.  Hardest part was upset customers, most enjoyable part was satisfying upset customers!"
good,"It was a very busy office with both telephone and walk in business."
good,"State Farm is a highly reputable company with a proven track record which made our job easy. With great employees its a joy to suggest products to customers when you can speak with high esteem of the company. Whenever there's a claim, great care will be taken to facilitate the customers needs. Excellent employee training available."
good,My office was like working with family. Team work all day everyday. My manager was super great. The company is all about family and they will try to work around your schedule.
good,my part is on operational side ..I enjoyed every part of my job..the work place culture is also very good ..all the other staff are very friendly and helpful
good,"I learned how to manage with all platform  at one place .While working with State Farm ,I got opportunities to show my skills and suggestion to my team members and also My clients ranked me #1 for providing 100 % results."
good,State Farm is a great company to start off with your foot in the door. They believe in promoting within. They do require you to work hard and show your dedication but it will eventually be rewarded.
good,I really enjoyed working for State Farm. My supervisors were approachable and I made a lot of great people while working here. I would definitely recommend to others for employment.
good,Worked as a claim associate investigating claims and answering and resolving customer inquiries throughout the claims process. Certifications vary based upon the state where the claim occurred and origin of the policy.
good,"I would recommend State Farm to people who aren't afraid to make mistakes - (and learn from them), who don't mind speaking with customers when they are all over the emotional spectrum range and who throughly enjoy the chase of the sale. I would like to see State Farm agents offer additional benefits to employees (401K, health insurance, etc). "
good,"Training is excellent.  There are metrics that need to be met and in the past this created a stressful working environment and a high turnover rate.  Things have been changing and the emphasis now is on customer interaction and personalized service as opposed to call metrics such as reading everything verbatim, branding the company, length of call etc.  Keep in mind this is a highly regulated industry and there is a reason for these word tracts but now the emphasis is on the customer and how they feel after they have to call in a claim on one of the worst days of their life.  You can no longer fail a call and coaching is always available."
good,"It was always a stuctured workplace.  Always needed to meet the Enterprise numbers.  The mose enjoyable part of the job is when we had fun days - lunch spreads, etc."
good,Great work environment! Advancement within the company is always possible especially if you want it. ILR is extremely easy. 10-15 mins to actually file a claim for insureds or claimants.
good,"Love this Job.  they will be moving the office to Dallas/Austin.  I can not relocate. Relaxed job. Family and Friends. very learnable positions.         "
good,"State Farm could be very tedious at times. There was something new to learn each and every day, which always made it interesting. The only downfall was that it could be very stressful and after a long days work there were time I went home worrying about someone's insurance coverages that I had to finish the next day. However, it was very rewarding for myself when the sale was officially completed!"
good,"My Agent was a class act. He was flexible and work life balance was great. As a sales manager, I had flexibility with work hours and being in and out of the office, as long as I was meeting the quota of course. Upward mobility is a touchy subject because there are limited number of positions due to being a small office."
good,"I work for a vendor on behalf of statefarm, however statefarm has great bensfits and a decent pay and great staff if u do a good job u have a good day. Point blank period dress code in tack, although it is an enjoyable environment u still have a job to do and must do it well again very fun and very comfortable but still tend to your business..."
good,"State Farm was very good to me, I worked hard for the company. They had great benefits, vacations, time off when needed in emergency sistuations. I am reired and I am still receiving benefits."
good,I enjoyed almost every day I worked there. Customers could be stressful but coworkers and boss made it ok. The pay was low considering the stress and responsibility and there were no bonuses or financial incentives.
good,Excellent work environment.  Would still be employed.  But company relocated out of state.  Management was very involved in employees.  Always room
good,"constant phone calls and telemarketing... directing customers to appropriate staff both in office and over the phone, as well as taking payments, messages, booking appointments... filing and documenting clients needs and changes, incoming and outgoing mail as well"
good,"Working at State Farm definitely gave me a lot of experience. For instance it made me more confident for the way I work and for the way I speak. It definitely did improve my speech. It made me more confident to come up to people and get to know new people each and everyday. I made a lot of friends at work which is probably the best thing about working at State Farm, because each month you see a new face. The hardest part of the job was whenever there would be a long que, but yet everybody including myself made it to the end of the day making sure to give our customers the service they deserve."
good,"My short endeavor here  was filled with  joy  and meeting  serious, dedicated, and caring professionals. Also, everyone was willing to go the extra mile and assist others in need."
good,Learned a lot of sales techniques. Very nice staff to work with fun environment. Flexible work schedule.
good,"My Manager was great to work with, he was very hands on and wanted to teach meal it was to know about Claims. I loved the fact that it was a casual dress company you could wear jeans everyday if you wanted too."
good,Great benefits and pension. Great people and understanding corporate department. The company is going thru changes right now and there are a lot of office closures and new offices opening in cheaper states.
good,"The hardest part of the job is balances sales with service activities, but they are both so very important to each individuals success!"
good,"My night hours were special to me."
good,"I enjoyed my time at State farm, and wouldn't mind returning to them in some capacity.  They were a nice company with nice benefits."
good,"positive"
good,"Great company, that caters to employees!!!!!!!!!!! I loved the job and the company, they have a lot of resources that can be used for employees, and discount programs."
good,"Fun place of employment with reasonable pay and goals.  However, Provident was bought out in my area by M&T Bank.  I never transferred so I don't know how they compare."
good,Good environment for work. I enjoyed a lot working here. And the management is also very good and the job is more secure here.
good,"I worked here for about a year and thought it was ok.  I left after a year because I moved out of town."
good,Great management.  I went to work and didn't have to think about anything after I left.  I was an agent staff member so I didn't have all the stress the agent did.  The pay wasn't great but it got me by.
good,"The State Farm culture is very nurturing and the job environment is very transparent. There is a focus on communication across all positions and levels of management. The benefits are excellent, especially for a position that does not require a higher level of education. The work is very repetitive. It is easy to complete, but it is even easier to get burnt out doing the same process over and over every day. If you're willing to stick it out, it is a good stepping stone for advancement within the company."
good,"A typical day at work starts off with completing beginning-of-the-day activities but isn't very difficult at all and is easy to get used to. However, constant phone calls throughout the day keeps you on your toes especially when clients ask for help with their policies. This job requires precision and skill mostly because one little mishap can cause a lawsuit due to the sensitivity of the information. Therefore, one can expect this job to require much training beforehand. StateFarm provides very detailed training on palmost everything you can think of that deals with the company and how to do your job. Managers and co-workers are very nice and friendly which makes for a very positive and uplifting environment. However, the hardest part of the job trying to learn everything that you have to do. Insurance companies such as StateFarm require you to know exactly what to do for very specific situations. No client has the same problems or resolutions so every call we get is always a unique experience. The job gets very stressful at times and can get very busy. This job isn't one where you can just go home and have it not affect your life. This job will require your attention even when not at work. Even so, the most enjoyable part of the job for me would be the social experience. You are required to speak to clients basically all day and make friends with them. This part of the job is very enjoyable for me because it allows me to meet so many new and unique people."
good,"Check my supervisor calendar for daily/weekly schedule"
good,"Great company to work for, had a high influence in my life. Always hard work, but worth it in the end when you saw the clients faces."
good,"* Typical work day:"

good,Loved my co-workers. Hardest part of the job was getting people to answer the phone.
good,Assisting customers with insurance  needs. Great management team. Most enjoyable part was helping with life insurance for all.
good,This job had great 8:30-5:00 hours and I loved being able to help people and save them money
good,"Worked on team which aids in a different way of thinking. There are no two claims that can be handled exactly the same. I welcomed the challenge of making people happy because once I do a good job explaining the coverage, the customer seems to calm down. I learned hat anger is a direct reaction of misunderstanding. The hardest part of my job was when the agent's office sold the policyholder the cheapest policy when for a minimal amount of money could have made a huge difference in coverage, What made it even harder is you could not place blame because that my be the policy the customer insisted on buying. I found the management was quick to step into help you in wording and finding creative ways to solve very difficult problems."
good,Same as before great job excellent pay & benefits. Hardest part extended periods from home
good,"Insurance billing is highly stressful. Adherence, average handle time, and one minute wrap--up time are factors to why the job is extremely stressful. The co-workers, supervisors and managers are very professional and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is the compliance to competencies."
good,The company is an overall great place to work.  They offer very competitve pay and incentives.  There is constant room for growth within different areas of the company.
good,"While at State Farm I worked in various departments, to include Records, Data Processing, Claims, Transportation, and Imaging.  I also trained in Shipping and Receiving.  I learned great teamwork, decision making, time management, problem solving, and to be flexible."
good,"Typical perception of what a claims adjuster does, however very fun place to work at and develop relationships."
good,"I worked at State Farm for 8 years.  I have held several different positions here.  My co workers have always been wonderful and seem to value their jobs very much.  Insurance is not the most exciting career but job security is great. "
good,"""Excellent training; friendly co-workers and management on location; working with customers; company is very well organized."" -"
good,"My typical day started with a sales meeting with product training and roleplays. Then I made cold and warm calls to sell car, life, health and home insurance. I learned a great deal about the various lines of insurance and how to sell them.  I improved my consultative, conversational sales style.  The agent runs the most successful agency in Texas and one of the most successful in the nation.  My co-workers worked like a family and were all invested in each other.  The hardest part was cold calling but the most enjoyable was when a sale was made off a cold call."
good,"Many talented people contibute their skills to projects for the Marketing/Advertising department. Work environement is friendly, creative and collabrative. Most people carry large workloads, but management works with you to help maintain a good work/life balance.  Salaries and healthcare are comparable."
good,"24/7 job, you are constantly selling the products you carry. Never ending phone calls in or you call out or you are in the field visiting your customers or potential customers."
good,"State Farm is a great place to work. Although the industry is not my cup of tea, as far the insurance business goes, State Farm is the place to be. They offer great benefits and treat their employees very well. "
good,"A typical day at State Farm Insurance as an Administrative Assistant was answering phone calls, processing insurance payments, completing special projects as instructed. Management was great. I worked in a small office, there were only me and the agent in the office at all times. Most enjoyable experience of the job, interacting with customers."
good,"Great place to work; very family friendly.  But, they will fire you at the drop of a hat for any minor offense."
good,"This job requires great phone skills and great benefits. A typical day consists of follow up work, scheduling appointments for the agent, and handling customer requests. "
good,the hardest part of the job is taking calls from rude customers!
good,You work individually and as part of a team; your co-workers are professionally minded. Your good skills are developed and new skills are also learned. The hardest part of the job is knowing where you want to advance to within this vast company that offers many growth opportunities. The most enjoyable part of working here is feeling good at the end of the day for achieving productivity with your co-workers.
good,"On a daily basis I conduct client interviews and prepared information to be reported back to corporate underwriters. As well as maintaining regular office activity I am also a liaison between the claims department and my client, listening to their needs and offering the best method to complete the desired requirement."
good,"Working at State Farm has provided me with an invaluable set of skills I would not have gained elsewhere. The hardest part about the job was the beginning as I was a bit intimidated and did not know everyone's names in the office. Working in the office has been a most enjoyable experience, this was largely attributable to the management and staff within the local branch at Fayetteville."
good,Productive place to work with strong organization culture
good,"Answer phones for customers. Determine liability and negotiate liability with Insureds, claimants and lawyers. I have learned customer service and negotiation skills. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping our customers and my fellow teammates."
good,This is a wonderful company to work for. The pay isn't high to start out but there is potential for a pay increase yearly. The health insurance benefits were expensive but the benefits you get as a whole getting to work a day job with the weekends off are incredible. They worked with me alot when I was there because my mom had a heart attack and then I was put on bed rest with my pregnancy. The only reason I left my job was to stay at home with my son after he was born.
good,"I love building relationships with clients ensureing their trust in managing their accounts. On a daily basis, I oversee production and retention growing the agents book of business year after year.

good,State Farm strives to better help customers with everything that is affordable for them and also promotes the company making them look good. The company cherish their employees and shows appreciation for them. They trust the fact that you will do your job great and efficiently. Management is understanding and supportive.
good,"I worked Reception. Billing calls can be a little stressful but usually not bad. Most my co-workers were great, the job was relatively easy for the most part. I didn't like having to learn the insurance details, personally it was too much to remember. But other than that, I would have stayed a long time."
good,"I loved working for this company! Everything from the daily duties, the culture, the management..I would’ve stayed with them but they did not have hubs where I moved to live."
good,"My day started working with my team.  We established the work day, I provided what states and/or markets they would work in.  The culture was very warm and inviting, definitely a family atmosphere"

good,I would recommand this company as an great growing oppurtunity I enjoy working here and the overall company was great and I would love to return back if presented
good,"I enjoyed working the 15 months with the Atlanta Hub location; However, I have reapplied with them and several other locations and nothing not even an Interview;  I was a good worker in my department first to arrive and last to leave; I went beyond Remarkable toward Customers in giving my all;  I would love to be rehired in the Fire Department where my Friend is an Associate and a Board Member; she is familiar with my work and my Character. My day would start with the answering of phone to assist customers who had recent accident; I would get help speedily to them, road service, renter,  set up repair if vehicle was not total, investigated to see who was at liable for the accident; brought claim to resolution; paid out claim.  I would do other tasks that included mail, calling Customers, faxing, copying material needed to speed process of claim.  I really did enjoy my job.  My hardest part of the job was been value and view by my Manager as a skilled worker."
good,I enjoyed working in the fast paced insurance office. It was always Great Atmosphere. There are mainly pros working in a small office. Company is great. Competitive wages.
good,I would check the phone make sure there were not any messages. Then i would check my work email make sure there were no important messages. Then i would help with clients

good,"I began my career with State Farm as an independent contractor agent in 1981 and continue in that position today.  Briefly I served as a consultant for State Farm and was considered an employee of the company .   I served as a consultant for State Farm Agents in the West Texas area.   After about 5 years in that position, I returned as an agent  because of my preference to work directly with customers.  State Farm has always treated me fairly and my rewards have  been excellent."
good,"State Farm Insurance in a great place to work. If you want to make a career out it, make sure you are working to become an agent. You experience will depend highly on what agent you work for."
good,Great place to work. You stay busy and learn every day on the job. Each customer has different needs. The company is reputable and values their employees.

good,"i learnt patience and working with others "
good,"When you work at a State Farm office, you are an employee of the agent not the corporation. If you get a good agent, State Farm is a great place to work. The pay could be better."
good,"Emphasize on team work, communication, learning experiences. Thrive as a team. Opportunities to grow and learn as a professional,  earn licences, and gain valuable experience."
good,"I worked in the Life Insurance side of the company for 8 1/2 years.  I always enjoyed and appreciated the work environment.  Management was/is very knowledgeable about the company and industry and my managers were always very in touch with employees and concerned about well-being and employee progression.  Benefits were excellent, including health, dental, vision, 401K, but also other benefits as well that are not discussed as much that comprise the total compensation package.  There are plenty of opportunities for advancement, but at the same time there is so much to know and understand in each position that a person can still learn and grow as a person and employee for a very long time without necessarily feeling the need to ""move on"" to something better."
good,Everyone is focused and goal oriented. Motivates you to be the best you can be. Training is based on effort and willingness to learn. No pressure with other co-workers.

good,"As an intern, I was exposed to the culture of State Farm and learned about opportunities within the company, including career advancement, mentorship, work-life balance, and additional higher education. State Farm puts an emphasis on keeping its employees happy and satisfied, and my time there was highly enjoyable."
good,"State Farm is an excellent place of business, provided you have the ability to stay late, on occasion. Being a team player, and strong analytical skills, as well as excellent written and verbal communication skills, are a must for any position in claims."
good,Too many rapid changes with no true support from trained managers in the department they are supporting.  Company changes being made are far behind some of the management they have
good,"Great Manager"
good,"Friendly and out going management, fast paced sales and commisson. A lot of cold calling, and competitive with other branches in the local area.  Overall great company to work for."
good,"followed up on upcoming renewals"
good,"Great place to work, strict on attendance and adherence. Definitely best to be at least 5-10 mins early to work daily. Very clean workplace overall, friendly staff."
good,"Good benefits including time off, health insurance and other wellness benefits, compensated fairly for work performed; supportive and knowledgeable management."

I cannot thank them enough for their accommodations. A typical work day is fast past and fun, given that it's a good day. I enjoy the talks we have in the office and the fun environment they set."
good,"State Farm was one of the best employers that I have worked for in regards to the environment and interactions. There is a big stress on treating not only customers, but peers and coworkers with respect. State Farm puts a lot of work into helping each individual be the best person and employee possible. There are so many benefits that no matter what help someone is looking to get, there is information or assistance on that matter. There are many opportunities for growth."
good,"Pros"
good,"Overall I really enjoy the company. Typically I remained on phones all day, inbound calls, perhaps 50 calls a day. For 7-8 hours per day, I did other tasks like reviewing estimates and speaking with body shops throughout the day. I found my management to be thoroughly relaxed, allowing the associate to analyze each claim with confidence and integrity. I thought my resources were always available and all my licenses were updated as needed. Overall, I think the opportunity is there."
good,"Made so many connections and learned so much from very ambitious and noble people. Customer service is what is primarily taught at this job, and I learned a lot about always putting the customers' benefit before my own."
good,"I've worked in several offices and the culture & opportunity for advancement are main reasons to choose State Farm. They have great products and training resources to develop knowledge and skills needed to be successful. A lot depends on the management style of your agent, your ambition/personal goals, and the qualifications of coworkers around you."
good,"State Farm is a great place to work,  love the environment I am and and it is also not stressful, I have been in a fast pace- over bearing job and this is not that! Its great."
good,"I worked in one of State Farm's call centers. Unless it was a Monday, there was usually a small break between each individual call that came in. There is 6 weeks of training before you are out on your own, which is good because there are a ton of laws and certifications you have to go over (and then review annually)."
good,"a typical day at State Farm was going into work, checking on your clients seeing how far they had come in the licensing process and what is needed to be done to get them moved on so they could perform their duties on the call floor. I did learn alot about talking infront of people, being able to address a classroom of 50+ in a typical day without feeling overwhelmed. the management was really great, and they genuinely did care for their people and try to help them as much as possible. The workplace culture is really something to witness, very interesting with the ability to shop and eat at restaurants while not leaving the area. The hardest part of the job was having to say goodbye as I needed to be closer to family and a larger support system. The most enjoyable part of the job were the many wonderful people that I continue to keep in contact with."
good,I have worked at state farm for 4 years and am now the office manager in my current office. I have the best boss a person could ask for. I have learned a lot
good,"very nice clean work environment, great pay for a job well done, this company has been and will be around for many years to come."
good,"Higher management could have been better, but my manager was very understanding which made my job more comforting. Majority of my coworkers learned to ignore the many dislikes of the office, I however did not appreciate it."
good,"Fantastic People to work with, In order to really make money though one has to sell life insurance otherwise its not very high pay. My Boss is very interactive and very supportive and takes us all out to dinner and drinks all the time!!"
good,When working in a insurance place you have to keep in mind that you cant slack off. Deadlines have to be made and people are paying the company to insurance them on their safety. You have to be in front of a computer all day and thats great if you dont mind sitting down all day. Its a job that you have the same thing everyday.
good,"Great place to work--one of the true places that is work-life balance and not soul-sucking."
good,"The pay is more than adequate, PTO is earned rather than granted in one fell swoop, our management team is absolutely wonderful and supportive. There is a cafeteria on site as well as little break areas with vending machines/little market all over the building. The security makes me feel very secure. The resources and guidance available is really great."
good,"Working at State Farm is a great experience and I learn a lot every day, unfortunately, the commission has left something to be desired. Educating clients of insurance decisions and helping them through daily hardships is very fulfilling."
good,"The management is great, as well as, the co-workers.  Is fun to help customers with their needs.  The job can be very stressful and repetitious, which makes it boring at times."
good,"This was a great job, I was able to meet some great people and get my housing paid for all the while I was able to make some quick money."
good,"The company has been an excellent source of growth for myself. I have had the opportunity to build and advance my skills in customer service, organization and legal processes. Although I have  had a pleasant experience, the company is undergoing nationwide changes that have forced its employees into undesired roles which has made it difficult to maintain the moral within the employees. I am highly adaptable and this has had little to no affect on my ethic to provide the best service possible to our customers. However, I am confident my skills are transferrable and that I will continue to grow as I am quickly adaptable in any environment I am in."
good,"Over all the job is really good, good pay and good opportunities. Co workers are fun. Overall a good job. The only thing is the full time hours are over whelming and you have to work every weekend."
good,"Great company to work for, great people working here. I had a great 10 years with the company, and it feels sad they they centralize in other states. Unable to move at this time ."
good,"Once you star your day as in claims you are phones all day. Phones was never an issue taking or making at work because you were helping people who had car accidents.  I loved my co-workers and managers and wished I didn't have to relocate or I would still be working there now. I learned so much at State Farm about Customer Service that now I when I see something that is subpar I tell the company how they can make things better for the customer or staff.  The hardest part of the job was leaving on time, I was always working a claim that kept me at work longer then my end time but I knew it needed to get done so the customer's claim could be paid and the car could be repaired.  The best part of my job was talking to all the different people on the phone, we had assigned claims so we were able make friends on personal levels with our customers."
good,"I had the pleasure of working at State Farm Insurance Company for 3yrs and I gained a lot of knowledge about the insurance business as a employee and as a consumer. The working environment was enjoyable and I liked my co workers. In fact, I established I hope some life long friendships. I definitely would go back."

good,"Work at State Farm usually began with a team meeting so that we could discuss the days goals and the previous days activities. We learned form those meetings ways to improve each day to day activity such as the sales cycle, customer retention and other operations throughout the office. The work environment was also a plus, having a team that I can relate to was a great aspect of the work day. Because once I had an issue we as a team could bounce ideas of one another so that each person could gain valuable experience that could help each of us do our jobs better each day."
good,A Typical day at work would be servicing customer and taking sales calls for various customers and potential customers. I have learned a how to quote and properly rate business proposals and bank application to customers that qualify with our company. I have learned how to manage different starting team members on helping them built their foundation. The hardest part of my job is knowing that I am a person that would always want to help a customer no matter what the situation was. The best part of my job was closing a sale on a business application.
good,"At State Farm call center is focused on developing their employees and providing outstanding customer service.  A day is spent on the phone answering inbound calls regarding any new/existed claims, make payments, updating information or adding vehicles and general questions about their account. They say we are a State Farm Family everyone is nice and professional. The hardest part is just simply the call center job. It is tough and mentally exhausting work. Most enjoyable part of the day is when I can make something good in someone's day."
good,I really enjoyed working with State Farm. There was always a helping hand by upper management to assist in any questions that you may have had. Fun working environment and lots of training to advance your career.

The environment of State Farm is always changing, so it's exciting to learn new procedures that will benefit the customer. The supervisors and managers are there to help you develop yourself within the company as well as personally. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the emotional calls, like when someone loses their home or loses a loved one, but the enjoyable part of the job is being able to comfort and help those people in their time of need."
good,"The coworkers are very helpful"
good,"State Farm was a great company to work for. We processed mail and faxes for the claims of the entire east cost by prepping, scanning and indexing all documents sent to us.

good,I enjoyed my job. My supervisor was wonderful and really created an atmosphere that made me feel that I made a difference in helping customers everyday. My typical day at work was answering calls from vendors to provide them with information about policyholders on glass claims and to record drafts into a claim that were written by agents to reimburse policyholders for their emergency roadside service expenses.
good,"Overall State Farm is one of the strongest and sound companies in the country, with some of the state of art technology, plus a warm and friendly environment. I think it’s one of the Best places to work for."
good,State Farm Bank strives to be best in class and they provide excellent personal and business development to their employees. Working in the vendor space has allowed me to view how much State Farm Bank strives to expand their remarkable reputation even through third party service providers.
good,Lots of changes but also good job security.  They use an old system in underwriting so be prepared for 8 months of training.  Its not a bad company...
good,"A great place.  I worked for State Farm Insurance for 30 years.  I retired after 30 years with much success and happiness.."
good,"I worked at State Farm from 2001-2013.  I initially looked for other employment because it had been announced many offices, including Dallas were to be closing and we may or maynot have a job in Austin, TX. "
good,"I've worked here for two years, I started as a marketing intern and was hired to work full time after that. All the employees are nice including my boss and we all get along, so that makes working together nice. I handle a lot of customer service calls, such as taking phone calls, making changes, doing quotes, mailings, callings, etc. My hardest part of the job is dealing with mean or difficult customers who don't understand why their rates went up or something like that, and my favorite part of the job, is getting to know the customers that come in and are super nice, and you're just like 'wow there still are some really decent people out there.'"
good,State Farm has always been a very reputable company and the leader in the insurance industry. It was a very positive working environment and friendly boss.

good,My typical day at work consists of mailing or calling customers and remind them about their bill's due date or to check any other possible questions or concerns they may have. I file throughout the day and answer a multi-line phone. I love working with the public I am a people person and really enjoy helping them with anything that I can. I treat my customers not just like their another person but like they are friends and family.
good,"I fell into the State Farm Family since my parents worked for the Company.  Both retired after 30 years respectively.  I am currently an employee of a State Farm Agency, whereas my parents worked for the Company.  Both are great to work for since across all lines we work in unison to manage risks, recover from the unexpected, and help people realize their dreams.  The Company has had many changes in the past few years, but none as much as in the past year.  The changes are positive as we have become more streamlined and seamless.  Honestly it has been frustrating, but like any change it takes time and this time it is a positive one.  I recommend this Company and/or their Agents as they will always be around.  Job security is a big plus and the benefits are great as well.  Working for the Company can be great if you desire to be an agent, but it is not a requirement.  I recommend working for an agent for at least 2 years or simply speak to a recruiter.  If you have the desire to help people then this could be your calling."
good,"I obtained my Fire & Casualty and Life Insurance license. I learned how to market and sell insurance from my agent calling out of phone books, cross sale, and walking door to door. The insurance industry is a 24 hour nonstop job trying to build your clientele.  It was hard work but something I enjoyed. I took incoming calls and walk in clients who needed service or questions on their policy, process their payments, and took claims.  We used ABS and NECHO database system."
good,"I helped people with insurance losses, accidents, thefts,fires, storms, and death benefits. It made me feel really good about my job when I was able to help policyholders with their insurance needs."

good,"Typical day included, morning meeting, check status of claims and update policy holders, take insurance applications, answering phones, faxing, filing,following up with prospective clients. The most enjoyable part was the customers. Since the office is small most customers knew all of us by name. The hardest part of the job was learning about all the pros and cons of the different policies so that we could better educate our customers properly. Once that was accomplished, day to day was very enjoyable and I learned alot"

They ensured that we were well informed about new processes. It was a great working environment with excellent views from huge windows."
good,"Good if you need a odd schedule, they literally have a schedule for everyone. The hardest part of the job was being continuously micro managed. I learned that they have the best insurance policies around."

good,Laid back work environments. Excellent family oriented business. Many opps to train and learn new aspects of business. Loved working in the trade andwith HQ office.
good,Filed auto and home claims mostly.  On the phone your entire shift.  Talk to everyone from policyholders to agents to new customers.  Can be stressful at times.

good,"nothing nice to say, so i will not say anything, poor management they are liers and two faced. They job is low paid for the amount of stressed that comes with it."
good,"The job and working with customers and helping was great until the ""BOSS"" came in. No support system all was numbers $$ for them. ONly people with money could talk. FOr some reason they always came out of pocket for your salary yet was still in business and had a porsche chilling in their garage hmmmm didn't seem right. If you don't like being a business owner (franchise in this case) then why be one! But Company itself is amazing loved it! Wouldn't change it maybe just agents."
good,"good job to work at loooooking forward to others being employed there"
good,"Nothing to write about this company. Not applicable. Great job for those looking for opportunity. The drive for sales is number one, so be aware what you're getting into."
good,Everyday is different and can be challenging.  We are always learning something new and need to apply it immediately.
good,Great Company but pay was not satisfying. I am not willing to work somewhere that is commission based only.Flexible with the hours and works with you if your in school.
good,"Agreed to be paid at $ 2,000.00 per month + Commission. I was not paid as indicated when I interviewed, I never received any commissions, never received pay check on time, there was no pay for attending pre license classes. Hourly pay was less than $ 11.00 hourly. Very strict micro-management by office manager and owner. There are individual cameras in each office and Owners and Manager watch them all the time. Not to protect the Customers but to watch the Agents and listen to what they say."
good,I only work possibly 8 hours per month.  I reconcile the monthly bank statement and deposits.  I did work as the Front Receptionist and job shared this job when first started in 2006.  I know only do the reconciliation and  portion of this job now.  A truly wonderful place to work with a team of wonderful employees.
good,"I have always been satisfied, but because of the limited advancement oppurtunity one can only bounce from office to office after a few years max at each location."
good,"Got hired as an Express Claims Adjuster. Throughout training, the experience was fast pace, taught through modules and when getting on to the floor, the manager I had felt I should have to know everything. The money is good, but would never want to work for this company just because of the Manager I had."
good,"I great company to work for, if you are paired with the right supervisors to help you grow. •Plans machining by studying work orders, blueprints, engineering plans, materials, specifications, orthographic drawings, reference planes, locations of surfaces, and machining parameters; interpreting geometric dimensions and tolerances (GD&T)."
good,Lack of management by agent created a unstable environment lack of resources example toilet paper napkins and delay payroll ...If these small things were meet id continued my career ..

good,State farm is an excellent company to work for. The members of leadership and my colleagues are pleasant and a joy to work with
good,Fast pace industry with limited growth opportunities within the agency offices.
good,"Sell Auto/Home/life/Health products offered superior products, take care of the customer is number one most important, clean office great staff, great location"
good,Management was not the best. The best part about working at State Farm Ins was education the client on our policies and helping them purchase the right one.
good,"The duties were always different but we were responsible for getting the duties done. Sometimes you didn't know what you were going to do until arriving, but some project would usually show up, the times in between jobs we would work on our paper work or cleaning up and organizing work areas.There was always ways to keep busy."
good,"State Farm is a good company and your working experience will depend on the Agent that you work for., My experience varied a lot from different offices. You are not guaranteed benefits (this is up to the agent as you are not a state farm employee), and this was the biggest issue that I had working for State Farm. Like anywhere, some agents provide a great and beneficial place to work, others do not."
good,"Working at State Farm Insurance was very exciting. I learned to manage an office without close supervision and improve on my customer service skills.  This was my very first job right out of high school so the compensation, at the time, was not as advanced as the compensation package it may have today. I am very grateful for the opportunity given me to expand my skills and knowledge in the administration business market."
good,"I was an incoming mail sorter hired by their in house temp employment agency, Ranstad."
good,Learned different parts of the Insurance Business. Enjoy working with my co-workers we always work together & help each other. Team Work.  The most enjoyable part of the job is learning something new every day.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for this company."
good,"My typical day at work involves running reports for marketing purposes, answering incoming phone calls and taking customer payments in person or over the phone. The most enjoyable part of my day is working with my team and interacting with customers."
good,"Overall is a very reputable company to work for. Independent agents are what make the biggest difference. I am always learning with this company as with any insurance company. It is a fast paced environment, which requires one's full attention. Hardest part of any office job are the childish politics. I am an adult, I prefer to work with adults. "
good,seeking employment after retiring from State Farm insurance after 31 years.  I started as data entry and was promoted to customer service and then to a technical specialist
good,"The shifts were very flexible. You could select your own shift. If you needed a schedule that allowed you to pick kids up from school management would be sure to find you a schedule that would fit your needs,"
good,"This is a great place to work but YOU have to be flexible with your ours because they won't be.  When you are asked to take an off shift, don't say no or you will be out the door."
good,"A typical day involves communicating with current clients and new prospects.   I solve problems, take payments, give quotes, and pivot to several available products.   I manage and train new team members daily.    I also compile agency results, cancelations, sales, and other office reports daily as well."
good,"I work as a team member in my agent's office located in Washington DC. A typical day varies from customer service duties (ie taking phone calls, taking payments, making changes and accomplishing any request from our clients) to writing polices for auto and fire."
good,"It’s ok.. It’s a good place to work if you’re going to school, they offer part time. It’s a good place to start your career. There are plenty of departments to move around to and lots of growth opportunities."
good,Not for everybody but you can definitely learn a lot from this company. Dealing with customers can be a challenge but it can also be very rewarding. We change lives
good,"State Farm working with the agents as a team member, you are not working for the corporation.  YOUR employment is with the local agent.  Similar to your home town doctor or dentist, general practitioner type.  So the work is fast paced and because its insurance accuracy is vital. "
good,Relaxing environment. They work well with your schedule and they try to help out if they can. Get to work with nice people. Boss is awesome he is very easy going.
good,I enjoyed the work I was doing.  Too bad it was a temp position and that Statefarm did not take me up on my applications for full time permanent employment.
good,"Was asked it I was interested in being trained as an agent, I was, but was not given the chance.  Only wanted me for 6 months until a new agent was trained and purchased the franchise for Crockett.  The agent that was temporary did not care about whether I had future employment with the new owner or not.  However, was a nice place to work while it lasted.  I knew the customers and enjoyed being there to serve them.a"
good,Very great environment. Very friendly co workers and staff. Self driven competitive work ethic. No micro management involved. Great team of sales leaders.
good,"Every single office is incredibly different from one another. Each office not only has its own culture, but it also has a different code of ethics, and policies. Some offices have more PTO days than others, they have different business hours, and befits, and commission structures. If you are looking at applying for a position, be sure to be thorough in your interview of the agent."
good,"From 9a to 6p the phone just rings, customers call all day long "
good,"Great place to work, Managers are great, typical day at work is to come in get set at your computer answer a few calls, help a few customers out and then go home. Wonderful place of employment."
good,"Depending on the Agent, the compensation is lucrative. Customers are typically unhappy about rate increases. This is the right job for the right person,"
good,Good pay. Schedule was not the best and changing it takes some time. The best part is the compensation. Semi-professional but most people consider sales as great position.
good,You have to be careful turn over rate. You will answer phones have to be fast and not care about the people on the other line it is sad job.
good,"Its a busy day at work. especially alot of customer service, public dealing, handling phone calls. A lot of team work I am licensed to write insurance policies that comprise of property, casualty, life and health. Challenging part is to handle issues with the underwriting department. The most enjoyable part of the job is to be successful in selling multiple lines of policies"
good,"Advancement is very minimal. The rate of pay is very poor for all the responsibility and stress. The culture is ok, however it could be a lot better."
good,This is a great job to get started in Sales. It teaches you a lot about sales and customer maintenance. I have enjoyed my time working at State Farm but I am ready for a more challenging career.
good,"There was not the ability to advance, they have closed all regional office in CA.  Middle management was not employee favorable. HR was as expected , protecting management. Not a bad place to work.Just could have been better."
good,"State Farm like most companies would be considered the ideal company to work for.  The training is intense, however, like most changes from time to time due to meat state and federal regulation throughout the industry.  The work day consist of of checking emails, going to daily trainings and working with the different departments that compose the jobs overall.  The management is ok, however, at times can be very political where some times one is forced to change their personality in order to meet the team overall objective.  The hardest part of the job is learning the balance between trying to adjust your personality in order to fit the overall team dynamic.  It doesn't always work.  Most especially if you already came with the current personality that you have in order for you to get through the day or to even do the task assigned at hand.  To me the most enjoyable part of the day was the work load because it allowed me to stay and remain busy.  This allowed you to increase your experience over all."
good,"A typical day for me is a short day. I am good on the phone, and I am able to smile through the phone, making people feel at ease. I work alone with my lap top and phone in at a quiet moment when I can hear myself breathe. The part of my job that I'm not too fond of is when I get voicemails or fax machines. However, I enjoy helping the people that I reach because I get the best of both worlds. I can help the agent to reach his/her goals, and I can help the person that is inquiring about insurance."
good,"• Processed applications, payments, and corrections."
good,"The tone of every State Farm branch is set by the owner. Some are very fun, others are very strict. However, they are all very client focused. Every office has co-workers that can be difficult and those that are easy and even fun to work with. This is something that apply's, I believe, to all workplaces. The most challenging part of my job was keeping up with the continual changes, however, State Farm was very good with training all it's offices long before any changes were actually implemented. The most enjoyable part by far was working with people and explaining their policies and putting together policies that were right for them."
good,"I worked for a agent, at the time I had my P&C Iicense so I was his right hand, sold auto /home insurance policies, quoted home and auto quotes,answered heavy phones,handled cash,the office was small only worked with the owner,and one aother co-worker"
good,Work for a friend to replace staff until new employee located.
good,"It was a good company to be involved with, but it was hard to do the telemarketing for me. But if u studied for the insurance test u could advance to the insurance representative position."
good,Answered phone. Received payments and entered them into customers account! I truly enjoyed this job! Left due to conflict of hours with another job!
good,"The employer was very professional, the agency book of business included a very high level of clientele.  Job description, duties and work guidelines were not clear and therefore workloads for the employees was inconsistent."
good,Working at State Farm has been a Great experience for me. Great benefits great people just stressful in work load due to being under staffed for a couple months
good,"If I was under a different agent, then my experience would have been much better."
good,In the time I was employed by this company I was working as a bartender. Entering a completely new field based on personality alone was intimidating. Although rewarding to have a step in the right direction and break through into a new career; there was little to no training.
good,"Good 9-5 but lack of benefits. Some days are slower than others but overall it is a good company. Have to learn fast, it’s a faced paced job. I overall liked it"
good,"I work with State Farm for five years started out as a license life, accident and health moved up to property & casualty and Commercial also certified Bank license representative and a notary."
good,Agents do not compensate their employees well enough.  Causing employee morale to be low.  Corporate should monitor how much the people on the forefront are actually compensated.
good,"Great job. You have to be organized. People skills are a must. I loved helping people so this job was great. Cant be scared of the sale. Just find the product the fits them best, they will buy."
good,"Relaxed workplace, poor management but great benefits. Hard to transfer within the company. Overall I would recommend working here if it is in the department you want to stay in."
good,this was a customer service job for claims from auto insurance. it was a good company to work for. I work 7 through 11 Monday through Friday. Management ok I was there long enough to give a fair assessment.
good,A typical day at work is answering phones and working tasks.    The hardest part of the job is making liability decisions and ensuring that you meet all the metrics.   The management lacks compassion and communication with the staff.
good,A day to start off is to call all clients that have birthdays and anniversary's. Take care of all clients that walk in to the facility to help in any need that needs to be met.
good,"Enjoyed working at State Farm the people were very nice and the work was fun enjoyed several friendships throughout the years the compensation wasn't the best, but was able to sustain my family for the better part of 14 years working there. I will always be grateful for the opportunity I had to work for State Farm."
good,The work environment is different with every agent. In our office environment the basis of our culture is productivity. The industry has changed significantly in the past few years. They've moved into the digital era.
good,Typical work day is pretty slow can sometimes be exciting. Not a job for someone that doesn't have a competitive nature.
good,if you like helping others this may be the job for you. state Farm is a fantastic company to work for because they have the best products and customer service out there. However some agents can be tough on their team members.
good,"On a regular day, I will take payments, answer phone calls regarding billing questions, make changes to policies, fax, email, scan, upload documents, file claims for our customers, make phone calls to our insured regarding accidents, set up assignments and reservations."
good,"Great company and I love my co-workers.  No room for advancement in independent agents offices.  "
good,It was a great place to work. Nice staff and awesome boss. The only reason for leaving is the distance was too far. I did full customer service work.

good,"Meeting new people is the greatest part of the job, and the customers want to talk to you and share things with you."

good,This was the first experience I had with being able to help individuals with basic needs for their family and being able to help protect their family against possible risks.
good,The Agency was the boss you enjoyed working for and would work more hard because of the positive work environment. Very knowledgeable and character like no other.
good,State Farm is a great place to work. That is if your working with the right people. You need a good boss that  is willing to help you learn and succeed in your job!
good,"My typical day starts as I get up early and try to get to work at least 25 minutes before the ‘start time’. In this way, I can avoid any delays due to traffic jams and can still be on time for work. Then, I sit down and plan the day. I jot down what all plans I have to complete and prioritize them depending on their urgency and importance. I check my voice mails and emails and the calendar and try to make plans such as organizing meetings and such. This way I can increase my pace for doing work and can be more productive for the day. “"
good,Get experience and all the licenses you can and you’ll make more money. Each agent is different in how they pay and with what benefits they offer. Find a good agent.
good,I got to learn how to use excel more and other programs. Always taking phone calls helping customers with their problems and getting a lot of customer service experience there.
good,The work is fast paced and requires a lot of attention to detail. I really enjoy my coworkers. The environment is friendly and competitive. The commission is awesome.
good,Handled inbound calls. Assisted with appointment setting. Handed cash transactions and bank deposit drops. Would handle phone calls in regards to insurance verification.
good,"I worked there from high school until the age of 27, i gained a lot of experience. State Farm did shape my values on insurance and helped my Sales skills."
good,"Friendly, kind, caring, knowledgeable, dealing with rude customers, helping customers who are appreciative of you  coverages are more under standing if you didn’t know before"
good,"Great people and a great company to work for.  The culture, the sense of purpose can not be understated.  It is truly fulfilling to work here . I suggest this career to everyone I know."
good,I absolutely love my job but i wish the pay was a little bit higher. My supervisor is awesome and my co-workers are very friendly. Great place to work!!

More specifically utilizing social media marketing and being able to market to the newer generation of people. A newer agent is on a different contract which is more production driven with less compensation on new business and renewals. This means working for a newer agent will most likely offer a lesser base but if you can sell then you will be able to make a good living with your commissions. Some newer and older agents are hardly in the office which some prefer but can make other aspects difficult."

The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity to interact with such a variety of people and to travel to so many interesting places, big cities and small towns."

good,"Very demanding, busy, multi-tasking job. Making sure that the day was productive and tasks were accomplished and up to date. Also, very friendly work environment and casual, where co-workers are easy to get a long with and fun to work with. Trying to keep everyone happy is the most challenging part of the job but like the saying goes you can't make everyone happy. The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility and meeting my goals for the day and making sure to the best of my ability that my mission has been accomplished at the end of work day where by mail has gone out, notary's tasks have been taken care of and UPS packages are all packed and ready to be sent out."
good,"Branching out into working in the field with on-site accident investigation, dealing with attorneys, and extending my experience to personal injury claims was very rewarding. The most enjoyable part of my job was their management style, which allowed me to work my own hours. I found that I could manage difficult claims in a timely manner, keeping up with my case load."
good,Going into work was always a new and enjoyable day. From sorting out client info to filing papers. Learning a great deal of how to productively sort out papers and insert them into the computer. My co-workers are family so it was always great to see my mother and sister on a daily basis. The hardest part was making sure I didn't mess up a client information on the computer. The most enjoyable part was going to meeting and seeing how our fellow agents work their magic.
good,Meeting with the business to go over business requirements
good,most enjoyable part was helping the elderly with life insurance questions and makeing sure they were okay for the after life

good,good employer if you are lucky enough to work for the actual company
good,"A typical day at working included answering calls as it was a call center. Other duties included creating disclosures, AI letters, subrogation notices, and benefit exhaustion letters. I learned a lot from State Farm including Florida's policies and how to do may different tasks related to the insurance industry. My management was very friendly and flexible. Co-workers were very team oriented and always assisted when helped when it was needed. The hardest part of the job was the distance from my home. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was high paced and there was always something that needed to be done."
good,"Great company to work for. Not only are they customer focused but they are also employee centered as well. Very positive environment to work in,"
good,"always busy, learned alot about insurance industry mananagemtn and co workers were close, hardest part of job was not being able to help enough, most enjoyable part was helping as much as i could"
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere in the office, the owner and staff worked together well; the staff had been there over 25 years and enjoyed working with me also. We were very supportive of each other to complete the work in the office."
good,Great learning opportunity within the insurance industry.
good,"I worked as a temporary employee for State Farm, performing mailroom and data entry tasks. I found the department I was in to be structured and professional but also fun. Many employees had worked there most of their working lives and continued to enjoy it and were very loyal. My typical day was reviewing insurance forms and entering/correcting data. My co-workers and supervisors were friendly and helpful and I never felt out of place because of my temporary worker status. I really cannot say that there was any aspect of the job I did not enjoy."
good,"Answer phone, take payments, answer questions for customers"
good,Works well with life / work balance.
good,"State Farm is a company you can feel good standing behind. Everyone is very nice and hard working. However this is a very demanding job, you have to be able to real go for it, no cutting corners. It involves a lot of calling and selling, time management and attention to detail. This is the kind of job where your stress from the job and follow you home. There is no job security, if you don't sell you wont have a job for very long and if you do sell then be ready to always be on top and remember that you'll always be expected to do better next month with your numbers. If you love the idea that you can control how much money you make, depending on how much work and effort you put in, well then this job is for you!"
good,"Professionally represent State Farm, serving as initial liaison between clients and agency staff, as well as meeting potential clients."
good,I like working for such a great company. I work Monday thru Friday. I get paid time off and some holidays.
good,enjoyed meeting new people and providing customer service
good,"I only worked there for a 10 week internship, but it was still a fun place to work!"
good,No matter what department I worked (Personal/Commercial Fire Lines and Human Resources) it was always fun and productive.
good,"Supporting and caring group. Will go far if you are an honest, bright person."
good,"Each time that I was called to State Farm was a really good day. Wonderful folks to work with, really good procedures. Great lunchroom that was accessable to all."
good,"A typical day starts with a meeting to review what has been done and what needs to be done, what needs the high priority. Once the things are planned, things are assigned to different teams."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was the satisfaction of being able to hand someone a check or give them the peace of mind they needed to get through a difficult time in their lives. I was new to the insurance world when I began here, and they really taught me a lot. The difficult thing for me was the people who we were unable to help through no fault of our own."
good,"Due to personal and medical reasons I had to leave State Farm. They were a great company and I enjoyed my job. A typical day would be to review claims and contact customers. You often had angry customers, but you did the best you could to provide customer service and help them in their time of need. No one wants to have an accident but it does happen so you want to strive to get them back to where they were prior to the accident. Hardest part of the job was not being able to give them everything they demanded. But if you explain the laws of Michigan and show empathy for their situation, it all worked out good in the end. I worked with a great team and management. I was very sad to leave and hope to try and get back to State Farm."
good,Provided Financial & Insurance Products to Clients
good,I enjoyed working with people to determine what types of insurance would best suit their needs.
good,"I really liked working for statefarm , first thing in the morning I had great attitude from my other co workers always said good morning with a smile, I always stayed busy , answering phones , making payments , processing applications , I didnt get to work there long enough to get lic , I was told the reason I was let go was because the needed somebody lic right away ,did not understand why I was hired in the first place if that was the case."
good,"This position was very personally rewarding. Was able to customize many different types of healthcare insurance coverages to meet the customers' needs. I worked closely with the underwriters to ensure acceptance of the healthcare applications. This position had a great deal of autonomy. Small office environment, worked for a State Farm agent. The company is very reliable, stable and professional. I received a great deal of training and had the pleasure of working with team-oriented co-workers and a loyal customer base."
good,My boss here was amazing and helped me get my license to sell insurance they were really fun to work with.
good,"The company is very equal with all employers, and very helpful with continuing education. It offers benefits good pay and very steady schedule."

good,Great company with benefits. Not too much negative to say. Great place to work.
good,"I loved working at State Farm Insurance Company. The environment was quiet and everyone was hard at work. My duties were to answer incoming phone calls, and schedule appointments. I also did outbound calling to get more people to sign up for state farm."
good,"Always things to take care of, insureds to take care of and new and innovative products to share with insureds. It was a very satisfying job when it came to the aspect of being able to actually getting clients to understand WHY they needed the coverages they needed."

good,"Great location no freeway driving, nice office to work at with great people. Hours were good, no weekends."
good,worked with a great manager who was a wonderful mentor and a catalyst for change in my life. I will never forget her.
good,"I had some great people and was inspired by one of my Supervisors to go back to school and finish my degree, that was the energy I needed and I accepted the challenge"
good,"Loved going to work here, the environment was very family orientate pay was not competitive enough to be able to stay as well as support myself and my family."
good,"State Farm was simply a pleasure to work for. From the environment to overall morale, I enjoyed working there. I gained some lasting relationships along the way I am thankful for."
good,Collaboration with other departments a must. Could be fast paced AND have slow days as well. Learned all about the life of an auto claim. Office environment was always nice and even fun on holidays etc. Claims offices for SF in California are becoming less and less. Jobs are being relocated. Being mobile is a must if you want to keep working here.
good,No benefits.  Good company. I have learned a lot. Management is great.  Very competitive.     The hardest part of the job is that we are expected to sell but we don't purchase leads.
good,A lot of different work. A lot of service and marketing. No time for sales. Intense work place with high stress. Make you want have an eventful day. Never know whats ahead.
good,"Everything is based on the office you are working for and the size of their book."
good,Each agent is independent and on contract. All I've worked with i feel have not pssed the gratuity to the ones who drive the business the CSR & sales agents..
good,"the better you are, the more you will love this job. you can't really say a job is ""bad"" when the job's quality depends on how good you are. working sales at state farm is not only a reflection of yourself, but also a reflection of the company."
good,"Working for different companies after working at State Farm is very dissapointing and eye-opening. The quality and standards are ABOVE ALL OTHERS that you will want to duplicate,- but can't. If you have a representative that truly loves her job and does it well,  then there is no way that you could possily be dissapointed with the services provided."
good,"This is an excellent company. The Technology, The Mission and the vision of this company always focus its action in the future. The education with State Farm is great"
good,"Develop leads, schedule appointments, identify customer needs, and"
good,"This company pays below market average for similar positions. If you get a good manager that has respect for the team, you can get comfortable with a long term job. Schedule changes occur every quarter, in certain entry level positions. Once you get above entry level, you can look forward to set working hours."
good,Great culture. Great People. Great foundation and structure. Good work environment. Great customer service. Underwriters were fair. Service/products are good.
good,"At State Farm the idea is to help the customer as much as possible. Customers do not always understand or even know what type of policies they need. At State farm it is our job to inform them, help them, and make sure they are satisfied."
good,"If you are pd hourly, it's a fine place to work. But commission is so hard when you get charged back if customers cancel.  Not fair at all when you have done all the work to write them."
good,"State Farm is a great company to work for, after all they are the #1 insurance company in the USA . There are a few customers who can get pretty hate full, but with a smile on your face, you can sometimes help them get calm & leave or hang up the phone happy & then there are the ones who are wonderful to work with. The enjoyable part, about this job is making people happy and putting a smile on someone's face and having a great team to work with."
good,"Great workplace easy work load. Part time hours were perfect to balance my lifestyle. Relaxed working environment, none micro managed atmosphere. Poor management"
good,Education was great I loved the job just could not pay bills on $12 a hour.  Hardest part of the job is the leads..... if you received a great lead you would usually make the sale.  It is difficult to educate someone over the phone about auto insurance
good,"A typical work day consists of reviewing mail and handling it accordingly while also answering the phones and tending to the needs of both the insureds and third party. Working at State Farm allowed me to utilize and my customer service skills when dealing with those who have faced a loss from very minor to epic proportions."
good,"Management was never satisfied, certain employees would run to management to tell on other employees like a 5 year old. Too much gossip. Manager would gossip about clients behind their back, called one client a s****. Very degrading and uncomfortable atmosphere."
good,"Loved working for the company, dashboard was easy to navigate, underwriters were always helpful. Management needed to be trained and be willing to help employees when needed."
good,I have worked for many different agents from start-up to promotion to Management.  Great place with family flexibility.
good,This company has a professional work environment and gives equal job opportunity. It encourages employees to further their education and training.
good,"Working for State Farm is enjoyable, challenging and everyday is different.  I genuinely enjoy my job, just make sure that your Agent is a good fit for you, or it can be a hard place to work."
good,"Call Center handling auto insurance claims. The call center was a fast pace and ever changing work environment. This call center handles claims in the GLZ, Great Lake Zone. On average handling 30-40 claims a day. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people, my colleagues were from all walks of life and had various previous work experience; some veterans and others newbies."
good,"Answering phones and typing emails...looking for new business, and servicing current customers. the boss very a very interesting person with a lot of insurance knowledge so were her employees"
good,I worked in the transcription dept typing insurance letters/documents on the computer system.  I learned interesting things about homes as a lot of the claims were concerning homeowners' policies.
good,"Above average benefits, flexible work schedule, exponential growth of company and growth opportunity."
good,Typical Call Center experience. Easy going environment. Fun environment.
good,Full service agent in office completed many tasks from selling all different types of insurance or State Farm Bank products to servicing clients for claims and payments.
good,"work is redundant, never expect to advance. all state farms are individual owned there is no HR and you can be taken advantage of if you don't know your rights"
good,The work was easy but customers are sometimes unappreciative towards your extra effort. I have worked for both an agent and SF corporate.  Corporate has excellent pay w/ benefits.  Agents? Not so much.  Low pay and no benefits.  However the whole company offers no room for advancement.  I have worked for State Farm for almost 7 years and I have my bachelors degree.  My AFS approached me and offered me this temporary position in an agency until a replacement agent is found. I took it because it was a FT job w/ benefits.  Problem is no one has even asked me if I would want to become an agent.  They are too busy farming outside SF.  The computer system is difficult and the Underwriting rules are inconsistent.  No amount of training will prepare you to use the system. Trial and error is the only way.  Yet the company searches for replacement agents OUTSIDE of State Farm?  The whole system is flawed.  The best area to work in is claims and underwriting; hence why those jobs rarely come available.
good,"I have had State Farm Insurance my whole life. One day I walked in, having a question about my car insurance and walked out with a part time job. I helped in the office with whatever they needed, whether that was filing, processing some forms, or mailing them out. I also cleaned the office, that included shampooing the carpets, to cleaning the bathrooms, whatever needed to get done."
good,I called customers and asked them to come in and review their policies. And used a system called Callfire to call and ask people if they would like a quote on their auto insurance.
good,"Company is OK, co-workers are great. Advancement is tough, salary is less than competitive."
good,State Farm had a comfortable work place environment. My job description had me talking to clients and managing their automobile insurance needs. The staff was extremely organized and hardworking as it allowed for a suitable workplace environment. This job is perfect for individuals who enjoy helping others through telephone based conversations. The most enjoyable part of this job was the friendly co-workers.
good,"Enjoyed working in State Farm,Liked the culture,Very cooperative team,Life balanced while working.Liked management.Very fast growing company.Thank you."
good,"It was an awesome experience, hopefully I get a more permanent solution. So many great opportunities at this company makes it very competitive in insurance field."
good,"I enjoyed working there except for the work overload. They give you the work of 3 people servicing AND you have to make sales. So each person does service work for 2,500 households. You are expected to do 9 hours of service work within 3 to 4 hours and spend 2nd half of your day on sales work- which means selling policies. Customers are always upset bc you NEVER have time to help them all. Everyday you have to decide which people you will lie to and say you are working on their issues- when really there is no way you have time to help them. So you have to just use judgement to determine which people will cause the biggest scene or bug you the most- and help them. Leaving the nice polite people to get bent."
good,"As a receptionist, it was a good job, but it can also be very stressful. The only downside, whether you work full time or part time, if you were not sales, then you would not get any benefits. The pay also varies depending if you are licensed or not."
good,"A typical day is sell sell sell it all about sells, customer services."
good,I enjoyed working for the company but I didn't like the pay I received. Overall StateFarm is a great place to network and grow depending on Management
good,"Worked with different agents. All that I could say is it's a great company to what for! Provides different products for customers, give many opportunities to make a sale."
good,"This is a fast paced enviroment, if you are adaptable and like to make money this is the job for you. Overtime pay is great here I loved it, it's difficult to advance though. There's good managers and bad managers, stay away from gossip it's very high school at this location."
good,Worked for State Farm for 28 yrs and there were great times and there were stressful times.  But in all State Farm was a  good company to work for as long as you did your job.
good,"Insurance is hard to sell, regardless of what company you have or perks. There is a common misconception that Agents who solicit Insurance are only doing it to sell policies for their own personal gain... I have never been that way personally, but it’s hard to shake it with the sheep of society now days."
good,"While the job itself was relatively low stress, the management and ridiculously short call times made for a very stressful work environment. "
good,loved it here. nothing but good things to say. the only thing is once you are in a position it is very difficult to move to a better one. but pay is great
good,"It's best to find an agent that is engaged in their business and sincerely cares about their clientele as well as their employees. If your goal is to help people in a time of need and desire to learn sales and networking, this could be the job for you."
good,"Great company, benefits, opportunity"
good,Ok to work for if you are a retired person.  I enjoy work at State Farm because if taught me how many type of insurance you can buy and what they are mean.  I love help the customer with their concern.
good,nothing further to say.  I was ok with the loss of my 11 yr career because the company was not the same quality as it was when I started with the company.
good,State farm is a great company to work for if you are a stay at home mom. The customers and the staff that i worked for were amazing I just needed more money
good,I cleaned her house did laundry fixed meals ran errands etc.  I was a caregiver I loved my position I still visit my client from time to time to make sure she is doing well.
good,"Great Company; Excellent Products; Great Benefits. My job was to review Reinspection Reports for liability risks on homeowner policies. Risk management procedures for insurability were employed. If liabilities were identified, letters were sent to the insured."
good,"Use scripted responses to assist customers, agents, and State Farm employees by phone"
good,"A lot of customer drama, great coworkers.I hated the fact of pushing a product onto a customer that I know doesn't qualify or can't afford the product."
good,I was a temporary employee so I can't really tell what it is like working at State Farm. I enjoyed my time there it was not stressful at all very laid back.
good,"A typical day consisted of helping clients in person and by phone.  Selling insurance and filing claims.  The culture was like working with family, not corporate."
good,This part-time position at a State Farm Insurance Agent Office allowed me to assist the agents with their daily activities while providing assistance to our agency customers.
good,"Awesome company all the way around! Offered health benefits, and decent pay.  upper management was awesome to work for/with. I would recommend other people to work for this company"
good,Leaving State Farm to go to a competitor to wok for was my single largest mistake professionally I have ever made. I miss it dearly and would trade my job back for a career there in a moment. So sad I left
good,It's a great company to work for.  When I started here back in 2011 I thought I would retire from State Farm.  Recent changes and the lack of advancement opportunities have changed my views.
good,Oversee daily functions of office. Identify and Resolve issues; prepare daily Bank Deposits. Calendaring. Personal Assistant. Administer database (Data Entry). Mailings. Payments Reminder/ Service calls. Supplies.
good,good company with great team work and excellent pleasant experience and good culture balanced work life we can the enjoy the working here and i am feeling happy for working for this client
good,Down home friendly work place with strong corporate culture and many pot lucks. Phones were intense and we had to cater to Agents with long term customers. We had to be on time and we worked a lot of overtime to keep up with customer demand and to extend our good customer service.
good,"I wasn't an office manager of the last State Farm office,I  did a lot of follow up calls for reviews and also sent out thank you cards. The only office manager position was at Nationwide insurance."
good,Learned so much throughout my time at State Farm.  I will move forward and build upon those skills.  You learn a lot about yourself working with other agents and you learn how to manage your time and multi-task.  You earn what you put in with effort and time.
good,Fast paced work environment. Pay/ commissions could be more but overall State Farm is a great insurance company to work for especially for beginners who want to learn about insurance.
good,Many opportunities and growth potential. It was a learning environment and allowed me the chance to work my way back into the corporate world after being in the education field for several years.
good,"It was a a good job, however for being ""the number one insurance company"" its frustrating to get paid the least out of all of them. "
good,"Great Company / Helped me with License and education classes and commissions and bonuses where over $1500 every month"
good,"ENJOYED WORKING AND OBTAINING NEW CLIENTS! ALSO ENJOYED EXPLAINING OTHER PRODUCTS AND GETTING THEM LAUNCHED WITH OUR CO. Re: our office, not enough help to meet the managers goals on our own. Manager not 100% on board with being a part of the policy  building team. Impossible to please this manager."
good,"No benefits, Agents make all the money. Changed the bonus compensation at a whim.  Too short staffed to make the necessary outside sales calls to get sales needed to get bonnus"
good,"Currently a sales representative, therefore making outbound calls to potential prospects. Making detailed notes about each client and prospect in State Farm Software. "
good,"This is not a job you punch a clock. Because it is commission based you must earn your bonus. If you are in the right office environment and culture, it can be a really fun job. The competitive nature of sales requires a team approach toward reaching sales goals. There is opportunity for growth and career advancement. Sales and customer service is not for everyone, but if it fits your personality than I would highly recommend."
good,"Great environment, "
good,"Love State Farm insurance company "
good,Lots of out of work activities to keep the team united. Boss is always there for the employees and any questions one had. Very family oriented environment.
good,State Farm is really not a bad company to work for. They are pretty much a laid back type of company. They take the company and customer serious. They are all about the company
good,"Encouraging management, multiple development opportunities. The training program used to be strong but they are making some adjustments and having growing pains at the moment. I'm sure they will pull it together soon."
good,I love to meet  meeting new people and helping people out. I really like my job. I love learning new thing about insurance and education customers about  it.
good,I love working for State Farm. It is a fair company to work for. The only thing I do not like is we do not get any benefits like medical and dental insurance.
good,My co workers were the most enjoyable part of my day they made working there easier. They also offered health and dental insurance which was a plus. It was a good company to work for.
good,Average workplace. The agent was truly caring of her customr base. Manager highly knowledgrable. Amount of claims was overwhelming for a staff of two.
good,Plenty of opportunites to grow and become more familiar with Job culture while gaining more skill assets. excellent environment with people who geniuely care.
good,"They hired on so many people that there was literally no chance for advancement. Also, my manager was never in her pod, she would always be up talking to the other teams."
good,"Events are great with State Farm, they like to market to the community. Always, has great things to give out to kids and adults.They reach out to their local events as much as possible."
good,"on an everyday came in to work, my days consisted of answering phone calls, reviewing and negotiating claims with claimants, assist team member with their work load, learned time management and how to balance a full work load, the hardest part would be dealing with claimants who are not happy with their settlement but as long as I would be able to explain how the settlement amount was made and the process of their claim it may them understand the claim process"
good,"A typical day consisted of multitasking through handling multiple accounts and clients.  Making outgoing sales calls every day.  The workplace culture was good, and the management was good but empowered you to take care of things yourself.  The hardest part of the job was making the cold calls and producing business while having to deal with a multitude of issues arising during the day.   It was hard yet achievable to get the work done on a daily basis.  The best part of the job was interacting with the people i work with."
good,"This company knows what kind of people it wants to insure. You have to sell quite a bit before you get any kind of compensation for it, but it is nice to be in an ever-growing and flexible environment."
good,"Good job to have, great atmosphere and great company to grow with. Work/life balance and compensation are a little on the non-competitive side but overall a good place to work."
good,"Production of Life, Health, and Fire Products. Also, offered State Farm Bank products such as Visa card, Home Equity Line of Credit."
good,"You take incoming calls from clients looking to know reasons why they're going into foreclosure, what is they're pay off or how do they make a payment. Easy work."
good,"State Farm was a wonderful place to work.  A typical day at work consisted of gaining new customer and assisting current customers.  I learned to field of insurance and the benefits of it. The management was not very friendly and very unprofessional.  My co-workers were amazing. The hardest part of my job was interacting with management, and the most enjoyable part was actually executing my job and meeting new people."
good,State Farm is a great company but hours are not flexible and does not provide work/life balance. If company offered more flexibility it would be a much better place to work!
good,State Farm has been a good company to work for.  I've been able to obtain my license to sell Property and Casualty Insurance.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers. Helping  them with some of the most important things in life and I  earning their trust.I   loved working with young drivers and helping them understand the privilege of driving  a vehicle,"
good,This establishment has been a great experience. I have learned so much in the short time of being here. I know there is a lot of room for growth within this company. Unfortunately benefits are not included if you are working under an agent.
good,The work load is always changing and no day is the same. Work is always fun and interesting. If you do not work for the corporate office you do not have any group benefits but other than that it is a great place to be.
good,This agency is a great company to work for. Employees were not micro managed. The owner assist when needed and she makes sure you understand what you are doing.
good,"I loved my position it was a team environment and management was there for everything.  I would still be there, but the hours changed and didn't work with my family life."
good,"Answer emails, make outbound calls, quote 4 households a day, Write 3+ households a week. Schedule appointments with clients. Pivot to other products such as life, health, bank, etc."
good,Wasn't too bad. I was there as a staff member. I didnt have the necessary licensing to view too much insurance information but the office I was working at was fairly laid back.
good,this Company has great perks and advancement in the company. The culture isn't stressful. There's advancement within the company if you're willing to advance your education.
good,"Applying discretion and appropriate security measures in handling confidential and sensitive information. Prepare correspondence and materials for Team Management and their associates. "
good,"I loved state farm great people to work with but  I was laid off   just really no one has a home phone any more ."
good,"Small work space, friendly customers, easy going co-workers, easy to learn day-to-day tasks, non stressful work environment"
good,It was good to experience to be in a different enviornment to work away from retail or fast food. Very professional and educational work area. A license is required for position takes about a month or so to get hired and paid well.
good,"State Farm has been a great place to work for almost 20 years.  In the last few years changes to the work staffing model has made things worse for stability.  Good people are leaving, others are worried that they won't have a job next year.  Benefits are fair, pay scale is average."
good,State Farm was a great company to work for.  I appreciated an environment where I learned something new everyday. Moving forward I am searching for a career opportunity that offers work & home balance.
good,"Fun place to work, meeting new people and situations. Finding their risk and help them achieve their dreams by discussion and listing. Put plans into actions."
good,"Great environment to work in. The kids definitely make it well worth it, the hours are flexible but not too many are provided. Hard to climb up the corporate ladder."
good,I enjoyed making telemarketing calls for several State Farm Agents.  This was always a part time evening position.  The agents required phone calls be made to their current clients to see if the client was interested in various additional insurance plans available to them.
good,It was a fun place to work and grow as a person. I also got to meet a number of amazing people in the company.I hope to get into the sales department as it seemed like a place to grow.
good,"I really love this job, however this job is relocating and I am not able to go with the company. Honestly if I could stay with this company for my life career I would."

good,"My agent was amazing but she was new market the stress was way too much, even when i was not at work it was all about work and it effected time with my child and husband it is a very rewarding job if you have the time to put into it"
good,"A typical day at work is not so typical...it varys from day to day with plenty of challenges and camaraderie with clients and co-workers.  I have learned the art of multi-task and true listening to the needs of our policy holders, My co-workers are quick, kind, intelligent, and work independently. The hardest part of the job is turning people away and not being able to write their insurance, The most enjoyable part of my work is conducting all home inspections and writing the policies. I further enjoy the diversity of each person I meet and totally enjoy inspecting their homes for safety."
good,"Great company to work for, learned a lot about insurance and background of what its about.  Management was ok, and showed me the ropes, Co-workers were great but had to watch them. Hardest part was leaving.  Enjoyed the atmosphere. I had the personally for the office."
good,This was a wonderful and exciting place to work I enjoyed every aspect of my position. I left only because I was relocating to South Carolina
good,Very good job to have if you would like to gain experience in sales and insurance. Learned a lot about the insurance profession and what it takes to be successful. Built relationships through colleagues that will last for a long time.
good,"Come in begin, beginning of day, once finished with that we begin following  up on other things that need to be done such as mailing and filing letter. "
good,This was a temp position.  I wish it never ended and hoped that it would have evolved into a permanent position
good,Very fun worked in well known insuranceagency in  falls church we helped walk in customers with there current insurance policies as well as gave insurance quotes.
good,"this is another call center I worked for. The work was easy but the load was extremely busy. For a customer care agent, I had many duties that none of us got recognized for."
good,"It was always quite in its own way, and I was never rushed until I'd gotten too into a task during closing time. Oh, and the paper shredder is the best invention of mankind."
good,"I started work at State Farm after I had retired from SummaCare."
good,A great organization with excellent training and remarkable customer focus.
good,State Farm is a good place to work.  I learned basically everything there is to learn about the auto insurance industry.  The Management team was very approachable and understanding.  My co-workers were wonderful people.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with different shifts and difficult policyholders.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with such great people.
good,its a call center.. it can get boring and so many people working there makes it difficult to be so inconsistent.. you always had to clean up someone else's mess and deal with upset bank customers
good,"My co-workers made me feel at home. Management was understanding of child and health issues, easy and eager to learn and coworkers were more than willing to teach."
good,"Manage inusured claim, ensure the insured is completely happy and taken care of at all times."
good,State Farm was a very nice place to work.
good,I love working with people every day I enjoy learning sonething new never had problems
good,"Job very enjoyable, took it to help State Farm and a disability retired Agent, there were a variety of duties that primarily included maintaining of client accounts, sales and service,"
good,"Working with state farm was a great experience, I learned a lot of things I never thought I would learn, and I would grow to carry with me through life."
good,"If you can afford to open your own State Farm agency ($80k-ish upfront investment), do it. I worked for an existing agency and enjoyed the atmosphere, work load, etc."
good,"You have to be patient on moving up but you will eventually. Very stable company, great benefits. People that work there are great! Facilities are nice and clean."
good,"A typical day at work is signing in and taking phone calls, and taking payments. I've learned a lot of ""real world"" situations, such as what happens in car wrecks, things of this nature."
good,"Insurance producers work for the agent, and not the Insurance company.  Compensation and benefits are determined by the agent and all company regulations and laws must be adhered to.  You will learn something new every day.  I do not believe I ever had a ""slow"" day or was never not challenged by the job.  Each situation is different and requires your full attention.  Customers make it worthwhile and having an agent you believe in, definitely helps make it a worthwhile endeavor."
good,you need benefits it is not. Working for a new agent is very stressful. Working for an establish agent is a lot easier. Hours are great . Your co workers either make you or break you. If you don't have team work in your office then you don't want to be in that office.
good,"Great company as a fortune 40 company, but management tends to play favorites. Great place to advance your career in the insurance industry, job stability is there if you are on managements good side."
good,Working for a small company with great people. Grew great relationships with customers and well as fellow employees. Worked hard to learn and excel at my position.
good,This is a pretty laid back but fast paced environment. Pay is good and the people that work there are great. Only downside is management. All managers are on different accords and it is super frustrating. They do throw mandatory bids so please don’t get comfortable with your good shift. I worked 4 days off 3 with 10 hour shifts.
good,"Also learned sales techniques, miscellaneous office duties, and other things that go with running a small business. A great experience when coming from a call center environment"
good,"A typical day at work consists of answering phones, taking payments, adjusting policies, discussing changes, taking claims, along with a lot of other 'service' tasks. It's a fast paced placed to work. It keeps you on your toes and on the top of your game. Sometimes the hardest part is when an angry customer calls and you are trying to help them. Most times we succeed with that, and sometimes we don't. You can't take it personally, on occasion that's difficult."
good,"If you just concentrate and do what you have to do as an agent. Following up and closing sales with clients you will succeed. The key is absolutely believing you’re doing what best for the customer by displaying the value of insurance to them . I bundled policies into one that was how I cross sold , just put your mind to it"
good,Working there was good for me because it challenged me to work with customers and provide them with excellent customer service at such a fast pace. It also helped me be more flexible and learn how to deal with different personalities.
good,The opportunity for growth is amazing and you are prepared by peers and leaders to take that step if you so choose. You can excell with the provided training and coaching.
good,Job experience lovely great company to be apart of. Somethings with the systems and new changes needed to be ironed out before going full circle with certain things but with time it will be a wonderful company
good,State Farm is a Great company to work for. They care about their customers first. Give great customer service and they care about their employees. The downside would be that there are no benefits
good,Work/ Life balance can be tough sometimes. A lot of cold calling. Prices are high so you really have to sell the value and over come a lot of objections. But overall a good company to work for as long as you work for a good agent. The relationship you have with the agent will make or break your time at State Farm.
good,"Everything about the job was great. I do not have nay complaints. Wonderful people and a wonderful boss, I would not be leaving if I was able to have the flexible work hours I need."
good,"State Farm is a great company to work for. The agent I work for is wonderful.  I work for a small agency, no room for advancement unless you're fully licensed in life and health as well as P&C."
good,A typical day at State Farm would involve completing activities on the computer throughout the day and answering calls to help customers.  A day on the job would also consist of making phone calls to schedule appointments with customer.
good,"state farm is an great place to work overall , i enjoyed my time spent with company, fast paced call center ,alot of resources and help, some manger where there to help"
good,Managers treat you fairly. If you come in and do your job as specified then you will succeed in keeping your job. For job advancement more effort needs to be displayed but it is seen by managers. Overall I enjoyed the culture there.
good,"Overall good experience for my career path. "
good,"Working at a state farm insurance agents office overall was a great experience. Its a close-knit crew. Ours had trouble training new people, but was actively trying to improve every aspect of the business."
good,They were always understanding! Treat you like family! It was a lot of training at first but worth to know what you know! It was easy to catch up and understand what everyday processes were. Not stressful but very competitive.
good,My boss was great and so were my coworkers. I didn't get any befits and the pay was fairly low for what we did. I was salary so even days i was stuck in the office late i wasnt getting paid for it.
good,Wonderful journey assisting customers with their insurance needs.  Allowing customers to realize the need for protecting their most valuable assets.  Making sure customers have knowledge of the insurance process and exactly what is covered and what is not covered.
good,I really enjoyed working there. I liked that State Farm valued education and team collaboration. The managers were always willing to provide us with more knowledge.
good,"Overall State Farm is a good company with benefits that meet or exceed similar organizations.  The company is customer focused and making changes to keep up with current technology.  Often employees have to be willing to start in an entry level capacity, but the opportunities to grow and advance are available to all."
good,"The work was just right, plenty of opportunities within the company, I was laid off when I made to much progress and left too little to be done so choose a larger office"
good,"State Farm Life Division is a great place to work, Management is very family oriented, they work to keep a work/life balance to the best of their ability.  Changes are fast paced which makes the job challenging and what I enjoy the most about my job.  I've learned a lot about various aspects of underwriting life policies, as well as managing the internal pieces to the policies."
good,"Typically Saturday's are the busiest, but the rest of the week is not as busy.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to speak with different people and of course my co-workers."
good,I worked for two different  agents.  They both had different philosophies and approaches but I was able to learn a lot from both of them.  State Farm does a great job on helping you understand how to identify people and how to bundle sells.  The pay though isn't that great even if you are an outstanding salesman.  You would have to open your own agency if you really want to make money.  There's a lot of loops to go through to have a possibility to open your own agency so odds are not in your favor.  I would say this is a great start for a recent graduate to get some experience as they are looking for better opportunities.
good,"Having worked for two State Farm Agents, I appreciate the fact that State Farm is the best insurance company in Texas.  State Farm""keeps the promise"" to insure to value. All claims are handle   in a timely manner.  State Farm  works the best interest of the customer.  By continually taking Continued Education cources, staff members learn to apply  new rules to stay in compliance.    Working in insrance is interering because of the ever changing needs of each customer.  Multi-lining opens the ways for obtaining all of a customer's insurance needs.  As staff I felt it was my duty to keep up with each customer's changing lifes and make suggestive to make their policies fit their current need."
good,It was a fun place to work but that phone is always ringing and everyone buying car insurance only cares about finding the lowest price. It was a tough place.
good,"I made family at State Farm.  I worked with some of the kindest and smartest people you can find.  Also since the company is so large, you can change departments until you find what it is you love to do."
good,"State farm office I worked in was extremely concerned about the balance between fun and productivity. My bosses fully understood the need to get work done and sell more products, on the other-hand they knew happy workers are more productive."
good,"State Farm is Family oriented, understands needs when it comes to family. Opportunity for advancement. Flexible with shifts and time off. Lunch could be longer."
good,I cant say anything bad at all about the company. I love working for a State Farm agent. As a company they give you all the tools  you need to be successful.
good,"Love the work. Some managers can be petty, and micromanage. The wrong manager can make or break your career. Some colleges have left due to the fact, and never looked back."
good,"The culture is good.  Most of the people are helpful to your needs.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that it is interesting work and I enjoy helping people with their claims.  The hardest part of the job is learning tasks that you are not familiar with.  Some of the tasks take time to learn and repetition in learning them.  The training classes upon getting hired mainly provide an overview of the claims process.  The training classes do not help with the on-the-job work, such as working with the different computer systems.  The management personnel are friendly.  They seem to want to see you succeed, and not fail.  However, currently, the company is undergoing major reconstruction and there are not very many opportunities for promotion."
good,"Great  work environment, great staff "
good,"I believe it is a nice place to work with great benefits.  However movement into another department is rather difficult, not sure why though.  I do believe once you move from the entry of State Farm, you could possibly soar, but it just getting there."
good,"Although some of the other employees are rude, the management team is awesome. They will get back to you quickly, and with accuracy. As long as you are on time, attendance is good. and can handle a fast-paced environment it will be great for you."
good,"A typical day at State Farm was extremely stressful, but when your boss is amazing it makes it worth it. I learned so many things about insurance that a common individual wouldn't know. In the long run it was very beneficial knowledge."
good,8 hour non stressful day working BI claims. i enjoyed the work and State Farm culture. I have no problems with management. I enjoyed every minute of working there.
good,"A typical work day is always hectic, full of things to do. If the phones are not ringing there is always paper work to do. You are able to inform customers on why insurance is so important for their future security.  Though working in an agents office you do not receive any benefits and no paid time off. I left for maternity leave unpaid and was not promised a seat since I was unsure on the time I could come back. I was always one of the top sales generators and I enjoyed the competition aspect of the job. I would work for State Farm again as I enjoyed the work I was doing."
good,Great place to work. You meet and work with great people. Possibility of travel and promotions. Great competitive salary.  Family oriented and great leadership.
good,"handling and processing claims daily to ensure our customers are satisified. I was responsible for the payments issued to our customers, no customers, Body shop and ETC.,"
good,"I enjoyed my job very much for many, many years.  I took a break from working outside the home for a few years. When I returned to State Farm on March 1st, 2017, the office ran significantly different than what I loved.  The office concentration was all about sales and much, much less on helping customers. I learned so much over 25 plus and I don't regret for one moment working for such a wonderful company.  Since customer/administrative services are my passion I had to leave the insurance industry.  My passion is helping people.  I also enjoy the administrative end of the job as well."
good,"Stable and secure company.  However, workplace culture has changed a lot since I retired.  Good benefits.  Not easy to get time off even though you earned it."
good,At State Farm you have the opportunity to be self driven. It is an enjoyable work place with ample room for growth. You know what to expect on a daily basis.
good,Love the gratification I receive from helping a customer better provide for their family with protection. Enjoy my current co-workers and environment. Hardest part of my job is taking things personal when something does not go correct for a customer.
good,This company is amazing to work for and was a blessing when I needed it. Too bad the opportunities for advancement  stopped opening up or I would have stayed here forever!
good,"Great place to work, but our office has no health benefits. Do not wish to leave this current employment. Feeling the necessity to upgrade my personal benefits. (health care mostly)"
good,Job culture has changed in recent years. Company is moving operations out of California within next five years. We were given plenty of notice which is greatly appreciated.
good,"Heavy phone activity, prepared auto quotes, policy contracts payment slips, accident/auto loss reports.  Front/back office duties, light soliciting. Formed very close relationships with our customers"
good,"My position was actually with Pilot Catastrophe. We processed State Farm auto claims as contract employees. "
good,"Having fun during the day with clients"
good,I loved being a receptionist for this company. Very laid back environment. I did all the office work and took payments. I was only working part-time so I didn't have any benefits.
good,"The developing of new agencies was corporate's goal. The success of new agencies always depends on the agent in charge,  willingness and ability to develop the agency."
good,"I have so many customers who I enjoy getting to know and assist. They look forward to the touch base from our office, it gives them a sense of connection. I enjoy every min of it. "
good,Was a great job I enjoyed greeting clients the second they walked in the office. Always welcomed with a smile on my face and made sure to answer any questions they had. I was in charge of filling paper work and stating envelopes.
good,"It is great company to work, good hrs., decent pay. If you like a challenge and like to meet goals this is the company for you.  Organization is a must and wanting a challenge. I enjoy the customer service meeting new people. You sort of become their therapist as well they confide in you after you have won their trust,"
good,"State Farm provides you the tools to be a success. As long as your're able to manage everyday activities with accuracy and speed, you'll find yourself surrounded in new opportunities"
good,"Industry is changing constantly, but the company is great and really is there for its employees. The Culture is great and training is always readily available."
good,State Farm is a great company to work for I was just looking for something that is part time so that I can manage career and home stability. I would work for State Farm again
good,"I worked in this role for 4 years and loved every supervisor I worked under. I worked in the CCC or Customer Care Center which is the worst place to work. They upper management cared very little for the people and strictly cared about the numbers. They set goals that were unrealistic. The main Director of our Sales section would meet with representatives once a year for ""town hall meetings"" and would never take into consideration the things that were being told to him unless it was someone who wanted to kiss butt and say how great things were. No matter how much people complained about things they never changed it unless it was to ""improve sales"". Not the best environment.  "
good,"Good brand to represent, must be able to take rejection in sales, and have good communication skills since most of your time is spent communicating the products you will sell."
good,State Farm is a very tight family. I learned how to to work in a large group of people. Scheduled meetings were definitely good practice for public speaking.
good,Use to be very enjoyable place to work but as with many companies more and more hours were required to work while taking away perks .  I was blessed to work there and have a nice retirement but in today's atmosphere I would not recommend it to anyone that isn't willing to work very hard and buy into company culture.
good,I enjoyed working there because it was inbound and I recieved a good bonus for upselling some of the products and also for each credit cards I took.  Every time I upsold a product I made between $5.00 to 8.00 for each product and $1 for each credit card I took and $1 for each calls I took.
good,"Great Place to work, work place was fun and friendly, agent staff was great to work with and always willing to help Anyone that needed it that being staff and clients."
good,"Welcomed customers as they came into office with a professional manner. Assisted them with their needs such as opening accounts for Bank, Life Insurance, Automobile and Fire applications for new or current customers over the phone and in person. Accomplished monthly goals independently and as a team, completed cold calls daily, processed hot leads and confirmed appointments with agent."
good,Everything as far as office relations and job security depend on the Agent you work for. I would suggest interviewing with a few agents before choosing. You never know who you could be working with or under.
good,"Ive been told numerous times your agent that you work for can make or break you. Mine was a train wreck unfortunately. Would rather showboat than call and follow up with potentioal customers. Cared more about a Starbucks Run and his new polos. He lasted for 8 months before he lost the agency, that he also was transferred an entire book of business upon entering this job. He also had 3 of the hardest working reps in his office, that did their job wonderfully, but due to his dealings with customers, they called to transfer elsewhere one by one. So, I am biased with my experience..."
good,"As a Bank Collections Representative, it was challenging, kept daily activitys upbeat, never a boring day. Learned daily, utilized skills, and adapted new ones."
good,"A typical day at work was going in, sitting at my desk. Greeting several customers and getting to know them also allowing them to be comfortable with me knowing their information. There was no hard part of the job. My co-workers were great to work with."
good,I enjoyed this job for six months when the Federal Government called to offer me a bett paying job.  I loved the new learning experience though.
good,Working at State Farm I have learned so much about insurance and the importance of quality customer service. Managers are always ready to support employees and to assist them in growing in the company. I enjoy coming into work because I know what I am doing is making a difference with each customer I speak with.
good,Fast paced environment.  Opportunities are there for continuing education.  Advancement more likely for younger employees.  Have to be in the HUBS for this to occur.
good,"The CIR scores are unrealistic.... People who want to be there are getting let go because of pettiness on scoring, what happen to real customer service. I love the job, but the they dont tell you up front how serious the scores are not that I was relaxed about it.... Im so disappointed in StateFarm... I very hurt..."
good,"State Farm is a great company to work for with good benefits and continuous opportunities for personal and professional growth. Highly professional environment and continuous training offered,"
good,"I loved working here, great environment and always busy. My coworkers were always professional and helpful. The workload was busy so you never sat around waiting."
good,I loved working for this company. The training and development was excellent and I learned so much in such a short time.
good,not enough time to study for the state exam. over all the company is good to work for. all the management who are very professional of work for
good,Clients are usually very happy with the way State Farm handles claims and they do not experience hassles. A lot of desk work at times and you have to be able to multi task or you could fall behind.
good,I oversee 150-200 employees in call center; monitoring phone activity and adjusting staffing needs accordingly.  It has been a rewarding experience to have a direct impact on meeting the needs of our customers. I have enjoyed the rapport that I have established with my co-workers and upper management. I thoroughly enjoy providing excellent customer service. The hardest challenge is when the company's goal does not align with what I think it should be -- to achieve a balance of phones and tasks to meet needs of calling customers as well as those with pending claims. The most enjoyable part of the day is when I achieve a balance of phones and tasks and maintain exceptional service levels for both phones and tasks service level objectives.
good,"The employees at SF are awesome. Great to work with, intelligent and very active. "
good,"Good experience. Great management, learned a lot about the insurance business. Learned a large amount of jargon of the industry as well."
good,"screening calls and emails to determine status of person and assist with free counseling.  "
good,"Working for State Farm Bank was a positive learning experience for me. I learned information about how to fill out car loan applications, what information is needed to get a car loan approved and what will get it denied. The difference between a new car and a used car application, etc. I enjoyed working with SFB, I'm sorry that the position was through a temporary agency and that the assignment ended a lot sooner than expected."
good,My Experience with State Farm was overwhelming positive. My management truly cared about my development and helped me to reach my full potential. My co-workers were awesome. The hardest part of my job was frustration at not being able to help people more. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers and the environment that State Farm created.
good,Productive and fun work place all employees got along and became more like family. The work place was very fun to be in because all of the employees got along so we all made it as fun as possible.
good,"Fast pace environment, advanced in management skills. Co- workers we very friendly . Hardest part of the job was clients not paying attention to their accounts, enjoyable part of my job was my co workers."
good,"A typical day consisted of taking payment by phone or in person and  helping customers in many ways. "
good,"There is room for advancement if you are willing to learn and be persistent. It is one on one and my duties were to Develop leads, schedule appointments, identify customer needs, and market appropriate products and services."
good,"My review of this company is that though I am no longer employed by (them), I would 'revisit' a second chance with them. The issue(s) that I had were never personal; the entire company was awesome, both friendly and professional. I may have left sooner if not. "
good,"I enjoyed my time at State Farm, although it was a slow environment.  I enjoyed being a secretary and performing clerical duties and would seek more duties to do.  The management was absolutely wonderful people and always have a positive attitude!  The hardest part of the job was that I had a lot of ""down time"" and wanted more to do.  The most enjoyable was seeing regular clients and building the relationships with them."
good,"A typical day at State Farm was, for the most part, laid back. It would be quiet in the office except for the sounds of the phones ringing, or the voices of the employees working with customers. I learned a lot about the business, and what all entails in the insurance company. My supervisor was a close fried to my family, and she has been doing our insurance for years. She was very nice, outgoing, and taught me a lot about the business. My co-workers were awesome. Although I was the youngest person in the office, they made me feel like I belonged there. I also worked with a guy named Jake (yes, like ""Jake from State Farm"") and that was pretty neat. The hardest part of the job was staying organized. It can get pretty hectic with a lot of papers and appointments in front of you. The part I enjoyed the most was being able to interact with not only my co-workers, but the customers."
good,"Fast paced call center, investigating, evaluating and negotiating injury claims with claimants and attorneys.  This job required very minimal management supervision.  Had to be a team player willing to help others with their claim inventory.  Most difficult part of this job was lazy and motivated co workers.  The best part was pay and benefits."
good,A typical day is very relaxed but commanding to get your work done. I've leanred to work with all types of customers and to meet all their needs to make each one of them happy. I try to relate to each co-worker as best as I can to make the environment nice to work. The hardest part of the job is knowing soembody needs a certain product the customer is not willing to make that commitment. The most important part of the job is seeing the satisfaction from the customer when the process is complete.
good,"I would call clients and schedule appointments to go over coverages, and direct calls to other employees. I also set up clients folders for the agent for meetings. I learned how to communicate professionally and deal with clients in the same professional manner. My coworkers were great to work with and helped me with any questions I had. The job was challenging in dealing with clients on a professional level. The challenge was welcomed! I enjoyed to challenge which comes in a professional environment. Helping costumers look at the insurance plans and schedule appointments to go over current and future coverages."
good,"Great co-workers, but very low pay for the amount of work. It was a challenging job at first, but once you understand the selling method you can potentially make a good living."
good,Good place to work. Lots of tests to do before been able to start working.
good,"My position at this certain insurance agency was an insurance account manager. My duty was to assist 700-plus clients with their insurance needs. I was also responsible for making sales across various insurance lines. Daily, I provided clients with insurance reviews, recommended better coverage selections, and referred financial products to the upper sales team. I learned more and more about the insurance industry as time went on. Because there is so much to learn, I learned something new everyday. The most difficult part of the job was to be able to convince those clients to improve their coverage because the insurance industry is so discount-driven these days. I enjoy working in the insurance industry because it's an industry that's always going to be needed."
good,"Working in a State Farm agency pgovides the opportunity to develop relationships with policyholders.  Throughout the course of the day, the team interacts with clients regarding several different issues (i.e. claims, billing coverage, etc.)  As a State Farm office manager, I wear several different hats.  Sales is expected as well as the responsbility of running an office to ensure efficiency and proactivity.  Since it is a small office, it is imperative that all employees have positive attitudes as well as great communication skills.  During the day, existing customer demands can be plentiful, which makes it challenging to spend time making outgoing sales calls in order to generate new business.  The most enjoyable aspect of my position with State Farm is being able to manage my workday and prioritze specific daily goals.  Some days we focus onc laim follow-up and others on prospecting and marketing.  Although the work environment is flexible, challenging and fast paced, it does not provide opportunity for more growth and advancement."

good,Needs more management training for staff so that multi-directional communication is effective.
good,"I first started out at State Farm as an assistant in the office and then was licensed to sell life/health and fire/auto.  Worked as a sales representative meeting monthly sales goals and servicing customers then moved up to Office Manager for a local agent.  My agent's office was a great place to work, very much a family atmosphere. I balanced accounts sold policies and worked with clients that came into the office as well as going outside the office and calling on local businesses for commercial policies."
good,Enjoy meeting new people. Everyday is different/  Helping clients determine what coverages they need. Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing the customer is covered for any future problems  that may arise 
good,It is always clear to me what is expected of me and the managers are good at making sure that the employees are glorified for good deeds yet stay on task to be productive at all times.
good,"State Farm was a great place to work and provided many developmental opportunities to assist me in growing both professionally and personally. The fast pace and high demands from both internal and external customers gave me the hands on training to help me elevate my administrative and customer service skills to the highest level. My day consisted of creating and maintaining reports, creating and tracking promotions for agents to increase sales/company revenue, complaint resolution, budget creation and maintenance and many other administrative duties. I enjoyed working with a diverse group of people and held myself to high standards. Flexibility was a must and the ability to adapt was needed on a daily basis. Among the many things I learned was the art of prioritizing and the importance of being very organized to stay on top of deadlines. I enjoyed challenging myself and taking on tasks that weren't always in my current skillset or job description to further my efficiency and value to the team and/or company."
good,Several phone lines ringing as well as constant walk-in business. I handle a fast paced office where I am responsible for sales/service/claims management. I work w/6 individuals in the office I am in and and top in sales. I really enjoy working w/people as well as my co-workers.
good,"I work at an operation center that provides customer service for State Farm Bank. It is a centralized environment were being at work on time and having a good work life balance is very important for your success. I work at a very small operation center so, opportunity for the positions available is limited. However, State Farm offers great opportunity outside everywhere else in the country. Due to the size of the operation management and politics are felt a bit more that larger centers."
good,"Not stressful but very productive. Started early and finished at a good hour. Management was great when I worked for my female supervisor, a wonderful lady. My co-workers were a joy to work with, They came from varied backgrounds and it was a great experience learning about or lifestyles etc. The hardest part of the job was when we went to a team aspect and sometimes workers did not pull their own weight. The most memorable part of my job was when we did an employee - team booster competition. FUN..."

good,"A typical day will consist of me coming into work and doing around 300 to 400 cold calls trying to reach people in our area and see if we can set them up with free auto insurance quotes to help save them money with car insurance. I learned that it requires having great sales technique and interacting with customers through a phone call. The management and co-workers were very friendly it's a very small office so we can all interact at any moment and also have monthly meetings to vocalize any comments or concerns. The hardest part of the job is probably dealing with people hanging up in your face or being rude through the phone but, that is just part of the job and something you must adjust to. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I am working with computers and phone which is something I enjoy having in my job."

good,"Typical day at work would be answering phone calls, taking payments and working on claims.  I learned a lot from that office.  I did not have my license when I started there and they worked with me to help me achieve my goals.  Management was great though there was a little bit of ""the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing"".  I think thats typical in todays office environment.  Hardest part of the job was learning how to make DOS interact with State Farms computer programs.  Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting a bunch of great people from the area and helping them with all of their insurance needs."
good,"It was probably my most educational job. I was new to insurance and this was the foundation of my career. I considered returning, but I learned not all agents are the same nor are the priorities within in the office and staff."
good,Excellent job culture. Everyone is eager to help new employees. Benifits are amazing and the best I have ever seen. The pay is lower than other companies but the benifits make up for it.
good,"The one thing I did not like is that I was constantly sitting down, I like to be up and moving doing things all day. I learned that even when customers are rude to you that you should be very respectful."
good,"The job is what you make it depending on the agent you have and the environment you're in. It can either make or break your experience. Also, having a great agent gives you better leads."
good,"A typical workday starts with follow up from the previous days requests. Then you would incoming calls or emails re: billing issues or errors that would require you to contact the billing department to find out exactly what happened whether it was company mistake or the customer didn't submit needed paperwork or payment. "
good,I learned a lot while at Stare Farm at the first office where I worked. Due to the respect for and reputation of  that office owner I received a job offer at another StateFarm office before a full interview. Second office allowed me to work whenever I was in town after I had relocated

good,"I enjoy working for the company, and though I had NO issues with adherence, I do feel that their system is not built for helping people establish longevity with their company. In addition to that, the mandatory overtime was excessive and brutal to the point where we were forced to spend the night at work some days."
good,"Not enough of a chance for advancement in a branch office.  Regular 9-5 job. Great owner of the branch that I worked at.  Not enough opportunity for advancement,  Although,  this was not the owners fault."

good,"On a typical day I handle between 10-30 calls per day.  I handle total loss claims and each call is different, which I enjoy.  I have learned how to negotiate charges and how to satisfy a customer while meeting the goals and guidelines required by State Farm.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers. The hardest part of the job is task time which isn't hard but not very satisfying.  If not for the fact that I have done insurance work for the same company for almost my whole life and feel as if I have nothing more to offer or to learn, I am ready for a change"
good,I no longer work at State Farm. I loved the office. The agency owner was a delight and very fair. The staff was very helpful and easy to work with. I would recommend this agency.

good,Some of the best people I have ever work with. Learned a lot in my 19 years and still learning. Most enjoyable part was having 5 or more consecutive days off.
good,The typical day at work was making checks out to all participants in the insurance company.  I worked in the Casualty and Homeowners departments.  We took care of all the homeowners.
good,My day would begin early about 15 minutes before the business opened.  First thing I'd check my emails and make priority  calls first.

good,"I loved the work and State Farm. However the Agent was never in the office, never returned customer calls, and was unreliable when it came to time to pay the employees."
good,Great first job.  There is a lack of advancement unless you have the funds to purchase your own angency.  Owning your own agency is where the money is in insurance sales.
good,Steady hours and pay. Not much room for advancement. Workplace is friendly and clean environment. Always room to learn about new products. Would like for the company to be more competitive in insurance products sales.
good,"Overall the account management/sales experience was worth my years employed here.  Each agent builds their team and provides what they feel is adequate for salary and benefits."
good,It is a nationwide company and has several super hub claims centers across the United States. If your looking for a small office this is not the place. It is very monitored and controlled.

good,"The best part of State Farm was working with great people. Each office will have a different staff and agent. I was lucky to work with an exceptional Agent as well as staff.

good,"State Farm is a great place to work, the most enjoyable part of working there was helping customers save money on their home and car insurance, I learned office skills."

good,"While some days could be very busy, a lot of the time I really enjoyed where I was working. Maybe it was the specific office I was in, but I really enjoyed the time I worked for State Farm."

good,excellent company to work for and grow with. A lot of opportunity and great pay when licensed to write insurance policies.
good,"State Farm has an array of financial products to offer to its consumers.  This helps to consistently learn new products and take on new challenges.   Working in a highly populated Hispanic community made my skill of being bilingual a great fit.  The progress of meeting new clients and building strong relationships makes it fun and enjoyable.  The office culture was also very important and well structured.  Although, with a small office the opportunity to grow was short and challenging due to seniority    I continuesly challenged myself every year by meeting all office goals and surpassing them as much as doubling or tripling the quota given.  I made it a goal to be number one on sales team every year I worked at State Farm"
good,"I loved my job at State Farm.  I enjoyed helping my customers and making sure their needs were met.  I was an Office Associate in and I loved my every day tasks.

good,Learned how to sell insurance.  Learned scripts to make calls to potential new insureds. The workplace was a face paced environment.  The management was always will to help you do well.
good,A team member at here makes many sales calls a day to drive business growth & retention. You work with the public daily & ensure customer satisfaction to meet their needs.
good,"Gary is a good boss. Flexibility is one of my favorite parts. He also trusts his staff to handle daily activities, but he is there for us and stands behind our decisions. He also has many years of experience, so is a great resource for questions as well."
good,"I worked for State Farm for 25 years and held many roles, I learned a lot while working there and gained many skills. If not for a restructure in the company I would love to still be working there. Being a team player is important working for this company. Having a can do attitude with initiative.

good,"When I started my job with state farm in abingdon I was hired for 1 week to answer phones and file. The agent liked my work and asked if I would like to stay on as part-time and get my license in property and casualty. Insurance is a challenge, you learn something new everyday and it's always changes. It for sure is a field of work that some are good at it and others it's not for them. "
good,"At State Farm I held many job duties, my last job duty I was an Auto Underwriter that turned into a Call Center type job. As an Auto Underwriter you are responsible for analyzing the data in the insurance application forms and determining the credit worthiness of the application. "

good,State Farm required a lot of multi tasking but very rewarding experience. It offered a great experience when it came to helping out the customers. A friendly smile and a willing heart is required when working in this busy environment. The co-workers and management were the added bonus because we all got along.
good,"A typical day involved a large volume of telephone communications regarding auto physical damage claims."
good,"Duties included calling customers to upgrade their polices, sell additional services,  also called potential customers to gain new business, cold call telemarketing."

good,I learned a great deal about insurance.  My day consisted of answering phones and doing paperwork.  My supervisor was very nice and my co-workers were congenial.  Some days it was hard to keep up with the paperwork.  The best part of the day was everyone working together and helping each other.
good,"Enjoyed working with my coworkers and customers.  There was always something new and interesting to do. I was licensed and sold homeowners, car and life and health insurance.  State Farm sent us to classes to increase our knowledge of the products we were selling and servicing.  There really wasn't any part of the job I considered to be hard."
good,Nothing but positive things to say.  A lot of flexibility and reasonable expectations.  Sometimes clients are just the most difficult portion of the job.
good,"Servicing homeowners insurance and learning about insurance can be a struggle for someone who has no background in the industry.

I have just started learning the NECHO system for auto insurance, and have not had much experience, but with the proper time and training provided I know I will be successful!"

good,It was a busy agents office.  Co-workers were great to work with but Agent was not at times. I learned all about property and casualty insurance. The hardest part of the job was getting all of my tasks done because I kept getting additional duties and had no support. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting clients and my co-workers
good,"Good learning environment, relaxed atmosphere. Answering phones, answering client questions. Learned a lot about insurance in the short time I've been there, I like the people I work with a lot. They are very helpful when I have questions."
good,I worked at a small agents office. No room for growth. The customers can be mean at times (no one likes talking to their insurance agent)

I was able to become licensed for P&C and Life & Health while working there.   Because it is a small office, there is not much room for advancement"
good,"The one thing I like most is the way all of the employees work together to achieve goals set for our company! It also has a relaxed atmosphere yet, at the same time the expectations are very high and achieveable when we all work together. I always learn on a daily bases how rewarding it is to be able to help people overcome lifes challenges. I try very hard to be a motivator as well as a hard worker to my staff. A typical day is always filled with tragedy and new customer relationships at the same time."
good,"You do a little of everything; customer service, sales, etc. Everyone that I have worked with are all so different, but really good people. You have to opportunity to learn as much as you can handle, and it's encouraged. "
good,"State Farm was an awesome company to work for. It hired quality people who took their jobs seriously, but had fun at the same time. I loved the people I worked with in person and online.

good,was just like family...... i have not complaints other than wishing my position was available

We then record the facts of the accident and advise the customer of different steps to take in order to get the problem resolved and the car fixed. We work in a team environment so any customer that provides a claim number can then be helped by any available representative. The hardest part of the job is explaining to people why the process of subrogation exists. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with other team managers and the manager.
good,"Enjoyable office,clients, coworkers and wonderful Employer to work with . Very busy environment, over load of work but it is a pleasure working at this office."

good,"Good people and Very helpful"
good,State Farm has many opportunities to advance! The managers are proactive in making sure everyone on their team can advance and feel apart of the company.
good,A typical day at work is you making anywhere between 80-100 cold calls and once a week you may get a list of hot leads. The hardest part of the job is rejection during cold calls and following up with the same person 5 times. In the end it's rewarding if you have the skills and put in the effort.
good,"The work environment is fun and challenging. There is always something new to learn. Just have a good attitude and the drive to learn, this job can turn into a great career."
good,Great experience. Great sense of purpose. Paid well. There is not much I could think of right now since I don't have time right now. I want to be fair to my team and employers. It was a great environment for those  thriving individuals who has the career aspiration

good,"State Farm is a solid company that I’ve hd the pleasure of working for over 30 years. They’ve had to adapt to the changing customer needs and to stay competitive. It is much less of a family oriented company however, still a very good company with a lot of opportunities."

good,"Good culture"
good,"*Customer service is always number one"
good,Good for a 9-5 job... if you want to move up this is not the job you should look into... this is more like if you need a stable job. There is a lot to lear always and licenses renewal it’s just under $400 every two years.
good,"I enjoyed my department and my entire team! Yes there’s politics to deal with, and yes there was days that were stressful than others. I’ve learned to not play the kissing game, don’t rely on your supervisor, and  allow your work to speak for you. I left because I was expecting my first child, and I was passed up for a raise. Their fault though. It took 3 people to replace me then eventually they closed my department. Do understand that I was at the corporate headquarters and not working for an agent."
good,"although we are all under State Farm, every office is individually owned and considered a small business and as such many offices do not offer benefits. A lot of offices offer commissions for your sales. And the culture in the office really depends on your agent. Some are absolutely wonderful and their employees are quite loyal, others not so much."
good,"It's great working for the largest insurance carrier in the nation because of the big corporate resources, yet close-knit culture of working in an individual office that's responsible solely for their book of business. Most agencies do not have health benefits."

good,Learning to work in a call center customer service representative situation was challenging  but rewarding. Many opportunities for advancement and continuous education.
good,Great place to work and build your professional skills. Be prepared to do customer service as well as sales. It is even okay if you are entry level because most offices are willing to train.
good,"Each agent is different, the one I worked for is an elderly gentleman but was still a go getter. Compensation was fair, but no residual, just  hourly plus commission"
good,i liked it but it was part time only and i didn't like having to bid for hours. that internal process was cumbersome and confusing. i didn't have time to do that in a fast paced call center environment.
good,This job offers many opportunities and the energetic and supportive community. Management gives you constructive feedback to help better you at your job.

good,I feel that State Farm Mutual insurance is a great company to work for. They support a positive work environment to try to make the employees be better everyday in your job. They have very strong coaching methods and positive critiquing skills to help you do better at your job.
good,You'll be calling and talking to people all day. It's nothing hard but it is constant. Most people can't pass the PA license test. That's the hardest part of the job. Office environment is fun and upbeat.
good,"I had an excellent exit interview and was advised the if any openings in claims became available, I would be to return to State Farm and would have a position.  Sadly, State Farm has continued to downsize and most of the claims are being handled out of hubs and I am not mobile."
good,State farm was a good place to work. The company itself is a great company. Overall it was a very relaxed environment. As a service worker your average day was spent making calls to clients that were past due on their premium payments. As well as assisting current clients with their policies. Worked for a great Agent that managed very professionally. The hardest part of the job was trying to get sales when there were 4 other state farms within a half mile radius of the location. the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet a lot of new people and work with a great team.
good,"Can sometimes be stressful but overall it’s good! Working for individual agents can be difficult in some ways each agent is different! No one agent offers too many benefits, no health insurance!"

good,"A typical day at work consisted of cold calling customers to find new clients. Also, servicing current clients books, accounts, and handling the proper coverages that they want. Educating about life, renters, home owners and auto insurance was the key point."
good,A place where you can expand your knowledge with great training. It is a reputable company that has been around for many years. It is number one in life insurance and home insurance.
good,I love the company and unfortunately didn't get along with one of the agents in my dual agency. She was difficult to work with and fired me when I stood up for myself.
good,"I did enjoy my time at State Farm. Both agents I worked for forced me to grow and develop as a person, parent, employee and manager. I do recommend State Farm as a great way to learn the industry."
good,It is slow for change but overall a great company to work with.  The company is very into education and making employees feel valued but also replaceable
good,Dail activities to assist clients with insurance portfolios from basic auto insurance to investments for retirements. State Farm taught me how to manage my time wisely in order to have a productive day and how to communicate effectively with various nationalities
good,It is fast paced wtih incoming calls on after the other.  Good guides and scripts that provide small window for error.  Training was thorough and interactive.
good,Dale Massey Agency has been a great place to work.  It afforded me the opportunity to obtain my Nursing Degree while working  It provides a family type atmosphere that promotes a sense of caring.
good,I enjoyed helping families and being a licensed insurance agent. Its important to offer protection them and help then see the value. Great experiences

good,The agent that I worked under was great. He was encouraging and a good teacher. I enjoyed all of my co-workers and we were able to get along very well and work together on cases for clients.
good,Enjoyed my time here.  Getting married in November 2018 and moving to Simonton Texas.   Relocating to the texas area and will be looking at careers focused on Banking and or insurance sales.
good,"Nationally recognize company.  Many opportunities in many areas including sales, underwriting, claims, administration and much more.  great opportunie"
good,I moved to the adjuster side of insurance because I did not like the sales process. I prefer more person to person interaction not internet and phone conversations
good,"State Farm provided non routine work in that each day presented new challenges and opportunities as an employee and leader. I do not recall a day that I did not get up ready to rock and roll, and face the day."
good,"If you have a hard working manager and good coworkers, this is a great job. Ideal for a salesman. Just make sure to communicate clearly with customers."
good,"Position requires taking loss reports for incoming calls.Almost 100% of the time is on the phone taking customer claims. Your work is subject to metrics based on handle time, time between calls, and adherence to daily schedule which is posted weekly/monthly. Calls are critiqued by management and scored- also posted. Company pays for insurance licensing so that calls can be taken in all 50 states. Basic knowledge of all state insurance laws and procedures need to be applied to each call. Reference to standard claim processing manuals is provided."
good,"The organization's internal system can be very complex and difficult to intemperate at times. Their training process is horrendous. You have to watch well-over fifty training videos and take three to four exams to prove you can work for them. It takes almost a month to complete this depending on how busy your office is, and you can't sell until they are all complete. After that, you are thrown into the fire pit and  have to make monthly sales goals. If you don't, there are consequences. And don't expect your co-workers to take too much time to help you, since they also have to make numbers. Essentially, you are left alone and it is everyone for themselves."
good,"Onboarding their employees and making them feel valued and appreciated from day one was always an essential and successful trademark for the IT department.  This is one of the many reasons they had such long lasting career professionals.  Hardworking, life long learning, and dedicated employees were rewarded well.  Benefits and salary packages were fair."
good,"I have been with State Farm for a year and a half and I love it. The work place is laid back and no one is constantly in for face. I work claims and answer questions as he customer calls in. I learned how to work claim, how to read and distinguish coverages, etc.Normally we rotate managers but I have had the same manager since I got here and she is the best! The hardest part of the job is continuously taking back to back calls. The most enjoyable part is the actual work, I love what I do!"
good,Loved working for State Farm but there was a lack of job growth. Most people who worked in the management position has been at the company for 11 plus years.
good,The workplace depends on the agent. My agent helped train us to be able to carry out policy and procedure while keeping the policyholder happy. I learned how to efficiently deescalate tense situations with policyholders.
good,Working at this State Farm office our boss always treated us like family from day one. It was an enjoyable work experience. The day to day tasks were not difficult once you know what youre doing and how to work the systems.
good,"I am grateful to have worked for such a wonderful and understanding Boss.  I loved how everyday was unpredictable and the foot traffic that stepped in the office was positive and pleasant.  Learning the network was a little difficult for me at first but once I got the hang of it, it was smooth sailing."
good,A lot of learning is required but it is worth it. Customers are nice and always happy with the customers service we are taught to put out. A busy day is usually a good day.
good,"I call insured customers to make payments, make cold calls to get customers. Learned a lot about insurance. Hardest part is their computer system, older.  Also, very minimal training - learn on your own or the hard way.  Most enjoyable is the co-workers, they are awesome."
good,Learned a lot and everyone was always willing to be hands on and assist each other. Loved my agent. Great guy. Always wanted teams input no matter what position
good,"I worked long hours, 10 hour days, 6 days per week, but was paid overtime for said additional hours. I handled Workers Compensation claims as a contracted employee, through a third party. The position allowed me to relocate to a new State while doing the same kind of work. "
good,The Agent makes all the difference. A typical work day is 8 to 9 hours. I have learned how to work as a team. I enjoy my coworkers as well as my clients.
good,"Steady check. Must be willing to not speak up against Corporate management or else you will get booted. Good benefits, lots of training. Would have stayed if my schedule wasn’t changed to threaten my ability to be a mom."
good,I learned a lot over the years about insurances in general. State Farm has internal numbers that interconnect associates and Agents staff across the country to get things resolved and get to the core of any issue. Everybody is so professional and knowledgeable. Very happy experience.
good,"Great boss, great atmosphere. A lot of paperwork but adequate intern experience. Would work there, but career aspirations do not line up. Overall, good experience."
good,"Easy and fun place to work. Had no quarrels with anyone there, just was not the job for me. Management was nice and worked well with everyone. Finding help on calls and everything was easily accessible"
good,This environment is one that is not for the lazy or the faint of hearts. This environment will provided all that one may need to be successful in the insurance world
good,"I was not just a team member, I am a customer work one 40 years experience with State Farm. I highly recommend State Farm to my friends and relatives."
good,"It is a great opportunity, but management and leadership are ignoring the challenges of maintaining a retail space, and the super high cost of doing business"
good,"Managing my inventory of claims is the most important aspect now, I'm currently attempting to settle 3rd party injury claims in a timely and accurate matter. Customer focus is also key during the claim handling experience. Building relationships internally and externally is also important to not only understand the particular claim but also building a foundation of knowledge by using your resources."
good,I was a lifeguard at State Farm Park. In this position I was very well trained and funded. I would recommend this job to everyone who needs a summer job.

good,Management in my department was great - they actually cared about you as a person and put a big emphasis on work/life balance. The only reason I left is because I relocated back to my hometown from their corporate HQ in Bloomington.
good,"I had a great experience.  I worked long hours, but I was paid well as an emergency insurance adjuster for State Farm.  Nice Pay!  I learned a lot of about insurance, management was extremely knowledgeable, culture was also down-to-earth, but professional.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with contractors who thought they understood your business role better than you.  The most enjoyable part was being able to help folks, who had lost a lot  in the hurricanes, get a new start.  At least I could give them a fair shake, when they needed it most."
good,"the traninning was great!! overrall training and products was good."
good,"Oversaw satellite office/financial consultants and maintained a 99% policy holder approval rating/retention."
good,State Farm is a great place to work and has a great team attitude in all the agents offices that I have ever encountered. They really care about their job and assisting clients with their insurance needs. This particular job was for an agency manager and he had 21 agents under his guidance. he was a great guy and wonderful leader of his teams.
good,"Personally, insurance is not something I see myself doing for the rest of my life.  I don't mind the work and my manager is the best I've ever worked for.  The team environment is great and I always have someone that I can go to for help.  It's really a learn as you go kind of job and you really need to learn from your mistakes the first time.  I've really learned a lot of life skills from this job that I otherwise would have had to figure out for myself."
good,"Freedom and respect depend on your department, the people you work with, the management, and how much you contribute. Find out early what customers like then give it to them."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for State Farm who is becoming a very innovative company in seeking new business.  However, the business model metrics are unrealistic and promote employee anxiety.  The training programs lack that human touch when additional questions or answers are needed.  A tenacious employee will have to seek out their information on their own.  otherwise, a great place to work and have a fulfilling career."
good,"State Farm was a great place to work! The benefits and compensation package was on par with the industry and they prided themselves on the diversity of their workforce. Had they not relocated, I would still be employed with them."
good,Working at StateFarm allowed me to heavily work on my interpersonal skills as dealing with different customers on the daily basis was a must. Interacting with them on a business and personal level was a great learning experience.

good,If you want a stressless position..Claims is not it.I've been in department for less than 30 days and I'm already burnt out. They don't pay me enough for this level of stress

good,State Farm is a great place to work especially if you are just beginning your career. It provides professional experience with the ability to advance.
good,Not a bad place to work.  I could easily work from home and accomplish much more. Management is supportive and my supervisor is one of the few who doesn't prescribe to micro-management.
good,Offer benefits for part time receptionist. A bonus structure would be nice. Lunch should be ab hour instead of thirty minutes. There should also be more locations to work
good,"Can be busy at times, friendly environment, flexible shifts, great pay, great benefits. Different starting pay for different departments, not too much of a difference unless you are in Sales!"
good,"My day was filled with phone calls, customer care, customer service and inputting information into the computer.  Cold calls were a part of my daily routine as well.  This office was small: just the agent, myself and a receptionist.  I liked the cozy, friendly environment.  The hardest part of this job, if there was a hard part, would have to be hearing the heartache of the clients.  The most enjoyable part would be working the with agent to take care of our clients."
good,I loved working at statefarm and I wish that I could of gotten more hours but it did not work with going to highschool. I enjoyed knowing that I was helping people everyday.

good,"I start my day my checking my activities for what to do such as Follow ups, appointments, changes made, and other various activities for customer service. I learn how to multi-task very efficiently to keep the pace during the day and a lot about insurance and it's elements. My agent/ Manager is my mentor and guides me through what state farm's expectations are and how to uphold them. As for the Culture it is a small team I'm on so they honestly feel like family. The hardest art of the Job Underwriting, we have support such as phones numbers and sites to look to, but it's best to have a good depth of product knowledge to insure all work and activities are done correctly. I enjoy helping people the most, financially many people struggle so it's nice to people able to give people tools to protects and grow their assets."
good,Selling insurance products is a very intense and quick-paced job market that is suited for only the right employee. You must have a sales mentality or you will not be able to survive in this job field.
good,"Very professional company with average benefits and pay.  Tends to have a conservative culture, but that really depends on the region of the country your are located."
good,"State Farm is a great company.  As an insurance producer you get to help people make sure their insurance needs are adequately met. The benefits aren't as good as they are in a corporate job, and the opportunity for advancement isn't as great either.  Overall it's a good job to have."
good,"I move a lot. I have worked for 4 SF agents in the last 10 years along the west coast. In comparison to other insurance companies I have worked for, I would say SF is the best. The training and workshops that are available are absolutely wonderful. "
good,"I have been employed with SF for over 25 years. Although the company is undergoing lots of change, I still feel it is a great organization with lots of opportunity for growth. My immediate managers have always been great. The most enjoyable part of my job has been the people I have met and the opportunities to work in different departments and on projects."

good,selling insurance at an agency can have its ups and downs. you can be 100% commission and the principal agent has total say over your job. you are typically a 1099 so you must do your own withholding.

My boss is a wonderful person to work for and willing to give me as much work possible but within company guidelines, as must be licensed for insurance to discuss policyholder coverage."
good,You learn a lot about the industry and there are great resources you can use to learn more about how to do your job as well as other job functions.  Management is great and will help you as much as they can. Advancement is hard as they would rather bring in other people for a higher job than promote others from within.

I was also good at quoting rates, collecting premiums, completing applications, filing claims, etc.  However, I did not enjoy selling Life Insurance.

However, if you do not live in an area where they are headquartered and you work in an agency, you have limited room to advance unless you want to open your own agency.  If you are a team member in an office you don't have any benefits.  Ultimately that is why I took a job elsewhere."
good,I worked at 2 different locations. It’s a great job where you can learn and grow very much. However the atmosphere definitely depends on the office staff.
good,They have an excellent training program and benefits. A typical workday is in a call center environment. Everyone is very nice and helps on another. The hardest part of the job is being on the phones and taking back to back calls that involve auto accidents which involve dealing with people during their worst moments.

good,"Always a great environment working here. Wouldn't trade this for anything. 💯💯 anyone who is thinking about working there, don't let anything  stop you."
good,"Overall my experience was a good one.  I had two supervisors that were not professional and, therefore, had to go to Human Resources and turn them in."
good,A typical day for me was lots of clerical work. I mostly worked as a receptionist. I answered phone calls and answered the questions that I could since I wasn't licensed. I did a lot of filing and other random projects around the office.
good,"I worked as an intern, it was tedious at times. I handled more then intern busy work. I was partcialy customer service. the only thing I didnt like was the that noone told me that one of the employees was let go and I was filling in for her.

She was rude and disrespectful."

good,"If you don't work at one of the 3, main hubs, there really isn't any ways to advance a career there, unless you want to relocate. Choose one: Illinois, Georgia, Arizona."
good,"Do not let this review reflect your perception of State Farm corporate. To be clear, I worked at an agent's office on behalf of State Farm. The agent was great. The pay could've been better."
good,"no comment semi-professional layout, friendly customers, limited growth possibilities. not enough vacation or sick days. no medical insurance provided."

good,"It was nice the agent it’s very friendly and an amazing person willing to help, the is nothing wrong with the place, I just feel that sales isn’t my forte."
good,This was a contract position with State Farm through another firm.  Work was clearly defined with a relaxed atmosphere and much team-building.  Our work started in California and then transferred to Colorado and finally to Georgia.  I met many other adjusters and formed life-long friendships.
good,"Company was very family-oriented, but culture has been changing over last 5 years... State Farm is having to engage with a new, young workforce that isn’t nessarily looking for a place to work for 30 years."

good,It was a great time working at state farm. I learned a bunch about the business side of insurance. I loved the new thins I would walk into at work and have to figure out how to do make everything better.
good,"I’ve been with State Farm for almost two years, started as a service team member with one agent, then took a sales role with another agent. I’ve been fortunate to have worked for excellent agents- they truly do make all the difference as far as day to day work goes. I also love the fact that I can truly get behind State Farm as a company- they truly do take care of their policyholders plus one 99.9% of the time. I trust our products, and they give me the ability to sell on value over just price. I will say it isn’t for everyone- you have to be able to be the smiling face of a good neighbor, while simultaneously solving complex problems and connecting dots with corporate departments for seamless customer care."

good,"Good place to work"
good,"I care deeply about State Farm and I believe in the values and services they offer.  In 2016 they lost 7 billion dollars and needed to raise their rates in 2017 resulting in a million policies lost.  The insurance business competition continues to tighten and at State Farm there is a real need for dramatic changes in their IT department.  All Remote workers and 20% of the IT department’s management was cut in this restructure with more to come in the future.  Though it has been hard for me to understand why I was impacted being a high performer and seeing value in my work, I know they have to make changes to remain an industry leader.  As a Remote Worker for 20 years I have been blessed to of had the opportunity to make a difference during my time there.   "

good,"good company. but clear guidelines on what they expect. they operate on a point system so clocking in late, calling out, missing a clock in or clock out gets you points and after certain points you will be terminated"
good,"I worked at state farm for about 6 months. I had never worked in insurance before and the training, though it lacked direction and putting it all together, was decent. I learned what I needed to learn just not how to put it together. I was a Claims Express agent for non-licensed states. Once you go through your 7 weeks of training they put you in a live controlled environment which is where you actually learn it all. The company itself is a great one. They are passionate about their brand and their employees. They do what they can to accommodate you when you need it. The schedules are random when you get hired on. I was fortunate enough to get 4 10's which is 4 days on with 10 hour shifts. Only downside was the absent time. You were allowed to take sick days but you accrued points. Which in my case having a two year old who was in daycare and constantly sick was difficult. Accruing 20 or more points means you get fired. Every day you're gone and its not consecutive you get 4 points. Since 95% of the sick days I took were for my kid, when I was injured I was out of days to take. Other then the sick time there is nothing bad about this company and I would recommend working there."
good,"quote auto, life and commercial insurance, answer phone all day.. received walking actual and new customers, customer service over the phone for payments, information, data entry."
good,"As an account rep your pretty much responsible for sales/service from 9-5 Monday-Sun and even though you're not the agency owner as the sales rep they expect you to grow their numbers. It's high pressure, competitive and aggressive. Most enjoyable part of the job is taking care of the customers."
good,"The environment is friendly and relaxed. There is, of course, a high concentration on sales and contacting new people. Compensations plans I have seen have been pretty great. Opportunity to make more money was based on closing sales and reaching more people. For the most part, you work your hours that you are supposed to be there and leave the office. But you do have to be willing to stay a little later for your customers, at times, to close sales."
good,"Great Place to work "

good,"A typical day consists of many tasks. Answering the phones for inquiries, handling disputes, negotiating settlements, and maintaining a work queue. I have learned that you have to look outside the box when completing an investigation. The management can be helpful but there are often times it does not seem as though they understand what a specialist go through. A lot of the management has never done the work that is being completed under the new structure. It is face paced and constantly making changes to better the company. The hardest part can be the metrics that are provided for such a complex position and the best part can be the security that the job provides."
good,Great Company at head quarters to help you put if you have questions on coverages for insureds or if you can write a particular line of business.   Also claims department over all is great.

I learned that confidentiality today is must. It was a diverse culture. The hardest part of the job was when i had to go meet clients and they never answered the door.

good,This is a great company with many benefits that come with working for them.  Great opportunities exist within the company both agency side and corporate side.
good,I worked for a few State Farm Agents. Since they are franchisees the culture differs slightly with each agent. I had great agents but heard stories of some not so good ones. There is a sense of everyone in the office needing to work together for the good of the agency. I learned a lot about how insurance works in the real world. The hardest part was keeping up enthusiasm on sales after a time with no sales. They often came as  feast or famine.
good,Office environment is a team environment and everyone is encouraged to succeed. The management is driven to see their staff become successful.

I say if you love to sale and you love people than you will love State Farm."
good,"I really do not have much of a review for my employment with Allstate because I was not there very long.  I enjoyed performing my tasks with each agency while working with wonderful people.  My typical day was uploading files, scheduling appointments to review renewal policies, informing people by email, phone call and post card of their late payments and assisting the agents with various duties such as scanning, phone calls, car inspections etc.  Since I was only part-time at Allstate I really don't have that much to say.

good,"I had a good time working at State Farm. However, I was offered the position on a temporary basis. The agent was a friend of a friend, who suggested that I give insurance sales a chance.

I am not looking for just any job, I am looking to start my career."

good,"Get into work, you greet your co-workers good morning and start work. Most of your work is in a queu to process. Your supervisior typically walks through the team to say good morning and hello and let you know about if a co-worker is not coming in for the day.

good,"I service current accounts, and find ways to gain new business from existing customers and non-existing customers. I have learned so much more about insurance in general that I feel like I am a better value to my community with this knowledge. The hardest part of the job would be calling people who have outstanding balances and having to hear about their unfortunate life events (losing job, death of family member, etc.) and that is why the bills are unpaid. I enjoy helping people especially those starting new chapters in their life (new home, first auto purchase, marriage, birth of a child, etc.)"

good,"A typical day at work was quoting insurance rates, typing, filing, helping customers by phone or in person in the office. Filing claims, taking applications, and collecting premiums.

good,"assist customers with catastrophe claims, issue line of authority payments to personal property, reissue checks, contact contractors"
good,Great company to work for! Loved the work/life balance. No nights or weekends! Won't start off making a ton of money but as you progress so will your paycheck! There are advancement opportunities here and if you work really hard you can be your own agent in 3-5 years.
good,If you work in the right Agent's office it can be a great experience. It is sales competitive. The major downfall of this workplace is no benefits available.
good,"It was a great place to work but hard to transition into a new department. During training, you're taught stuff you don't need to know regarding your specific position. We learned about other advanced position that didn't pertain to just Initial Loss Reporting. I took the customer skills I had and self taught myself through their information site."

good,working in my agents office over the last five years has been great. he really makes it a fun experience and doesn't micro manage which i love. we focus on sales points and how to grow as a team not just how to grow for him. i love working here and never thought id be here more than a year when i started.

good,Loved my job. Working for an agent is like working for family. We are all in it together. I was very comfortable at my job but it’s time to move on. I need somewhere with more opportunities for growth. An agent can only do so much for their employees.
good,It was an easy learning process. From answering phones to learning how to give quotes and then actually sealing the deals and having to set them up myself and learning the system.
good,"I stepped into a new role as a Sales Supervisor there, I was given the tools to succeed, and I made full use of them.  As a way to continue my development and challenge me as a leader I was tasked with leading my team and taking the lead in designing a new process for my division.  It was great to feel challenged to step out of my comfort zone and work on things I had no real experience in, but my manager had faith I could do it."
good,There was a lot to learn about insurance. There are a lot modules to complete when you first start out and then there is the state test. License renewal is every 2 years and there are free continuing education credits via major disaster clean up crew. Some days your very busy and other days are slow. Its nice to have slow days to catch up on the busy ones. Sometimes its hard to meet the sales goal when no one is coming in.
good,"My typical day at work is laidback. I would make and receive phone calls, take payments, write out daily messages and send out mail. I was able to expand my knowledge on customer care throughout my time working there.  The coworkers are the best of the best. They're the sweetest people you could find and always make you feel welcomed. The hardest part of the job would have to be calling people to set up appointments. Whether it be rude customers, hang ups, or simply no answer - it gets frustrating when you're unable to do your job.

All the others are directly tied to shareholders, or are a mutual company owned by a larger corporation with shareholders and organized under an insurance holding corporation (i.e. ""Umbrella Corporation"").

good,"- answered calls"
good,"As a large company with many small franchise agencies, the key is to ensure that the Agent for which you work leads well and understands the culture of the larger company.

good,Every day you get to work with team members to sell and create value to clients. The management is great and the workplace culture is competitive but advancing. The hardest part is learning to deal with people but you get to meet all types of people
good,"I used to love working for the company. Even after they announced they were moving I still enjoyed myself. As the move was implemented and we started to feel the effects of new staff things changed. Quality of work changed, expectations changed, attitudes changed."
good,Everyday is something different. We are able to provide customers with the knowledge they need about what works best for their lifestyle. The hardest part of the job is making customers understand the importance of insurance.
good,Every week I learned something new about my job. We had goals to meet every week as a team. The hardest part was trying to meet 100 percent. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with a great manager and being apart of a great team.
good,"Typically I receive an average of 50-80 emails per day, along with roughly 30-50 inbound phone calls from clients.  This does not include the amount of outbound calls I'm required to make for my sales position.  "

good,"Your typical day at State Farm, is fast paced but great. We do have set breaks and schedules, but it keeps everything in order. Management is great and is there to assist you if you have any questions or are experiencing any trouble."
good,"90% or more of all the leadership people I worked with were superior people in all respects. The culture encourages and cultivates competence and professionalism. When I started in 1998, the leadership was strong and demonstrated genuine care for its employees and policyholders. When I left in 2007 for a career change, those leaders had retired and values had shifted toward greed and achieving short term objectives. There were many talented, exceptional people who left around the same time for similar reasons. The company will boast that they don't lay people off, but they will make it so uncomfortable that turnover is inevitable. The unintended consequence is that those with skills, talent, and initiative will leave. So what's left is the high-salaried sand baggers simply collecting a paycheck. Sad. If you're a white male at the executive level, you're good to go. If you're a white male anywhere underneath, good luck. Diversity is practically a religion beneath the executive level. I was actually told by a manager I wasn't going to receive the job I had applied to because I was a white male. At least he was honest. Interesting, because at that time in our region, there were 12 white male VPs, one woman, and one black male.The vast majority of my experience was overwhelmingly positive, so I'm trying to provide balance."
good,This company teaches sales and how to make the most of every interaction with with potential clients. Effective sales is a grind that is defined by following up with potential buyers. This company provides leads and opportunity. What you do with those things shapes your skill at sales.

good,"Very relaxed and welcoming workplace. We all help each other solve problems in order to give the customer the best service that we can. I work for an Agent, so I think it's more relaxed than working for the corporate office"
good,"There are several upsides working for State Farm but due to time and family commitments, I don't have the time to wait out the period until my next review.  I was hoping that they would re-evaluate my potential and move me to a role aligned with my experience and education in a shorter time period but I was recently informed that I would have to wait 3 years.  It's a great company and if the compensation was higher, I wouldn't leave until I was 80!  The people are great, it's an exciting, refreshing, rewarding environment....a company that is focused on doing the right thing for their customers and the community.  I know I will regret leaving but the starting pay is way too low."

I learned time management, working in a team environment as well as independently.  Management varies from department to department, personalities, expectations, as well as priorities.

There is a lot of team work and fun things going on all the time."

good,My job was fun and enjoyable. The agents was old and a good guy to work for but he didn't pay us what he really should have. Loved our policyholders and enjoyed them coming in to visit and take care of business. My Co-work and I got along great and made the day fun. Would have never left if I could have just handled the auto insurance only. The other insurance we offered was to hard to comprehend  and they wanted me to get my licences for them. I couldn't comprehend a sentence due to how the study guide and policy itself was worded. Very confusing and hard to retain what I just read much less pass a test  on what i just read.

good,"State Farm provides an opportunity to learn many different aspects of the insurance industry, to handle a wide variety of claims and to provide excellent customer service to policyholders."
good,State Farm is great to its employees and its clients. The company truly does strive to be the best and genuinely seemed to care when I worked for them. Co-workers were people from all walks of life and it was fun getting to know each of them.
good,I really enjoyed my years at 1800Flowers. I really attained a tremendous amount of phone experience. To lead people through a sale on the phone is an entirely different approach than face to face. I was trained in a lot of things and promoted to a floor supervisor very quick (even before I was a permanent employee.)  As a supervisor I learned very effective conflict resolution and customer relations skills. This was my first job and I was able to move up the ranks quickly and felt like my talent and dedication to learning was truly appreciated something that has been lacking since. I left this job when I was young because I was concerned about gaining too much weight sitting at a desk all day. This was before I figured out how to eat right and move on my spare time.
good,I have been blessed to be part of an organization the deeply cares about their client’s needs.  Through this position I have gained additional skills that are helpful now and will be helpful in the future.  I am truly thankful for the opportunity to work with incredible individuals on a daily basis.
good,"When I began at State Farm, I came on as a customer service representative with focus in growing State Farm Bank's business. I had very little experience with marketing, but with adequate training from my coworkers and agent, I was quickly ready to begin working. I was able to assist clients with their billing, claims, underwriting, and policy questions. Learning the ins and outs of insurance was challenging, albeit very interesting, useful, and enjoyable. I constantly felt challenged, and each day that I came to work was different than the last. "
good,I loved helping clients manage the risks of everyday life while helping them recover from the unexpected and plan for the future.
good,"I really liked working here because i always had something to keep me busy. I learned how to send out mail, use microsoft, had data entry. I learned how to file as well. My mom is a agent at state farm and her boss was a great manager. The hardest day at the job was all the paper work but i still got through with it. The most enjoyable part was the free food."
good,"Nice co-workers"

good,"Working at State Farm was a pleasure.  Although it was a fast paced environment, the co-workers made it a fun place to be.  The management was very professional, knowledgeable and extremely family oriented.  The hardest part of the job was going through the transition with the company and not having enough people to do the job which put extreme pressure on the employees that were left."
good,"Worked with Executive to the Agents. Generated reports, set meetings and travel. Helped with budget for group. Assisted all staff of the Agents in group."
good,"I have enjoyed this job greatly! The only reason I am leaving is because I want to become an ER Nurse and want to start working in the hospital setting. I have learned how to handle different situations with coworkers, customers and within myself. I have grown from this job. I enjoy the flexibility and dependability of this job."
good,I like working at this company. There is a relaxed enviroment sometimes the call flow can be overwhelming but most days its not to bad. I do not like that I am part time and are limited to hours.
good,"I started part time, opening mail, then advanced to other positions and eventually became full time. I learned accounting initially through on the job training, but the tuition reimbursment and encouragement from management allowed me to complete a degree. Unfortunately, the regional office where I worked closed, and I was unable to move with my position. State Farm was a great place to work, and my coworkers were very dedicated."
good,"great benefits"
good,"I have found that, in general, State Farm employees are hard-working, customer-oriented, friendly and compliant. This is the most enjoyable job I have had thus far due to the customers we assist, the management/supervisors we work for, the work load we are dealt and the care that State Farm provides for its employees."
good,"typical day at work called for reviewing claims with employee (s),"
good,State Farm Claims is a great atmosphere where focus on the customer and and improving employee competency are key goals.
good,"we meet first thing in morning to go over the previous days production and issues we may have with changes or processes that may or may not be working and then i go to my desk and process changes on policies, make and take phone calls to and from agents to help process the changes they send in.  The people i work with are mostly ok, there are always some in any job you would prefer to not have but try to stay away from.The hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with the constant changing in how we process our work and the most enjoyable is the satisfaction i get from a job well done"
good,It was the best employer in my working years. It was a company that paid well and showed appreciation for good work. The benefits were very good. It encouraged employees to continue learning new skills. It strived to have workers that understood differences in culture and age. There  was a lot of diversity training. There were social events so employees would know each other in ways besides co-workers.    The building itself was secure and modern.
good,"Some of the daily activities are as follows,"
good,"I really enjoy working here, would love to get into an internal role."
good,"State Farm Insurance is a Culture all its own.  They believe in being there for their policy holders and Training their employees, to give them what they need to be efficient and productive to the highest degree possible.  You are constantly monitored, management is always grading you and finding ways to improve your performance.  The hardest part of the job is telling a client NO! I can not help you or turning them away, especially when Hurricane Sandy hit the east coast and decimated homes and lives, I had one man who just purchased 32 properties before Hurricane Sandy hit and it destroyed all 32 of his properties, that man yelled and screamed at me for 2 hours! I managed to calm him and his business partner down, got all his claims filed in the system and they both apologized and thanked me afterwards for a job well done.  I enjoy helping people, giving them HOPE*"
good,"I have worked at State Farm for the last 7 years, and like any compnay, it's had it's ups and downs, but they always keep us abreast of the situation. Management is also great."
good,I enjoyed working at State Farm. They were very understanding that I had kids and things come up.

good,Gave me my first job experience out of school. Greatly appreciate my experiences there.
good,"I enjoyed assisting the agent with different tasks and assisting customers with their insurance needs. Management was great, they were always professional in the workings of the company. The best part of the job would have to be running the office when the agent was absent and there wasn't any bad to it."
good,It is a bit unorganized. I go to work to actually work- not socialized ALL DAY.
good,Challenging and exciting at the same time great place to get your foot in the door. 
good,Did not have one bad day the whole time I worked there. The managers are promoted based on merit and not seniority. Most workers are top notch and highly competent. It's not a competitive environment—more like a big team. 
good,"A typical day at work  is starting with the B.O.D and around lunch time I check all the folders in Email Outlook, take care of those existing tasks. Sending documents, scheduling appointments, greeting incoming and outgoing clients and making cold calls. I learned not many people are educated about their insurance coverages until its too late. There isnt really a hard part but timing management is something you will have to have. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customer walk away protected and knowing they have COMPLETE understanding of their policies."
good,"My job required working a wide variety of different skill areas such as project work, maintaining business continuity plans for our area, working with both workers compensation and farm/ranch policy system issues within a single day.  This required developing working relationships with a wide variety co-workers on-site and off-site that could assist to identify and develop resolutions to specific submitted system problems and requirements. "
good,"I process checks from other insurance companies, attorney's, and responsible parties in the Subrogation Department. I handle discrepancies every day. Such as not getting the amount owed by the payee, balancing issues with our Finance Department, and problems with our day to day activities. I have learned to be a self starter. I can work with little or no supervision. I have grown in diversity. I get along well with all of my coworkers and other employees on other floors that I need to interact with every day. The hardest part of the job is when the system fails and we can not do our job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer service aspect of making sure our insured's are issued their deductibles in"
good,"Everyday was exciting. The people, the managment and pay were great. It was one of my favorite places to work."

good,"As a Claim Adjuster I dealt with a variety of people involving automobile accidents. Some accidents were minor and some were severe. I learned alot about auto claims and still use the knowledge today for myself and friends. My manager was very hands on and made sure his team was up to par and that we were learning all we could to effectively do the job. My co-workers worked great together as a team. Hardest part of the job was dealing with irate policy holders and claimants, but it was enjoyable when I was able to calm them down and assist them."

good,"A typical day at work, consist of an abundane of phone calls made and recieved in reference to insurane, office organization, positive commuication skills as a team member with a great team leader each day is great. I have learned patience is very important and as long as proper customer service and given, tension can be eliminated. My management is very positive with a strong will of success that she instills within her staff, which makes going to work a plus daily. My coworkes and myself depict our management on a day to day basis, we work hard and make a great team. the hardest part of my job is slow days and when customers are upset and need to be calmed down in order for tasks to be completed to thier likeing and continue rendering successful customer service. I totally enjoy my job, because of the work environment, there is always something to do and I take those tasks seriously as a blessing everyday. I work hard but I also make sure I add a smile to everything because it keeps you young and jovelant."

good,"Every week updated reports from all the agents. I learned a lot about excel, I learned how to transfer calls and how to forward them to a cell. I learned a lot here I can go on and on about it.The hardest part of the job would have to be when there's a lot of customers that call at the same time and trying to answer everyone and give them whatever they ask for. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet new people and just sharing our experience here at State Farm together."
good,"This job had good and bad, could be fun and you could be in tears somedays"
good,I very much enjoyed working here and had wonderful things to say about the people I worked with.
good,"Great place to work, very family friendly. Pay and benefits are competitive but not the highest in the industry."
good,"In a catastrophe claim office, the days are long and very busy, but also very interesting. No two claims are exactly alike and no two policyholders/customers are alike. There were a lot of legalities involved (contracts). Management was always available if needed. Co-workers friendly and helpful; we workred in a team environment. We had a lot of laughs, but we also settled hundreds of claims. You absolutely had to know what you were doing and you had to do it fairly quickly."
good,State Farm is a great place to work. It is an extremely large company that provides several opportunities to introduce you into the work environment. The employees are extremely helpful and understanding. The supervisors are observant and attendant. There are team building activities to guarantee progress.

Everyone always looking out for each other."

good,"""Ever-changing demands in an ever-changing environment still make this a good place to work if you are looking for a good salary with benefits and if you can handle structure. Field associates have less structure than inside associates, not having to clock in and out so far, and don't have worry about taking too many bathroom breaks. Field associates also have more flexibility with their schedule. Before the restructuring, I worked virtually from home to accommodate the staff reductions, handling a two state territory vs. a local territory I was originally assigned."

good,Overall State Farm is a great place to work. They offer awesome benefits and management is great also. My training was about 5 weeks long and it was very helpful. My trainers were great. The reason why I left was because I had to relocate back home for a few months but my supervisor and HR recruiter was very understanding and very helpful. I will be returning soon.
good,This is an amazing job but I'm looking for a career in something that I'm passionate about.  This job has been a great experience but need to find myself and my passion.
good,I just wish the commission was higher and that the offered health benefits or ever offered a discount on the policies they had.  Other than that the best training programs In the market.
good,I worked for them in several different IT jobs over 33 years. Due to downsizing I had to leave my job in IL and look for work elsewhere. I have a lot of OTJ knowledge and I've trained some of the best technical people in the country. it was a great place to work but I had to put family first and that is why im looking now.

The best thing was the swap board where you can swap hours with other employees as much as you want and not be penalized for anytime off from you regular schedule.

They pay is considerably less than other similar roles in the area, but it is completely possible to get promoted to a claim specialist role within 6 months of being on the floor if you show up on time and do the work to the best of your ability. They really push for personal development and if you don't succeed at State Farm you have no one to blame but yourself. i only left because I wanted to move to a place where they didn't have any hubs, and I kind of regret it now. The environment is relaxed but fast-paced. Some of the other departments are rather rude, but if you just let it go and focus on your own job it can be very rewarding."

good,I enjoyed my time with State Farm.  I worked a variety of jobs in several departments.  My managers were always professional and happy to help with any questions. I was always excited to look for other opportunities to grow within State Farm.
good,"it was a good place to make a career, just choose your department wisely , management can be tricky but for the most part is not over supervised. It is important to pay attention  to detail at any job"
good,Typical call center environment. Good people and management. Easy to understand job position and everything involved in your day to day activities. Fast paced
good,I have enjoyed working for State Farm for the last 4 years. Agents I have worked for are great and I value everything I have learned from their agencies.
good,It was a great experiance i learned a lot. It was a wonderful work environment. I worked alongside great people. The companies culture is great and always looked forward to going to work.
good,"This position provided fulfilling work and dedication to client satisfaction and care. I found in a typical day I was quoting, hosting appointments for coverage and general office duties. The most trying portion of this position was the transition from one company to another and coverage changes from State Farm to Desjardins."
good,"loved it, comfortable place, great people, great customers, never had a bad experience while working for the agent i worked for! I think this was a very good job!"
good,"Great place to work, but traffic during rush hour is hellish and undesirable. I worked with a great group and great chemistry. Unlimited opportunity and friendly culture."
good,great company to work for  great products typical day on the job would d be dealing with customers I learned the basics of insurance and they paid for my schooling
good,"It's an  training intern position with advancement. I really like working there and learning. The great thing is that if you want advancement, the opportunity is within your reach every minute of the day."
good,"Great place to work looking for advancement and willing to relocate.  Great training and listening to employees."
good,"Productive and fun environment, competitive pay, opportunities for advancement are out of state. Team building projects and steady work flow makes the work day go by fast. Excellent management and training available for career advancement."
good,It was very Interesting working with a office of family but over all they are very nice except the sister. The Agent is very attentive to detail she is a role model I look up to.
good,"Very relaxed and supportive atmosphere. Balanced work load. The associates and managers all work together to achieve one goal, taking care of the customer."
good,"It depends on agent to agent unless you work at corporate, so you may see different reviews from person to person. In my instance, my boss was great and I really enjoyed work. It was a laid back culture which allowed me to feel comfortable without extra stress."
good,"State Farm is the largest insurance company in the country and, despite the pressure toward commoditizing insurance coverage the company remains focused on listening to policy holders to understand their needs."
good,I really enjoyed working here and I gained some great experiences that I will take with me everywhere I go.  There was a lot work that is phone related so if you are not willing to be on the phone this isn't your job.
good,Great learning experience. Learned about new products introduced to different lines of insurance and new business opportunities and learning experiences.
good,It gets super busy and you work with a team to get things done. It's fantastic. You get to meet a lot of new people and there's always something new to learn about the products.
good,"Our office was small and family-run. We had many loyal customers, but some proved to be difficult or repeat-offenders. If you keep your cool, you can handle everything okay. It really varies greatly by agent."
good,"Calm, for someone who has patience to wait for customers to come into the door."
good,"The hardest part of the job was the inevitablity of physical harm or loss of life to a client. The most enjoyable part was hearing the relief in shaken clients voices when they verify they chose the right company, right policy, and are on the road to indemnity. The best part of this process was handing the client a check that resolves their biggest source of contingency. The team was amazing as well and felt like a second family."
good,The office I worked at was very friendly and helpful. This made it really easy to learn about the job. Everyone was helpful and knew a lot and were more than willing to help each other out if they ever had any problems.
good,"State Farm offices differ from state to state and city to city. The one in Fremont was wonderful to work for, very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately this was a temporary position."
good,"A very good company to work for if you like work & life balance and a slow placed career, good for family people.  I you want challenges, and if you hungry for growth, this is the not place for that. Everything is good except just just one demotivating factor, lack of growth opportunities."
good,"The insurance industry is hard to break into. They are willing to train you from the ground up. The mission statement takes pride in your development. Movement if you want to relocate. If you are the type to be present and do exactly what you get paid to do, you'll be successful here. The metrics are very attainable, management is good"
good,"I was office manager. 2 employees under me.i learned the computer"
good,Providing excellent customer service is our priority. We have both Spanish and English speaking staff for our diverse customer base. We have knowledgeable staff to answer any question that the customer might have.
good,It's a large company with room for growth and promotions. Break rooms have ping pong tables to help relax. Buildings have an amazing view even from your desk. The hours are very flexible. Full benefits even at part time. The worst parts just come from the fact that it is still a customer service position even if the focus is sales. You have to deal with some less than favorable people at times but for the most part it's a position with the ability to help people more than in most other companies so customer are often pleasantly surprised at our capabilities and it makes for more enjoyable calls.
good,Tore my rotator cup during training and had to be on medical leave.  Went to sign up for the next training class and was not picked.  Tried several more times but was denied each time. Ended up finding another job.
good,Productive company with great opportunities for advancement. State Farm has always been a family oriented place.  Personal time was allowed for family situations.  A good work life balance.

good,This is an excellent company to begin working after college and continuing with until retirement.Advancement and additional education options are available.
good,"There were no typical days, that is what made the job fun!  How to constantly adapt to new circumstances and prioritize them quickly.  Management has been great at all my jobs with State Farm.  I'd say advancing, was the hardest part, for me.  New circumstances all the time."
good,Insurance is an industry that will forever have a demand therefore you will find that there is job security and don’t have to worry about it being and industry that could potentially go out of business
good,I give State farm an overall good review.They have great accessibility to overtime hours and the ability to change ur schedule to handle unexpected things
good,"The job in itself is not hard. I myself was promoted 3 months into my time there. The most difficult thing is being there early everyday because if you clock in a minute late, it can get you fired. It isn't something that is documented in a record, but it is still kept track of. Any small inconvenience to your morning could have you on the brink of termination. You are also only given two sick days per 6 months. Even if you have paid time off saved, calling in will mark against you. If you can get past that, you're in for a great job."
good,Great Team to work for. I got my insurance start here. I've done nothing else since. It is a great company. Value based and service is number one. I would never have left except we transferred to Texas.
good,"I love being able to be service to the lookers in the field and helping them with any issues they have in the field. I love being a part of a team that works hard. Also, I like always being busy and having problems to solve"
good,Customer Service and selling insurance. I enjoy helping clients with their insurance concerns. Getting to know your customers. Coworkers are friends for life!
good,"Insurance is no joke. You will learn things daily and that is what I loved the most. It was never boring or dual and I loved the staff I worked with a lot. Obtaining your Property and Casualty License is very difficult, so you have to make time for studying which was difficult for me. But the management was so uplifting and everyone is super supportive."
good,"Some days were slower than others, didn't like the slow days, made for a very long week.  Liked the job I had and the people I worked with.  The only downside of working here was there were no health benefits so had to pay out of my pocket for health insurance.  I feel the pay could have been better since there were no benefits."
good,"A typical day at State Farm can sometimes be busy or calm. On a busy day I’m taking calls, payments, and connecting customers to the resources they need, etc. Management is great and so is the staff. But it’s too far from home and the benefits and pay aren’t all that great for all I do."
good,You meet great people and it makes your work life worthwhile.  Management differs with each department and individuality. You may experience micro or relax this will also play a role in your career stay.
good,"I started with State Farm in 1998, it was a great company to get my insurance career started.  The training was amazing and there were many great management."
good,I loved working with the team at Brooke Cluse State Farm Agency. They were outgoing and very well managed. I enjoyed the diversity within the store. Working at this agency taught me a lot on in-dependency and I am forever grateful.
good,it is a great job.. I love the people that I work with.. I have learned a lot about customer service and the management is great at our office.. the most enjoyable part of the job is the people that I work with..

good,"Great company, corporate ethics and upper management. Is committed to the customer and their needs. Benefits are very competitive and it is one of a very few companies that still offers a defined benefit pension plan."
good,"State Farm is an excellent company to work for. Since starting at State Farm they have worked to development and broaden my knowledge of the insurance industry. They offer competitive wages and benefits including a pension. While there are lots of opportunity for advancement due to the companies large size you will have to work hard, network, and complete continuous education in order to be competitive. If you are promoted their relocation packages are amazing."
good,"Looking forward to helping customers and dealing with one on one relationships with them. Take payments, claims, car inspections, bank deposits etc. Management was very fair and understanding."
good,"I really enjoy working at SF. However pay could be better so I don't have to work so much overtime to get paid. I need sleep.  Very structural, Great Management, although like any place management will determine how you like the company."
good,"One must work hard and be committed to succeed. I spend the majority of each day on the phone. It can be a little overwhelming, but also rewarding. Most enjoyable part is being able to meet many people through cold calls and build relationships. The hardest part is when I have a long list of calls to make and many people aren't able to pick up the phone because they're most likely at work and unable to take calls, so I have to leave a lot of voicemails in a row at times."
good,Encouraging environment with strong emphasis on the customer's experience. Those in higher positions were very readily available to offer assistance and advice
good,"I was able to grow with this company, my bosses were the best. I just need to move higher up on the scale. This job is limited to just one level on the position."
good,"Great company to work for."
good,State Farm is what you would expect from an insurance company. It is better insurance but harder to sell because it can be expensive and they are pickier about who they will insure and for how much. I just really liked my boss. The agent makes all the difference. My agent was supportive and lead by example.
good,Working for an independent agent was great.  Small family feeling in the office.  Very tight knit group.  Each person had their own area of expertise and everyone worked together to make sure goals and numbers were met.
good,I really enjoy working for State Farm. The manager is nice and is a great mentor. My co-workers are all very helpful and everyone is a team player. What I love the most about working there is the work life balance that the manager has provided for the team.
good,I worked in an agency. I loved being in contact with people and building life long relationships. There was a family like environment among the staff. I looked forward to going to work. The pay was on the low side.
good,Management is wonderful and understands work life balance. Great benefits with 401K company match. Annual Christmas gift and bonus. Diverse atmosphere and great people to work with.
good,The most family oriented plae I have ever worked. Never a boring moment. If you to keep busy and help people every day then this is the job for you. The business was always growing and thriving.
good,"Working at State Farm you learn all about property claims especially ones that are involved in catastrophes.  This is a very high intense job that requires a lot of time, patience, customer service, and math.  As you have to calculate the different dimensions of roofs/buildings that were destroyed or damaged.  The management was great to deal with and you learn a lot within their training process in which is done within a classroom and being sent to the headquarters in Illinois."
good,state farm is a great company to work for with great pay and they are very flexible to work with your schedule. they also provide great benefits and incentives.

good,offer great insurance rates to customers.  day to day office duties such as answering the phones or helping customers that come in the office
good,"Flexible work environment, tight knit group of people and family oriented culture. Interacting with customers and third-party vendors to create a satisfactory, quality product."
good,I was hired into State Farm while still in high school. While I am thankful to get a great start at a young age; I did not know exactly what I held in my hand until I left.  I was very lucky to get into State Farm full time and at times I wish I had stayed but I also loved my next job. I believe things happen in life as they are supposed to.
good,"Enjoyed my daily workplace environment.  I was able to advance from an entry level file clerk to an Administrative Assistant in the executive offices.  Management was a pleasure to work with and always thrived to keep a healthy work life and family life balance.  I enjoyed the challenges I faced within the years of my employment there which enabled me to advance to the positions I held in the company.  Often times the most difficult part of my job was leaving at the end of the day, I enjoyed it so much!"
good,This was a great opportunity to work as an individual or in team atmosphere.  I loved working for the supervisor I had at the time.  He made the job.
good,"Working for State Farm was great! The agent I worked for made it feel like a family business. Its not an easy job though, it's a lot of sales and problem solving."
good,An excellent company to work for! Culturally diverse and they really value their employees. The training is ongoing to ensure everyone is abreast of any changes that may have occurred.
good,The hardest part about the job was honestly the agents that would call in to get an update on the policies that recently submitted changes for.
good,"I arrived at 5 am. So it was pretty quiet for awhile. My coworkers kept it pretty cool. The hardest part was being, but it wasn't so bad the day went by pretty fast. The most enjoyable was helping people out and my awesome supervisor."
good,"Typical day at the office could either mean your going to be really busy, phone ringing off the hook. Or really slow, most of my work as a receptionist involved answering the phone for any questions a customer would have or the importance of making a change to a insurance policy. Our customers really depend on us because insurance is very important to have. I had a variety of personalities that I worked well with in the office, I learned so much every day whether it was from doing something on my own, asking a claims associate a question I wasn't familiar with, or even asking a co- worker."
good,I enjoyed working for Kyle Aubry and his State Farm office. He helped me develop as a salesman and gave me many new insights on how to sale a product. He encouraged all his sales representatives as well as being patient and understanding if a mistake was made. Nothing is hard when you have a boss who is more than willing to sit with you and go over anything you feel is difficult to understand.
good,"Great Place Work, Given all the resources to grow and mature as a professional in the industry and in general as a person."
good,"The insurance world is full of information and the job of becoming an expert is taught to employees at all stages. Call handling, continuing education rental agreements. There are so many various tasks to perform that you can never run out of work at a company this large. The perks are numerous being an employee and the environment is great. You do have to prove you can commit to a year before being able to move departments and they have a rigorous rule about adhering to your schedule, but I think it is worth it."
good,"Ethically ran company that valued its employees, as long as you did your job the company made sure your work day had wonderful amenities.Work days were typically only 4.5 days of the week, the company wanted to ensure that its employees still had time to enjoy life outside of work. Lunch breaks were 45 minutes as well. All of the cubicles for ILR staff were by the windows, which was thoughtful"
good,Good place to work.  Outbound acquisition and inbound service was a typical day here.  Good environment to work.  Office was recognized as a top 100 first year agency.
good,"Best place I ever worked, this agent is the best there is.  You can talk with anyone there about anything.  The friendships I made here continue to this day."
good,"I absolutely love my job, just not enough pay. What may not be enough to me can be enough to someone else. I would stay if I had a much higher pay."
good,"The typical work day started with a group team meeting.  In this meeting you would be informed of the number of items that each individual would need to do.  This vary from day to day, it was based on the amount of claims that were submitted and how many were in the queue."
good,"Im glade to work here."
good,Great work environment and fun place to work.  Fellow employees are great to work with and willing to help.  Benefits programs and 401K program are excellent.

good,"Benefits with some of the best I have ever had. 401k was good with company match. Sick time, Vacation time, Personal Time. Management is very effective and friendly, willing to work on a personal level with their associates to identify goals and provide constructive feedback, by focusing on the positives. "
good,"I think State Farm is an amazing company. I have learned so much from how to sell financial services to being licensed for the State of Illinois in Life, Health, Property & Casualty.  "
good,"I learned so much working with the owners. Very good people ! I love them dearly . Best part was making good friends with them , hardest part was in some ways being micro managed.  I see now how beneficial it was."
good,"I enjoy working here quite a bit, but am looking to grow with a company. I engage with project managers and business analysts on a day to day basis and assist them with project tasks. Everyone I work with is friendly, kind, and willing to help me as much as needed. I have learned so much working for State Farm. I have learned various computer programs, how to work well on a project team, and the importance of teamwork to create an amazing end result. I would say the hardest part of the job is dealing with the ebb and  flow of work, it is not always consistent. What I enjoy most about my job is the people I work with, and the flexibility in the schedule."
good,Great organization for customers and employees. Had my position not relocated I would still be there. Good work and life balance
good,"SFMIC is an excellent employer and offers very competitive benefits."
good,Glad to be at work. I have learned a lot from this company.  The management is excellent.  They are always ready to support with any issues.
good,"I have worked as a collision technician, Collision Center Manager and with State Farm. I only wish I had worked longer for State Farm. It was a joy being associated with this company. I recommend them to anyone who is looking for a long standing career with a company that truly cares about their employees."
good,"A typical day is answering phones, assisting customers with questions and connecting to the team and or handler that is handing the customers auto claim. The small group that I am attached to supports the claim adjusters by handling their mail and ordering any police reports and tag checks. My co-workers and management are wonderful and very supportive. They are always there to lend a hand when needed and want to see you succeed in your position. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customer recover from the unexpected. At the same time, you have customers who are unhappy, which is to be expected to a point, as being in an accident is inconvenient for everyone."
good,Small office atmosphere. Everyone works together to reach goals. Great place to work at as long as the agent has a good head on their shoulder.
good,Loved working there.  Just could not work with a co-worker that was already employed there.  She made it very difficult for me and other staff members.  She is no longer there but I left before she was let go.
good,"Making calls and selling insurance to qualified customers "
good,fast paced environment with excellent hours and wonderful coworkers. always have something to do and stay organized.
good,I traveled to State Farm locations to install and setup their new VOIP systems.  Bringing them into the 21st Century.  Doing this gave State Farm Owners more accessbility and easier access to customers and to Corporate Headquarters. This was a great experience for me.
good,"Fun easy going enviroment and great team work. Answering voice mails, providing great customer service and negotiation skills."
good,"It wasn't just your typical 9-5 office job.  Priding themselves on mentoring, diversity and inclusion, several internal committees, and employee incentives - they made a stressful insurance claims department fun to work in."
good,"Start the day checking personal calendar set by Planning , paying attention to the schedule for the day and take incoming calls as needed. Being alert to change is key as during the day schedules and calenders change. Make outbound calls as needed and completing tasks such as issuing payments , customer follow up calls. I learned claims investigations is a way to develop outstanding interviewing techniques and build on the ones you have. Management is professional and there for guidance. Co-workers are there as a good resource if you are new and when all work well together can achieve great results for the company. The hardest part was explaining a liability decision that was not in favor of the customer / claimant . The best part was the smooth operation of the leadership , teamwork and the customer to achieve a positive result , closing the claim and occasional recognition of one's efforts."
good,Most days started with a team huddle in which the previous day’s numbers where reviewed. It is a sale driven work environment and there is pressure to hit matrices to advance. The training is extensive and there is a verity resources to help you succeed.  You will spend the majority of your day on the phone providing customer service. The most enjoyed part of the job were the people that I worked with. My coworkers where friendly and always willing to help.

good,I sold policies everyday and always met my quotas on a monthly basis. I loved my co workers. My manager was not the best she had no idea what she was doing that she lost 4 people at the same time.
good,I assisted customers in reporting any and all car/home accident and ensuring that though they were going through a rough patch they'll be taken care of
good,"A very high paced and energetic place to work; lots of amazing people to work with and learn from.  Many opportunities for growth and challenges within the company.  Great culture in offering many perks for work and life balance."
good,"The new Tacoma, WA office in downtown has such a great vibe and a really nice atmosphere for such a large company.  Many great benefits that most companies don't offer.  I just wish the advancement opportunities were more available to employees without so many hurdles to jump through."
good,"I loved doing telemarketing, because it gave me a huge push towards learning great customer service skills. It helped me learn patience with customers, and helped me focus completely on the customers needs. I developed great communication skills. I did both English and Spanish calls, I am fluent in both. "
good,"Responsible for generating leads and new accounts for a local State Farm Agency. Works closely with"
good,"High call volume and very busy, i've learned things about insurance that I never knew. Hardest part of the job is understanding and having a clear view of what happened in the accident. I love typing."
good,"This company is family friendly, offers sick days as well as vacation days. Great benefits. The work was fun and challenging. Multiple software programs to learn, but very useful. I LOVED my job at State Farm. The only reason I am not there anymore is because my department was relocated to another state and I was unable to relocate."
good,"Helped me out a lot when I needed it. My current agent doesnt pay the best, but other agents tend to pay really well. Highly recomend SF as a carrer job with the right agent."
good,Everyday was a new adventure.  Continued education on systems and programs put in to place.  Learned to think  outside of the box for customers while remain in federal bank regulations.  Assisting co workers with agent and/or customers issues and concerns.  Co workers and management was always willing to help with any issues. The most enjoyable part was being able to help our agents and customers on any given day.
good,"They aren't very big, and finding a full time job here is difficult, but if you're able to obtain one, keep it. They treat their employees well and the benefits are EXCELLENT."
good,Office staff was helpful and helped to develop leadership skills. Taught me the importance of customer service and networking.
good,Sowing roots into local community was a great experience. Upper management offers great support for growth. Endless opportunities for advancement should you desire.
good,Typical day at work was setting appointments with insureds to meet with the main Agent. Selling and talking of other insurance products.
good,"great place to work! love the management, and the team environment! Great stepping stone to obtain a good paying job. Always look forward to work each day, they are good with balance for  family as well and are very employee oriented."
good,SF is one of the best companies that I have ever worked for. The culture is spot on professional and the business is helping people.
good,Employees are extremely friendly.  Great atmosphere.  Management is extremely involved in your growth and advancement.  Awesome gourmet health food café for breakfast and lunch.  Training was very thorough and enjoyable.  Overall wonderful place to build a career.  I unfortunately had to resign- family medical reasons.
good,My typical day at work is logging into the phones and assisting customers with the initial loss reporting of there claims. I have learned a lot working at State Farm they are paying for my education for different designations so I have more opportunity for advancing with the company. As far as management goes they are a joke the only time I see my manager is for a 5 minute huddle with the team every day and a 30 minute 1 on 1 once a week that is only about my stats our team leads are also a joke they know about the same things we know about and there reference to every question is look in your SCPs or get them to a claim handler when your done collecting the loss report. My co-workers are awesome everyone is very friendly and supportive. The hardest part of my job is the repetitive nature doing the same thing over and over daily. Also trying to keep the small talk down to a minimum with the customer so I can keep my average handle time down to a minimum. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you really feel you are able to help by getting them the rental car or shop they need. Also the benefits are some of the best I have seen any company offer. Except the medical that is very expensive.
good,"My typical day at work includes coming into a laid back atmosphere where the dress code is be comfortable but dress for Your day. Meaning your day could be non customer facing casual or meetings in business attire. More often casual.  I answer calls to assist insurance agents outside of their normal business hours. It is an inbound customer service/sales call center environment, however, the call volume very manageable. The management team is encouraging helpful and has been trained to help you meet your goals with great leadership abilities and healthy boundaries. The hardest part of my job was learning the systems, and processes.  Once learned, I really cannot say the job difficult. My peers and co-workers have diverse backgrounds, skills sets and age groups."
good,"The job requires you to have patience especially dealing with customers.  Multi-tasking is a must.  Every day is a learning experience because you deal with different clients with different careers, personality, and cultures."
good,"State farm is a great company."
good,State Farm gives you plenty of information and support to succeed.
good,"This is an amazing company to work for because they pride themselves on giving adequate training to all their employees. They also have management who are pretty good at training new employees or at least setting you up with the right people. I learned customer service, office management, inventory management, working with a budget, and event planning. The co-workers are pretty understanding with helping a new hire out and always answer questions. Most of the people you could / would come across in State Farm want you to succeed in your job. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with grumpy customers who got transferred to our office when they should not have been since I don't have an agents system. The most enjoyable part of the job was being included in the fun activities that usually secretaries are left out of."
good,Loved my employer and my customers.  Loved knowing that I could make a difference in a persons life with their insurance needs being taken care of.
good,I loved being able to help our customers understand their insurance needs and their coverages.  Loved making sure that those needs were looked at closely.
good,"Highly motivated and young professional looking for employment within a company where  I can maximize my management skills, quality assurance, program development, and gain training experience."
good,People are nice and there are lots of opportunities to learn and grow.
good,"I work with a great agent, and that makes all the difference. The agent chooses your compensation, hours and pretty much everything. I'm lucky to have an older agent."
good,"- daily insurance inquiries such as home and auto quotes."
good,"A typical work day for me was first I would check emails to see if I had to update customers information.  Then I would call people to ask if there were able to make their payment for their car insurance or other insurance payments.  I would also answer calls to transfer people to my representatives, and take their payments via over the phone or in person.  I learned how insurance works, and learned to apply people for credit cards.  Management and co-workers were great they helped when dealing with customers and how to take notes when a customer give you car information.  Hardest part of the job was being unable to write insurance policies when people wanted to insure a car.  Most enjoyable part of the job was learning how insurance works and meeting new people."

The company has strong management that cares about its employees and clientele.  My co-workers are nice and fun people who always offer help when needed.

Answer calls as they come in and distribute evenly. Take payments over the phone or in person when clients come in.

The agent and his wife, who was the office manager, were very familial and generous.

Looking back, I wish I had stayed with this company to advance with them through my entire life. I should have given them the chance to give me the opportunities they planned for me."
good,"What I learned at State Farm, organization skills, time management, customer relationships skills.  The more no's you get, the closer you are to a sale."

good,I stepped into State Farm with little to no knowledge of insurance. I am grateful for how on hands our agent is in helping you retain the proper license and certification. The office manager has been nothing but helpful in showing me how to excel within the insurance world. This job is an excellent place to help you fulfill the career advancement to get the security you need financially. Also with the scheduling I am able to spend more time with my family and enjoy the holidays with them. I love my job!
good,Working here was a great experience and opportunity for me to step out of my comfort zone and has helped me become the person I am. If it wasn’t for this opportunity I would be afraid to step into a room with confidence.
good,The interview was interesting and intimidating. You do so much more than just answer phones and take payments all day at this job. Fair warning was given about the work that you put into this job.
good,Temporary assignment in Casualty Department. Staff and management were extremely helpful. Everyone was extremely accommodating with this temporary assignment. They made me feel very welcome.
good,"I have always loved State Farm and actually worked there twice for different agents. As a team member, you are actually employed by the agent, and not State Farm, so depending on who you're working for, my experience may not be relevant. The sales targets can be tough if you don't want to work, but I never found them to be unreasonable with any of the agents that I worked for. It's rare to be offered health insurance since State Farm took away the group plan for team members, though some of the stronger and more established agents will offer a stipend to help pay for that. Salary ranges can be all over the place since each agent runs his or her own business, and that can be a bit frustrating if you're moving from one to another, but if you find a good one, you hold on as long as you can!  Unfortunately, my most recent agent had to lay me off due to personal financial reasons that had nothing to do with me or my production, but keep in mind that you are working for a small business owner, so cutbacks can happen from time to time if the agency isn't growing or the agent is experiencing financial hardship. That being said, I will go work for another agent."
good,"State Farm was a great company to work for, they have an awesome work to life balance, you can pretty much change your schedule at any time to accommodate life's changes as long as someone was willing to change with you, which I never has an issue doing. The starting pay is good but the bonus was unlimited overtime (only sometimes mandatory like they'd ask for 14 extra hours from everyone) so you could basically work more if you needed more money for say a planned vacation or something. Holidays they pay 2.5 times your pay so it made more sense to work then chill at the house. Overall an awesome company, just be willing to work and don't BS around. They treat you well so you should definitely treat them well and work hard."
good,"Work-life balance with interesting daily work: good risk and security culture. For my work of cybersecurity and compliance, it is easy to communicate with stakeholders as people understand the risk culture and are proactive to mitigate the deficiencies."
good,"marketing events were very fun. Your boss is an independent agent so my experience may not be the same as yours. Overall compensation for sales is what you make it. Each agent chooses how much to pay their employees, it is not the same for each agency"
good,"I loved working with my agent at State Farm, he made everything so easy. If y’all get the pleasure to meet him I’m sure you would say the same. He’s very friendly and helpful."
good,"Great company to work for. Everyone is super friendly, work environment it great, not stressful. Work scheduling is also easy and convenient. Managers work with you"
good,"As part of a major digital transformation, a day of work consisted of eliciting and documenting business processes suitable for automation or improvement. The workplace culture is amiable and collegial, although typically confined into Director level organizations. The hardest part of the job from a transformation perspective is aligning and integrating organizations. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with competent, highly skilled people."
good,"Not only do they handle their employees fairly, but they also are fair when compensating losses. The company itself has integrity and you never have to feel as though you need to apologize to anyone for working there."
good,"Great place to work for a starter job, growth potential is high if you are willing to work for it. benefits are fair and so are the hours. The company's corporate structure allows for a fair working environment."
good,"The workload on a daily basis can be daunting but the superior leadership always helps to curve your morale for the company upward. Helping people to understand a bill or explaining why a rate was increased may not always be answered with kind words, it is important to remain calm and breath at those times. If needed supervisors do a fantastic job of giving time off the phone for a breather or a talk."
good,"I had a great experience working for State Farm Corporate Office.  While I know the agents are on their own as far as what benefits they offer, Corporate offers medical and vision and dental insurance, a 401K and so much more!  Paid time off according to how long you work there."
good,"I greatly enjoyed the opportunity to help insureds pay for their medical bills due to car accidents. A typical day consisted of setting up new claims and reviewing the bills for existing claims. Time management could be stressful, but my manager listened to my concerns. The hardest part of the job was that it was being relocated and during the transition process we did not have enough people working in our area to meet the needs of the number of claims we were processing. The most enjoyable part was being able to help people by paying for their bills and giving them peace of mind. The workplace culture was very friendly and always geared towards bettering our lives with frequent seminars about eating well and work life balance and other topics to improve our day-to-day lives as employees."
good,There is a culture at State Farm that promotes collaboration throughout the entire enterprise with the goal of providing the insured with the best possible product and experience. I was often approached by employees of multiple levels of the ladder when they recognized a new face in the building. I felt very welcome and learned a great deal during my time with State Farm

good,Always being assessed by supervisor and monitored. You will always be given grades based on how well you take control of the calls. You have to adhere to the numbers.
good,"schedule was a bit different from regular schedules my position was 4pm to 10pm but if you are a good salesman you'll make up the 40hrs weekely ."
good,"Working for this company was a pleasure. I started at an entry level and quickly worked my way up.  Free educational courses always helped improve yourself. I really enjoyed working with numbers, answering phone calls from Agents and insurers. I travelled areas of Ontario, educating Agents on Company software. My day was always busy. My co workers were supportive and fun. We all had our designated areas that we assisted with,each having over 40,000 accounts. Meeting Insureds in our lobby conference room to discuss their policies, accounts and find ways to resolve their concerns. I"
good,"I really enjoy working here. I have no compaints at all. Advancement is available, yearly bonus (based on performance) Awesome coworkers, safe environment. The pay could be so much better. Benefits are great, I’ve had no issues with management. Training is great."
good,"I worked in an agent office for 2 years, and can honestly say it changed the way I view my career, and the insurance industry as a whole. I got to work with people who were passionate about what they did, and came in every day ready to win."
good,"I enjoyed working at State Farm. To describe the work environment there is like a Government Job. Slow to get any Response and slow to change. Older system technology made it difficult to interact with underwriters. It was a caring culture. Strictly a professional business. Never an issue with unprofessionalism. I have a great respect for this Company, they service their customers with pride."
good,"Busy, friendly and caring environment. Take every day one day at a time. Be courteous, respectful of others , considerate."
good,"Was sad to leave for personal reasons but I left on good terms. Great pay, great company and great people to work with. Typical day, go to work, have meeting with team about goals and how well we are doing or how we can improve.Then to the phone to assist clients, break, work, then break, then work then dinner/lunch, work then home. I loved the desk they have you can stand and the desk will move to your height or sit."
good,"Statefarm is truly a place that cares for its employees. Depending on the position, the training is extended and gives you a full knowledge of how insurance works. In addition, the benefits are high above standard. Sick pay, paid time off, a special interest banking system is all benefits someone can enjoy when joining Statefarm. In addition, the campus is beautiful and contains many additional extras, such as coffee shops, a gym, lunch/breakfast are all a plus. The standard job can be repetitive since it is a call-center environment, but the room for growth is completely open."
good,"laid back and great atmosphere, management is great, Everyone treat each other with dignity and respect. The moral on the floor is very high and we have a strong bond."
good,"A normal day is busy but you can take you time. Your supervisors really have your back and understand that you do your best. The training is long but very informative. I loved my job there and all the new people I got to meet. The attire is pretty laid back and your teammates are DEFINITELY working to help you and make sure that you understand. "
good,"I was required to make a minimum of 100 outbound calls a day, while staying on top of my sales and service work. it was a very fast paced work environment, but it was not stressful."
good,A work a at State Farm the call volume can be very high and customers can be difficult. I was able to balance the call and tasks the was required of me day to day. I had a great attitude and that reflected in my ability to be consistent and my rapport with State Farm customers and Non- State Farm customers and their Attorneys.
good,"I started at State Farm at the age of 18. Through classes and training, I have been able to advance myself and take on new challenges over the years. They made is easy to balance work & life. My office in West Lafayette is closing and I am not mobile outside of Indiana."
good,"My review of statefarm would be its just a great job. The employees are great, facilities are great and the environment is just special. You can truly enjoy your work dat everyday."
good,"State Farm is a fantastic company to work for.  However, each agent is independent, so an employee's experience and benefits will be dependent on the agent employing them. I worked for wonderful agents who cared about their employees as much as they cared about their clients. If sales is not your strong suit, working in an insurance agency can be stressful if sales is required for your position."
good,You enjoy helping people and trying to beat the prices they are currently paying with another car insurance. Its different and everyone's situation is different which makes it challenging.
good,"worked a few months with state farm before relocating to another state. My boss was one of the nicest people I have ever known. we worked as a team to grow the book of business and was open to suggestions. If you put effort into your job then you should have a good experience but then again it comes down to the agency you end up working with, I have heard some bad stories. The only down side would be that you don't get healthcare if you are not the owner of the agency, besides that if you stick with an office you will go far as the book of business grows."
good,State Farm was a really good company to work for in the department in which I was in Underwriting and it was really good. I loved my manager and the team I worked with made you feel comfortable I just was very sick.

good,"I honestly cannot say enough good things about State Farm. The culture there is great, the management team acts with both your best interest in mind as well as the company's, and the training is top notch. There was never any doubt in my mind coming out of training that I wasn't properly set up for success. Benefits are wonderful and so is the State Farm Credit Union. The brand new Tempe campus, which is the largest campus in Arizona, is absolutely stunning and features many awesome accommodations as well as a peaceful view of Tempe Town Lake.  The only real complaint that I have is the compensation compared to what adjusters make at other companies in the area; however, the compensation was still more than fair for an entry level position and more than enough to get by on. "
good,"Great place to work . Good benefits, nice 401k plans.  Daily freedom to perform tasks needed as the job calls for. Flexibilty with management. Great coworkers."
good,"I loved my career with State Farm over the span of 23 years of employment. People were great to work with and State Farm benefits were more than fair.

Each individual from management to employee acts as a support structure to help keep the team moving forward through those difficult times. One of the best companies I have ever had the pleasure of working with!

good,"I was in my Sophmore or Junior year in high school when I worked as a telemarketer. It was a high-paying job, well, at my age, I was being well-paid, and it was an overall fun experience working in an environment I thought I couldn't handle. Yes, there was rude customers but most of my work was done over the phone, getting information over the phone so, the rude customers were only a stone on the road. The daily routine for me was, prepare my station with the right materials, call at least hundred or more customers, report them to my boss, and file papers in their designated areas."

Everyday there is a claim need that requires your attention and I loved that it was a very team oriented environment working on the Richardson, TX campus.

My typical day at work involved taking customer payments, answering the phone, and assisting customers with any questions they would have regarding their insurance policies. The management was excellent-one of the best bosses I have ever had. He took work seriously but also made it fun and enjoyable for his employees. The hardest part of the job was working during Hurricane Matthew since there were so many claims being filed but the best part of my job was interacting with customers and getting to know them."
good,The main center is huge and while they do provide a lot of support for employees it is easy to get lost in the maze of cubicles that they have.

Working for the company was great,  because I had opportunities to learn computer skills such as; Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, along with taking University Courses to assist with work.  The supervisor were great and always open to direct employees to improve themselves.  I learned a lot from the many diversity employee's the company hired, in which they assisted internal and external customers with a positive attitude.  When my job migrated to Texas.  The company offer employee's services to assist with resume, job interviews, job search.  The hardest thing of the job was my job being migrated to the state of Texas.

There is a tool that you use reading word tracks and filling out the question in the tool. its only hard when you get a deceased driver or angry customer. if that happens you can always escalate the call. very redundant work all day but its really easy. I was promoted in 6 months after training and its easy to request time off. Overtime is available but not always.

Advancement is amazing as well, within 6 months you can be promoted as long as you don't have any write ups.

You spend about 20 minutes on average per call and read through a script and gather and enter all of the necessary information. You will set up services for qualified State Farm customers and make sure they are informed on the next steps of the claim process. Most managers are lenient as long as you are a hard worker but some are strict and you can get written up for being 1 minute late."

I learned so many things at State Farm: how to persevere, manage my time, organize myself, stay task-oriented, deal with people of many different personalities, fix mistakes, advise customers on the best things to do, and develop a good work ethic. The management as well as co-workers are friendly; always willing to help and push you to a higher level if you're willing. The hardest part of the job, are dealing with those situations where you really can't help somebody because the circumstances are out of your control. Whether a third party is holding up the process, or we can't move forward without a missing document, sometimes customers want us to do things we cannot do. However, those instances are few and far between. Most times, customers' issues are not exceedingly complicated and it always feels good when I get to help them out."
