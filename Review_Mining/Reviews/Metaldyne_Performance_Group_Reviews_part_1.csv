rating,review
bad,Working there was the best for my career but for advancement opportunities there were none. I knew everything in building but got paid very little until I turned in 2 week notice
bad,"el favoritismo es el pan de cada dia, la linea de mando que esta, no acepta recomendaciones estan encerrados en su concha"
bad,I did inspection on parts before they were shipped out.  Was a temporary job until I found something else.  Did not like the atmosphere there and did not want to stay.
bad,"It was my first job. Learning to work on a assembly line. Driving a forklift. Also learn about quality control, and QS9000. Learning my attendance was a great priority."
bad,"The company was a good company to work for, they moved this company out of state,"
bad,bnot a good place to work would not work there again thats all i want to tell you
bad,Management only cares about numbers of parts shipped out the door. They know some off the jobs aren’t safe and can cause long term affects on your body. If you want to be in pain the rest of your life then this place will do that for you. Do not recommend this because they don’t care about your health.
bad,"management is a joke, one big finger pointing game. The workers back stab each other and the managers play the game with them."
bad,"Horrible place to work!  Supervisors were always looking for the wrong reasons, very unprofessional!  Rude and very monotonous!  Never work at Metaldyne!"
bad,Be open to working lot of over time and to fix all your  Machines when they go down they do not like to pay to fix the problem most the people there are kind  supervisor is nice on 3ed
bad,"If you don't mind working 7 days a week and more than 8 hours a day then this is the place for you. Managements answer to all of the problems they refuse to fix is more overtime, they refuse to work with you or listen to anything you have to say to try and improve something. Just all around not a good place to work if you want to enjoy your job and have a family you would like to spend time with"
bad,"This used to be a good place to work, now there is no leadership and a total disregard for employees. The culture of the plant has gone down hill in the past 6 months and with the lingering merger looming, all morale in the building has disappeared."
bad,Poor management philosophy and education. Management is not good with people skills. Earnings are top priority. EBITA themed employee meetings. Resistive to change or Kaizen. Quality defects always and always fighting fires. Layoffs to boost earnings. Still recovering from bankrupt. Large business swings due to 100% automotive.
bad,"Most of the production went to Mexico, Asia, India, and many other foreign countries, as long as it was outside of the U.S.. Republicans helped them do it with the ""unfair"" trade act and many other legislative acts. Shareholders (again, primarily Republicans) were first and foremost, regardless of the cost to American workers. Find out where the displaced autoworkers are working at now and then ask them if they can afford to buy a new car now!"
bad,Air quality was poor. work conditions were poor. Listening supervisors were poor. They didn't care about their employees. This is not a good employer.
bad,In my opinion Metaldyne never had any intention of trying to make a long lasting place to work. Metaldyne took over a good place to work and then ran into the ground and then sold it to make a quick dollar.
bad,70 plus hour work week.  Salaried no compensation for overtime. Always on call 24/7.  Taking time off is frowned on.  I once was sick and I had a doctors not but i was not permitted to go home.
bad,"Worked on lots of different parts for all the major auto companies, mostly just operated, was hired to be a machinist, ended up just being an operator, once they were bought up by an investment firm and got a union, plant managers changed frequently, union didn't live up to their promises and the plant closed."
bad,"Constantly switching hands so you never really know who owns you. Rules and expectations change with every new owner. no real job security, most employees are unhappy."
bad,They are all about the money and the tax breaks be careful don't buy no houses on new cars they will up and move away in the blink of an eye they destroyed a lot of families and communities
bad,"Do not work here because you will have no life. Mandatory overtime without any notice what's so ever. High turn over rate,and company rarely fills positions, they just require remaining employees to cover vacancies with ot. They can require you to work over 4 hours any day with out any notice required. Do not work at metaldyne... You will regret it!!!"
bad,"During my tenure at Metaldyne it appeared to me that the management direction was misguided, with a focus toward growing the top line at all cost (presumably to grow the company size and increase the enterprise value).  The company direction and culture was mainly driven by corporate and crammed down to the operating entities."
bad,After being told by executive management that our plant was due to be dyvested from the corporation and the division was to be sold. Management and labor came together to try and save the company. The auto industries bankruptsy was cause enough to close the plant for good. It was sad to see.
good,ok place to work and the people on the floor are all good people to work with.
good,"""Ok"" place to work overall."
good,New Castle facility closed after they took all of Chrysler's products. Bought the building and closed within about 5 years. Had no intention of staying in New Castle.
good,"Started at the peak of a company only a few years old, but which had bought several mature quality companies.  CIO was wonderful guy, but he was put out in a cost-cutting push right before the recession.  Infrastructure was then outsourced to Perot Systems, but the helpdesk, engineering systems, and applications support teams were not.  This accentuated political issues which already existed."
good,There is a lot of personal demand with poor compensation.  There is not any opportunity for advancement.  The business does not foster the development of its employees.
good,"Good learning experience but not recommended for younger people. Consider themselves a ""lean"" workforce - this would indicate they are efficient, but they are not."
good,Metaldyne was a good place to work. I had good quality training in CNC machining and fork truck driving. Each employee was rewarded for their hard work. Management was fair to everyone.
good,"High paced automotive manufacturing environment. Due to the lack of resources, tasks are difficult to accomplish in a timely manner (often tasks do not get completed in the time frame originally established)."
good,"Co-workers were very nice. Not much to really learn. Ha. management, you could never find them when you needed to speak with them. A typical day is sitting at a table inspecting and packing parts."
good,7 Faltan varias cosas utilidades cursos de superacion no se prestan mucho atencion los lideres
good,Metaldyne is a fast paced organization with little attention devoted to the cultural environment. Focus is on output of finished goods rather than on quality. Teamwork between departments is virtually non-existent and responsibility and accountabiltiy for errors is directed at others.
good,Worked there and enjoyed the work but it became stressful with the high turnover rate.  Shortage of help when it comes to understanding the environment within the company on an everyday basis.
good,"Lots of overtime, lots of good people. "
good,"+ Un día normal en metaldyne era practicamente estudiar el proceso con tan solo verlo y no ""meter mano"" al proceso."
good,"Not a bad place to work, company filed chapter 11 so I bailed.  Mostly specialized in high volume machine centers making parts for all continental US automotive oems."
good,Great job to have always have work but hr not really there to help u. Most of upper management good people but some look at u as if you weren't human.
good,Good pay good benefits management and supervisors don't care about the employees busy times are long hours and slow times they try to lay off or fire people lack of time training on equipmentt no effort put back into the machine or the company
good,"I supported the Asia Pacific group while I was there and very little work to do, no growth, and no communication.   Although I found things to do but most of the time it was very quiet.  Too quiet."
good,"I started at Metaldyne as a temp working a weekend shift. I was soon hired to full time status. The pay was great, and the UAW contract wouldn't let the company force overtime. It was great that you only had to work overtime when you wanted to, but it became very apparent that paying 150 employees at least $15/hour, while not being able to hold them to any serious work standards was a serious problem. Between management issues, and the poor work ethic displayed by most of the employees, who felt that they only had to work as hard as they wanted to, I don't expect this company to be around for another 5 years."
good,"120 day probation period but worth the time after it is complete"
good,"If you enjoy overtime, this is the place for you to work. A typical day at Metaldyne consists of making car parts, and checking the parts to make sure they are good and reliable parts. The pay is good, as are the benefits."
good,"Trabajo en cadena, estresante y monónotono, ´see realizan mantenimientos, y a veces, se parenden cosas nuevas, lo cual es bueno y satisfactório."
good,I inspected car parts before Metaldyne shipped them out to other companies. A typical day at work was back breaking. I was constantly bent over examining parts and making sure they were effective. My co-workers their were very friendly and helpful. The most enjoyable part was the clean break room! The hardest part of the job was being bent over for 8-12 hours a day.
good,"Metaldyne was formed through a merger of several smaller companies.  Once it started to grow, management only cared about revenue growth, not its people.  Many layers of poor inefficient management were added. Eventually, the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009."
good,"I worked their for 26 years and loved what I did, knew all employees. Learned a lot about machining and assembling parts. Was involved in a lot of teams their including quality and safety teams."
good,"Had to hold tight tolerances which in turn had to keep close eye on tooling and gauging your parts. Climate control factory was cool in summer heat , Was a good work environment."
good,Ok place to work decent wages considering the area..management could be more for the employees and they need better communication.
good,"Aprendí a manejar centros de maquinado, ajustar parámetros, hacer mediciones, trabajar con calidad"
good,"I ran anywhere from 1 to 5 lathes on a daily basis."
good,"Metaldyne is a company that is experiencing high growth. With this comes the (hopefully) temporary problems such as frustration with training groups of new people, quality problems resulting from so many newer people working on one line, and a higher turn over rate until problems are smoothed out."
good,"I didn't feel like part of a team. The hardest part of the job was being around negative people, while the most enjoyable part of the job was when it was almost time to go home."
good,"Metaldyne is a fast paced environment that requires more than a 9-5 work day to succeed. If you want to improve your skills of working in a fast paced environment, this is a good place to do that."
good,La dirección tiene el control de todas las decisiones a todos los niveles.
good,I would come into work and start my day off by getting the furnace hot so I could pour the metal in and melt the metal so that I can make my own parts.
good,"was amazed that there was constantly something breaking down,manangment was not receptive to ideas given by employees to fix chronic problems, also employees are over worked ( ie 56- 64 hour work weeks)"
good,"My position as quality technician at windfall was a productive one.  I worked thrid shift which wasn't a good fit for my personal life.  The employees were great to work with, benefits were good and an overall nice factory to wr=ork for."
good,We was agreat place when we were owned by iit but after being sold 4 times it has some issues
good,"Exigencia de acuerdo al sueldo"
good,pay scale was good friendly place to work supervisors was amazing to work with learned lots of things management was not so good due to changing company names.
good,"This was a challenging place to work - long shifts, cement floors, lack of air conditioning in the summer (well over 100 degrees daily), and back-breaking work."
good,Great employee's who take pride in their workplace.  Few opportunities for advancement and / or annual increases in the salary group.
good,great place to work until it closed inn 2009. Trouble shoot CNC equipment as well as conventional lathes. Learned CNC programming at this facility
good,"Company was a awesome place to work, but as of 2009 the New Castle, Indiana plant closed. I enjoyed this Union Shop of  Local 371. People all got along with one another and enjoyed working for the company. Company treated The employees with respect."
good,MPG fostered a team selling environment. Employees were empowered to voice their opinion to management. Offered great benefits and flexible work hours.
good,"If your willing to learn, they're willing to train. Friendly work atmosphere, great benefits. Safety is a big concern."
good,"I would look for defects, on the parts that came from the line, the  people we nice, not a hard job if you could stand for 2 hours at a time without moving around, I was in the very back where I could move around so it was nice an nice to b in the  a/c"
good,"I learned a lot of different jobs while working at Metaldyne. I was doing quality control when I hired in and I loved it because there was always something new to tackle. The management was okay, however, there were many of them that were carried over from the previous company and held some grudges on the new company and the employees it came with."
good,"Metaldyne Sinter Forged Products company was a fast paced and challenging work environment that required individuals to fully contribute a conscientious performance to meet the absolute high standard quality and customers needs on time."
good,As a welder I was able to learn all the different departments and produce products for nearly all products made by the company.
good,"Se puede trabajar en equipo, se aprende constantemente y lo mas interesante es que tienes contacto con los clientes"
good,"Fun relaxed atmosphere with a quickly growing company in the automotive industry. Everyone employed at the corporate office was extremely friendly and helpful, from start to finish. A wonderful starting point for any corporate career."

good,"Metalydne is overall a nice place to work, I learned a lot and had a great boss, so they hire good manager. They have a good benefits and are flexible"
good,Will get an education in manufacturing and hands on experience. A crew of highly experienced and technically sound employees always get the job done right the first time. Very pleased with my experiences in this company.

good,Its very steady work and great pay and benefits. However one will not have too much of a life. A lot of overtime is required.

good,"arriver au debut de poste verificaciont des document pour connaitre le produit a produire, controle de la machine pour la production"
good,"My job was an enjoyable job working with many friends where most of the employees seemed to work as a team. I learned the responsibility of leadership as a supervisor from 2nd. shift. I got along with management very well since I learned from working in general labor force. I gained respect from fellow employees as supervisor because I would stop, listen and try to take care of their concerns. The hardest part of my job was not being home with my kids as much I would have like when they were young. The hardest part of my job was not being able to sometimes perform as well as I would have liked. The most enjoyable part of my job was when a job was done perfectly and in a timely manner."

good,"A typical day at Metaldyne started by receiving a to do list from the supervisor, if there were any important tasks do those first. Then perform preventive maintenance on all the machines in the facility. Next completing inventory on all Departments. I learned how to drive a various types of forklifts and troubleshoot many different types of machinery. I had excellent co-workers. The hardest part of the job was if more than one machine broke down at a time we would have to shut down production. The most enjoyable part of the job was what I learned."

good,I enjoyed working here and it has been one of my favorite and best places I have worked. Before they closed the doors and I was an employee for 5 years and loved the job. I worked there from the time the doors opened til they closed. The hardest part of my job was the heavy lifting but not even that was all that bad. The best part of my job with Metaldyne was knowing that I had the same job type every day and not being moved around from machine to machine every night.

good,"I scheduled the pick up and deliveries for the afternoon shift.  Dealt with management in order to meet their daily needs.
