I like being in a leadership position amd rise to my expectations and most times surpass them so it didnt surprise me when I admitted to actually loving my demanding job. The best part of my job was when a supervisor from an opposite shift than mine, who I had never met, came up to me and congratulated me for being the first operator on my shift to have ever reached a production number in one night as I had. Going in at night, starting the machine, keeping the line up and running, and managing my team was very hard but all in all just a nights work."

(all at the same time) I learned how being prepared aided my focus and allowed time frames to be followed; thereby being on time was important for the program to run smoothly. Yet understanding that sometimes you may need to address other issues that could became pertinent. Co-workers were helpful in sharing ideas or projects that they found helpful and interesting. The most difficult was to not have your program effectively skillfully thought out to bring out the fun that we all could enjoy.

Had to work too many hours to receive holiday or vacation pay and the pay wasn't so great that I could afford the benefits that would have come out of my pocket. Otherwise, the work assignments were great...even though some of the co-workers they placed me with obviously only took their medication on the day they interviewed!

good,"Processing Insurance Claims, entering data into the system.  I learned a little accounting while doing my job. The management was available if needed. The workplace was relaxed. There was nothing hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was if you had to do mandatory overtime you can do it however you like to do it as long as it was all done in that week."
good,"Very low pay for an experienced teacher with a Masters Degree. However, temporary work allows for a lot of flexibility in work/life balance. Toward the end of my experience working with them, they started placing restrictions on the type of footwear we could wear, which in itself, was not a problem. What was the problem, is they claimed that the teachers and administrators in the school system were spying on us and would ""report"" us for violations which was NOT true. It felt like an immature and petty sort of way to approach a dress code issue. There is no need to send ""threats"" to an employee about violations. Simply state the rule and the consequences and that's it. Then when a violation is reported, respond appropriately. The way they handled it was treating us like children instead of responsible adults."

Claims document preparations, missing payment reporting, missing claims document   reporting, administrative equipment and supply inventory and refill. I had mail sorting machine refresher training. I learned how to prepare incoming mail for redelivery at the AFLAC Headquarters building, how to use the SCLogic program. I learned a lot from BANCTEC. The culture was a family like atmosphere where everyone was willing to help, if they could. The management helped it to feel like family albeit extended, but family just the same. The hardest part of this job was the pay and lack of benefits. The most enjoyable part of this job was the people I got to meet and befriend and working with the sorting machines."
good,"Great Company to receive work from if you're in need of fast work. Sadly not a long term option. They provide great help in getting jobs, sadly the work is usually stressful (on the part of the employer not Kelly). Most of the work provided is Warehouse which is usually not a high paying area. If you wish to work with Kelly make sure you get your clerical certs, they will put you in higher paying assignments."
good,"A typical day at work would for me would be more of scanning pallets now. I use to sort packages according to the destination or put the packages on the line to be strapped. The hardest part would be when there are many errors that have to be fixed, because it causes us to get behind."

good,"They do put you to work, met lots of new people and learned new things working in the warehouse department. good start if you have no experience in this field."
good,"Kelly Services was ok. They seems to change staff a lot and was not always upfront with the positions and they information. If you use them make sure you ask a lot of questions regarding the assignments they send you on. Such as parking, hours, work place culture is very important for those looking to achieve full time status"
good,I enjoyed being a machine operator and line assembly. I learned a lot of work ethics at this job. I was okay with my pay and the overtime I was allowed to get
good,"Great company . It certainly helped to improve and increase my starting knowledge of skills and use many business operating systems. It involves the ability to communicate with members and providers effectively, accurately, and resolving issues within insurance guidelines and protecting information all at the same time."

good,They are very helpful to try and find employment for anyone with their experience and/or if they posed a degree in that field.
good,I have worked for several companies through Kelly's. Some companies were easy to work for and trained employees well. Other companies did not train employees well. The Kelly staff was mostly helpful whenever needed.
good,"I enjoyed learning new things about fire trucks. I learned what goes into them as a whole to just get one put together. I had some issues with the consistent drama between shifts and other co workers but tried to ignore it. I liked knowing I was part of something, Building fire trucks to save lives."

good,Everyone that I have come across at Kelly Services have really been amazing. These people are very helpful and understanding. They really do make things alot easier.
good,"-Some days were unorganized, no lesson plans were left by the absent teachers."
good,I had heard good reputation for sending people to and from jobs long or short jobs and temp to perm. I was never permanent and they felt they had nothing that fit my abilities for a long term permanent.
good,I would go to different places as a temp place. I would go when they called me to come in and go to different work sites.
good,"I enjoyed working for Kelly services, but the worst part was waiting to find out if you would be hired on or kept as a temp."
good,Working here was great. I had a great time meeting different people and working within different companies. My daily routine depended on who I was working with at the time. I would definitely go back to Kelly Services if this was an option for me.

I worked as a receptionist. Took classes as BSI. received a certificate. I loved all these jobs. some harder than others. But worth the experience.
good,"This being a temp agency I worked numerous jobs each requiring a little different skill set from the other. Working as a temp exposes you to a variety of scenarios and needed skills. The Kelly Services management was good, they kept me employed almost full time for almost two years. My co-workers were always nice. That's one plus to working as a temp, there is not as much expected of you in a way because they know you aren't familiar with the company. My co-workers were always very helpful and friendly. At times you are uncertain if you are doing the assigned job properly since it is all new to you. I would often ask another employee if what I was doing was correct. I enjoy facing new challenges and meeting new people which is what temp work is all about."
good,Loved this job. Its truly a joy to work with children playing a part in their education.

good,"very long hours 6am to 6pm, my duties as a lens inspector consisted of me being able to detect defects once the product was completed, it was a temporary position that was only supose to last for 30 days but was extended, at the time of this assignment I was living in a re-entry program housing unit with requirement to attend outpatient group meeting that conflicted with my job at Baucsh&Lomb. I work for them for about 6 months that when my recruiter re-assigned me to recall I just learn that one requirement to be a lens inspector no other assignments were offered"
good,I am busy with UI insurance applicants. I learned new things about old computing systems. The management has been here a long time and they know what they are talking about. My co workers have work ethic. The hardest part of the job is teaching the person who has never used a computer before to use one. The most enjoyable part of the job is the gratitude that the clients give you when they know how to use the equipment by themselves.
good,"Not a bad place, but the one I looked at had very few contracts, so if you couldn't work for one company, you were pretty limited."
good,"A typical day at work is arriving promptly for my shift, clocking in and out using the AVAYA phone system. I learned alot about my customers and developed relationships with coworkers. We worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was leaving because I enjoyed everyone as well as custoomers. The most enjoyable part were the games that the employer used to play. One could win money or gas cards for perfect attendance. There were parties. Everyone got along."

good,work was always fun and intriguing. Often worked for a few months only to be laid off for a few months. This was constant

Placed under s great supervisor at GE Cardservices. The call center atmosphere was well lighted, well ventilated and nice atmosphere.Plenty of parking and felt security did a great job to secure safety of me and my vehicle.

good,Great company for experience and possible advancement opportunities.  Leadership is improving.  Many changes over the last few years impact finishing projects timely.
good,"- No commute to and from work. The pay is okay."
good,Really work to find you good employment. They usually keep you working steady. They have good job leads and a simple interview process.  They will continue to refer you to jobs.
good,Es una empresa comprometida y responsable los pagos son muy puntuales y están al tanto de lo que hace falta para tus labores
good,"I enjoy being a Substitute Teacher because I love kids.  The job doesn't pay well but that's not Kelly's fault the Teachers doesn't get paid well item.  I recently retired making 4 times the amount of a Sub, so I wasn't looking to make a lot.  I'm used to working and sitting around not doing anything is not for me. A typical day is taking care of kids making sure they do what they suppose to. One thing I learn is that teachers are definitely under paid. The hardest part of the job is keeping the kids on track and doing what they need to do. The most enjoyable part of the job is the smiles from the kids when they see I'm at work."
good,I worked at an aerospace company that manufactures galleys.  As a full-time worker I worked on behalf of Kelly Services.  They placed me in the stock-room.  My job was to process the incoming parts: parts we  buy and parts we make. Other duties include keeping the warehouse clean and tidy.
good,"It was a cool place to work. My supervisor was very patient and supportive. My problem was not with Kelly Services more then it was the assignment, you received horrible hours at this company."
good,For the most part Kelly Services was good to me and finding work for me. Anytime I needed employment they we're always there for me and helping me find employment
good,They were all very helpful...my mom had health issues they made a way for me to take care of my mother and still be gainfully employed...i was very impressed with their compassion and professionalism
good,Kelly services wants you to succeed and get hired. They back up their employees. Professional company. Easy call in sick line so you don't have to be drilled about why you are sick or have an appointment.
good,"I personally loved my Kelly contact but while I was employed by Kelly I worked for Dow Chemical. My coworkers were great. My direct boss was great. The person in charge of deciding staffing requirements, nice but somewhat disagreeable when it comes to rewarding an employees contributions. At the end of the day, Kelly is a great company but you're still contingent staff. The 'benefits' weren't really worth the cost so I have to say that working for Kelly was great for the experience but that's about it."
good,The company as a whole i have no complaints but its hard to get a call back from management.. The pay could be better. Management needs to be better..
good,"I enjoy working fior them they was always courtesy the hours was perfect, they gave me a opportunity and I will always respect that .. the job was great wonderful people"
good,"I worked here for a little over a year while I was finishing my teaching license requirements. It's a great job to get teaching experience, especially for classroom management purposes. I honestly wouldn't like it long-term, mostly because it's often hard to get the kids to respect your authority (at least in high schools). It was a good interim job for my purposes."
good,Every time I am placed with a new position I am allowed to meet new friends.  A growing friend base can only bring good things to light. be happy to increase your friend base.
good,Bausch and Lomb has too many supervisors and team leads that favors employees that are the same nationality as them. A lot of the employees came from the same country and knows each others family members and friends.
good,"I worked as a line worker at g3 enterprises. I learned how to use the equipment, package the bottles and bottle the wine. I know how to take down inventory when packaging the wine."
good,This job was perfect for me since I am going into teaching and the hours are flexible. You are able to pick the days you are able to work. Since I was in school I was able to attend my classes and teach during any downtimes.
good,I was sent on different jobs that helped me learn different types of jobs and the hours worked with my time line.  I enjoyed the people I worked with in all the jobs that I was sent to.
good,I love the fact of being able to work remotely. It as allowed me to do so much more with my kids and their school. The job allows you to choose what shift you want to work on and you have the ability to switch with others if you need to have a day off. You can also give days away if needed. I really enjoy having that flexibility especially with my kids in case they have appointments come up or school events. The people I work with are great as well. And all of the training that is given makes the job that much easier.
good,Kelly services was a great way to just get your foot in the door of some of the best industries in Houston Area.I completely enjoyed my assignments with Kelly Services
good,Kelly Services is a great place to work for if you're looking for temp work. Some companies do hire And some don't it just all depends. you do not get benefits unless you been on your assignment for at least a full year which is a con.

good,I got assigned to a productive company. I learned a lot and hope to take to my experience on to the next company. Just wish these assignments were longer term.
good,"Kelly Services is a temp agency and worked with me to find a position with the opportunity for permanent employment. However, my pay did not increase after being offered a permanent position and there was no room for advancement at the company I was placed with. I would recommend Kelly Services to explore options and enter or re-enter the work place."
good,"I do enjoy the flexibility of working as a temp. Some of the assignments are really great environments to work in however, the salary does not necessarily jibe with the duties. The one thing that always struck me as odd is that no one from Kelly would ever visit you onsite after the assignment was taken to make sure that what they were told you would be doing, is what you were actually doing."
good,Everyone that I have come across at Kelly Services have really been amazing. These people are very helpful and understanding. They really do make things alot easier.
good,"I liked working for Kelly Services as an on site representative. My supervisor was really great and very understanding when it came to taking time off, sick time or other scheduling needs. The only thing I have been dissatisfied with is the lack of benefits. I knew about the lack of benefits offered when I recieved the job, but it has always been the biggest con of the job."

good,"Kelly Services has been a good company to work for, I learned so much working with them, I am looking forward to continue with company. The staff at the onsite Kelly Services have been very supportive with any and every concern you might have.

The hardest part of my job was meeting each and every requirement of the call center environment.  I was able to to succeed.  The most enjoyable part was talking with our customers.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Kelly service very supportive manager and understanding, nice culture and environment. we deal with angry clients sometimes that their employees haven't showed up for their shift so we need to prioritise replacing the employees that need instant replacement, could be very stressful at times. our manager is always a great back up if we are unable to finish the task onetime. always there for support. she is an excellent manager."

It was a great opportunity and took i and learned a lot of information to help me and build me up for my next job.."

good,"Working in a cell with 4 other women making internal clutches for golf carts was a good day at work most days. It made me feel like I was a contributor to something many people use, and the detail required was  extreme. I felt I had put in a hard days work after each shift and it gave me hope of full time hire.Unfortuanatly for me during club cars busy season, I was required to work 12 hour shifts Monday through Saturday averaging about 60 plus hours a week. It proved to be too much for me."

good,I had several different positions through Kelly services.  They were always very cooperative in meeting my needs and assisting me in finding positions quickly.  If I did have issues at a location they were quick to address them.  They also described the placements prior to placing me in the positions and made sure I was comfortable with the jobs and the atmosphere.
good,Everyone that I have come across at Kelly Services have really been amazing. These people are very helpful and understanding. They really do make things alot easier.
good,The pay and the job is great. The onsight manager is awful. The job can be stressful during open enrollment. Open enrollment is the only time to you have mandatory overtime.

good,"I would start my day out around 6 or 7 am and start working on the projects I was assigned to do, I would research and correct information if needed and re bill the claims, Did a lot of Data Entry and research through out the day, I worked until 3 or 4 pm Monday thur Friday. I enjoyed everyone I worked with and was sad when I had to leave. The hardest part of the job was sometimes it was slow and I would not have anything to do."
good,"Though Kelly Services is far better than most employment agencies !"
good,"Although Kelly offered work in my field, they inevitably lost their contract with Putnam County which ended my teaching through their company. The staff were friendly and easy to work with."
good,"This job helps me get rid of the ""I think I want another child blues"" but also gives me the opportunity to invest in the lives of other children without the committment and expense of having another. I love children of all ages. It helps that I have a flexible schedule with the ability to choose location and days that I work. There's no direct supervision from the company, per se. They set honest and fair expectations and trust employees to follow through. In a year, I haven't had a single issue. Most interaction with the company is online or over the phone. They keep us informed through email updates and postings on the assignment board."
good,"got hired in January. two weeks later the person training me was fired. manager told me to put on my big boy pants and take on responsibilities of former trainer. when I asked questions, managers response was ask someone else. was not ever really given the chance to succeed."

good,"I have worked with Kelly Services for a number of years, which served an ideal purpose for me when I sought flexibility and income without the full commitment of permanent employment."
good,"Altegra was the best call center I have ever worked for. They encourage free thinking while mantaining a strict rule of satisfaction for the client. I learned that in order to be productive and have growth in a tough market the best practice is not a tough managing style but a caring, but firm one - our group became number one in the company for the type of project we worked on in less than six months, and on our way to reach number one in the entire field. The hardest part of the job was the rejection faced by clients that did not understand the advantages of the program."
good,Trabar bien cer respetuoso y llegar a su hora   gracias
good,Cant complain about what I have to say about the company other than I dislike the commute. They take good care of their employees and offer great opportunities for growth.
good,"Worked with so many different types of people with different backgrounds, ethnicities, nationalities and cultures."
good,Management in that company wasn't very well organized when I worked there. There were three layoffs when I worked for them. Each time a group of employees were laid off I was wondering when was my time. I was there 3 years. Longer than I thought. I worked hard when I was employed by them. Since then the company has reorganized.
good,"I can say that Kelly has been able to find me employment in a rather quick time.  The pay of the last job was not great, but for the job I guess it was probably acceptable.  My first temp job just ended and within the same day i gave Kelly notice of the job ending they already had me lined up for an interview with another job.  Everyone has been very nice and easy to communicate with."
good,"Arrive 1 hour before shift to start production line setup. I learned how to run and do minor fixes to the machines. Plan out everyone's position in the line. Attend once a week meeting, do employee evaluation, inventory count, attendance, and problem solving."
good,Kelly Services was a great place to work. Once the paperwork is complete they have several opportunities for different kind of work. The interviews and paperwork can be completed remotely. I liked that.
good,I enjoyed learning the gowning and learning the different lines and all the SOP's. I loved working on dayshift being at home at nights. Getting paid every week
good,"I loved this assignment but, it did not last long.  Everybody at GE Capital liked me it was unfortunate that i got laid off when things got really slow back in July 2012."
good,A productive work place with repetitive work.Good friendly people but alot of workplace drama. Good work schedule with a constant flow and adequate lunch breaks.
good,"While my contact with them is minimal, they are the access to the project work I am doing and it's pretty seamless. I have been impressed with the level of communication I receive from them."
good,"I work at ADP through Kelly services as a temp and they have been nothing but great to me. I learned to work in a fast paced environment while meeting deadlines,"
good,I was a substitute teacher while employed with Kelly Services.  I received many calls to work until the recession.  The schools I went to were using their own staff to fill in when the regular teacher was absent.
good,"•	Cafeteria/Food Service Administrative Support – Planning and maintaining schedules, menus, and Supply lists. Guided by productions sheets, performed food service standards."

good,"They allowed me to pick and choose the right job for me as well as give me a chance for a different opportunity, instead of a typical employment agency that will just give you what they feel your skills match up with."
good,"Having multiple secretarial skills, payroll, receptionist, data entry, filing, mass mailing, copying of materials and putting them in presentation form. They gave me an advantage to work long term assignments and get a check out other companies. Most management I worked for were great, but a few wanted more than what they had hired me for during that day or few days.  Most my assignments were from 2 weeks to 6 months or even extended."
good,Everyone that I have come across at Kelly Services have really been amazing. These people are very helpful and understanding. They really do make things alot easier.

good,"Go to different job assignments and do a bit of everything in the administrative field. From answering phone, greeting people, letters, filing creating documents to making conference room reservations."
good,"I enjoyed working at a fast pace and pushing each other to reach the goal as a team. The hours were good, plus over time, so the pay compensation was great. You could not make plans for Saturday, though, because we almost always had to work, and you never knew when they were going to switch the work schedule.I didn't see much of an opportunity for advancement with this company."
good,Kelly is a great place to work if you love children and helping them learn. I wish I could work more often. The hours are great and so are the management team.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Health Net, but the distance was just to far. From Torrance to Woodland Hills everyday, no no no. But the pay was great, and I loved that the job duties alone keep me busy."

good,"I worked for two different companies: one was evaluating student's performance skills through their answers to tests. I was in the math section, 4th-10th grades. Everything was computerized, meaning that the children's test were uploaded to a computer. "
good,Fun and laid back environment would of loved to keep the job if it would of been full time staff and  not just a temp job. met many great friends while working here
good,"I have already gave my review about this company. The company is great to work for. Every company has its pros and cons. I have learned how to disassemble diesel parts and I truly like this company, but unfortunately they hired less than 20% of the temporary workers. I enjoyed working with my co workers. I truly enjoyed working for this company."
good,is finding odd jobs to do. But they do find jobs that I can do and it is not a hard job when they do assign me to the certain job.
good,"Good company to work for just, some of the employers don't like to hire on.  No benefits, no raises on a regular.  Once your on an assignment then your pretty much stuck there no with growth."
good,I will arrive atleast 20 min. early to work.I am easy to get along with so I generally will always have a positive attitude.My work days always go pretty quick and good.I did not like my group leader or her trans gender issue being brought into the work place.I did not like being disrespected by my group leader and other employees.Now I have no job.
good,Overall it is a good company to work for and there are some opportunities out there that exist. They just have so many employees it is hard to grab the good ones while they are at bay:)

good,"I substitute part-time at different schools as I am needed usually in the high school.  This has been one of the most rewarding jobs I have ever had.  Interacting with the students, helping them through their day and watch them succeed.  I subbed years ago when I was going to school to become a teacher until life took over and was unable to complete my degree."

good,"Extremely helpful hiring professionals whom are always ready to assist you in meeting  your career objectives, while maintaining a professional relationship with local clients."
good,Sometimes you are overwhelmed with work and other times it is slow.  Management is unpredictable with three owners and one office manager that thinks they are an owner.  No direct procedures established for office conduct and rules - office manager makes them up and changes them frequently.  Environment of office can change quickly and you can be pulled in various directions at one time.  Must be willing to lie to customers on daily basis as well as take on major responsibilities not included in your job description and pay.  No room for advancement from the position you are hired for and do not expect a raise.  Time off is good as 1-5 year employees accrue 10 hours a months and 5-10 year employees accrue 13 hours a month with anything over 15 years accruing 16 hours a month.
good,"Kelly Services Educational Staffing was really nice to work for. As a substitute teacher, booking jobs was very easy although at times getting to a job before someone else could be a little hard. The pay is low, however, as a down side and you do have to travel to different schools."
good,"This temp service was one of the better local temp services.  For the most part, job placement was fairly quick.  Pay wasn't the absolute best, but it did the job at the time.  I loved doing the one and two day assignments once in a while because they always seemed to be with GREAT companies and I got to meet some top dog people.  Loved that!"

I want a job in Northwest Valley, and most of their jobs are in Scottsdale or Phoenix. Since I live in Sun City, I would prefer to work in Surprise, Sun City, Sun City West, Peoria or Glendale.  All my assignments were with Cigna Healthcare. Prior to working with Kelly, my major positions were in the accounting field, and I would like to get a position in that field, or in administrative assistant field."

It was good.. Kelly's People were happy to help and  teach to be succesful employee to represent them."
good,"Based off of my experience the company it's self is a great company to work with. You get a chance to try out amazing positions that you probably would find if you were searching by yourself. But, on the other hand is that your assignment could end at a moments notice leaving you unprepared and it could take a while for you to find another position. But while on assignments you will gain lots of knowledge through on the job training."

good,"Nice and productive staffing agency. Always was available to take my calls and handle my concerns"
good,It was fun to meet new people and to work at different locations but it has it's down side too. You don't get to people because the job might be for a day or two weeks and then cut short. Every day was a challenge since you don't know who you are to report to and the job sometimes was boring. Companies have to be careful on who to allow on their computer systems. And if they have had bad experiences from previous temporary employees all you can do is answer the phone.

Always helpful, talked to you not at you. Co-workers were the best, still keep in touch with them. Hardest part was the 12 hour rotating shift. The most enjoyable was the people I worked with."

good,"very large practice, enjoyed learning new procedures/ offers wide variety of positions"
good,"This company is great for students and people who require extremely flexible hours. They allow you to make your own schedule daily, however, the pay is low and there are no other benefits."
good,A typical workday was normally busy which was good. I'm the type of person that I go to work with the agenda of getting my job done and not getting involved with finding out the latest drama or hanging around people who complain a lot. I helped out where ever managerment needed me.
good,"Workout before shift. Fold and packing clothing by size and colors . Breakfast,work safe,respect each other and be a team worker.When production is not met.Company dinners and cook-out with managers and co-workers."
good,"This was a series of contracts grading standardized tests, it's unknown if this job still exists. Kelly Services is a great company to temp for, great work ethic and good pay. Only drawback is that it isn't permanent."
good,They went the extra mile to find a good paying job that matched my abilities
good,Overall the company works with the employees which is a good thing. If you need time off the company will try to work with you in reason.
good,I did get to learn new things. Medical billing and coding. I just wish it could've turned into a full-time position. This is why I decided to go back to school and get the education to back me up. I really liked it.
good,Dedicated worker and hard worker. I give my all and earn my pay. I will make sure all that is required of me is done.

good,"Excellent client, excellent products. I have had excellent opportunities for growth, learning and advancement with this organization."
good,Kelly Services is a fair and trustworthy employer that is supportive of their employees. There is much support staff to help an employee succeed at their job.
good,"Teaching the students the fundamentals of life keeps me going. The school I work at is full of excitement and learning experiences. The hardest part of my job is dealing with students with very bad attitudes at the young ages they are. The staff is very helpful and is willing to give any advice needed. Overall, I enjoy every aspect of working with people of all kinds."
good,"I like Kelly Educational Services. Training and automation is premium. "
good,This job gave flexible working hours for a working student. You are in charge of wages based on your openness to work. Plenty of work opportunities from each school system.
good,Very good chances of getting hired on at company you are working with. Pay is better than most places and being able to submit time online is very convenient.
good,"Easy to learn. Fast paced. Great environment. (Seasonal). Professional, and challenging at times. Fun environment. Handled customer calls, personal information, etc."
good,"Very rewarding job to be in the school system, however pay could be more. "
good,The pay needs to increase and we should get raises because we work as hard as the regular employee every place I work I'm always ask to become full time I'm also the first sub to ever make employee of the week on a job. I'm Good.
good,Kelly Services is always looking to better my future as well as checking in with me for my happiness and determination to get hired at an assignment that they place me at!

good,"With the help of the Kelly staff in Pensacola, I was able to return to the workforce quickly which gave me peace of mind while I actively search for a position in my career field. Am able to keep up with changes in the work force and learn new and perfect acquired skills. "
good,Kelly Services provided me with an excellent placement when I was down on my luck.  That temporary placement lasted four years and turned into the career that I have dreamed of.  The company where I was placed hired me as a permanent employee and I owe that to Kelly Services.  The management is easy to work with and helpful.
good,Everyone that I have come across at Kelly Services have really been amazing. These people are very helpful and understanding. They really do make things alot easier.
good,"I must say I have been employed by Kelly Services many times and have been very pleased with the positions I was assigned with various companies which started as a temp to hire position. When working temp to hire positions there is not a typical day unless of course assignment is long term. Every day the assignment could be with a different company. Kelly Services keep a temp on assignment,you learn a great deal due to position,companies,management,workplace culture and the hardest part of temp jobs is lack of security until hired by a company. The most enjoyable part of temp to hire is meeting new people,training and learn new responsibilities."
good,"Excellent and feel proud to have been associated with such a organization. Trust on and recognition of your employees were the best thing that happened to me. "
good,It was good opportunity to work on a long term basis.  I just wish there more full time opportunities to be employed at a client company. I recommend Kelly Services to anyone that needs an opportunity to broaden their skills while working on a temporary basis.
good,They are good with their employees and with that they take time to find out what's going on if you are having problems at work. They really look into the point of if you're being trained properly.
good,"It's nice that you can decide when you want to work and if you don't like a specific school, classroom, or subject you don't have to go back. The problem is that it's hard to get work whether you're picky or not. It's very competitive."
good,A job where you travel to the schools you want and chose what grades you like to teach and you make your own schedule because you choose the days you want to work.
good,"I very much enjoyed the fast pace at the factory; other jobs were slower paced.  "
good,Kelly Services was a temporary work agency. At the time my husband and I were moving often for his job. I did receive many offers of full time employment from the companies that I subbed at.
good,"I have enjoyed this contract assignment. While the company is shrinking its workforce, I have had opportunities as a contractor that wouldn't have be available to me otherwise."
good,They are supportive and give jobs to students who need part time jobs to pay rent and other expenses as well as to pay tuition fees. They give employment in many different organizations.
good,"Kelly Services provided opportunities for me to try different industries within my occupation. I worked in a government contracting company, and two non-profit companies. The experience was great! The last company I worked for had it's accountant out with a broken leg. I settled in nicely with the company, but once the accountant returned, there was no room for me. I continue to volunteer for charitable events sponsored by the company."
good,"I am at a job near Kelly Services and near home with great management and good hours. Overall, a jobe well done on my recruiter's part. The job is not too difficult either, especially if you are accustomed to working long hours."
good,"A typical day at Kelly Services included waiting for entry level jobs to be arranged for me to perform as needed."
good,"Work as fast as you can. If you talk, you may get in trouble. This is determined by the company that Kelly contracts to you.They did move you around as long as did well at previous job."
good,"There were no career options for me due to it being temporary. I could not maintain working for them because after losing the one position I did have due to a medical issue, there were no other positions that I was qualified for."
good,Had ample opportunity to work overtime which was very well paid. My salary was much higher for my position than the average in my area but couldn't manage the commute any longer. Looking for something else closer to home.
good,"When I see that students make a connection with daily activities that's when I feel day has been a success. However; if students  struggle but still put in the effort and ask for help that's even more a plus, plus for our students. My most trying part of working as a Substitute Teacher, was gaining  the respect of the students. Unfortunately; I was the fourth teacher the students had encountered within three weeks of a new school year."
good,The work at Kelly Services was great and it really helped people to find gainful employment... there were some super people that I worked with and I believe it was a very relevant job.
good,Management is rude and bullies the employees at the job. Its not professional and when you voice your opinion you are the outcast and is over looked. The product is more important than the employees.
good,"très réactif , toujours un poste , correcte......."
good,Everyone that I have come across at Kelly Services have really been amazing. These people are very helpful and understanding. They really do make things alot easier.
good,I enjoyed working with the agency. They are very nice people. The manager was excellent. Yes I would go back to Kelly services if I had to. Really great team.
good,"My subbing experience has been great with Kelly, they're very consistent and make sure you have work on a daily basis.  If the pay was better I would do it permanently."
good,Kelly Services is a job agency that filled positions for companies with part time workers. Once you have worked for Kelly Services for so many hours with good work ethics it was up to that company whether they would like to hire you full time or not.
good,"People were great, gained some great experience, very thankful for my time there.  Great exposure to different jobs. Work life balance was average.  Would recommend it here"
good,"Just do your job for the company they hire you to work for and you’ll go from temp to full time employee at that company they give you, if you want. which usually has great pay and benefits"
good,Kelly Services was a great place to work because they immediately found me a job close to home that I really like.  My supervisor was very kind and willing to put me to work right away.
good,"Kelly Services has always had my back when I ran into employment issues for being laid off.  Some jobs could have had sexual harrassment, discrimination issues.  Kelly Services always led me to another temporary job in hopes for hire. My experience of Kelly services is it's just a temp job.  I advise look for a permanent job and don't depend on permanent hire with temporary agencies ever."
good,"Kelly is capable of handling the larger, mass-hiring clients in the area, therefore able to give a little more than some of the other temp services.  They are straight forward and pretty streamlined."
good,"You do need to meet the certain requirements. Not easy to do, but sometimes it is. You need to be willing to work on Saturdays as well. If you can't you wont have a job. So make sure you pick a job you can work with no problems. They are willing to help you if you are needing a certain type of work. The staff is very pleasant. If you have a work concern let them know for they will help you. Just be open with them."
good,"I had a good experience with Kelly's until the end, and I even tried to call holly and get another job she wouldn't answer my voicemail an I called the office in Jacksonville fl on sainsbury was told someone would contact me and no one did"
good,"Excellent staffing company with an excellent Recruiting team.  They always answered my emails and took care of issues when I needed it.  When it came time for me to seek a better position, they were right there from the start."
good,"It was clean. The atmosphere was temperature control."
good,When something goes wrong you are not allowed to discuss the incident.. The staff do all they can to assist you with jobs and the downsize is we are not allowed to work in other Districts when our District is out of positions.
good,A great experience going on various assignments representing clients in the downtown Chicago Loop area.  The shifts were first shifts doing mostly office work in a clerical setting.
good,"good at finding temp jobs for u, works with u on getting paystubs and weekly pay easily, has some health benefits that u can get thru them, good at staying in contact with u."
good,I love my job and I love how helpful the people at Kelly's have been.The only thing I would change is that I've been there a year and my call-offs or time off doesn't restart.
good,Welch Allyn is the best job to get great people I got along with so many people I loved working there only one problem with this 2 supervisors just didn't like me they picked their favorite people.
good,Everyone that I have come across at Kelly Services have really been amazing. These people are very helpful and understanding. They really do make things alot easier.
good,"Empresa com bastantes boas condições de trabalho."
good,I have worked through Kelly Services for over 15 years. They work hard to match you with jobs that fit your experience. They work with employers to resolve any issues.
good,"If you like temp work. Then Kelly is the place to go. However no benefits, and no guarantee you will be hired into a place they send you. And they really don't do anything for you if you  have issues on the job."
good,"I was making good hours and money.  So no complaints there. "
good,A enjoyable part time job. You get to meet new faces and enjoy developing new relationships. This job was very rewarding. The part you get to choose your own days to work.
good,They placed in places that were compatible with your skills.   The supervisors treated you well.  I liked the coworkers.  they gave us free donuts on every Thursday.
good,"Great staff, Great company and good pay. Consultant are professional, and thorough. I have worked for many agencies, and would rate this company as my number one choice."
good,"it was seasonal job in kelly service . i moved from pittsburgh PA "
good,"Kelly Services was able to get my foot in the door to many enjoyable work places that I would have never been able to get on my own.  They provided me with  secure employment opportunities, and they were able to find new jobs for me when a new assignment ended.  It is important, though, that you call them often to check on new job openings when you're looking for something new, or you might fall through the cracks.  Overall, working for Kelly Services has been an enjoyable & unique experience.  I have learned something new with every assignment.  It's been great!"
good,"After coming from another staffing agency, Kelly was a welcomed change. The focus seems to be truly on the end product and not as numbers driven as previous position I have worked for other agencies. "
good,"working at allstate was fun while it lasted. It was a temp job and ended before I was ready.  It was fun, self motivating and I leaned a lot.  My manager was very nice, understanding and knew how to manage her employes and she knew my job and could do it at any time."
good,On certain assignments that culture is relaxed and some are more formal. It is nice to have a balance between the two. I like that you can try out companies to see if they are a good fit for you and also for the employer. And they try their hardest to get the best fit for what you are looking for.
good,"Take anything you want'"
good,I would recommend to my friends. Website easily accessed. Pleasant people to work with. Bonuses were a plus. I worked for DAV through Kelly Services and found the job to be challenging and rewarding.
good,"Kelly is a great place to work.  They have grown over the years and are Global.  The offer decent salary with bonus potential and great benefits package.  Management is approachable and willing to work with you and works hard tin offering work/life balance.  Due to the nature of a staffing agency and the fact that Kelly has many large Clients, there is always a need to fulfill job orders/requisitions which causes a lot of extended hours.  "
good,"I like getting the chance to sub at charter schools. Nice change of pace. Good while waiting to find full-time work. There are minimum requirements for work, but they are easy enough to meet."
good,liked working for kelly at the time but when I went back to apply for a different job the process was horrible and they did not even take into consideration that I was a great employee.
good,Kelly services is a great agency that helps its employees out a great deal and they find great work that best fits your skills. The environment is open and friendly with great communication with its employees.
good,Everyone that I have come across at Kelly Services have really been amazing. These people are very helpful and understanding. They really do make things alot easier.
good,"Great company, sad I left.  Really enjoyed what I was doing, but left for more money and a advancement.  Shouldn't have, but you learn what you value when you lose it!"
good,"This was a part time job but it was better for me. We took contracts and cleaned arenas like the United Center, Arie Crowne and more. The shifts were long and tiring but I met a lot of celebrities."
good,"NO Comment to say of my experience of employment. Typical work day was as pacing self to the quota."
good,My time as a temp gave me time to learn the culture and experience that helped me get a full time position. I loved working as a Temp for Kelly Services and it was a great opportunity and the only way to get hired full time.
good,The hiring process was easy and simple. Employees are able to make their own schedule and choose the schools that best fit them. Employees are only required to work two Fridays every 45 days.
good,"The staff is very professional and always ready to assist with any issues."
good,I worked several temp jobs for them and was later employed as a full time employee at Lunde Truck Sales.  I did clerical and office work.  I worked at 7 companies in my time with the company.
good,This is a great opportunity. Kelly Services is doing a great job at providing substitute jobs at great schools. It's easy to connect to an app so that you can accept jobs quickly and have them quickly uploaded to your Google calendar.
good,A typical day at work would be coming into work at 3:30am to get the work day started. I was a maitenance and cleaning guy at Honda. Kelly services is a temp agency. I would make sure that all bins were emptied. All boxes were broken down corrctly etc. I also would sort totes from time to time to make sure parts went out correctly.
good,"One way to have great opportunities to work in various roles, gaining experience along the way. The staff are friendly and strive to find the perfect fit between their clients and employees"
good,Although this was over 10 years ago.  The manager was awesome! She kept me in an assignment.  The pay was proper and the assignment bred great experiences!
good,"A typical day is being on time and preparing to work a productive day. Good management, work a little ruff and fast paced but do able. Mind you this job is making the seats for Mercedes."
good,"Its been years since I worked at Kelly Services, but I remember enjoying being a ""pinch hitter"". At the time I was a Navy wife and young mom. I worked for the company just for a short period of time, but I really enjoyed the aspect of working short term at different employers as needed.  I worked in a variety of environments from construction offices to law offices. Times at each position ranged from a few days to several weeks. A couple positions offered me permanent employment, but as I needed a somewhat flexible schedule I chose to decline.  Personally I enjoy learning & adapting to new environments and personalities, so this was a fantastic job for me. I would recommend this to anyone who has a professional helpful demeanor, learns quickly and enjoys new experiences."
good,"Being a Kelly Lab Technician was great, the work environment was great. The job was simple enough, and you had a lot of down time. The real bad thing I can say about it was that when you were done with your task, that was it. You will wait on what to be told to make next, if ever."
good,"This is a good company to work for, pay was fair, good  raises every year benefits were good also and management was really good. I enjoyed working for this company and learned a lot about how to work safely every day.."
good,"I enjoyed my experience with Kelly Services. However, the job assignment I received was the total opposite of my experience with recruiters and the staff at Kelly Services. Poor management and rushed training at my job assignment. The work environment was also unprofessional and the management took pride in embarrassing and belittling their employees in front of the entire department especially those that came from Kelly Services."
good,"I loved the job. "
good,I have worked for this company for 2 years. I have had an awesome experience working with a great group of people. The company is hands down the best one I have been apart of .
good,"Excellent Management, enjoy working for this Company."
good,Everyone that I have come across at Kelly Services have really been amazing. These people are very helpful and understanding. They really do make things alot easier.
good,Kelly Services was a great employment agency which found me both temporary work to help me get by and a temp to hire position within my field. This temp to hire position went on to be a permanent place of employment which lasted about 4 years.
good,Most days were very busy. Scanning documents or taking calls and payments in person and on the phone. Management was very friendly. Worked many projects at once.
good,Kelly Educational services is a great place to work. They allow you to set you own schedule and sometimes offer a bonus according to where the needs are. If you have kids in school and need to be home this is the job for you. Just know that they offer some medical insurance but it is not anything major.
good,this was a temporary assignment. Kelly Services is a great company to work for. If they have any upcoming assignments I'll be more than happy to help out
good,Does not lead to permanent work. I had a good experience working with their personnel and on the job site. I do not recommend work with any temporary agency. Their goal is to keep you on their agency.
good,love to work there when they have the hours to give there employees. The management is great to work for every day.  I love the co-workers they are fun and entertaining.
good,I loved the open door policy allowing me to work on my job and life goals.  The hiring manager helped me use what I know to further my career.  I would recommend Kelly Services to all my friends.
good,"this was a temp-to-hire position at Weatherford that actually tenured a job offer."
good,typical day at work was pretty busy . Learned how to use different machines and cleaners .management nice and approachable if you had any needs or concerns. the hardest part was leaving after the temporary assignment was over and you had to wait a few weeks to go back and reapply. meeting new people at the different companies.
good,"A typical day at work is students love when their is a sub. They think this is play time and don't want to do their work. I inform students to make right decisions and remind them that their teacher is counted the work as a grade. Most of the time the teachers leave a note concerning this instruction. "
good,"Kelly Services is a great option if you need a flexible schedule or are between jobs."
good,As a first factory job it was a great job but a little difficult at first to get used to the 12 hour shifts.  I had breaks about every 2-3 hours which made the day go by fast.
good,"This is a very productive and very busy work place, I love serving the kid's and the staff. Each day is very interesting here, I have learn so many different things."
good,Company want to see you succeed. Wants to place you in a position that you will enjoy and possible become a permanent employee. Sits down and talks to you about what your needs are and what you are and are not willing to do.
good,The pay was minimal and we weren't always working an entire shift. You had to work an entire year at least before being considered for an permanent interview.
good,"I worked for Kelly as a Substitute Teacher.  It was nice because, once I was in the system, I could sign up for jobs whenever they became available which is was just about every day.  I loved being able to work on my own time and at my own pace.  Substitute teaching was fun too!"
good,"With that said they treat me well I have been a hired service for United Technologies for almost 4 years. My real gripe is upward mobility within UTC, not Kelly. Kelly services can get your foot in the door but they don't hold any ground inside any company they temp out to."
good,"Loved working at Measured Progress through Kelly Services."
good,Everyone that I have come across at Kelly Services have really been amazing. These people are very helpful and understanding. They really do make things alot easier.
good,"A typical work day for me is getting up to head to the school substitute assignment I picked up the day/night before. Once at the school, I get the day's lesson plan(s) and fulfill the day's plans for the students."
good,Kelly Svcs has a great reputation for placing people in positions for temporary or long term.  I would recommend them to other people to contact them.
good,"I worked for Kelly as a temp for hire at Plexus. I enjoyed very much working for kelly services. If ever I had a problem all I had to do was call Kelly and they would take care of it, it also helped that they are located right at the Plexus site."
good,"Kelly Services  is great and are very good at matching you with the right company,  whether it is a temporary assignment or temp to hire. I would highly recommend Kelly Services."
good,liked it there. wasn't there long enough to form an opinion.  The people are very friendly and helpful.  Would go back again if I had to and i would recomend them to friends
good,It has been a pleasure and the flexibility helps a great deal! I appreciate the friendliness of the staff and the hours during the day. Most of the schools have great potential and made me feel welcomed.
good,I did calendaring and travel arrangements for 15 managers.  They gave me an excellent way to keep training on Microsoft Office programs.  Management was very helpful.
good,"They do there best to place people in jobs they would do well in.  Being a temp agency, work is not always available, or reliable. Managers are understanding with salary needs and placement."
good,This company provides opportunities to gain various work skills among various workplace cultures. A typical day depends on your assigned work place.
good,"Internationally known.  Kelly has been a great asset in my life.  Have used them when I needed extra work or needed to get more exposure on the work community wherever I lived.  They are extremely professional.  Kelly tests your typing skills, which mine are good and Microsoft Word and Excel which I have good basic skills.  Recently completed a medical secretary course and gained more computer knowledge."
good,"Kelly Services est une agence de travail temporaire, accueillante, et efficace."
good,"I loved working with Kelly services! They pay great and they have management staff that seem to really care about you! The only thing I have to say about them that was a bit of a problem for me and the only reason I had to part ways, was the hours they wanted me to work. When I was hired on they promised me that they would work within the hours that I specified on my application because I do have other responsibilities outside of work."
good,"I have gotten 3 permanent positions in that time from working as contract labor.  People are really great to work with.  However, as of the last year I have noticed that the recruiters don't seem to care as much as in previous years. They don't take the time to create a true feeling of rapport with their ""employees"".  Two of the upper management that I worked with and created true friendships with are no longer there and I think the younger newer people don't care as much!  Too bad."
good,"I enjoy Kelly Educational Staffing because of the ability to choose my work hours and work environment. As an entrepreneur, I also have the ability to run my business and work with students on off days. I enjoy teaching and developing young minds. It is an excellent position if an individual would like to explore a teaching career."
good,They always find me a job when one contract ends!!! My case worker is amazing. She finds me work every time. She is very dependable!! She negotiates for me to get a raise.
good,great company to work for and they do a good job communicating with you. Flexible hours and scheduling. Opportunities to meet and grow within OCPS.
good,Management was very responsive and informative.  The I.T. department was also very helpful in guiding me in scheduling my days of assignments. Nice Staff.
good,"A Typical day at work begins with checking in at the office, reviewing lesson plans, trying to follow them out and help children who need a little extra guidance. Being kind, supportive, cleaning up at the end of the day and making sure the children feel comfortable and supported. Then, I usually leave a note for the teacher for the following day as a review."
good,"I don't work directly in Kellys offices, but I do have contact with them when needed. Everyone is so helpful at Kelly and they are keeping me employed with is great."

good,"a very good place to work great work team and manager great work hours a very good learning and train team ,open door very peaceful high demand but flexible co worker are very helpful,supervisor was the best that a person could ask foe they treated me like family and not just an employee"
good,"Working as a sub allows me to make money and still search for my career.  The flexible hours are what make my career search possible.  The company is very friendly, and reasonable, I don't mind working for them at all."
good,"- build parts up start of shift to keep ahead"
good,"Kelly Services treated me well then I was hired full time for Blue"
good,Kelly services was a good place to work. I liked it because they were all very helpful. I learned how to use RPG gun and also a verity of things.
good,"The employees here are great! Very helpful and quick to get whatever needs to be done, done. It's a family oriented business and that's a great quality."
good,Was truly an amazing place with an exceptional work environment going to work while it may have been hard on some days but never without any fun. Management was excellent and very easy to talk to and was always there to help motivate you. Co-workers were nice and made the work life a really great place. The most enjoyable part of being an employee was being part of the engagement team which meant I was able to help motivate my co-workers as well so they didn't get too tired.
good,"I enjoy working with children, however,  at times it is difficult dealing with their behaviors..  I love to teach them the curriculum. "
good,"Fast paved , great people great hours"
good,I am proud to have been a part of Kelly Services and the AppleProject. I would recommend anyone to try this out. They send everything needed you will just need phone line and high speed internet.

good,Work place at SB&D the experiences was good. people are very nice to work with. The pressure is a lot because you have to learn what the tools are used for and explain what they can and can’t be use for . With Kelly services  sometimes you feel a little left out of the loop . not too much communication with the placement reciter a little more  follow-up up when it’s getting close to the end of the temp position will be great .It’s a little stressful that you contact them and you are inform we have nothing that will fit you .  over all cant complain

good,"In general, I would recommend Kelly Svs to others.  Benefits are decent.  Support system within the local Kelly personal is a little weak.  Need to make it more inviting if you have an issue with a direct person, but work to be done on that front.  Most directs do not make Kelly personal feel ""less than"" employees, but environment promotes separation between them."

I have learned how to maintain my temper when they call in upset you shouldn't go temper for temper some calls can get you upset and that shows through your voice on your calls.

As a scorer we had to pass State Education tests with at least 70% or 80% accuracy (depended on the particular state's requirements) to be eligible to score student exams.  The environment was fast paced and accuracy (70% minimum) and rate (about 2 per minute scored) was required throughout scoring as well as the initial qualification test.

good,"To monitor and survey the gantry at Tuas Checkpoint"
good,My job with Kelly services was amazing. The students on some days would be quite a bit to handle. I had days where little girls would scream across the room at each other. It was not much fun. but I would have just as many if not more days where you would be able o reach the students and help them learn something that could change their lives. I loved this job more than any other job that I have had. with that in mind the pay is far too low ( a the end of the day you have to be there for 8 or 9 hours) on a short day and the pay ends up being like 6.50-7.50 an hour. But the experience is well worth it.
good,Contracts through other companies to provide customer assistance in health care. You will receive in-bound customer calls seeking help with Medicare coverage. The job requires good listening skills and the a calm demeanor.

Put the parts away into the oven rooms so as to keep the parts from breaking or being deformed."
good,Everyone that I have come across at Kelly Services have really been amazing. These people are very helpful and understanding. They really do make things alot easier.
good,A typical day at work is draining but it is all worth it when you get paid for all the hard hours you put in.

I was hired and stayed with them for 5 years. The accountant in the company was strict about the laws. Some of the employees did have some grudge against the policies of the company. But I felt that they were ethical. My work duties were : answering International and domestic calls from customers, employees from other branches of our company, organizing files and folders, sending faxes and e-mails. I learned a lot about how to deal with certain clients and employees. The hardest part of the job was differentiating between important calls and unimportant calls. Sometimes, people would just walk in tellling me that they would like to have a meeting with my employer. Sometimes, I would tell them to wait and other times, I would have to send them back and ask them to take an appointment and then drop in."

He not only told me how to use, but showed me and had me use it; meaning the 'hands on' approach. I worked as a temp. but the 'regulars' were very helpful and I learned a lot from them. The hardest part of the job was going through and making sure all the tags were on all the clothes. Also putting the camo. where it needed to go. The most enjoyable part of my job was actually going out on the floor and putting the clothes where they needed to go."

good,"Clerical work, collections, budgeting, planning, and etc."
good,"A typical day at work consist of group meetings in the mornings and getting any training or additional information that is needed to complete your job duties for the day or week, if nothing new comes about. I have learned to manage time wisely, stay consistent, and communicate with others on a professional level. Management was there for all needs, whether if it was job related or personal. The hardest part of the day for me was probably when it came to training others with new assignments and still doing my own assignments for the day/week but I got through it with no complaints. The most enjoyable part of the day was just simply coming to work, getting my job done, and helping others."

good,It was a great place to work for. People are nice in which caused for a stress work environment. A typical day at work wasn't like normal places I have worked for. We all worked together in a friendly and respectful way. I learned that morality was a key roll in this company which kept the people humble and willing to work harder. Management was laid back and knew how to give out orders and demands that weren't harsh or rude. The co-workers pushed safety to high regards. Each worker cared for one another. The hardest part of the job would be the heat. I believe the highest working temperature was at 120 degrees in summer. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the responsibilities. I like to take on challenges because it pushes me to learn more and in return gave me more respect for my own self.
good,Everyone that I have come across at Kelly Services have really been amazing. These people are very helpful and understanding. They really do make things alot easier.
good,"I loved Kelly Services, but won't be going to another temp agency as it's exactly what it is, temporary."
good,"Loved working for a major manufacturing company (another new business type) and learning SAP since it is a widely used versatile program.  Met and worked with Regional Managers, Department Exec's, and buyers to keep workflow moving and checks paying vendors/suppliers.  I created spreadsheet to monitor utility, loan and lease payments to ensure timely payment of critical bills - was adapted into policy for all AP Specialists after I left.  Never two days the same because of variety of vendor invoices, problems, priorities, etc."
good,I think the only things that they need to do is visit the work place and see what types of work. environment we are in and what we have to go throw day in and day out.

good,"I am currently very happy with my assignment. The client, a major pharmaceutical manufacturer, has extended my contract twice and awarded me a promotion. The management team at Kelly Services has been very helpful and supportive. The client company has an excellent corporate culture and recognizes hard work and talent. I have been given many opportunities to both show what I can do and to learn new skills. The position is challenging and there is always something new to learn. The managers are professional and approachable with any issue or question. A typical day involves updating reports, data entry, and data analysis and management tasks primarily in Excel. I have been given duties including primary on-site support for the Maintenance Management System and frequently assist with issues."

I learned to persuade potential applicants by giving tours, providing detailed information about the sites history and current market values and to process received applications. My co-workers and site managers were incredibly helpful, supportive and pleasant. There were rare interactions with an upset resident but I am efficient at handling such situations. I enjoyed learning about real estate."

good,"Great work environment with the ability to move around."
good,I learned how to help make a line run smoothly and to keep up with all my work. I also learned to keep pace in a fast work environment and to help catch other peoples work that was not able to get their own. The hardest part of the job was learning what to do at new stations. The easiest part of the job is when you knew how to do everything and did not worry if you would be somewhere that you have no clue what you are doing. The coworkers were the nicest because they were all just about temporary people in need of a job.

good,"Warehouse pick a minimum of 160 cph, while on a electric pallet jack,build pallets according to order forum or voice pick, shrunk rap and load in truck or stage according to truck numbers. It was an awesome place to work. Great teamwork, all the co-workers helped one another. That   is why this job was most enjoyable to me. The most difficult part for me was waiting for my other co-workers to move on to the next item. I am a lot faster at pick/packing then most people."
good,"The day at Molex was always busy."
good,"The assignment was for about 2 years, I was surprised it ended. 2 Years is a long time to decide that you no longer need a temp. But it has given me a great insurance background and life long skills that I will use in the future"

At one point I was working in shipping and i was packaging product in to the boxes and sending them down the line. Also down in receiving I was up in another room called the sample room and up there you had to sort throu things to package and send downstairs to be packaged again to be sent out. I also worked in the offices at Meads. I loved working in the office. I was the mail girl.

good,The days at work went by quick because their was always something to do and i liked that with all the nice people i worked around and they were willing to teach me anything it took to move up but the most important thing learned was that hard work pays off even the supervisors would show you what to do to make it then we all had days where we meet up after work and go bowling or something i enjoyed that.

good,I started my day at this call center by logging into my phone and logging into my computer and initiating my computer programs for my daily calls. I learned about handling different billing criteria and procedure codes for the State of California. I took calls from different billing offices and gave them claim information whether it was paid or denied and if their was a reason why. The hardest part of the job was researching info on why the claim was denied and if their was an answer online or a new procedure code being used.

good,"I loved working for apple tech support for kelly services, this was the first work from home job that started you off with great pay. I had great managers so that was a plus and never had an issue. The only issue i had was i was with the company for 2 almost 3 years and had not received holiday pay, was told i didnt work enough hours but 2 years come on.  But we did have a lot of sources that also helped us do our jobs as well. If our TL was not available we always had another person or people to reach out to help in the matter of whatever the situation was."
good,Kelly offers great assignments in many locations that work being close to the employee. The assignment was a call center care coordinator. Making inbound and outbound calls to assist patients with getting scheduled for diagnosis exams in a timely matter.
good,Being a substitute you might not spend time at one school you’ll help substitute at different schools so it’s hard to connect with someone to achieve a paraprofessional/aide job.

good,I was hired to handle inventory at a warehouse and I LOVED that job. it was a set schedule and all I had to do is do my job. The managers believed in my capacitation to do the job and were very easy to get allow with.  I just hated the part that is was a temp-hire position because the person came back and I was laid off.
good,This temp agency was a nice place to work now when dealing with the contractors they was picked about who they wanted to hire coming from the temp agency.
good,Recruiters are professional and do their best to work with you. I worked several assignments for them since 2006.  I would recommend this agency to anyone.
good,I worked almost a year at various jobs. The jobs were steady and the pay was good.  Eventually I was hired in a permanent position and have worked for the same company for almost 20 years.
good,I landed a 5 month assignment that turned into a 7.5 month assignment.  It was really laid back and not a lot of direction. I asked many times if there were tasks or jobs I could help complete from the main office but no response.  I was paid to sit there and Answer the phone that never rang. Good gig. Allowed me to do online school courses and work on personal projects.  In my down  time I created a employee handbook for them.
good,"This company is great to work for. The only bad thing is sometimes there are no jobs. When there are jobs, you could working for  month  six months and it all depends on the job"
good,"Es una empresa que se preocupa por su personal, ofrecen capacitación para mejorar el desempeño,"
good,Kelly Services was great in placing me on an assignment quickly. I was able to experience working in a warehouse/ manufacturing company and also was able to work in a health insurance job. Both provided me with great work experience.
good,Kelly is a wonderful temp agency. I've worked for Kelly in multiple cities/states. I've had better success in more progressive cities than small cities. But always know when I walk into a Kelly office. Kelly is 5 Stars in my book.
good,My work experience with this company is good. Employee friendly company
good,"I enjoyed working with this company on this particular project, my group was awesome, I met a lot of great people, and travel to places I would not have otherwise visited. The company was supportive and the pay and bonuses were very generous. I would gladly work with them again."

good,"It's hard to separate the experience I had with the contact at Kelly (super) from the day-to-day experience I had actually doing the job. The project manager was ultra professional while being infinitely patient with all of his coworkers, so that made such a difference."
good,"Everyday with Kelly Services was an adventure. Yes; students can be difficult, but once you get to know them they are amazing. The fact that you get to work with all grades K-12 makes it that much better. It lets you find your niche and once you find it, you can really connect with the students."
good,"Uma ótima empresa de se trabalhar, indicaria para qualquer pessoa que quisesse trabalhar nela."
good,Good company to work for. Gave me great experience in terms of teaching and being able to manage the classroom. Which given that I was going into education was skills that I was going to need. Good place to work. Flexible. Can set your schedule too.
good,"It was a joy to work with Kelly Services. They were helpful with any issues the employee had. Seeing that this was two-year contract management came in an array of supervision, which meant directions came from different areas within the warehouse."
good,"I have been working at Kelly for over a year, and have moved positions quite a few times. the job opportunities are endless, but you have to work towards getting them, they don't just come to you. My managers, with the exclusions of one, have been really good. I enjoy working from home, but the Apple program is stressful especially when you have 3 chats. I do like my management team, my entire team actually. I love that they truly try and fit you into a place where you belong, and they don't force you to do positions that you don't want to do - the pay is pretty good, but could be higher for the amount of work that you have to do. I obviously know it's based where you live, some people make $15 an hour, and some lower than $14. That's the only downside of working from home. I really haven't had any complaints."
good,"I have had a great transition from call center to at home advisor. For me the pay for where I am located is not enough. The atmosphere is great, and there is always a contest or something fun to do in your down time."
good,I love being able to work from home. It saves time on the commute and over head. As well as gives me family access if needed. I also love that its a tech position.
good,Great company that works with you. I had a great supervisor who listen and was there whenever we need him. Always available and always checking on us.
good,"Takes FOREVER to get benefits. More advanced jobs are hard to come by (that pay more than $16/hr)"
good,"It was a pleasure to have such great co-workers. There were a few problems with the equipment I had to use, but, in the end, it worked out okay, The hours were consistent; no overtime was expected."
good,The company is good to work for It was a great experience for myself I only wish that there was a permanent position available. The benefits take too long to get so you have to take those points on the days that are not coverd.
good,"Kelly Services pays very well, pay is weekly and my recruiter was awesome at contacting me when high paying positions arose whether I was able to accept the offer or not. Never making less than $15.00 per hour."
good,Kelly Service good place to work weekly pay and training. Will work with you if a situation comes up. You couldve choose your own schedule. Pick.what school you wanted to go to.
good,Muy agradecida por la oportunidad y encantada con el trato hacia los empleados
good,"The position was a Data Entry Specialist position. The work is repetitive, but easy. Not problematic for an experienced data entry representative. Management always hold group meetings, to keep everyone informed of daily changes in routines or state requirements."
good,"I was a Biogen contractor so everything that was said in the Biogen review is exactly what occurred with the Kelly Services position. The only difference was that there was a fear that if I made a mistake that I could be replaced. Besides helping people in need with the medicines I helped create, I did like getting paid weekly. The manager at Kelly Services was amazing because she would help me get bonuses, raises, and extra pay to match exactly what full-time employees received and this was done because of my high level of performance."
good,Everyone that I have come across at Kelly Services have really been amazing. These people are very helpful and understanding. They really do make things alot easier.
good,Kelly Services contracted me out to substitute at locals schools. They provided a bit of training and are easy to deal with. I've had a great experience with them.
good,I assembled and prepared documents for imaging using a high speed scanner. Reviewed imaged documents as a quality control measure to ensure an acceptable image was captured. Independently operated scanning hardware and perform daily cleaning.
good,"- Employment was great"
good,"I enjoyed working at Kelly Services; the staff was amazing and helpful, the pay was more than sufficient during my time there, but the jobs were not long enough and to far apart. This was my experience but I know other people who have worked for Kelly Services who were permanently hired for full time employment by the company they had tempted at through Kelly."
good,They are a really great company to work for. It's an excellent place with very friendly people who care about your needs and concerns. I highly recommend anyone and everyone to give them a call if in need of a job.
good,Kelly Services is a great place to work except that there's no benefit like traveling expenses for contract employees. The supervisors are really nice people.
good,Working with Kelly Services is an exciting venture.  They are usually able to get you to work for as little or as much as you would like.  I enjoy working for Kelly Services.
good,"Profesional enviroment,problems solve with etic and good hour."
good,This was a temp job that I worked for a short time.  It enabled me to develop and improve my skills.  It was a good company to work for but my remote location did not provide many opportunities at that time.
good,"I've learned the administrative side of Kelly Services and the ability to lead in corporate America. I worked as a receptionist, data entry clerk and customer service representative."
good,My hiring and superior is excellent. Very easy to talk to and work with. Had a very understanding and professional experience Business casual dress. Great people to work with. Very flexible schedule. Kids are fun.
good,This is overall a great company to work with however sometimes management can be a tad bit unhelpful. I loved both job assignments that I took on through the company and wouldn’t mind accepting new positions in the future.
good,"Not a bad place to work but not temperature controlled. very hot in summer. they do supply fans though. starting pay as an temp isn't very much but is typical of most company starting pay.The company is very strict about tardiness,one minute late is counted against you. You only get two 10 minutes breaks and one 30 minute lunch. overall it all depends on what position you work if you will like it or not."
good,I really liked working for Kelly. Management is really good at Kelly Services. I just wish I didn't have to relocate. I hope they would have work sites here in Riverbank for me.
good,"Moved to ND and applied with Kelly services in Fargo in 2016.  I was working within a week at a pretty decent job for not terrible pay and with what looked like a road ahead for growth.  Sadly the company had some internal upset right around the holidays, when I was supposed to transition from a temp to full-time regular employee, and decided to be rather cheap about how they wanted to bring me on.  I asked Kelly Services to transition me out of there."
good,"Worked with great people fast paced great work environment. We did group team building fun activities. We would have group lunch outings. All of the job assignments with Kelly were great positions "
good,"Kelly Services is a fantastic recruitment centre for permanent and casual vacancies. I was able to work when I wanted, where I wanted, and for how long. I would recommend working for them."

good,"This job, although temporary, provides opportunities to gain essential skills and discipline needed for other jobs. You have the opportunity to get hired by the company you work for."
good,"Kelly Services is a great company to work for. However, the pay is not what is needed to live off of. Substitutes only receive $60 a day for assignments and there are no benefits available for us because we are considered part-time employees."
good,"kelly services has a lot of jobs that are available  in your area."
good,This is a Temp Service. The pay is great and they will find you a job/ assignment very fast. The only problem is that there is no benefits unless you get hired on to your assignment.
good,"Kelly's Services Educational Staffing was a great way to continue working with young adults, getting the experience you need.  What's also great is that you are able to work for a day or two, or find a permanent substitute teaching position that covers months!"
good,"This was a great company to work with, in conjunction with Dow Chemical.  Everyone was very helpful and very understanding with personal issues.  Praise for a job well done."
good,"this is an amazing work from home job"
good,"A typical day at Kelly starts with a team meeting discussing the various open roles at different clients."
good,"The reason why kelly is a great place to work, is that they can and will place you on the job site fast. Apparently, I have to fill out this form to look for a job through indeed.com..."

The management is very nice, but I can't say much for the co-workers because they changed based on the place I was sent to work.

good,"I enjoyed working for Kelly services I went on a variety of jobs for them"
good,"It’s a good job for those wanting to work from home. Don’t expect to be able to slack off just because you’re in your PJs. Work pace is very fast, literally one call after the other. Standards are tough but if you have outstanding customer soft skills you will do well. If you’re not clearly above average in “giddiness” when speaking to customers they will send bad feedback which will trump every other aspect of your work no matter how well you’re doing. You need a sunshine kinda personality to work with Apple customers :D"

good,"Kelly Services is a contract-based company, and inherit with such things, comes certain problems, but with Kelly, the benefits drastically out-weigh the cons. The benefits are extremely supportive staff that are always just an email or call away (i've never waited more than a couple hours to receive a response). But in contrast, they will rarely fight for your compensation, since it is up to you to negotiate that, and it also is not their fault, since they are only the contracting company, and the company they contract you out to sets that price. They offer all types of coverage, and are always willing to work with you."

good,"My day at work involves telecommuting with associates, team leads, and supervisors while I advise customers over the phone about any issues they may have with iOS Apple products. The toughest part about the job is the fast paced nature of accepting calls one after the other without any break other than the scheduled 15 minutes and non-paid lunches. For a call center position, it is above average in regards to the culture. Compensation is lower than I would like, but it pays enough to get by."

good,Great staff to work with. I learned how the orders go once the customer orders items. The hardest part of the job was the lifting of the heavy boxes. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fast pace of the job.

good,Everyone that I have come across at Kelly Services have really been amazing. These people are very helpful and understanding. They really do make things alot easier.
good,"When I worked for Kelly Services it was a temp agency. I was only paid so much and did not receive benefits. I had to work so long where they sent me in order to get hired on full time. I was told it would be about 6 months, but I was never hired onto the company and never received and benefits or health insurance. I worked anywhere from 12-14 hour shifts 5 days a week."
good,"Since I have been in VA, I would get a call to work for weeks or just a few days temporally. The staff was always available if I had any questions regarding the assignment."
good,They offered website training and advise on advancement.  Kelly Services always left an open channel of communication.

good,Una empresa de outsorcing la que no tiene estabilidad laboral
good,"I enjoyed my job at Kelly's services. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday and trying to help them find the right job for them. The most frustrating part of the job, was thinking that someone was going to be a good fit for a current position and it was a big epic fail."
good,"I really enjoyed working in the job although the work was very important and part of HMRC, I firstly worked in the post room where I collect and collate all the information needed to be entered into the data base which I worked my way up to, then as time pasted by as I was a fast and accurate worker then then moved my in to the home office section which I enjoyed very much, the times of which changed monthly but did not bother me as I was happy to work the hours and any overtime that I could collect."
good,I had a great co workers and enjoy working with others. I  like running the machine to get production done. I used to weight out mail and print out postage stamps and then send it out to the postal office

I enjoyed that you can choose if you wanted to take a job or not, you choose your days, the schools you want to attend or not."
good,"This is an excellent job for the right person. I love it, but know it wouldn't work for many people's personalities. You need to be someone who can think logically and work through things step by step. It's important to follow directions, and be able to work with many windows up on your screen. The pay is good. My understanding is it is higher than what it used to be. Also, you can move up quickly. I was promoted about 2 months after being hired. Management is great to work with. The team leads and supervisors are approachable (via instant message and email). Coachings are informative, and work on helping you improve. They are nice, but if you are the type that can't handle regular, constructive critique, you may not do well here. You have metrics that measure different aspects of your calls. You want to always be improving. During a month, you may be trying to improve your customer satisfaction scores, average handle time, research time, or improving your adherence to a set of standards on how you open your calls. There is a 401(k) you can sign up for, but no company match. After one year, you can get an Affordable Care Act approved plan from Kelly. Before that, they offer a health plan that doesn't meet the ACA standards and isn't subsidized by Kelly at all."
good,"I had a varied of receptionist jobs through this temp agency.  I learned how to catch on quickly.  Management were very nice and great to work for.  All co-workers were very welcoming when entering each new assignment.  The best part was having a variety of jobs which I learned a lot from and a break between jobs was nice as well, but the hardest part was having a break that was a little too long between jobs."
good,"I have worked at several different offices through Kelly Services and most assignments have been enjoyable and offered an opportunity to learn a number of different positions. Most jobs are temporary, but it's great if you're looking for flexibility."
good,great to work for Kelly Services great place working at TG Motors in Mo  all was great place best warehouse / factory job ever I just want happy in Mo

good,Baylor is a great hospital and the staff are very nice and friendly. I loved this job. I work with the employee health dept. and I took care of all the vaccination records and kept them updated. I made sure all employees were up to date with all their vaccines. I made hand hygiene rounds through out the hospital to make sure the hospital was germ free as much as possible.
good,I would still be working for Frito-Lay if I hadn't move. The amount of time and cost to hire and train each employee is impressive. Every employee is treated with respect. Its a good company to retire from.

good,"Obtained supplies to operate the macines"
good,"I appreciate Kelly Services because they always placed me at companies that was in trouble and ""fires"" needed to be put out. I worked steady for them the entire time I was there. They was great to me as well as supportive in everything. It was a great placement agency."
good,"Allianz – New Business Annuity  	"
good,In the mornings or sometimes in the evenings I would schedule when I would substitute and where. I learned that the future job that I'm currently going to school for which is teaching is definitely set in stone after working in the classroom with the kids. The best part of the day was seeing the smiling faces of the kids and being able to work with them! I normally sign in at the office and head to the classroom then the teacher usually leaves a folder with worksheets for the kids to do. All the other teachers surrounding their classroom are always a lot help! The principles and staff are always great as well! The hardest part but very minor was sometimes having to get the kids under control and to stay in their seats.
good,I enjoyed the diversity that a temp agency gave me. I was able to pick and choose where I wanted to work.  I was paid in a timely manner and made more than if I was working a regular job.
good,"Explanation of certain ratings above--comp and security. Enjoyed working at the Dow Chemical facility. Since the position was through a temp agency, there was job security--once the project requirements were met the position is eliminated. However, i was the last person to leave this particular project because of my performance. The facility leaders were quite pleased with my work and willingness to accept any task. Due to the nature of temp agencies compensation is not as beneficial as compared to a direct-hire position."
good,"Professional place to work with supportive co-workers and management. Gained more experience to enhance my skills. I would say the most difficult part of my job was initially learning their operating system and once I learned that everything fell into place, and the enjoyable part of my job was everything."
good,This is a staffing compnay that helps and checks on you through out your assignments. They helped me find a job that fit my background easily.
good,"I liked working at Kelly Services because, although it was a temporary agency, it allowed me to work in varied positions and learn how different companies used their assistants."

good,Was contracted out through Kelly Scientific in the summer of 2010. Very much enjoyed coming to work every day and received detailed instructions from my recruiter as to the work responsibilities I would have along with who I would be expected to report to and what type of compensation I would receive. The management and recruiting staff was very professional and knowledgeable. The work was steady and available when I needed the income the most.
good,Everyone that I have come across at Kelly Services have really been amazing. These people are very helpful and understanding. They really do make things alot easier.
good,"I really appreciate having the opportunity in working as a customer director and the training is amazing it's like no other, and the pay is weekly as well as paid training too."
good,I found this company to be very profession and helpful.  The management is good to deal with.  Very busy office and the days go by very fast.
good,They make sure that their subs are working continuously and they are always giving us little incentives to work towards. If we work so many  we will receive 100.00. They also offered us insurance benefits for the time we worked. I really enjoyed being able to see my kids in the evening being home with them after school meant so much to me. My typical day was me going to the varies school sub for absent teachers. I also loved my co workers everyone was so nice and informational.
good,"Kelly came through for me when I needed a job, after a major move. My preferred job was something that, obviously, would allow a source of income coming in, but that would also allow me a flexible enough schedule to allow me to go on interviews and such for full-time employment. The only drawback is that the days you work are based solely on if, and only if a teacher calls out. This isn't the type of work you do, if you need a guaranteed amount of funds, but I found it to be INCREDIBLE helpful for me."
good,"This company has a gift for placing you where your talents are used best, while allowing you to learn and add skills to what you already have.  You meet good people at many of the places they put you.  The hardest part of the job can sometimes be saying goodbye when your assignment ends. Again, this is an excellent company to work for if you are raising a family.  With this company you can learn and grow and move around."

Management was good because they allowed us to pick and choose the days we did/didn't want to work. Also we picked what schools we wanted to work for Monday - Friday. For me the hardest part of the job was subbing in a Math class because math is my weakest subject.

Thanks to the staff at Kelly
good,Kelly Employment Service is an employment agency the primarily assist in temporary employment. I have worked a few temporary assignments for Kelly and I have to honestly say I have never been on an assignment that wasn't professional with great compensation.
good,I have been working for the agency off and on for about 10 years. About 2 years ago I was laid off from my permanent job after not being with Kelly for over 5 years. I called them back and was able to pick up where I left off. They remembered me and knew of my work history with them and immediately statred looking for placement for me.

good,"Its what you make of it. I enjoyed the evening positions that I worked. Depending on the contract you are assigned to its an open-air call center or you can be sent to a facility that has cubes. Good place to network and make associates. Just keep your personal life and business to yourself. Contracts with Kelly tend to attract alot of women since its typically and inbound call center contract. The pay is decent, guaranteed weekly.

good,Kelly Services is an excellent company and I feel very blessed they gave me an opportunity to work for them. I highly enjoyed the project I was on and was actually sad to leave! Pay of course depends on what you’re doing and what state you live in. My one and only gripe is the insurance. The deductible that must be met before coverage begins is extremely high.

My only complaint would be our database system is antiquated (I came from a company that used Bullhorn and I loved it!), and their KellyWeb (our resource for all operations materials) frequently has broken links/unsearchable terms.  For being such a giant of a company, both of these things really should be more user-friendly."

A good compliance analyst must be familiar with the laws, aware of planned changes and able to identify anything that might fall on the wrong side of the law, even if it appears nebulous or subtle. Experience is critical, and an analyst who has substantial industry experience and connections might be more employable and better able to negotiate pay and benefits. People who are already working in an industry but have an interest in changing careers to compliance analysis might want to consider going back to school for certification."

good,"I had several years factory experience when I came to Kelly's. I actually was looking for another agency and was lost that was how I ended up working for them . The recruiter asked if I had ever considered working for the potato factory I told her that I had and she said fill out an app and when can you start. The typical day at the factory was go to the crib and draw out the equipment necessary for the shift, then go to the lunch room and wait till the shift bosses come and get the workers they want. I liked working production I was really not very good at some of the packing jobs . Packing especially tray pack was just a beast for me I was too short to reach the product and watch the box maker .Any way I would go to the area they needed help in and I was always a few min. early I believe in giving the other shift a few min. to relax before they punch out. When the other shift leaves then you suit up (put your gear on) and start the shift I would always ask how the machines were running and if there was any thing special to look for because when you are sorting sometimes the loads are real bad with debris and foreign objects. I would wash down the floors when there was a break in production. This was the cleanest place I have ever worked .We work twelve hour shifts and breaks were given by a relief person. This was a typical day the best part of the job was the fact that the bosses never bothered you they watched but the leads were who they dealt with. I have a great respect for that factory and the people that work there every one will help you if you have a problem and they"

Or you have the option to come to them and tell them what you don't feel right about. The working pace was always calm. No drama nor talking.

The most enjoyable part of any job would be getting your job completed any a timely manner and a successful completion.

Most of the management was very easy to work with.  Co-workers were excellent in helping you if there was something that you didn't know.  The hardest part of the job sometimes was dealing with the customers because what they didn't realize is that we never possessed the fingerprint results, and they thought we did so that caused some confusion.  The most enjoyable part was being able to troubleshoot for customers, it gave them a sense that I would go the extra mile for them."

We also would sell Applecare plans to some customers."

The people I worked with were all positive and nice to spend the days there with.  The hardest part of my job was when business was slow because I really like staying busy.

Working with management and my coworkers was an awesome experience, I have met some wonderful people. My toughest responsibility while working with apple was not being able to satisfy every customer. When you face technical issues that was beyond my expertise, those calls had to be forwarded to another team.

But I enjoyed being able to completely correct those technical issues  for other customers."

good,"Kelly does an awesome job of meeting the needs of its clientele by finding the right person for the right job. Corporations nowadays seem to want people with very specific skills AND experience and don't want to waste time or money on training. While opinions vary on the sustainability and/or ethics of this business approach, the reality is what it is and Kelly does exactly what they say they will. They negotiate your salary up front and even allow you to purchase benefits when you work for them for a length of time. For assignments which can last a lot longer than three or six months, this is an ideal way to split the costs down the middle for everyone involved. The service coordinators know what they are doing and everyone is extremely professional. The hiring process is as transparent as possible to my knowledge and all their policies are available on the Internet, which makes finding out the etiquette of applying for a permanent position at the workplace you are assigned a lot less awkward. In addition, I REALLY liked the ability to get paychecks direct deposit and see all my tax info and pay stubs online. I've worked with various different agencies; this is the only one out there to deal with both me and my employer straight up while meeting both our needs. If a corporation or employer posts a job through multiple agencies and you find you have a choice when it comes to signing the exclusivity agreement? Whatever these recruiters tell you, SIGN WITH KELLY."
