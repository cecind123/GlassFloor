bad,"Worst back I've ever worked for. The leaders, and I hesitate to use that word as their is no leadership demonstrated, are bumbling fools. Unethical lending practices are promoted."
bad,"If you are lucky to work at a busy branch to obtain your goals, the job will be easy. If you are lucky to work at a branch where there is not a high turnover, the job would be great. If you are lucky to work at a branch where the branch manager or team lead is knowledgeable and want to teach you, you will be lucky. My experience at Regions was horrible, a lie from the door."
bad,Regions is an awful place to work  Upper management doesn’t care about the employees. Only about making the already rich VPs even richer. They do not offer fair pay and promote those who kiss up the most.
bad,"DO NOT gravitate towards this job just because of the pay.  This was absolutely the worst job I’ve ever had in my life.  The manager was on vacation every other week and expected us to do her job for her, we even had to stop telling customers she was on vacation because they asking where she was so often.  Kind of hard to take care of customers with no manager around.  The assistant manager is just if not more incompetent as she is, he’s only assistant manager cause they’ve known each other for ten years and she got him the job.  All in all if you want to be stressed and depressed over people who talk about you constantly and doesn’t help you just tells you to look things up then this is the job for you."
bad,Love the customers. Too many expectations to reach quotas. Sales goals change during the quarter to make it where it's difficult to meet your sales goals. Micromanaging is too stressful. Your calls are tracked daily. If you don't meet your goals everyone knows about it. Digital banking is pushed daily to ensure you don't have a job in the future. Upper management wants the branches to have kiosks and video bankers instead of real people. If you want to work at a branch find another bank. Your job will be eliminated within the next 5 years.
bad,It’s almost impossible to break out of a branch role. The same managers sit in their positions until it’s time to retire. Also unethical practices. My old manager was under investigation.
bad,"They don’t care about your well being. "
bad,They have such a high pressure to sell . I would never recommend working there. The managers pressure to get loans out of nothing. Worst job ever. HR doesn't keep anything confident
bad,"The culture is terrible.  You are only as good as your last quarter.  They will train you a lot.  Then not let you use the training.  Management will lie to you and about you.  All performance goals are completely unrealistic. There is absolutely no 'work/life balance', unless all you care about is work.  IF you chose to work there, you will put in more than 60 hours per week, and you will be stabbed in the back professionally.  There is no chance for advancement.  You will be a telemarketer.  You will be selling products to those on your list that are in the best interest of the company - regardless of how those products may affect the customer."
bad,"Stay Away! The goals are inflated and nothing is ever good enough. You have to open 150 checking accounts a quarter along with 650,000 in loan volume. They claim they are not pushing product to clients with there new needs assessment tools. But you are forcing product down customers throats! This is not a retail store but a bank and needs to be managed like one!"
bad,Don't work for regions dont xare about their employees. They are all about numbers and what will make them some money. They scam on the elderly by issuing them credit cards with high interest rates knowing that they are on a fix income.  Some of the Team leads and managers have nasty attitudes. Regions us always down sizeing as well. They xall it revitalizing and growth.
bad,This was the worst managed company I have ever worked for. The manager was a complete a--hole and the regional manager was full of it. I would not recommend anyone to work at regions
bad,If your not friends with the right people you will stay in the same spot. everyone clicks up and make fun of the new people in the office. agents sleeping with management.
bad,"Working for Regions you are treated like a replaceable warm body. They do not care about development or their customers. They care about their bottom line. It is very much a ""good ol' boys club."""
bad,"Never work for them. The managers dont know anything and the ROMS are even more terrible with directions Very unprofessional and hood place to work, The managers will throw you under the bus quickly"
bad,This was never a good place to work. No one in this company could ever take a joke. Everything was incredibly serious. They didnt really want an employee. They wanted a possession they could control.
bad,Regions is plagued by very poor management.  Corporate management doesn’t follow through when issues are brought to their attention.  Retaliation for speaking up is very high.
bad,This job did not focus on the employees at all and the benefits are not really that good. You pay for benefits but could not really use them because of the requirments
bad,Bad in every way. Horrible regional and local leadership. Incompetent in every way. C class company within south east and will most likely pull out of market due to the inadequacy
bad,"Under new management and structuring, our customers and loyal veteran employees became lost in the vision of the future. Our mission and focus should be (always) on our customers and building relationships, not primarily steered toward integrating everything about technology and innovation of new methods of banking, Bank manager often insighted that CSM's mission is to have ""one person on cash line for both lobby and drive thru), instead of the face to face communication and having the proper staffing to meet the needs and demand of the branch. Let us not forget where and how we built our banking to begin with, it was from QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE, which was instilled into my generation of customer banking. Not this ""new way"". Then with the termination of an entire tenure, loyal, staff (people who have sacrificed YEARS of excellence to their employer, communities, and team, whom the majority of customers were coming to see because ""THEY"" built those relationships and serviced their needs and focused on THEIR CUSTOMERS) were let go. Completely incomprehensible. YET, new managers (with no prior banking experience, no PROFESSIONAL leadeship skills, no empathy for medically ill individuals (whom there were two who faithfully worked while having both serious medical issues; however, THIS branch manager would leave with a head cold) simply walks into a professional career with staff who she did not hold acountable for tantrums (50+ year old women, who acted unprofessionally regularly) were/are unethical, whom do not follow policy, and with new hirees who were/are not following proper"
bad,Bank is changing all job roles in which you are not compensated for. The new job roles include unrealistic scheduling and goals for day to day duties. Bank is also placing anyone even unqualified individuals in management roles.
bad,The day started with me reluctantly waking up to go. I got there by 730 to open up the store. I blanked out until the end of the day. I didnt really like working here because they have some pretty messed up people that they hire.
bad,"horrible management within company, mean, rude, didn't care about their employees. My manager asked me one time why I didn't have someone else that could watch my kid when my babysitter was sick.."
bad,"•	Identified customer needs, and market appropriate products and services."
bad,"Do not waist your time. Do not go to work for Regions Bank. They are a regional bank headquartered in Alabama. Alabama maybe great at turning out college football championships, but you do not want them managing your money or having anything to do with your career."
bad,"AmSouth was sued and lost for deceptive business practices, but they didn't care.  They were consumed with sales at all costs - whether the customer knew and/or agreed to a product or not.  They say Regions is a different bank than AmSouth was, but..."
bad,"Regions acquired Union Planters bank in 2004 and Regions at that time was ok, it was large and the merger did not go very smoothly but overall it was a ok place to work. In 2006 AM South purchased Regions because AM South had a bad reputation and wanted a clean start. Once they took over things were worse yet because a lot of deposits went missing accounts did not come over correctly if at all. My regional manager left and asked me to follow her so I did."
bad,Dfw area for this bank seems to be a terrible place to work. The managers are hugely stressed and upper management is aware of all this stress that flows doen to the lower levels. Turn over is rampant and nobody stays in the retail side of banking. Things are probably different abd better outside of dfw. Beware the culture is toxic imho
bad,"Would NOT recommend I worked here for 2 years , there is NO room for advancement , ridiculous changes, and the job itself is just stressful due to the unfairness to the customers"
bad,My experience with this company was horrific...the work load was overwhelming and expectations totally unrealistic. I would not recommend this company.
bad,It was a terrible bank to work for. Management lies to you and promises everything to you but never delivers. They did not want to help you and there was no such thing as team
bad,Working for Regions is one of the biggest mistakes I’ve made in my who entire life.  It’s so bad I don’t even wanna go in to details. Like all I can say is if you don’t have to apply here keep moving.
bad,That place was all about numbers. They did not care about their employees. We worked so hard and never felt like any of our work was appreciated. I would not recommend working there.
bad,"I worked for Regions bank for 9 years and each year it seem to have gotten worst. There were constant changes. They would tell us it was for the better then months later it affected employees in the worst way. The pay raises were minimal, if you even got a raise. They wanted us to force customers to open accounts, apply for loans, or credit card even if we knew the customer was on a fixed income. I loved what I did, I just didn't feel appreciated. Being in Management with this company was the worst decision I could have made."
bad,"Regions has a good training standard, but management lacks. Working for Regions was truly a dragging experience. When i first started working at Regions i thought it was a great job, then once the newness wears off, you start feeling like everyone is against you. You are trained to put people first, help, do what is right, but then when you perform all of these tasks, you get questioned by your superiors as to why didn't you make a sale, why did you not do this and that. If you are not a strong sales person, this job is not for you. They only like people that makes sales, and they do not care how you do it, just make sure you stay within your lane while doing it. The working morale was terrible, you would have seniors constantly breathing down your necks, it was truly the hardest experience i have ever had, I loved all of my customers and took care of all of my customers because they are the reason I had a job, but quickly it turned out to be every man for himself, no true support and no one you could go to, to help you. Waking up every day knowing that I had to enter the building was dreadful. I did not look forward to coming to work, i did not enjoy it, it was the worst work experience ever, I rather work at a gas station, which I have and had a much better work experience."
bad,I felt that it was a sweat shop with low ability for advancement and low pay. I would not recommend people to work there just for those reasons also I don't feel they are honest
bad,Horrible. Drama. They encourage the back stabbing environment. They show favoritism .i would not recommend this   Company or worrk environment to anyone
bad,"management did not take care of employees. Was promised a lot and nothing was ever followed through.  Was not told of sales requirements before taking the position.  "
bad,Banking environment has evolved and Sr. Management of Regions was not able to change and stay competitive during my tenure. The culture of the bank needs to be upgraded.
bad,"Management was untrustworthy, bias and unprofessional. A typical day was slow with low business. The employee morale was stressful. Hardest part of the job was working with out dated technology."
bad,"The Arab location of Regions Bank was unfriendly and unprofessional.  However, the Guntersville and both Albertville locations are WONDERFUL.  I would recommend those branches to anyone who is seeking employment.  But not at the Arab location."
bad,I honestly can say this place is not a good place to work for its very stressful and not only that that turn over is bad here. Managers are so micromanaging and its all about sales they make it seem like its about helping customers but in the real life its not its about product pushing and sales that's all they care about you have goals you have to meet that are very impossible. if you don't meet them you will get fired. They coach you in a very negative way. This place is a joke tellers have goals to meet that they don't get anything out of it I would never ever recommend anyone to work here your managers and the higher people up there are a joke they don't care about you as an employee they care about you getting them money they push you to the limits and comes to the point you will hate this place. they make you different from successful people if your not successful they will treat you differently and make you feel dump. I regret leaving my previous work place it was nothing like this. Lesson learned you go trough all this trainings to make you a better banker but in reality its more on how to make a sale to your customer and how to not accept NO for an answer there is a lot more I could say this is not even half of what this place is!
bad,Worst 12 month of my banking career by far the worst working environment unethical pressured sales environment productivity and profit come before customer just all around bad company
bad,"Regions is an alright place to work. It is very sales oriented though. You do have goals and you are expected to meet these goals. Benefits are decent, pay is not."
bad,They seriously need help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They do not know how to treat their people. They under pay their people and severely over work them. They hold them to unrealistic goals which brings a lot of pressure and strain on work life and home life. Overall they are not a good company to work for.
bad,poor poor supervisors. poor poor management. high driven sales tactics. thieves. poor customer service. treated customers poorly and very unfairly. robbers.
bad,"I worked in a call center. The automated dialer that calls out get you cussed out by ""courtesy calls"". Customers are allowed 14 grace days before a late charge. We were forced to call out on 3rd of each month as ""courtesy reminder calls"" as this was part of ""incentive of 400 a month"". Management was never helpful. Lack of growth. When I hired on, I was told 30000 was potential if you get you ""call volume"". No one ever mentioned a QA score of 90 and above with it or I'd stayed where I was. Supervisors and management showed partiality terrible."
bad,"After the merger it was not the same company, policy change and work became just about selling and not giving any educational reasoning behind giving the customers unwanted product."
bad,"I just put in my 2 week notice from this exact position. The Manager will interview you and tell you anything to get you in the door and once your there. Your just numbers to her. She has no consideration for her employees and there their lives and family. Typical day consist of, get there go AVAILABLE (answer phones) then call customers that have had their credit pulled by other lenders and ask if whats going on and tell them anything to refinance them they Regions. (These people are already fed up of REGIONS so your call is not welcomed) Pretty much you have to get as many people to refinance and no amount of applications is ever enough to be appreciated.."
bad,I worked for this company for 6 months. The culture of not caring and the absolute lack of qualified leadership from the top was enough for me to take a pay cut and a demotion just to leave. Never have I worked for a company that has such little regard for their employees and clients. FYI: Once you put in your two weeks notice they fire you and stop payment of your salary that moment. I saw this several times.
bad,"I have been with the company since 2011, work at very productive branch and have had 3 managers and 3 branch service leaders.  After the second manager and service leader came in they totally turned  the branch upside down for the negative and the manager left within 2 yrs.  I have never worked under such stress and down grade before.  I have been in the business since 1992 and have never seen such a negative environment.  Defiantly not looking out for the fellow employee.  Recently received new management and soon a new branch service leader, hoping for a smoother environment for all."
bad,No one wants to take responsibility for anything wrong that happens in the IT department and spend more time passing the blame than actually getting anything accomplished. High stressful where the managers will wait at your desk when you get in the morning and yell at you. Breaks and Lunch is basically at will of management if too many calls in cue they will cut brakes and have you eat lunch while working and the same with going home you can't leave until all the calls are answered.
bad,"Absolutely the worst place to work for. Was misled at hire- get EVERYTHING in writing!"
bad,"No management skills, all management should be sent to training to learn interpersonal skills. Way to much gossiping within company, cannot trust company or employees."
bad,"Not pleased with the company....not fair to the employee. And  the managers need to be fully trained. I had one good and well trained manager the entire time I was with the company... the last manager was the very rude, disrespectful, and should not be in management at all."
bad,I enjoyed working with my peers and learning from them. I enjoyed coming to work to an happy environment. The most part I enjoyed about my job was training. I trained new hires on all functions of being an investigator or chargeback analyst.
bad,"A typical day for a teller includes processing customer transactions while pushing Regions products and services. Any down time is spent being coached on sales techniques. Regions encourages getting to know the customer to sell products and services and then associates are told to find ways to push those products to meet branch goals. Sales meetings are held in the morning and afternoon with check-ups throughout the day. If an associate is not meeting individual goals he can expect documented observations by management and written warnings. Unfortunately, this pressure often results in recommendation of products/services without a true regard for the customer's needs."
bad,"no advancement if I wasn't black, hired people because of their color instead of their qualifications, had observed many instances of favoritism because of color, including allowance of bringing a gun to work because she was afraid of the job area and was a single black woman...one manager would disqualify  you for your bonus if you were 15 minute late. !! this was often due to traffic in this area."
bad,I answer calls assisting with personal and business financial accounts. The management is the most unprofessional mangemebt teams I have ever had over me
bad,In my department we taking incoming calls for customer who's having issues with their online banking. We reset their ID and password and also give technical support if their having issues with their device. We also cross sell certain products that fits our customers needs.
bad,"Spent several years with the company trying to better myself seeking higher education only to be put out of work due to company merging with another over 3,000 people lost their jobs with the merger only to be given a small severance package cant rust financial corporations"
bad,Tellers take on great responsibilities but not well respected with low pay with little to no chance for opportunity or growth no programs to help you grow your career as a financial associate in Montgomery most of all the career positions have moved out of the city
bad,"Stills owes Government Billions in T.A.R.P.  If you enjoy pushing checking accounts onto people who can't handle the responsibility of managing an account to make insanely unreasonable sales quota then this is the place for you."
bad,president of regions in searcy area was very hateful to me personally.  he was always popping in my branch to see if I was doing something wrong.  when I wasn't there I would have to prove it to him I was on my sales calls. it was an awful place to be.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of management telling you to reach unrealistic goals, my head teller was always so stressed out, she was starting to take it out on employees and that's what led to me resigning.What I learned is that you can't sell products that will end up costing customers more in fees, and Regions basically wants you to do just that!If you cannot sell, don't work here.Even if you meet your goals,it's not guaranteed you will get anything for all your hard work. My co-workers were pretty fun (when the management team didn't stress us the hell out). I didn't like their managing skills. I worked for First National Bank in Texas and I never had a write up or meetings with managers like I did at regions. It was all just a ""big me, little you"" job. The hardest part of the job...is actually enjoying it...it's way too stressful and the managers didn't set good examples. They would give attitude when it came to customers and that was just unprofessional.The most enjoyable part of my job was taking care of my customers and building relationships with them. Overall, I can honestly say that it was a lesson learned...working for Regions showed me that I deserve so much better!!!!"
bad,"Regions used to be an incredible place to work for. Sadly, after the merge with Amsouth, this company took a turn to the worst. It became a nightmare for the employee."
bad,"Upper Management and some branch management treat all staff as slaves...  need to do what is said with out asking questions.  Sell, Sell, Sell and Defraud, Defraud, Defraud.  Customers are not treated equally from branch to branch because each branch manager has his/her special favorite customers.  Sell all products to customers even if its not what they need,,,  The fees are money in the bank for the bank!!!!  "
bad,"Does not pay well for the expected duties.  With no previous teller experience, I was put into a supervisory key holder position within a few months and made responsible for the vault all without extra compensation.  I was made to take 2 hour lunches so they could work me from 7:45 until 5:30 almost everyday.  There was no reason for this after a full staff was hired, but yet kept doing it because I was a well performer.  The head teller took smoke breaks at least every hour, even when we were extremely busy with only 2 tellers on the line.  The management did nothing about this.  She was also never on the teller line.  When it came to her there was also a double standard, if she messed up it was swept under the rug, but if we did the same we were immediately written up.  I was written up for forgetting a password to one of the computer programs.  There is such a lack of communication.  The entire team of 6 tellers before I was hired quit around the same time.  After I left the teller hired a week before me also quit because nothing is being done about the operations in this place."
bad,"Feeding and processing the statements"
bad,"I worked for Regions for a year. My annual performance reivew was excellent/proficient and how was I compensated? With a 1.5% pay increase!!! That was a total slap in the face!! You will be micromanaged with someone constantly looking over your shoulder. There is a lot of inapproapriate behaviour between male and female manager. Brown-nosing will get you nowhere at this company. Unless you are management, you do not matter. You will be told you need to present an obituary if you have death in the family. You will be followed to the restroom. You will be written up for no reason if you try to transfer to another department, hence, hindering your transfer. Take a look at this job posting, for example, an entire shift was laid off a month ago. Instead of recalling laid off workers, they are hiring new ones and temporary workers. Yea, Regions really care about employees. You must work in silence...no talking unless you are on your break. Uh, excuse me? That last time I checked, I was an ADULT!!! You are threatened everyday with losing your job. Gave me high blood pressure which was never an issue before working there. They have no core values and are downright evil!!!! I'm glad I never have to work for them again!!!!"
bad,Management sucked! Human Resources sucked especially west tn market. Worse experience I ever had. Pay wasn't comparable to other banks they lead you on. File a workmans come claim
bad,be very weary of this company! look over turn over rates! problems of discrimination and more!
bad,"It was one of the worst places I have ever worked. They had a bad computer system that would not work half the time. They did not have enough tellers to cover the work load. They had people who did not know their job functions. They had bad hours, bad pay, and no benefits. Some of the customers were enjoyable and that's about all that I can say nice about that bank!"
bad,"If you are not in the click you will not last, the click is referred to as the ""wolf pack""  they bully, follow, hunt, and destroy for fun and hr believes them over you. Don't take it personal, just move on but watch your back."
bad,"Rushed training, manager steals your loans and clientsShe has her favorite banker and no one else on the team matters. Awful nightmare HR does nothing"
bad,"I was pressured into selling clients things they didn't need,  belittled for not sellingenough, and not given lunches because they refused to hire staff, even though we were very short."
bad,"To begin with, the management is very vindictive. If you are not sucking up you will have trouble on your hands.  The bank no longer cares about their employees, only about numbers.  When there is a problem; both the employee and customers are left frustrated.  No one knows what to do when there is a problem.  There is no diversity in the branches. Regions does not look at your skills, loyalty, or how hard you work (good numbers) for a promotion; they just bring in a good ole family members with no banking skills. Many employees are let go because they did not meet their goals for maybe two quarters and many others never ever met their goals and are still there; they pick and choose who gets fired and who stays. Come on Regions Bank you need to do better...start with management..."
bad,"If you want to work somewhere where they tell you to do one thing, while also expecting you do the opposite; if you enjoy constantly being understaffed, belittled, underrated, and unheard; if you enjoy hearing about the core values of a company and then seeing them be completely disregarded, then this job is for you. The support of my fellow “inmates” was the only thing that got me through."
bad,Regions is not a great place to work. The management is awful. They gossip and talk ugly about everyone that works there. The managers i had will go in each other’s offices and not even take customers but just have a little conversation for an hour. Regions also does not pay fairly. The bonuses aren’t worth your time and effort of making regions richer. The accounts also aren’t that great and fees are ridiculous. Their atms never work. Half the time they are so short staffed that you don’t get lunch breaks but managers somehow still end up getting to take a lunch break.
bad,"Less micro-managers (Regional Managers) and more teachers!  Ensure your higher ups do not come into the branches so on edge every day that their presence alone instantly disrupts the entire Branch team. I accepted my job in the Albany Office as Branch Manager because it is what I have always loved to do. Banking was my passion, allowed me to pursue and achieve my dreams for the past 35 years. It was at the Regeny Branch and approximately 8 miles from my home. Serving people and helping them achieve their own financial success was reward enough for me. Walking away was hard to but at that moment I didn't see any other way out."
bad,"Changes upon changes are leaving Regions perpetually short staffed with frustrated customers and overwhelmed employees. I did not feel valued at all there, and simple requests would be shot down without even a thought. There is no work/life balance- Regions want to be our everything. I'm just glad to be done."
bad,not worth the review and not a company that I would recomment that anyone works for on a serious basis. The culture seems very racist whites against blacks or other cultures. just not a good company to work for wish I would have never applied. i don't like them.
bad,Regions Bank the company itself have great values and morals; however working within the contact center the value of their employees tremendously fall due to the management.  Bankers or micro managed from restroom breaks to personal time.  There is no room for growth and when it comes to the bank policies the contact center will find away around it to benefit their team.  Needless to say if you are a robot pushing 500 sales points each month they love you .  This by far was the worst company I have EVER worked for.
bad,From my experience I was not given the necessary guidance and truing that I needed to succeed in the company. Management was non existent and I felt I had no choice other than to put my two weeks notice in in order to further my career at another organization the will give me the opportunity to grow and advance.
bad,Working for regions bank is not all that I thought it would be. They get you in the door and give false promises of what the job actually consist of. Also the pay does not go with the responsibility given.
bad,"I love working with my customer, however now the organization is more concern with making money off of the customer instead of helping them.  So I go to work with to thoughts each morning how not to get robbed and how to get fees from customers"
bad,"Customer service at Regions is a highly hard core sales job. Agents must push all products to incoming customer calls most customers simply want a balance but the position demands you sell products and list the benefits or you will be written up Supervisors lack knowledge and are unfair. Management is not a open door policy. "
bad,"If you are great at selling then it may be the place for you.  But watch your back if you have a disagreement with management they will find any and everything to write you up and get rid of you.  I had a disagreement with the Manager at the branch I was at and the CSM made it look like she was doing me a favor and sending me to a different to make me happy when all of the time she was sending me to this failing branch to have a reason to fire me.  If you are not 100% of you referrals (sales).  they will give you a written warning. after the 3rd you get fired.  they call it referrals but if the customer does not open the product you do not get credit.  and If someone else has keyed within 90days of them opening the product they get the referral not you.  and Management all the way to the CSM do not know what is right and what is wrong.  They do not train you how to do things once you start working they just tell you to do it and if you mess up then you get in trouble.  one last thing, If they fire you for any reason they will lie to try to keep you from getting Unemployment."
bad,"This used to be a great place to work but it is going down hill quickly. Managed constantly by intimidation and fear. Threats for meeting unrealistic goals. Values and mission statement are not at all promoted here. Rediculous turn over rate, like I've never seen before!"
bad,"Invested 5 years of my life with this company and the best thing I got from it is the pension and 401k when I left. Managers are abusive with their power, overworked and under paid. They tell you to follow the chain of command but the chain is a rusty, raggedy, trifling chain of people who stick up for each other against you and then turn around and back stab each other. YOU WILL WISH YOU NEVER WORKED THERE!!! Believe me!"
bad,Horrible company and management  would not recommend  no appreciation for employees or customers  horrible policies that do not keep best interests of customers in mind no room for advancement
bad,"You will be frozen in position unless in ThE CLICK,  even if courses completed ."
bad,If you aren't a manager or on the phones you get no appreciation at all. They are not understanding of any situation and management will do whatever they please but you better not dare mess up or do anything that they dislike they are quick to throw you under the bus to make them look good. All they care about is money money money
bad,"my was an ok place to work, I didn't agree with a lot of thinbgs Regions did as a whole,I was laid off after 5 years with the company,Regions cared about making numbers no so much the employees"
bad,Every day was a horrible day walking into work with one lady being there for 26 years she got her way or would make you pay. Manager never knew the answer to anything and she was very narcissistic and rude. Bare minimum training and then you’re thrown out to the wolves. They would do shady banking for people they knew. We would have to call random customers and harass them over and over again to push products. It was a TOTAL NIGHTMARE!!!
bad,"Everything changed with exception of the bank name.  They cut staff to the bare minimum, opened on Saturdays, extremely high sales goals, publically shamed and threatened if you didnt meet them.  The environment is extremely unhealthy.  If you have any other options, dont take this one.  Everyone that worked there when I did has left."
bad,PEOPLE FIRST does not apply to employees and lots of time does not apply to customer- they keep business understaffed and do not want to pay overtime.
bad,They don’t promote within they hire from the outside then make those whom they could have given the job to train them.  They have this policy if you don’t meet your goals you get written up. After 3 write ups your terminated.
bad,"It was a nice bank when I started my banking career but every time the bank was sold, working conditions got worse, they didn't care about their employees and all the work they were doing."
bad,Dont work for them they have favortism and treat everyone else badly. There ate cliques and nanagement at several of the sw florida branches would degrade you in front of customers. I cried every night and every morning going there. Im so glad i left.
bad,"They do not care about their employees. They have poor training, no resources to assist you with doing your job-s well, and judge you in whichever light is worst whether as a branch, or as an individual, to keep you from personal or monetary gain."
bad,You have to know someone to move up in the company. If you are not on the managers favorite list they do not support you. Management is not supportive if you are not brown nosing them.
bad,"Not an over healthy working environment for families. I could not get approved personal leave time while out sick after presenting all Dr. documentations I had, Regions still wanted more.  Just an overall horrible experience."
bad,"The pay is great, that's about it. So, if that's all you are looking for, this is the place for you.  If you value your sanity and self respect, I would recommend elsewhere."
bad,"Let me start.  They tell you that there are no goals.  But oh!  Wait!  there is what they call PSPM and BMPM.  You get written up for not meeting goals.  15k Min for a Banker and 700 points for a manager.  yes! they rate you on points or you get a write up.  Smells like Wells Fargo.  They call it business as usual if you make the minimum.  They have this thing called needs based sales conversations, but it is more like need to meet sales conversations.  But my favorite part the local HR calls themselves HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGERS,  more like HUMAN CATTLE MANAGERS.  Put people first is their value,  but it is more like put Regions First.  Local Management wants  YES people,  and if you share an idea you are frowned upon.  Stay away from this place."
bad,The management in particularly in the Jacksonville area is absolutely terrible. In less than a year almost the entire staff resigned from the St Augustine branch location due to the Branch and Regional Managers.
bad,"The turn over rate at Regions (locally) is ridiculous. We had 3 managers in 1 year. Their is a revolving door for bankers and tellers as well. You have ""goals"" that if are not met, you are reprimanded for. The goals are completely unrealistic for the market. The branches never make their group goals, thus never get payouts. Upper management is a joke. They show up only when there is a huge problem. And don't even bother to contact HR when something is amiss. One of my worst work experiences ever!"
bad,"It was a very stressful and unorganized.  Management was difficult to work with.  The saving grace was the supervisor and other employees that were like family.  All in all, the friendships made were worth the stress!"
bad,The company does not care about the management.  Senior level leadership is only focused on making money and not working to devolp advancement
bad,"Regions does not care about their employees at all. You are not safe no matter how long you have worked for the company. There are too many people to answer to. I worked in 2 branches that employed 5 people and had 3 supervisors in each branch. They also place really unqualified people in management. I had a supervisor who stayed a supervisor even after repeated complaints, constant tardiness, and sloppy appearance. I have watched this company dwindle and make poor choices for three years. This company also refuses to stand behind their own policies when a customer complains and will then punish the employee for doing their job. What a shame."
bad,"They make you push products om customers when they dont want them.Management does not care about you. This is what my manager told me verbatim ""I DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS. ALL I CARE ABOUT IS WHAT IS IN BLACK IN WHITE"". After I was told that I resigned from the company. I feel that there is a lot of prejudice in the work place. The pay was good but the high stress everyday was not worth it. Please think about what is important to you before you apply for a job with Regions Bank"
bad,"There is a lot of micromanaging. They only want you to sell, to the point that it is unethical. You will be a telemarketer in this position."
bad,"Horrible place to work, the job is not as described, encourage getting over on customers, very stressed and intense work place."
bad,"They are all about what you do today and tomorrow, yesterday matters very little.  Management seems to be people who haven't moved on to something better and are micro managed.  You are so far removed from anyone who has the power to affect change.  If you are motivated and hungry you may want to go elsewhere."
bad,"Absolutely, no communication to employees. I would compare the office polotics to be as bad as high school."
bad,They are in great need of better HR   It was a complete nightmare working for them.  Unlike any place I have ever worked  you will eat every single penny and you as salary will come out to about 6.00 an hour
bad,"The only good thing I have to say about this company is that you get a fair amount of holidays off. Other than that there's not much else I can say. I have been with the company for over 2 years now and my location has stayed overworked and understaffed the whole time I've been employed. There's no reason why one branch doesn't receive help from a fellow branch when they are understaffed, but the second any other branch needs help that branch is expected to help and make their own branch understaffed further."
bad,"They act like its a 100k a year job and yet its not, so under staff and having to cover others jobs, which in turn you cant do yours. Having to compete against my manager and she gets paid off what I do."
bad,"Regions executives are a joke. So is most of upper management. My personal critique is poor job work/ life balance. However the reason I quit is being lied it. "
bad,They only care about sales. If you're a banker they expect you to make cold calls day. The leads are terrible and stale. There pay is decent. management  is a joke.
bad,They just want you doing cold calls ALL day. Literally demand you follow a robotic script and call the same people every day. Comp set up is ridiculous. JUST DON'T DO IT. WORK SOMEWHERE ELSE. Someone quits at least once a month.
bad,"Stress to meet goals, Calls, meetings. I never could please management, always wanted more. Management had favorites, that they always helped more than the employees that deserved it"
bad,"The pay is ok, goals are hard to reach depending on the branch. If you don’t like to cold call this is not the job for you. I believe this would be a great company to work for if it wasn’t for management. There are favorites and if they can’t control you they will try and replace you. If you Brown nose you will be fine."
bad,I worked for regions for over 2 years. Upon them raising everyone to 15$ they decided to let me go for some bogus excuse. Yes I admit I refused to wait on a lady because it was against police to disclose information to a non account holder. A coworker who thinks she is all high and mighty called HR and made up some story how I wouldn’t wait on her because she was a lady of color. Needless to say they let me go stating I was a racist. When I asked to see the videos from that day regions refused telling me it was no. Of my business to view them (red flag right there).  I then asked for a separation notice which they stated they don’t give out ( red flag number 2 as it is the law). I did file for unemployment knowing regions back was being discriminatory themselves. When the state unemployment office asked for proof to there allegations Regions bank could not furnish them with it as they had none (red flag number 3). Long story short Regions bank plays favorites and it all depends on how much you kiss the managers butt and not how well you preform your job and follow the rules.
bad,"Answering phone and pressuring customer's in a up sale of bank product. After receiving a call, you must scan the customer's account while they're talking to see what other products you could possible cross sell before the call ended."
bad,The company model in the call center was all work no play. You were expected to grind grind with no other incentives. The goals were constantly increased but the money stays the same.
bad,The company makes change with no regard from employees. They are not aware of how the system is working nor do they evaluate the effectiveness of the process. They have been pedaling the same success story which was probably fluff to prove the value in the change nobody including the Area leadership truly believes in the process.
bad,Upper management could care less about their associates & only care about Executives.  Have been there 20 years & was terminated by a horrible manager & a horrible HR Dept.
bad,Bare minimum staffing.
bad,"The workload is tedious and strenuous, the manager doesn't know annnnnything she calls human resource for everything. The pay is horrrrrrible!!!!!!!!!"
bad,It is such a big company that information does not get delegated properly. Support is limited. High turnover-I've had 3 managers in less than a year. Any chance of promotion will require relocation.
bad,"This use to be a good place to work but over the last two years it has became the worst working environment.  New manager is uncaring and non supportive. If you are someone who likes to be micro managed, then you will love this place.  Unrealistic goals, duplicate reporting, constant debriefing, under staffed while they expect you to wear 7 different hats at once.  The first door of opportunity that opens can’t come fast enough!!!!  There is so much turnover here that customers are asking questions why people don’t stay."
bad,"Regions is a very sales oriented environment, cloaked in the guise of providing a great customer experience. Management appears to be floundering, without a clear direction or focus."
bad,"New management direction does not flow towards a good road to be placing customers, stockholders nor associates.  They are treading on very dangerous waters."
bad,"Your normal day at Regions Bank as a teller is to process transactions while selling products (or speak benefit language?!) and services to the customers. You will complete deposits, cash checks, getting balances, cash advance..etc. Selling products and reaching your HIGH sales goal is their top priority. Doesn't matter if the same customers you work with has been going to your branch for over 25 years, your teller leader or manager will ask you to brainstorm ways to persuade your customer to get any other product that the customer doesn't have. This can become frustrating and old... especially in slower locations."
bad,"Bad experience, Bad Structure, Heavy turnover in staff.  No respect and areas of growth for promotion.  Many people were thrown under the bus."
bad,"You do not want to work at Regions in Anderson, SC. Regions as a company is great. Local management in Anderson, not so much. They show favoritism, make up their own rules, and get away with it. You are not allowed to disagree with them or question their authority. If you do, they will find a way to get rid of you. Steer clear of this location."
bad,Do not apply for a position in Upstate SC. You won't be happy.
bad,"Management that makes in the six figures works the out of lower paid employees. They say that they coach but, not really in my experience. You do many jobs for little pay."
bad,"Regions Financial Corporation (Regions Bank) is the worst place I've had the misfortune of being employed. Management does not value their employees in any way, shape or form. They don't care about your health and well-being even when you consistently go above and beyond your job duties. There is no real training to the job, you are just thrown into the position and expected to exceed. No support from management, just blank looks when you ask questions to better yourself. Very juvenile atmosphere - passive aggressive treatment from management."
bad,Learning banking and meeting good contacts while able to promote self
bad,North La District Manager very nice and fair-enjoyed working for her.  Some local branch managers watch your back.  Fair compensation would have been great place to work other than direct branch manager was very immature and always causing problems within the branch.
bad,This used to be a really great company to work for that truly cared about its employees and customers.  This couldn’t be farther from the truth now.  It’s all about unattainable sales goals that can increase in the middle of a quarter with no warning.  Making a ridiculous amount of telemarking calls.  Benefits are mediocre and the pay is below average especially for the “activities” they expect of you.  Very disappointing
bad,Unrealistic goals and if you succeed they will change the goals higher so you can make more and expect more from you. Also the job is not a secure job they will let you go in a heartbeat if you are planning to make this job for long-term it is not a good job for long-term and no place for advancement
bad,"It was extremely difficult to close a loan on time, which affects income. Making a living depends on closing loans on time, with all departments working together"
bad,Management is poor. At the location that I work for the manager displayed egotistical tendencies. Our team was micro managed at 15 minute intervals. Our daily huddles were full of contradictions. Time to complete mandatory training was offered but rarely provided.
bad,Unfortunately Regions operate on the buddy system. If you have or know people in upper management they will move you up in the company whether you are the best candidate or not. They diffidently don't like it if your knowledgeable because that is a challenge for them(remember they were hired by their buddy they really don't know the job)
bad,"I used to love my job, but after being promoted and moving branches I can't wait to leave. My manager who is well loved by his superiors has ran off 3 people in my position in the past year."
bad,A very Laid back culture. Regions has poor management and poor HR consultants in the SC/GA region. Not very diverse and it's not competitive wot other financial companies.
bad,"Stay far away from this place."
bad,Worked for this company 2 times. It is a great company but the management is not so great. Never could make Manager happy with any goal that was met. Manager was also gone all the time. Never could stay in office to manage the place. Not a great choice for job. Manager also plays favorites. Whoever could cover for him/her got special treatment. Referral goal was unreal to achieve.
bad,"When they bring you in you go through their process OJT, everything seems so wonderful and positive. But when you get on the floor and start working totally different. Managers very immature and like who they do and they get special treatment. They will literally scream at you across the whole dept. at you! if on the fence, DO NOT DO IT!"
bad,"Management only looked out for themselves. Harsh environment that did not foster internal growth. Negotiates well with salary, but misuses sick/vacation time to the detriment of employees."
bad,"The training focuses heavily on customer service but after training is completed sales are greatly emphasized on the floor. The supervisiors listen to phone calls, perform 1 on 1s and literally jump down your thoarts to meet sales goals. You are written up if you do not meet a certain thereshold, in which your sales points are based on the customer's actions(ie if you get a credit card application you will not receive sales points unless the customer uses the card, not activate but USE). The team leaders and managers are inconsistent with policy and they tell employees personal business to one another.If you love to sell to customers who already have no funds in there accounts(alot of overdraft refund request)and wait until the end of the month for a taxed ""incentive"" check then this job is for you. The contact center also has an terrible inclement weather policy... If you call in during bad weather you are forced to use vacation time or sick time instead having the option of not been paid for the day. Phone codes are tracked and you can get docked for being a minute late no exceptions.All Ims and screen usage are recorded as well.Starting pay is not based upon experience and low annual raised are giving depending on how your team leader thinks you performed.Many tenture associates(5-10 yrs) are in their same starting postions, they give a lot of promotions but up to a certain level(Team Leader is about the highest you will ever get)  most opportunities are located in Birmingham(headquarters) or Penscola. Good stepping stone job. Good Luck!"
bad,I took my positon with no prior experience in banking. The training provided is incomplete compared to the goals set for the position. Management is very closed door despite proclaiming otherwise.
bad,A lot of meetings pertaining to ever growing sales goals.  In the branches you work with a wonderful group of people but everyone is looking for better pay after they gain experience from the company.  The higher ups are not in touch with the branch level people.  They make goals exceedingly hard so you can not obtain them.  This does not help with morale. The enjoyable part of the day is working with customers and helping them reach their goals.
bad,"It doesn’t matter how great you are at your job. You are merely a set of statistics... how many referrals you provide, how many credit cards you open, how much you do in loan volume, how much phone solicitation you do per day.... When I first started they genuinely cared about the employees. That all changed in 2018. Complete role restructure."
bad,Dont work there!! They are goal driven and if you dont meet there goals you are written up.This company sucks!! They treat the employees good at first then it gets horrible after a few months
bad,Low paying entry level position (bank teller) with no upward mobility. Management expects too much out of tellers who basically do everything for little pay.
bad,"very stressful. many daily conference to check on how many widgets you have sold, if not acceptable, then what changes are you making, etc  upper management needs to provide assistance"
bad,"You will sell products that doesn’t benefit the customer, if not look foreword to be written up. It’s very stressful. Management is horrible and unfair."
bad,"Pros Great place to work fun environment."
bad,I wish to not speak ill of the company I work for. I was put into a position where we have been understaffed for months. Many changes that have not been well thought out.
bad,"I would not recommend this business. It was shamefully ran. As long as THEY are making money, you're good. If they weren't, your job/life was miserable."
bad,Dealing with customer issues and processing application for credit. Giving out balances and discussing account information and opening accounts. Trainings and staying current with banking policies and procedures. Opening accounts mostly
bad,"I worked here for literally 2-3 weeks. The head teller was extremely rude, & the branch manager was even worse. I got in trouble for not saying ""regions"" 3 times in a conversation. The head teller hated it when you talked to each other. HR was awful as well. Instead of fixing a problem, they would make it worse by only hearing one side & then going with that. There had been a lot of turnover at this location....if you have so much turnover, you need to look into management!!"
bad,"Not a good working environment. I would not recommend anyone to work there. The typical day starts at 8:00am. Co workers are under tremendous pressure from the managers. The hardest part of the job was having to answer all day long to where are you, what have you done. What can you do to get to goal. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction knowing that I was helping people achieve their financial goals!"
bad,"Upon being hired for this company, I was told that there was ""some"" customer calling and asked if that would be an issue.  Of course I didn't think it would be because banks I had worked for in the past had always called customers for phone number verifications and things like being overdrawn .  No.  They want you to TELEMARKET products over the phone under the guise of wanting to give ""advice, guidance, and education"".  And if you don't get at least 30 contacts in, well, that is unacceptable. They do not care about their customers.  Only how much debt you can get someone in.  I was flat out told by a CSM that if I think someone looks as though they can't get approved, cut the time with the customer and move them out so I can get to the next customer who looks like they will be approved.  If the branch is shorthanded, most times you don't get a lunch or you have to eat in between customers if you can and you CANNOT have overtime.  I was denied the ability to take my sick days for my scheduled doctor appointments.  I wasn't even allowed to go to 5 doctor visits because the manager came up with various reasons for me not to be able to take off.  Telling HR was like talking to a wall. More often than not, she never replied.  "
bad,"I don't usually do reviews but I definitely had to take out the time for this particular position. Most people that mentioned this company is awesome may have worked at smaller branches that only serviced low volume of customers. I worked at one of the busiest branches here in local Jackson area of Ms. I have never worked so hard and never been so stressed in my life. I actually left and took a pay cut. I was only making $25,000. Pressure is placed on you when your staff meets less expectations. You are not expected to make mistakes. Regions is big on customer service and performs many random calls to customers on recent visits to the branch. Some customers may not even like your service and you may have done your very best. You will get a low customer service score. You will get chewed out for this. Regions is also big on meeting quarterly sales. There have been days where some staff members were in meeting, on vacation, or absent because of sickness and I remember the times where I ran both drive thru and front window during busy times and sometimes all day none stop. Not only that but while u r running the line, you are expected to finish a lot of paperwork. I really can go on and on. But I wouldn't dare go back to this position unless they start me with no less than $40,000.00. Other than that stay away from this job."
bad,Working for this company is way more stressful than it should ever be. Change is inevitable but “rules & policies” change every other week and are different at every single branch. There is a MAJOR disconnect through the whole company from top management to corporate offices to local branches. In the branches all they care about is hitting astronomical sales goals and just keep threatening to fire you if you don’t reach you goals. And they threaten to fire you everyday if you break the rules and policies that Chang every week. Only good thing is bankers hours and good benefits package. NOT worth the stress
bad,The job itself is great minus the low pay. Management was atrocious and she acted like a dictator instead of a boss or even a manager.  Played favorites to the side with finanancing and the cash line was always last to be thought or or taken care of. The manager would take tons of time off and never tell anyone wouldn't keep people updated on if people were going to be missing and little to no support in your affairs in the office or out. The manager would put on a great show for her boss gene he visited to act like she was a team player even though she could care less. Most stessful job I have ever had and I have worked in corrections before
bad,"During training they painted this pretty picture of what working for Region's is like.... They value customer service. They wanna help you succeed. They offer all these great benefits... Then you get on your teams and realize this company is a joke. It's all about making money. Everyone is clicked up like they're in highschool. There is no professionalism whataoever. There is nonstop drama and tattletailing. Your supervisors really don't serve a purpose. They spend most of their time playing on their phones avoiding taking escalated calls. The environment is extremely stressful. I get cussed out on a daily basis by customers and you literally have to just sit there and take it. They give you paid vacation and sick time after 30 days but you have to bid on time off and most days are marked off as ""doctor note"" days. The pay is about the only thing this company has going for them. I seriously cannot find another job fast enough!!!"
bad,This is a ok company to work for. Depending on what department you work in depends on how well they follow rules. My experience was not a very good experience towards the end. The company did not follow guidelines.
bad,"Learned multiple aspects of banking. I started as a teller, then loan processing, mortgage processing, research and reconciliation. I enjoyed learning as much as I did but the pay is very low."
bad,Every position will become Universal by the end of 2018 in the bank branches except management. Regions is also cutting positions so you are expected to do the work of 2 people for the pay of 1 person.
bad,"Some day on the phone is slow and some day are very very heavy but over all its all good, good people and good team work, do different function routinely following up on request, and im bless to have a job.  Thank you."
bad,"Do not care for their employees, a lot of changes that only benefit the company. They dont strive to promote internals. The company is truly inconsistent with how fair they treat their employees"
bad,Branch Managers don't know how to run their respective location. They are only employed because of longevity or the fact the the CBM is comfortable with them.
bad,"They harp on banker integrity, yet do things within the company in regard to bonus structure that promotes a lack of integrity within the bankers.  I lost a bonus due to a thing called ""fund-downs"".  If a customer lets their balance fall below the minimum required opening amount, the banker will lose the points that designate their bonus."
bad,"Fast pace with an urgency to resolve issues. I learned that the key to fast, quick and accurate resolutions lie within a great knowledge base of data notating past issues and resolutions."
bad,If you looking for a job and nothing more than Regions is a good place for you.  They suffer from a lack of ingenuity and acceptance of new ideas. Manager was never able to articulate job expectations nor willing to provide a work environment which promoted good employees.
bad,"The pressure is unreal. The goals are unrealistic. I've  seem people in management positions develop serious health conditions from developing heart conditions, blood pressure, and nervous problems. You get threats instead of praise from upper mgmt."
bad,A typical day at work can be stressful due to poor management. I learned that companies of this size should find the root of there problem before hiring any other employees.
bad,all they care about is profit and money customers can harass you and be rude to you but management will not step up for you if you're applying for this job get ready to go home feeling miserable everyday. they're very sales orientated  if you dont meet your unrealistic goals you WILL GET talked down to and they will remind you everyday that your job is on the line.
bad,"Our Business Banking team of nine in the Fort Worth area worked great together. Unfotunately, problems with underwriting in Birmingham, AL came up and it became harder and harder to get loans completed. Eventually, our team parted ways one at a time."
bad,Working for Regions Bank the last 3 years out of 10 was terrible. Poor management. Very high turn over rate. The working environment was very uncomfortable.
bad,I would not recommend this employer to anyone that cannot handle extreme stress and pressure to sale in difficult situations. Pressure is also placed to make sales or risk lose of employment.
bad,"Asked my manager to try to be uplifting instead of being negative all the time because some people can’t learn in a negative way. No acknowledgment to my email it was a reply to a good job message after criticism the day before."
bad,"My manager is the worst."
bad,"I wish I never join the company, managers wanted to know ever personal business and thing going on in your life. Which they had the most nastiest attitudes I have ever seen, always mad and took their anger out on the employees. Business couldn’t be kept personal, if you told the manager something that’s going on with you everyone in the department will know."
bad,Policy does not apply to everyone. Some people can do what they want with no discipline. Others are written up. Just depends on what your position is.
bad,Local district manager provided almost zero support.  On my second day I was told i needed to figure out a way to get rid of another employee.  She was never around.
bad,Pressure and sales.  Horrible work environment.  Do not recommend this place customers are very unhappy as well and you are stuck in the middle and told to take responsibility for their horrible policies.
bad,"Not my cup of tea by any means. Im not a sit at a desk type of worker, so i didnt have the greatest time while i was there. thats all"
bad,"I enjoyed my training period in the Mandeville branch but once I started in Covington I was very unhappy. The employees at the Covington are upright, snooty, and hypocritical. The pay was not very good either. Lunch is only 30-45 min and on a very busy why so once you get your food you have to eat it in the car on the way back and hurry to clock back in."
bad,"I was a part time teller. Did not have benefits. "
bad,"They have high goal aspirations that are not attainable with the competition in the area. They need new management that is not a know it all and will let you do your job without his/her influence because he/she likes an employee too much,."
bad,A typical day at work would be preparing my desk for the day ahead. I learned more about sales and service. The management had some lack in communication and a lot of preference over performance. My co-workers were helpful and I had a positive experience working with them. The hardest part of my job was leaving different offices constantly. The most enjoyable part of my job was going to work and getting my work day started.
bad,"High turnover rate at the location I worked. Management changed every other month for almost 2 years. Long term employees were rude and disrespectful. Hated working with them."
bad,"I gave Regions low ratings due to poor management, low salary and the lack of on the job training received to be the best at your job.  There's very minimal opportunities for advancement even though there are positions available.  There's a high turnover mostly due to the company's failure to promote from within.  I accepted a lower salary with a promise to move up and receive higher compensation which was never fulfilled. I recommend anyone wanting to work for this company to negotiate your salary on the front-end.  We wear many hats, and the pay does not match the work required.  I have not received overtime pay for my overtime hours worked, due to what they term being ""salaried, but hourly.""  The bonuses are not great compared to other banks either.  It's difficult to advance without a manager's referral, which often works towards the manager's benefit, such as in my case."
bad,This company was a hindrance on their customers. Tellers and customer services reps were not allowed to let them walk away with out pushing products on them. If we didn't we would get sent to classes to better ourselves. The company only seemed to care about how much money they could collect from their customers.
bad,"Life-depleting environment. Dysfunctional at best. The Contact Center makes you question your worth, no money to be made as long as you are under this umbrella."
bad,"Policy is ever changing to benefit the company. Not service oriented, but great at portraying that image. Everyone places blame elsewhere. No opportunity for advancement unless you KNOW the right people. Your advancement is not based on your overall job knowledge or qualifications, based upon how you benefited your previous manager. Ultimately if your manager doesn't want you to move forward you won't. No matter if you qualify or not. They don't care about their employees or health. Anyone who recently worked there knows what I am talking about."
bad,"Many, many promises made by regional management and were broken.  I was left without a manager for 5 months and no assistance was provided to me by the fill in manager.  If i hadnt had previous banking experience it would have been a nightmare.  All training is done online except for some sales trainig, thus, showing that the bank really still is primarily focused and focusing its employees behaviors around sales and putting compliance and operations second to that.  Very high tirnover and pay ranges that seem to be less than other banks."
bad,"Micro-managed down to bathroom breaks! People doing same job with less experience get paid more. Favoritism is obvious. Regions will lie to you, hire you for one job and then load more on you without anymore pay! Only place I have ever heard that has ""mandatory overtime"". You will never move through the ranks, DEAD END JOB!!"
bad,"Regions is an okay company to work for, but puts its employees in a position to do two skillset, and not compensate them for it.  Makes it mandatory to work 2 out of 5 Saturdays without overtime if a holiday falls within that week.  Will only give you time-off for bereavement three days, and if you have no sick time or vacation, you will be put on disciplinary action."
bad,"it was unorganized and customers were not put first. Spent more time trying to get the customer to sit down with a banker to add something to their account, instead of doing what the customer wants and putting the customer first."
bad,No room for advancement. Management likes to blame people for not being able to attract more people to open checking accounts. There was nothing special about the products they offered and they made a lot of their former customers very upset.
bad,"The company overall was constantly changing, there was no stability with the CSM, Branch managers compete with bankers to make sales goals. You can only advance if you are best friends with someone there, the morale of the whole bank is not as they convince you at orientation. they put themselves first not people. the stress is high to meet sales goals with low traffic branches. overall you have to solicit outside of the bank for sales and hope you get it. the turn around is high as well ."
bad,"Regions Bank had a small bank culture to make the customers feel appreciated and not like a number. However, after the AM South bank merger with Regions, the culture changed along with many other things that I feel, made the bank take some steps backwards."
bad,"The demands are too high compared to the system constraints. It's basically manual underwriting and inputting your manual conditions into the system one by one. The guidelines are either outdated, don't pull up, or just not followed. The decisions made by upper management clearly indicate lack of understanding and sales rules here...even over quality."
bad,"If you don't have a life then this is the right place to work. You have to work as a manager over 65 hours per week unpaid because as a salary person we don't get pay overtime. You need to meet your goal and killing yourself doing it, so at the end of the quarter they find the way to manipulated incentives so they don't pay you. My experienced there was horrible, stressful, and wear me out. Executive do not appreciated their staff and how hard people work. My recommendation *DO NOT WORK THERE*"
bad,"Regions is a very sales oriented bank, pushing employees more than necessary to reach sales goals. It makes interactions with customers uncomfortable and when I was not reaching my goals (which were nearly impossible) I would be berated and treated poorly. My branch went through employees like a fat kid goes through cake (5 coming and leaving in the year that I was there) and most of this has to do with poor management decisions and poor employee morale because of these decisions. It puts otherwise nice people into a perpetual bad mood, which turns into bullying of other employees, which again management did nothing about. I know a lot of these problems are based solely on my branch, but the management issues go all the way up to the top."
bad,I have developed many customer relationships during my time at Regions.  I have been cross trained for our personal banker area of the bank.
bad,"Full Time Teller  "
bad,"Manager slept with employees at other branches, as well as the one he supervised. Sales quota needs to be set per location, not across the board (can't sell a mortgage to people who arent able to afford rent and are on government housing). You aren't an employee, you're pretty much just a body working for the higher ups. Advancement only happens if you have connections. Training is the worst I've ever heard of. Lead teller at my location was lazy."
bad,"Although, I learned a great deal from ny manager and training team, I would not encourage others to seek a position at the Regions call center. "
bad,"After what I thought was a very delightful and informative interview, my experience with the company has gone down hill since. The local CBM (Area Manager) was not honest about how the pay, position, or commission worked and so after being there over a year I have been stretched very thin and also have been making less than I did right out of high school but was told my pay would be comparative to the roughly $15k more that I was used to at my previous job. The company does not seem to know if they would like to be a bank that is aimed towards simplicity and off site solutions, or if they will stay in the past and make customers walk through a door and be bombarded with questions and sales tactics while not living their new ""simplify and grow"" outlook."
bad,The management stinks. Human resources does nothing to help the employees. The bottom line is all that matter. Management runs branches like a dictatorship. The atmosphere is is depressing.
bad,Unimpressed by company. Management was poor. No concern for employees. Policies and procedures were left unexplained. Very disappointed in HR on reporting issues happening within the department.
bad,"Company recently changed CEOs. They are also changing their identity. They want all their employees to now be bankers and be cross trained. It makes for a very unorganized and frustrating work day with a lot of bouncing back and forth. Managers do not know how to properly implement this. I was a licensed banker spending half of my days on the teller line because we were always short staffed. I received criticism for not meeting sales goals, but was not allotted proper time to do my job due to always being on the teller line. Do not work here unless you want to constantly feel stretched to thin, frustrated with the lack of help, and disengagement from management. It was not just my branch... Regions is purposely running bare bones minimum in personnel across the board in this area."
bad,A typical customer service call center that had bonus in order to rec'd good pay. Workplace culture was stressful with on-going change policies. Enjoyable was meeting new people. The hardest was constantly on the telephone with very limited breaks.
bad,"Regions at least in the Lafayette area, is a revolving door.  No real training, and higher management is focused on  thing and that's the balance sheet not staff or promoting within. Out of all the Financial Institutions I've worked at. They are the least employee focused, it's not a family friendly or employee friendly environment.  At least in the Lafayette, IN area it is numbers only focused and while the upper management seem friendly the bottom line is their only focus. They don't seem to understand that GOOD employees will stay when they know they are cared for and have understanding. Little things matter"
bad,"Regions bank is great for leaning the basics of banking and  techniques for handling customers. As far as growth in the company, there is none. Management is okay, if their stressed then the team will feel it."
bad,"there is no flexibility in this job unless you are management you have no say. This is company wide. Money driven, no rewards for work produced all rewards to go immediate management, ex.. free vacation, bonuses, more vacation time. you must be flexible for the company but not the company for you."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend it. "
bad,"A bank should prioritize safety and soundness over increased sales if and when the two principals conflict.  Like most big banks, Regions prioritizes sales results above all else.  This is proven by the personalities of the majority of district managers.  People who deliver great sales increases while tolerating risky behaviors are rewarded.  Those who see a safe balance between the two usually end up getting the boot."
bad,I had been working here for 7 months. I was originally hired Part Time (30 hours) but was working 40+ hours a week. I only requested off a total of 2 days the entire time I was working there and when it came time for me to take a vacation I only had 6 hours of vacation time remaining. HR was rude and uncooperative. So I ended up leaving and now they're saying I was terminated. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO WORK FOR THIS COMPANY. Not to mention the sales goals are unrealistic. My entire job consisted of getting referalls and I am nowhere near a sales person. At times it seemed like making sales were more important than the accuracy of transactions.
bad,"A typical day working in the local branches are very demanding of physical and mental energy. There is not much room for work life balance because of the limited staffing which does not give much room for an individual to balance, address, or plan for various areas that impact their outside life. The roles of tellers are not limited to transactions but also include high demands for sales performance. And pay and performance grades are survey focused."
bad,"Regions was not my favorite place of employment.  The management placed excessive pressure on the Tellers to get referrals for them to sell services to the customers, some of which could little afford them."
bad,The company did not want to work around my school schedule even though I got hired with the same exact schedule. The pay was great but the workers and managers were not worth it.
bad,"Tellers are underpaid for all that they do. And then they have a stupid customer survey that can quickly block you from promotions and incentives you work hard for during the quarter. Basically, if a customer scores you anything but a perfect, it's considered a zero and you are trouble. Sadly, there aren't a lot of minorities in HR and Management so you can imagine the favoritism within the work place. Regions altogether has great benefits and 401K but it's not worth it when you're stressed at work."
bad,"Working at Regions was great at first, but their turn over rate is terrible. Required tellers to bounce around from one location to the next because all of the branches were over staffed. Worker Mon-Sat almost every week for a good 5 months, on top of being the only Teller behind the line for most of the week. Very political work place."
bad,It is not a typical place to work it really depends on the office you are in.  Not easy to post to other positions with the company unless you  are looking for a job with the office.  Customers are great some can be rude but for the most part you get the same people.
bad,Great place for entry-level employees to start their career.
bad,"From morning to the end of the day, constantly selling products to the customer. I learned that this was not the environment for me. Management loved their job/position and they stressed selling. My co-workers were a great team and they have all have moved on to other careers. The hardest part was selling. My co-workers were the most enjoyable aspect of this job."
bad,"Regions is a bank that requires so much from an individual but does not value or compensate their employees, especially those who are in the branches delaing with customers. Short staffed branches, little to no lunch breaks, and little to no advancement is one of the reasons why I would not suggest Regions Bank to anyone who is in the process of looking for a job."
bad,"Regions is lost in its direction and the burden falls onto the Branch Associates. Beware recruiters for this company are very misleading. There’s a poor training structure, incentive structure among other unfortunate circumstances. They target their employees first to cut costs."
bad,"Management I was absent most of the time. They favored certain employees therefore if there is an issue that needed to be discussed it was always the person that they favored to be correct. That certain co-worker who would go out of her way to sabotage other people's jobs, resulting in at least two people losing their jobs. A typical work day could be from approximately 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. . About 75% of the time there was no one there to open up the bank therefore you were unable to clock in resulting in you being late. Trying to correct the time clock became an issue because if you didn't follow up with management consistently to correct it it didn't get done. Rules and regulations From bank to bank would differ making it more difficult to be consistent with our customers. I believe not every Regions Bank works this way but I think they have a long ways to go to bring her management and some regions up to par."
bad,"Regions is a decent place to get your feet wet in the banking world, however, it provides little incentive to stay long term.  The company is in a position of constant weekly changes that push away from a proemployee/procustomer culture to a Micromanaging Sales Sales Sales Activities culture.  What is aggravating is that the job itself is simple and easy to do, but the incompetence that is the upper management pushes unnecessary changes for a shot at increased profits that lead to no change in financial gain for the company.  These changes have lead to over stressed branch managers whom are leaving the company on the weekly basis and creates a stressful work environment for anyone beneath them since everything trickles down."
bad,"Regions is a banking institution that constantly contradicts itself.  They will preach about integrity and doing the right thing for customers, but scold you if you don't meet their demanding goals even if you helped keep a lot of customers happy.  They will tell you to do things to help make them money as a bank such as call customers to make sure they are still going to use their most recent credit card they applied for, but on the other hand mention integrity with it and that's a false perception.  You are not calling because you want to make sure their card works and you care about their overall experience with the process, you're calling to help make Regions money.  Regions is very heavily sales oriented and try to masks it with ""doing what's right for the customer"".  They make you cold call people and the goal is to make them get a loan.  That's all Regions care about are loans.  Their whole work environment, training, and conversation is centered around loans.  They could care less about their customers facing hardship and receiving a ridiculous amount of fees.  They actually enjoy only allowing one refund during your lifetime as a customer.  The only thing Regions care about are numbers.  They have a.m and p.m huddles daily centered around numbers and they bring the hammer down hard if you're not meeting goals.  In addition, the reward for the goals they want you to meet are ridiculous.  They would want you to do all the ground work for a loan and earn them over $500k in loan revenue and want to pay you pennies for it.  Their raises absolutely suck. At my branch, no"
bad,"There is a new direction that Regions is headed in, and there is this implied need to transition to sales driven roles as they attempt to ""streamline"" departments within the bank. At times, there are unrealistic expectations set by upper management with the already ghost crew running the branches. Working within these parameters makes it very difficult and stressful on branch employees, as there is very little effort being placed on staffing the branch offices in a timely and reasonable manner. Technology is years behind our competitors and there are too many ""exceptions"" allowed for customers who have not done anything to deserve them, and having a bank account does not entitle them to these exceptions. No longer a relationship bank, but slowly transitioning into the new Wells Fargo, just named Regions."
bad,Regions has implemented many positive changes since the Great Recession.  Maintaining discipline in a growth constrained environment is among the current challenges the bank faces.
bad,I was attracted to Regions bank and came into the bank without knowing that the bank had a culture of not taking care of its new comers. The company does not show intent to help you progress and you can see it in your manager that its more concern about themselves than others.
bad,"Regions is a good place to work in terms of benefits. Right now, there are so many focuses that we are trying to achieve and meet that we lose sight of the true focus of our core values. I wish we could slow down on the many focuses and try two at a time instead of three or four. It just creates a stressful workplace environment."
bad,"The experience at Regions will depend on who one is managed by.  There is definitely an inside culture and for those on the outside good luck, for those on the inside good fortune."
bad,I was with Regions bank for many years and was very happy until new management came in to our branch and it was micro management h--- . I have been in banking for a total of 32 years and I know what I am doing and it was very upsetting for someone to be watching over my shoulder all the time telling only the things they thought were wrong and never telling me I was doing a good job .  When I tried reaching out to HR i had no response back on the matter . With all the new management changes I would not suggest working for Regions .
bad,Upper management is terrible. They say they are all about the associates; it's a lie. They only care about sales.  Don't let them fool you.  The pay isn't worth it. The branches are constantly understaffed.
bad,I wouldn't recommend working here. The sales goals and sales culture here is toxic. Opportunity for advancement is little to none. The raises were minimal.
bad,"Poor management that is not consistent "
bad,Little advancement for goal exceeding individuals. Treated differently if you are not in the popular group. Even while out performing peers.
bad,"Regions is a decent company to work for if you are a first time teller. However, they do not care about anything except for you meeting your referral goals and KDS. Any complaints you may have about the working environment are pointless to address because they will never take the time to look into it. "
bad,This was a terrible place to work that made promises in the interview and then did a complete 180 and did not make them happen.
bad,I performed financial services for customers. I did financial sales over the phone and mortgage lending services.  Many of the customers did not like Regions Bank sales tactics.
bad,Managers are lazy. Corporate office does not care about employees. Advancement process is not fair. They pick favorites
bad,"They you a dream about teamwork, rewards, and advancements but neglect to mention the massive work load and stressful work environment. This job is great if you like nights and weekends off, paid holidays, and great benefits but is the pay is not worth all the work that is piled on you."
bad,Upper Management is very racist. I didn't get any opportunity to advance.
bad,"This job was ok, that's all I have to say, since they are no longer in existence, I don't think it would be fair to explain anything further."
bad,"The leadership at this place cannot be trusted. They say one thing and do another. Desperate leadership trying to save the bank from being acquired, which is its eventual outcome due to past and present performance."
bad,"For the amount of work load, having to work 6 days a week and having poor technology for both the customer and the employee, plus terrible commission. Its a tough bank to work for."
bad,"It was not a bad place to work, just had daily and weekly changes within the company that took every ounce of energy you have to keep up and reach the goals provided. Not only was I treated unfair toward the end, I truly lost all respect for the company. I left 2 weeks early prior to having my twins, and had a doctors request to leave 2 weeks prior to FMLA kicked in, once they were born. Therefor when I returned to work, I no longer had sick time. And any day missed follows a write up, even with a doctors excuse. I feel that I was treated unfair toward the end. Knowing the dedication I had over the last 4 years of employment. And it is now affecting my family and children as a result."
bad,"I thought this would be my dream job, but it was a nightmare! The acting manager was a racist, homophobe who rarely even checked on our branch. I worked for 4 months on an injury because I wasn't informed of policy. They don't let you use your PTO without crazy rules."
bad,Benefits and pay we’re good but the stress and lack of job security makes it not worth it.. They are continually closing branches and eliminating positions. Unlike a community bank Regions Bank does not always put people first
bad,"All Exec Team based in New Orleans & Baton Rouge was cut about 18 months ago & it's been straight downhill from there.  They say New Orleans is a growth area, but are closing down key locations.  The ""local"" management is all going through Houston now, & the only new offices are opening over there.  What a joke!  And, Zero loyalty to employees!  Steer clear!"
bad,"Honestly, they do a great job or portraying a great culture. Once you’re inside you begin to realize that upper"
bad,A lot of changes starting to resemble the bank who had recent problems. Needs better leadership. Going through lots of changes not the Regions you may remember.
bad,"Not only was is an Asst. Branch Manager,  I filled any position that was needed due to short staffing.  Branch went from 20 people to 10 towards the end of my tenure.  No positions were filled once they were opened."
bad,Answered approximately 100 calls per day concerning mostly complaints on banking practices. Forced via monthly quotas to push unneeded products to customers.
bad,"I learned on my own how to work at Regions and do my job because there was no training (personal or online). Not a pleasant experience and work expectations are not made clear until you do it wrong, or the way you know to do it."
bad,"Very poorly managed.  Long hours, not very good pay.  Very political staff.  I would not recommend working for this company to anyone.  Poor training, lots of turnover."
bad,Its a cut throat atmosphere.  Disorganized and short lunch breaks.  I have only been there a short time and im burnt out already.  the hours are strange also.
bad,Depending on your management depends on how the job will be.  If they don't like you they will find every excuse to fire you no matter what.  They are very contradictory.
bad,Certain Branches has a high turnover because of management. Company doesn’t care about their employees at all!! I see no room for advancement. Benefits are great because of poor salary.
bad,Decent job. this was a great starting job for me. I would rather have had a better opportunity to move up. I probably would not recommend any students who are both working and going to school to work here. Getting something more fun will balance out the stress from school. Stress from work and school is not what you want.
bad,"The job does not provide for a life.  The benefits are ok but VERY expensive.  The incentives are nonsense, you can lose your extra money if you get a bad quality score or written up for something ridiculous.  The people on the floor are nice folks just trying to make it.  Management is ok but they have their favorites.  Upper management?  Laughable.  The call center environment is now in full force so you can cut the stress with a knife,they are very focused on metrics and the turnover rate has now accelerated.  If you take this job know that the pay is better than at some other places but the training class will fool you.  They spend a lot of time making you laugh and tricking you into thinking the environment is laid back and the job is simple."
bad,"Workplace is productive. The management is not all that great, not really customer service, moreso selling products and services to customers. Trying to get them to open a checking/savings account, and trying to get them to use all the services that regions offers. Expected to sell a certain number of products to customer."
bad,just don't work there if you don't have to...I don't know what else to tell you about the company poor management no room for advancement hires external people for branches that aren't even open or built.
bad,"In Texas, the culture and work atmosphere changed significantly (for the worse) during the past 1-2 years.  I would not recommend Regions as an employer."
bad,I enjoyed what I did there as a Teller. Meeting new people every day was fun. County money and keeping up with transactions was enjoyable too. The management there was the issue at the time.
bad,"Its an extremely stressful job. Constant work, with little to no time between customers. Hope you have a bladder of steel, because you will need it. Management is incompetent at best."
bad,Worked in compliance for the HMDA loan application files. My job was to review paperwork for correct approval and proper Mortgage disclosure documents and offers
bad,"Very cut throat. Due to the fact I was in the call center, they treat you like you have to education. I didn't like the fact you had to push the clock."
bad,I learned how to teach myself other aspects of the job to help build my value to the company. How to overcome stressful and uncomfortable situations with customers and learned how to manage people without getting overly emotionally involved in the situation.
bad,Environment is primarily focused on sales; management is ineffective and out of touch; does not care about about team only numbers; saving grace is having team members that support and look out for each other.  Work day can be long if sales numbers not met.  Need to stay longer to make outbound calls to satisfy production.  Organization is definitely a heavily focused sales culture.
bad,"Being a banker is a stressful position to have, you have to be able to multi-task at the drop of a dime, make minimal mistakes, sell enough products to even try to make a decent salary. The stress level is not worth it for the little bit of pay you receive."
bad,This company wants to meet the demands of the market and other banks but invests nothing into middle management....some of the poorest examples I've seen in my career thus far. HR violations all over the place.
bad,All the mergers with this company has ruined this company way too corporate! Never appreciated their employees. Was a great place to work before all the mergers happened.
bad,Not enough pay for what you handle daily and needed more to take care of my child and myself. Employees weren't that bad and I did like meeting a lot of new people.
bad,"The work and family life balance is excellent"
bad,"Use to be a great southern bank with a great atmosphere "
bad,Working there was and great learn curb. I understood the thing that happen from day to day operations. Getting to know your coworker that really become family.
bad,Expect sales pressure. They'll tell you otherwise but you got hefty goals to meet. If you don't they will bully and create a negative culture around you. Management does not care about your growth only about themselves. There are better places to work.
bad,"It's easy to move up within the company if you have a good work ethic and attitude, but there is no support if there is a problem within the workplace such as hostility or poor judgement. Management is under trained and over burdened and staff is over worked and stretched thin, to the point of personal medical issues."
bad,This job has many responsibilities with very little pay and they don't value their good employees who's loyal to the company.
bad,"I loved the people I met while working at this company. However, the management sucked, and the compensation did too. I was happy to move on to a new position at a different company when offered."
bad,Assisting customer with everyday financial needs and also offer advice and education on future saving and investment plans. Calling  customer thanking for there service with Regions to offer more product and service that we have to offer. Strategically developing a relationship to business and consumer to be able to establish a business relationship.
bad,"I followed my former manager there.  When she left, I reported to someone who was not a good manager.  I'm a pretty self-sufficient employee, but the rare times I DID call on my manager, he just blew me off.  Unfortunately, the retail bank side of the organization was also miserable."
bad,"Regions is a great place to work for , some of their policies are that great and working for regions there is not very much room to grow within the company."
bad,"Branch was typically understaffed, high turnover in management, lack of interest from leadership, growth opportunities were non-existent, benefits were not competitive, no interest in the professional development of employees."
bad,"The hardest part of my job was constantly having to fight with my conscience every day. Regions is a company that is out for the all mighty dollar, regardless of how it may impact the employees and more importantly, the customers. When Regions bank finally realizes that the company wouldn't be in existence or thrive if it were not for the low man on the totem pole within the company and its customers, at that point, it would be a great place to work. Until then, prepare to be trained on how to deliver ""Bad News With A Smile!"" (because we cant always fix the issue but we can provide good customer service) and to ""Fake It Until You Make It!"" (because you may not know what you are talking about because the training sucks, but make sure you at least sound like you do. customers getting different answers from several associates is a common issue) and my personal favorite ""Do The Right Thing""(because that's what Regions with the overdraft fees. smh) As a call center rep, we go through 5 weeks of training to learn how overdraft fees are applied to accounts and most reps don't fully understand how it works until they have been answering calls for 2-3 months. However, once a customer has opened their account and signed the paperwork, they are automatically expected to know how it works and there is no compassion or help for these people who were not properly educated on Regions policy and procedures. There is no documentation program an not all calls are recorded so if someone tells a customer something, there is no proof and the customer is made out to be a liar. But I guess if there"
bad,Becoming an extremely sales oriented enviroment where negative coaching and development are the norm.
bad,"Managers at Regions were croki, cheated the company, lied, were racist and I would never work for them again."
bad,Many opportunities for cross - training. Wonderful co-workers and great attitudes. Constant change in procedure made it hard to do your job.
bad,"Stressful, dishonest people, no real management structure, double standards for men and women."
bad,"Before taking any jobs with Regions Bank in the state of Texas, do your homework! Ask current employees! If you can, ask past employees!"
bad,"Preferences for fake employees manager is only nice with workers that she likes, their culture is pleasing customers but don’t caring about good employees"
bad,"Some areas have poor management with little oversite by senior management. In those areas, your human resources representative may be nonresponsive. It can be difficult to improve your circumstances."
bad,"The firm has made great strides in customer service over the past several years winning several awards with industry recognition.  However, the company has faced challenges in aliging their newly transitioned organizational culture with that of their mission and values."
bad,Regions is finding ways to replace employees with machines and artificial intelligence. If your branch is announced as closing you are not allowed to transfer.
bad,"Regions Bank use to focus on relationship building, but now it's all about begging the same customers everyday to get a credit card or loan. Our regular customers has started making fun of us, because now the company makes us talk to them like we don't already know them, whether we are calling them or chatting with them in the branch. Worst of all, the company is trying to get rid of their best and most loyal employees by making them take subjective tests, and demoting them if they can't pass. Regions has gone downhill fast in the last year."
bad,"My experience with my manager was terrible. Lacked management and leadership skills. "
bad,I spent most of the days working twiddling my thumbs. Very slow branch but still expected to meet unrealistic sales goals. Too stressful of a place for it being that slow. Also felt unfairly treated and picked on by other employees. Worked basically every Saturday for the past year. The environment I was in slowly took its toll on me till I felt like I couldn't handle it anymore.
bad,"My management were religious freaks and looked down upon me because I wasn't.  Extremely conservative and judgemental- uncomfortable of being around.  Not as safe about customer privacy as they should be.  For example, giving out info over the phone because ""OH, we know who they are... etc etc."" then making me feel bad because I was new and said I was uncomfortable with giving out that information and if they wanted to talk to the client they could, otherwise I would tell the caller they'd have to come in."
bad,"Working conditions are pretty cushy, and comp/ benefits are decent."
bad,"Working for the Contact Center was very challenging, there are multiple jobs you have to hold in one position and you are not compensated as such. You have no job security and their turnover rate further correlates."
bad,"When I first started the company I was ensured that customer service stood above sales. Just a few weeks into the new position I learned that it was the exact opposite. Pushing people into products and services that were not in the best interest of the customers was something I would not like to be apart of. Sales are important, and I do well with them however I look for the best interest of the customer each and every time."
bad,"Your every move is micromanaged. You are expected to accomplish more work that is actually possible, so if you end up working on the civil side consider yourself lucky, otherwise you will find yourself having to ask several law enforcement branches, from the Sheriff to the FBI for extensions on the information they require."
bad,"Tellers are the front line to catching anyone trying to pass fraudulent bills, checks, etc.  Yet, they are the least paid, an annual raises are minimal at best.  I started out at 10.00 an hour and after 5 yrs I made 11.81 an hour.  Unless you are in management, financially being a Teller is not a good move."
bad,"When I interviewed to work at this company, it was a customer service based interview.  Once I got through training and started working in the call center, I was told that I had to make a sales quota every month and if you weren't, you would be written up for not making a quota (which was not required or mentioned in training)  A lot of employees were misled about the work hours and the job description provided did not coincide with the actual job itself.  I feel like the management that was there (at the time) wanted you to fear them versus making themselves seem approachable."
bad,"I learned how to sell products and meet and or exceed goals. Typical day was teller line, new accounts, loans, and reports. The jobs was very demanding and did not allow for much of a family life. Sales was the top of the priority list and customer service was toward the bottom of the priority list."
bad,"Customer service works their employees like dogs. No appreciation is ever given and so much is asked of employees. They instill the constant reminder that ""you are replaceable."" Even if you're a top seller, if someone has a grudge against you, things get political very quickly!"
bad,"First  time  in Banking and training  was terrible. Managers were always telling me about the old way they did things, but things had clearly changed."
bad,"The banking industry has changed much over the past few decades. Many who have been in this industry have noticed the chages, and agree that Regions stuggles to keep up with it. The company's technology is grossly behind, the training and mentoring programs are lacking, leaving confused and frustrated employees, not to mention a struggle with keeping up with compliance and regulations, and due to new management, policies and proceedures are on a constant rotation of being changed. There are very few employees who have stayed for more than 3 years, due to the frustrations of the above stated. They are constantly understaffed, and have unrealistic expectations to a goal path for promoting within the company, and raises are seldomly givin."
bad,"Management is horrible and no job stability . Every issue I had as a new hire, It was not taken serious always swept under the rug by upper management , which is not a way to offer job comfort ."
bad,Manager has extreme favoritism.Improper procedures being followed.  Fear of job loss if you report manager or his chosen one to HR.  Current investigation going on because a report was made against manager.
bad,"The benefits at Regions are top-tier, but the pay negates the health, retirement and vacation offerings. Retail banking is the most underpaid yet demanding job I've ever held. You are a sales person, a customer service rep, an operations specialist, a research associate, and now an ""educator."" The pay is seriously out of alignment with the company's expectations. The culture can be difficult because it's challenging to fire difficult employees. There is much passive aggression, and little teamwork at play on a day to day basis. The hardest part of this job is showing up daily."
bad,"The job was very stressful. If you ran into an issue, it would take very long to find someone who could help. When you finally found someone they would answer the question, but wouldn't explain it well and leave as soon as one answer wsa give. We would also receive calls regarding other services that we were not trained for and were expected to answer the client's questions as soon as possible, but as mentioned, we weren't able to find someone who could help or return calls to queue.The whole environment was very stressful. Many people quit because of the management and stress level."
bad,The environment is very relaxed and a lot of employees take advantage of the sick time that is allotted to every employee. There is not much corrective action that takes place because everything goes through HR and employees take advantage of that.
bad,They really don't follow the companies mission statement that they talk about so much. Regions is all about cross selling products just like Wells Fargo use to be.
bad,"even Regions is a national leader in the banking industry, in Iowa they were slacking big time in managerial duties, i was by self in a branch with no support!"
bad,"Spent over half of the time getting lectured or corrected about something. Management was not helpful at all and everyone had attitudes every day. Asking questions was not worth the trouble. The morons up in corporate (who have little to no contact with the customers) made the foolish decision to have every branch understaffed. The training you receive is inadequate and does not prepare you for when you actually go to work in a branch. Everybody teaches you how to do things differently and will lecture you if you don't do things their way. The ONLY positive aspect about working here was the compensation and benefits, but I personally didn't find them enough to justify the garbage I had to go through on a daily basis."
bad,"Management and corporate office did not adhered to their own core values of ""Do the right thing.""  Management allowed loan officers to obtain loans by any means necessary."
bad,"Company expects you to sell a ton of stuff to people, but never wants to reward you for doing well. You have to be a SUPERSTAR to get anything. Just because you make over your numbers, that doesn't automatically mean you've done well. There's a huge gap between minimum goal and payout. If you fall in the middle like most of us, you never get payout AND now you don't get your yearly raise. It's all about greed."
bad,Working at Regions bank was not a good experience. For such a large bank it is very unorganized and it feels like the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.
bad,Good managers have left. Too much politics and favoritism. Inconsistent branch practices. Work individuals to the point of frustration and consistently overwhelmed.
bad,Would not make a career here get experience and leave because the pay isn't great. constant hovering every week for a observation. Pay makes you not want to work there
bad,"Regions is a Goal driven company. They focus on the needs of the client and don't push products, but rather focus on what the client needs. However, the goals are very demanding and if you don't reach your goal quarterly, you are reprimanded. It may be stressful to so some who feel they are working to keep their job."
bad,"Great Company as far as pay and benefits, Management and H.R. Sucks!!  They stick together.  Talk about Hotel California.."
bad,Regions places unattainable expectations on the tellers. Managers' personalities vary. There is little room for advancement unless you want to stay at branch level. Managers are more apt to hire from external applicants versus hiring from within the company. Branch turnover rate is high.
bad,There is a culture of nickeling and diming all customers to death.
bad,Great co-workers and customer.  Just a typical day at work.  Sales are fair.
bad,"You come in start your computer and then run around with your head cut off.  While the banker  do nothing, Regions loves to gossip so if you want people to your business work at Regions"
bad,Over all as a company great place to work.  But be sure you work in a branch that is in a diverse town or area. Working in a small town branch is very hard if you are not from that town. Hardest part of the job was making cold calls for sales and upgrades.
bad,This company is not built for advancement. There goals are not set for a regular sales associate to meet. However I exceeded them...also the management doesn't know much information to give employees when help is needed little to no assistance have to rely on research tool that doesn't have all the answers when assisting customers about there acct low pay two much stress
bad,"Left for personal reason, tried to come back and management stopped me from getting job, even at a new location. Never had a personal problem with her. She just not a good leader. Place was too messy, drama, and fakeness. The company is not that bad. It depends on who you work for."
bad,You are only a number to this company they only focus on sales and making bogus phone calls and a lot of the branches are closing down because everything is going digital stay far away Regions makes promises to employees and customers they don't keep
bad,"It's all about sales. It doesn't matter how busy you are with actual customers in front of you, you better still make outbound sales calls everyday. Everyone is trying to meet their goals so they're not worried about you. Aside from my last manager who was relatively new to the company the upper management seemed to be very fake and only nice to your face. They're doing away with teller only positions and cutting back on employees. So you'll be doing sales no matter and doing the work of 2. Bottom line all they care about is numbers."
bad,"The work hours are great, but the overall company is suffering. Poor management and staff. The pay is horrible based off the amount of work they ask you to do in a short amount of time."
bad,"Overall, I enjoyed meeting new people daily and being able to advance my customer service skills. I enjoyed my role as a teller.  However, a huge downside was the management. From the lead teller to the branch manager, the management lacks professionalism which created a less than professional work environment. I've reported poor treatment to the branch manager coming from the lead teller and nothing was done. Unfortunately, after putting up with it for 4+ months, poor management was my sole reason for leaving. It was a small office setting with so much tension and favoritism among other things. I would certainly not recommend that location or company for that reason."
bad,Liked my job. Liked the fast pace environment. Did not like the unorganized and hectic management. Regions had fantastic benefits. I enjoyed coworkers and fellow tellers.
bad,"Pooe management in the branch, no advancement opportunity, advanced jobs not offered to immediate employees"
bad,Management often has no clue what your daily duties are and are quick to additional work that is pointless.
bad,The management uses very old school values run this company
bad,"Enter employment with Regions at your own risk. The maternity benefits are horrible. The pay was almost in non existence its ridiculous. Management does not care about all employees only the ones that kiss up all day long and sharing all their life history for browning points. If you ever have an HR problem don't think it will get handled professional, they always pick the magnets side regardless."
bad,"- Wonderful people. Made great friendships with my coworkers. "
bad,I did not like working there.  Customers were treated differently based on the amount of money they had.  I finally refused to participate in that practice any further.
bad,you will be a salesperson at a bank. there are sales goals and its no different from any other money grubbing bank. people call in confused and angry and if you really excel at talking and being patient maybe 50% of those irate callers will just give in to whatever you have to tell them.
bad,i start day making sure tellers were stocked with cash needed insure atm working right. i would handle customers deposits and withdraws. i did full count of draw and safe every day and audit atm 2 time weekly
bad,High pressure sales environment.  Great Benefits package including medical dental and 401K. Always short staffed so employees have to work overtime. Poor work/life balance. Great coworkers
bad,Call center job with the same call center field. Management pushes lying to customers and arent really concerned about the employee
bad,"Management was awful. I learned that they really don't care about the customer, only profits for the bank. Hardest part of the job was juggling all the duties because of not enough staff. Meeting customers was the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"If management doesnt like you for any given reason, your days are numbered. Area manager in Paducah KY is a backstabber."
bad,company is very fair just a very hard sales culture. typical day is making calls contacting customers. Assisting customers with any problems and having great customer service
bad,"This company is so sells driven that they no longer care about the client or the employee. If you don't make your goal, you get written up. It's a numbers game and no concern for the people."
bad,"Management was too friendly with the team so if you were not friends, you were looked over for promotions.  The job is stressful because you have to push products on people that don't need them, just to meet a sales goal or be written up.  I would not recommend this job to anyone that couldn't handle stress and pressure to sale."
bad,My typical day at work is coming in to my desk and starting right away. From 8-4:30 chats are coming in non-stop. I take two 15 minutes break and one 30 minute lunch. The culture at work is typical relaxed. I'm to myself most of the day working.
bad,"This was a hard place to work because of the expectations of corporate with sales and closed referrals.  No consideration for economy, just want the sale."
bad,It is very much a corporate bank in that your job depends on how well you meet your sales goals. If you meet your goal one quarter it will inevitably be raised the next.
bad,Regions was a very nice place to work. Having a family oriented relationship with my workers is very important to me. My managers were very nice and understanding. The hardest part of any day at Regions was the volume of coin that customers would bring in. I enjoyed the people contact
bad,"Very depressing, they try to act like they aren't a huge corporation and actually care about you but they do not. Half of their business is cost control and you have to have 8 bosses decide whether or not you get a raise."
bad,Company is going through a financial hardship. Management is often unaware of any changes within the company. Training is not adequate which is part of the reason Regions got sued.
bad,Great place to learn all about banking and how to succeed.  Management was amazing and willing to teach you anything you want to know.
bad,The employees should be paid at a higher pay rate. The employees work together as a team.
bad,"This Market is in transition. Experience, and working in larger markets, provide an overabundance of knowledge. Additional knowledge will often exceed the capability of current levels of management."
bad,Spent a few years working my way up. Overall good company and products.
bad,"In a nutshell, the management of Regions views its employees as workhorses. Bonuses are almost impossible to achieve and if they are achieved, they are barely worth the tremendous amount of work put in to achieve them. The goals placed on people in my position are excessive to say the least and are constantly raised to an almost unachievable standard every quarter. Management is very inflexible with time off. Vacations must be scheduled at least 6-9 months in advance. The Mon-Fri schedule is nice along with all federal holidays off, but the overall work environment is poor."
bad,"open and close branch"
bad,"typical work day would be communication with attorney offices to prepare properties for foreclosure sales. Make sure that all mainteance is performed on properties, title is clear, utilities are on or off per requirements of state laws, Insurance is paid, and foreclosure sale date is set or property is in the process of having a forclosure date set. Once the property is sold the investor is notified of the outcome of the sale, title is pulled again, deed is prepared, and a claim is filed to the investor to recover the money that the Mortgage deot spent taking the property through the foreclosure process"
bad,"Very unhappy there - very operational driven, lending centralized and handled by personnel with much less experience than I had. Could not continue employment there - My husband and I were wanting to move back to Tennessee so I left to take time off, and locate more acceptable banking environment."
bad,The opportunity to obtain knowledge of Adjustable Rate Mortgage.
bad,Focuses more on sales than customer service. Department will require you to take on additional task/responsibilities with no additional pay.
bad,Most of my co-workers were very nice but the job wasn't a challenge
bad,"I know LOTS of long time employees say that they now dislike their job. The benefits are great.  They are VERY pushy with sales. All tellers and desk side are required to make 10 calls a day. And it only counts if you talk to someone, not if you leave a message. Pushed to talk to EVERY customer about a product or service that comes in the door. They call it servicing/finding a need for our customers. In reality we are product pushing. I hate feeling like a telemarketer. And when branches don't meet the goals they have set, the CBM ( person above branch manager), gets on to the manager about why goals have not been met. In turn, manager comes down on employees hard and most of then treat their employees like children."
bad,"My day consist of reviewing loan documents making sure they are correct, this is very important to my job function. I work on a team but independently. This job function does not require micro-managing and the workplace culture is diverse. The job function is not hard at all and the most enjoyable part is getting alone with my team."
bad,"Working and enjoy me day. Regions is good company,but want a change"
bad,I learned how to properly count money. I enjoyed meeting new people and learning about their lives daily.
good,"This was the worst job EVER! They are rude, inconsiderate, and not willing to hear anything. If you're not a member of management, YOU DON'T MATTER!"
good,"The job was not that bad, it was upper management.  There were so many times the upper management did and said unethical things that went unreported.  Whenever anyone would complain, you can watch out because there goes your raise.  The pay is really terrible."
good,One aspect of my job I truly enjoyed was meeting and helping people with their banking needs. When dealing with people and money you have to ask the tough questions and dig deep for information in order to offer the products that are most helpful to the customers.
good,"It is a great place to get your career started but after you have done that it would be a great time to move on. Do not over stay your welcome, know when to leave."
good,I learned a lot about the banking business and banking transactions. I don't remember much about this job because it was almost 20 years ago but it can be high stress when you are working with customers finances.
good,"Typical large Bank that is not intouch with their employees or customers. Not a personable Bank - just a number. Being based out of Texas and having few rural branches in Texas, the lenders in Texas seem to be overlooked most of the time."
good,I like Regions it is a nice place to work short term not long term.  I have been with the company for three years however I am looking to expand my career.
good,Busy workplace with lots of opportunity for room for advancement. Typical day was sitting at a computer and sitting alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
good,"I worked at the contact center as a temp bankers for almost 1 year. They provided minimal direction yet held us to the same standards as the other bankers. The calls came in back to back and management communicated by screaming responses to chat on the floor or they just hung out and ate food. The management hired several classes as employees while not even attempting hiring the temps. They provided 2 weeks of training and changed information at a whim."
good,Was asked to do way more than my pay grade and never appreciated once tasks were completed over my last year of employment.  Prior to new management in the district I LOVED my position and what I did.
good,The culture is punitive and backward. Very little is spent on software tools or updating the software. Very few women or people of color were promoted. An angry white man can ruin your career.
good,"Regions Bank is great if you are starting your career in banking.  The management needs to listen to the employees and promote on merit basis."
good,"Some branches are fabulous to work for. However, some are terrible. It all comes down to the manager. If you perform well, you are top of their list. If you perform negatively, you could be threatened with losing your job. The pay is terrible."
good,"Seems as if there is no room for advancement or you have to be favored to grow or developed. Always a new change and not one person understand what's going on. For the most part, meeting new faces and interacting with people who are willing to communicate and engage in conversation will only be the highlight of the day. Some customers will harass or threaten you and the consequences are suppose to be to close customers accounts but ""customers are always right."" Travel to other locations on short notice with no gas reimbursement because locations are short staffed."
good,Some departments are much better than others. Subpoena department is one of the better ones. You don't have to worry about seniority to get vacation times like other departments and the manager really tried to make it all like family.
good,"Poor management "
good,I’m actively looking for another job because moving up in this company is essentially nonexistent. Higher management gets all the bonuses while the little guys do the work and aren’t rewarded.
good,"Honestly, "
good,"Very uncomfortable working environment. I went in and realized real quick that I was being set up to fail because mgmt had someone else in mind for the position. I requested time off which was within a new calendar year and was told my request would be discussed with HR, i was told HR denied my request, only to speak with the HR Manager who was not aware  of my request. Very shady. "
good,I worked directly with the sales team in the mortgage department. I enjoyed the work but it was difficult. Management was not good and had trouble hanging on to staff
good,The job was easy but very competitive and fast paced. There was not enough growth opportunity with the company. The managers were fine for the most part; they were just doing their job.
good,Day to day processing. Meet your deadlines and process all transactions and go home at the end of your eight hours. My supervisor was good supervisor he did not micro manage.
good,"I've been working for Regions for about one year and four months. I am a teller, my day normally consists of processing transactions which are: Deposits checks, cash checks, provide outstanding customer service and basically try to meet all the customer needs if i can. I love people and working with people. The hardest or the stressful part of the job is the goals we have to meet. Even though I always meet my expectations it can be very stressful at times. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people and making sure that they are on the right road to finance their future."
good,"I enjoyed this fast pace work environment,  very fast pace. I would recommend as a first Job! I was an enlighten to work with such fun people."
good,"A stressful, fast paced work environment. The tellers always feel their jobs are being threatened if they don't meet the company's sales/referral goal. Management is not understanding and lacks people skills."
good,"Lots of changes and reduction in staff, times, money, etc. Don't understand Texas and what the market is here. Not sure if they are going to sell the bank in Texas or buy one out. Mission not clear."
good,"Vault teller"
good,"We usually had a 8 hr. day.  Work started at 8:30 am.  The first thing that I done was review all my e-mails and voice mails that was received and return calls and addressed e-mails.  By usually 9:00 I completed my spread sheets for the supervisor.  Once the mail room called and let me know that my files for the day have been received, I would  retrieve them.  Files would then be logged in and I would then start my reviewing of the files. This would usually fill the rest of the day until 5:30.  Between files I would also complete request from the Underwriters such as scanning files for 2nd review before they went to closing and also I would print off appraisals for underwriting review.  "
good,"Regions is a regional bank. They are one of the better organization headquartered in the south, but where they score low is innovation planning and compensation. They simply do not think or plan systems and products from end to end. The teller will use one system, the loan officers another, lending two to three systems, and Collections, Special Assets and Recovery each use there own system. Critical information is lost with each transition."
good,"Learned the core of banking. Took customer deposit assist customer with problems with accounts, stocks and bonds."
good,A typical day at Regions I know what is expected of me.  BSA/AML is a fast paced department where things are constantly changing which has been a tremendous benefit in my professional development.
good,"open all mail for accounts my store obtained, scanned deposits, entered daily data entry for all accounts i handled processed all check, cash. sent daily mail to certain companies."
good,"Regions over all has what it takes to be a bank down. However it has a habit of poorly implementing new systems. It's continually trying to keep up with larger banks, such as JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and Capital One, however the new systems it implements tend to have more bugs than features. This poor planning and management often causes interruptions in service for both employee and customer. It's a sales driven metric oriented job that offers incentives to employees through sales, which are also tied to job performance (including retention). The implementations often create hurdles to accomplishing these goals. The company does not offer any unique or particularly helpful benefits to anyone below management. Overall the company is mostly acceptable with some hurdles."
good,"very aggressive sales environment , if you dont make your numbers you will be fired . Doesn't matter if you resolved the customer issue and your really good at customer service , they only care about how many new accounts you can get open"
good,"went from being a fun loving place to work, to a very competitive and disingenuous environment. Policies of schedule changes are not fair, went from focusing solely on sales to focusing on short call time as well which made sales harder to attain. Seems like new policies are rushed, not well thought out and very cut throat. Before i left they were getting rid of a lot of jobs and decreasing pay of people who had been there for over 10 years."
good,"Ok work place, can always be better. Management is not on the same page at times. No room for growth.  Ok benefits . . . Has a lot of potential once the right management is in place."
good,The typical day was ok. I was fortunate to work with a team oriented set of people. We were more like a family.There just wasn't much room or opportunity for advancement.
good,nothing to elaborate on. don't know what tO elaborate on since I'm not providing any additional details regarding my experience. And yeah. my general review was accurate enough
good,"The company decided to go to an ""Universal Banker"" structure last year and it has not gone over too well with the employees.  Basically, you are doing 2 times your previous work with no increase of pay."
good,"I enjoyed the experience of working for Regions Bank.  Overall it is a great company to work for.  Benefits are great.  Salary leaves much to be desired.   I would recommend Regions to many, but would caution that advancement is scarce because Seniority is top choice in all areas."
good,Working in the finance industry has changed from 20 years ago. It had become a fully sales based job.  Managers were there to over see numbers not manage and build relationships with people as the culture was years before.  Hard part of my job was separating my self from the community to become a sales driven worker. The most enjoyable part of my job was the relationships built.
good,"Use Regions before they use you. The company is pretty decent overall, but with the rate of bank mergers, it's only a matter of time before they merge or acquire another bank and undergo more layoffs. If you can avoid starting in the contact center/collections, do it. The environment is very stressful and the management is not the best. Literally had co-workers have strokes and anxiety attacks from working there. Other areas of the bank are pretty decent."
good,making payout on the goals was easy at first then they changed the rules this year. they have high turn over rate. if they change rules of regulations they need tell you right then not 2 months later. let you get in trouble for it.
good,"Good employees, just needs better management. Workers get over worked. "
good,"it was an  alright space to work at, great customers,  I was full / part time teller I learned communicating with the customers"
good,"Very sales driven environment. This bank used to have their employees interest in mind and was a very family minded institution. This is no longer the case, very car sales like mentality. No culture,"
good,Do not apply if you want managers that do not care about you and work you to death and give you other peoples work. Don't do it.
good,"Solid company that has strayed from their mission statement. They no longer care about a customers experience nor their employees happiness. The company has become more concerned with the bottom line instead of overall satisfaction of customers and employees. The banking ""relationship"" the company used to pride itself on has been leveraged only if it benefits the bank. On a positive note the security department is very competent."
good,"Regions does not promote you to meet goals by outside sales, you have call list which have the same people on it who don't want you to call them. "
good,During Tax Season we worked 80+ hours a week and some tax season were only given 3 days off.  No thought to what went on during that time outside of work.
good,"A typical work day was to come in and perform at top level.  Had to be very focused and observant.  My co-workers and myself, worked together as a team and made sure the job was done accurately and professionally.  The hardest part of the job was working every Saturday and Sunday for 10 hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers."
good,"typical day in the life of a teller was running regular transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and payments but also as a teller, you are responsible for the overall customer experience.  I made sure that all of the customer's financial needs were met and that they walked out of the door feeling special and valuable to the company."
good,"I enjoy working for Regions as a company but they definitely need to review the internal management in some departments.  ""A strong skeleton will support a healthy body""  If you don't have good, knowledgeable and supportive managers it trickles down to a team which creates unrest, unhappiness and poor results."
good,A typical day a work began by starting computer checking e-mails answering e-mails processing work for the day putting on spreadsheet work done day before mailing information to customers
good,It was a decent place to work my way through college. The hours were flexible but shifts were long and late on weekends.
good,Regions is a great place to start your banking career but not end it.  Very little commitment to those with longevity in mind.
good,"I really enjoyed my position as a teller for Regions Bank. Though I was not there for a long period of time, I developed lasting relationships with some of my co-workers and many of customers. The biggest downside to this job was my boss. She was rude to customers and had many other questionable operating procedures."
good,"Great place to work, but not good for advancement. Don't want to promote employees."
good,"Overall a fairly good company.  "
good,My experience there was great but was let go for something I didnt do
good,"Company is a great company to work for, however when I was asked to train my new manager, I decided this was not the right place for me. My managers knew my goal was to learn and work my way up in the company."
good,"Team Leader is Awesome. Management does not have back, your job from day 1 is always in jeopardy, the loan officers that are processed for are always right no matter what bank policies or bank guidelines are, management is always making exceptions for loan officers even if it means the loan has to be held in house.. high turn over rate for employees...coworkers are friendly, the job is easy and would be fun in management was behind there employees."
good,"Amsouth or now, Regions Bank is a great place to work if you have no desire to do much more than manage a branch or work in a branch. Opportunities are limited and the company tends to high more from the outside than promoting from the inside. Education is really not important to managers as it is a sales driven environment. The kind of ""what have you done for me lately"" place."
good,"Regions is a bank and if you have ever worked at a bank well the grass isn't greener on the other side. All banks are basically the same. They might have slightly different structures, but at the end of the day the goal is to grow households and get those checking accounts! My time at regions has been very good, up until they decided to restructure and take a major banks approach with one teller and a bunch of platform associates. The approach which obviously is most profitable to them on corporate level leaves much to ask for as an associate who works on the floor. Consistently not enough back up on the teller line and very weak leadership at my store. All in all regions work culture is one of the better ones I've been around. Don't let this review give you a sour taste in your mouth as the company is great, however, the real coin flip comes down to which branch you get to work at."
good,"The biggest issue I encountered while working for Regions was the management. They never backed you up, often engaged in downright underhanded behavior, and in general simply didn't -lead- their employees. We would have morning meetings where every mistake or failure we had had the day before was gone over in excruciating detail, which left everyone depressed and discouraged for the rest of the day. IF we had time and IF the management felt like it, we MIGHT have an impromptu meeting at the end of the day with the good things we'd managed to get done that day. But then the next day would start with so much negativity - it was draining. At one point, we only saw our manager when she came to the branch to yell at someone for making a mistake. Otherwise, she was -never- at our location. The manager who did my annual review wasn't even working for Regions by the time I got the review, and she didn't leave any notes to explain why she had evaluated me as she did. The person who went over the review with me couldn't tell me anything about why the manager in question rated me the way she did. I didn't once see an opportunity for advancement within the company locally in the year and a half I worked for Regions. To have a hope of moving up, you really need to relocate to Birmingham, and no, Regions doesn't pay for relocation costs."
good,"When I first got the job, it was great. All the people I work with at different branches are nice. They expect a lot out of you especially in referrals and sales, if you don’t meet or exceed your quota per quarter your job is always on the line. I’ve seen too many good people leave and go to other banks and they are much happier. I started out part time over 2 years ago and I’m still part time. They are great when they need you to cover another branch but when they don’t need you anymore, you go back to feeling like it’s not worth it. The pay should be more for what is expected of you."
good,I love the job. I love my clients. The goals and expectations are not bad at all but the management of my area are awful. Demeaning and motivated with fear vs encouragement. Just plain awful to work for.
good,Lots of changes happening with a shift to a much younger workforce. Lots of experience leaving the bank with old school people that have weathered lots of years leaving.
good,"Working at Regions was just another typical day.  It was fun in the beginning when I started because I was able to bring my skills from bankruptcy, collections by helping people to get their credit back on track so that when they wanted to buy a home or perhaps just get a loan they would not be turned down.  Made customer feel special and on first name basis's... the goals, values and mission there kind of took a different turn on what they meant and therefore I had to reevaluate my goals and career and felt that it was time to consider a career change.  The hardest part was understaffed and the most enjoyable part was meeting new people from all walks of like and being able to help them."
good,I do not want to voice my opinion about working for Regions Bank. My experience and the company as a whole is neutral. The culture was not up to par and the company did not chose to correct it.
good,It's is hard to move up in the company. Management stops you from moving up cause you all ways has to do there work even if you get up from you desk something will be waiting in your seat when you get back.
good,"Changing Rapidly digital age catching up to the industry and making walk in traffic much less. "
good,"This job is a very good position for someone that like to micro-managed and does not have a problem with being stressed out. Coming from a person with anxiety and depression, steer clear of this job"
good,"Working with customers was a joy.  Management changed with mergers, some good and not so good.  The work enviroment was great.  Some days balancing the debits and credits was challenging."
good,Daily work experience varies depending on volume of customers per branch. Good workplace culture between employees. Poor branch staffing and high employee turnover can make for unpredictable work duties.
good,It was a good big bank to start at. You learn alot fast. They have a great training program! The benefits are reasonable. The HR department was disconnected from important employee matters.
good,They try to make you sell products to individuals that don't need them no matter at what cost they want you to get the sales.  You a wrote up for not being deceiving to customers.  You get fired for doing what the managers tell you to do.  No accountability or support.
good,The people are nice. The hours are reasonable. They offer different shifts. The parking good. The cafeteria food is ok.
good,It's all about the sales numbers and less on customer service.  It used to be the other way around. The trend in banking is more toward the sales area.
good,Hard to advance in the company unless you are in with a special group.  They do very poor training of their branch managers.  I worked for the company for 5 years and had approximately 4 managers and they did a very poor job except 1 of them.
good,Government regulations have made the banking industry an extremely difficult environment to thrive and to assist those in need.  I have only been in the industry seven years but I have seen it deteriorating at a rapid rate and have been told from long time employees that it hasn't always been this way.
good,Once Regions merged with AmSouth banking changed. Regions no longer cares about the employees. They pressure everyone to meet high goals and corporate quarterly changes the payout so you may not qualify for a bonus.
good,"I felt like the smartest person in the place.  The HR manager told me that "" I could be the biggest fish in the pond or be a small fish in a big pond"" when I gave my resignation notice.  I never want to be the smartest person in the room - what benefit does that provide for me!! A relatively small regional bank compared to the others, so be mindful of that if this is what you are looking for."
good,"Typical day includes h=taking about 60-80 inbound calls a day concerning locked accounts, debit cards, ordering checks, opening new accounts, researching holds, transferring calls, handling Overdraft inquiries, Ready Advance inquiries and a host of other things.  The toughest part is when your thrown on the phones and you need a supervisor to help and you cannot find one! Or, you ask your supervisor to help and she doesn't want to take the call...But you've been on the line with an irate customer for over 30 minutes."
good,"Not too demanding, but not very challenging, and you are paid accordingly."
good,"Excellent training, great job security...advancement is slow unless you get in with the right people.  You'll make more if you jump around from bank to bank...i.e. start from a basic platform rep and get promoted to branch mgr and you'll have a ceiling on how much you can get via raise in pay but someone could leave and go to BBVA for ex, for a month, come back and come in at a pay grade commensurate to experience."
good,"Lots of paperwork you can get into trouble for the slightest mistakes. High turnover, and a lot to put up with."
good,"I would assist customers with their transactions, and help with any other banking issues they may have. I would also make customers aware of new products of the bank."
good,overall it was a fine company to work for. benefits were good and the learning experience was one I will always take with me
good,I loved working at Regions Bank formerly know as AMSouth. I had worked as a teller in a bank several years ago and things have really changed.
good,Regions seems great initially but underneath is all about it’s shareholders. Does not value good employees. It IS about how many phone calls you make and how many guides you have. Not necessarily the customers.
good,"the benefits and pay are great but they expect too much from the employees. The environment is super stressful, and management is awful. They constantly lie, scheme, and trash talk the employees. If you take a job here, I suggest taking the associate position not the specialist position, pay is the same and they expect less from you."
good,Regions was my first full time job. the experience was excited and new to me. my co workers were really nice and very easy to talk too. The enviroment was stressful at times overall a good place to start my working edventure
good,Sales expectations but no time to do it. Always short handed. Company would rather have less people helping as “tellers” and more bankers trying to get loans and credit card applications.
good,"The job was easy but annoying. If it wasn't the customers complaining about overdraft fees it was management in you ear about sales goals. "
good,"Region's Bank seems to only care about the bottom line.  This is a very pushy sales job.  Each morning, be ready for a manager to stand in front of a whiteboard and shove numbers and goals down your throat.  It is never about what you have accomplished but what more you can do now, and the bonus structure is almost not worth mentioning.  It is extremely low for your efforts.  If you exceed, all goals expect a few extra hundred each quarter.  They are never satisfied, and the pay is horrible.  I was a top performer every quarter and never appreciated.  Upper management is awful.  This company has the worst overall culture than any company I have been associated with.  I left for this reason.  My advice to Regions management would be to focus more on the quality of culture in all your branches.  This is why the company retention level is so low."
good,"I was hired for part-time. However, the turnover was very high so I ended up working way more hours than anticipated. The female drama was very high. I bounced around and worked at other locations, especially Saturday's. The work experience is good. The people you meet are awesome. However, the pay does not meet the fast-paced environment or cost of living in Pensacola area."
good,"All about bugging customers with teleconnecting calls trying to get them to apply for credit cards, loans, mortgage referrals, checking accounts, savings accounts, etc. They want you to talk to customers about products while working on their transactions and when mistakes are made they don't realize that you're trying to fulfill all these mandatory things they want you to do all at once. They don't pay extra for Vault Tellers. I had to be the Vault Teller and operate a cashbox at the same time. They expected me to make 5 teleconnecting calls Per day, order money for the bank, handle customer transactions, open checking and savings accounts on the desk side, work lobby and drive thru. I would be the only teller on the cash line and that would leave me with bad customer reviews on Gallup surveys because I literally ran back and forth helping customers in the drive thru and lobby. I would not recommend working here unless you like pushing sales. I like to be personable with customers and build true relationships this bank wants you to pretend like you're interested in customers lives and prey on them until they agree to apply for a loan, credit card, etc. I never received pay for traveling to my training either. This bank was my first bank job and I know not all banks are ran like this but I won't be working at another one."
good,"Regions as a company offers great benefits such as: 401k, health/dental, vacation, and other perks. "
good,"The new open office floor-plan is a real detriment to personal productivity. It does increase collaboration, but people who need quiet for their jobs are out of luck if you are working at the downtown headquarters."
good,"Regions typically does not promote from within. Their new training program to follow their one-banking initiative is a wreck as well. That said, there are many open positions and once hired you'll generally benefit from consistent hours and job security."
good,It’s a good start if ur just getting into banking. If this is the field that you want to be in learn what you can and then take that where you wanna go. Some people are lifers and others are not.
good,the coworkers were the best part of the job but once concern management came in it was difficult to work in a environment where people were shady and haters
good,Regions bank has some great opportunities for people who are interested in it. The branch I worked had some fantastic people who worked there and each person really cared about their customers.
good,"like high school where if you are not the ""popular kids"" then they will push you out. will make up things to get one fired or to even be looked into and not fair and consistent."
good,Frustrating workplace when goals are unattainable for bonus each quarter. Has a Wells Fargo atmosphere and don’t know what to expect each day as bank only has 4 locations in Charlotte and very hard to compete with other banks in the area. Management expectations are overwhelming/frustrating especially when bank is in a smaller market.
good,A typical day at work involved reviewing loans. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about different businesses in the southeast and the business relationships.  
good,"I am thankful for my employment opportunity at Regions Bank, but I feel that the company should make definite changes. One such change I would recommend would be an increase in pay for employees."
good,"My Manager was amazing.  During my time there, people I worked with were the reason to stay.  Left due to illness but continue to stay in touch with those I worked with."
good,The job was very stressful and a lot of micromanaging which is very annoying. You do have the opportunity to get a lot of overtime which most people like if they couldn't get the big incentive. I loved my manager and my team. I just didn't care for pushing sells. If you are a person that loves to sell and very pushy. It's a great job for you but not for a person like me who's a problem solver.
good,"One of the ""values"" of Regions is to ""Put people first"".  That is a confusing message, because it doesn't apply to employees, but customers and shareholders."
good,"Regions as a whole is good, but in South Florida the employees are not cared for as much.  Tellers are asked to do the work of both tellers and bankers while getting paid much less than bankers.  We must be the secretaries, tellers, operations managers, and even bankers by opening accounts and ordering debit cards all while being paid the least of anyone in the bank.  Everyone in corporate acknowledges that we have the most difficult job of anyone but then does nothing to compensate us for it.  The company provides a lot of vacation days and sick days, and even has a week dedicated to appreciating employees with free food, but when the pay is low and the incentive payout is minimal, the one week a year doesn't seem like much."
good,"Working as a Teller at Regions can be very stressful. The hours are sometimes erratic, and sometimes you have to work six days a week. It's only saving grace are the small raises they would give throughout the year."
good,"My employment at REGIONS has been eventful. I have had more managers come and go than years of service.  The benefits are not bad, but the pay is. Training here is ongoing. Compliance training, mostly. I never looked at this as a negative.  What is negative is the way the Tellers are being treated.  Referrals and sales come before anything else. Our operations managers are becoming sales coaches.   I am more operations-minded than sales oriented.  Regions in the West Florida area had all associates take the Strength Finders test.  My top five are:  Consistency, Empathy, Intel lectionary, Learner and Relator."
good,"Working as a teller at Regions was a decent position for me during early college years, but I would not recommend it for someone looking for a lucrative career. Tellers have high turnover for a reason: strict adherence to the every rule and regulation, minimal autonomy, low pay, and minimal time off. I felt consistently ""job scared"" and broke while I worked here; although, I gained some valuable lessons and experience during my time."
good,Regions branches are a great place for a person first job. Not a place to raise a family or support a home. I'm a single mother with a daughter in private school and would appreciate more income.
good,"No one seems to able to give a direct answer to a question. The environment in the contact center is definitely an us vs. them attitude when it comes to the branches. Customers are consistently give incorrect information and upper management is definitely lacking. There is a good work/life balance but it doesn't do much good because the pay is terrible. They like to tell you they promote from within but it's all a lie. Sales goals are constantly changing and have recently become unattainable, making it difficult to make any personal financial decisions."
good,"work days are busy, management needs training classes, work culture is ok, the hardest part of the job is coping with management and the most enjoyable part of the job is accomplishing my daily task and going home."
good,I was a part time teller while finishing school and the job started out ok but then dwindled from there. You aren't given too many high expectations at first because you're new and the referrals goal isn't as high and as strict as most banks. I liked the branch manager but I always had problems with the head tellers. The first head teller I worked with was lazy. She would sit down and be on her phone and when customers would come up she wouldn't even acknowledge them so I was always having to pick up the slack. My transaction count was always almost double her and I was only there 25 hrs. She also always acted like she was doing reports all day which in reality only takes 15 min. But she would milk it and. She always tried to talk to me about referrals and how I needed more but never once did I hear her have conversations with customers but yet somehow she always met well above her goal. I'm 99% sure one of the bankers was always giving referrals to her so she could meet her goal. My next head teller actually worked more and did have conversations with people but she thrived on power and always tried to assert dominance. I was always micromanaged by head tellers. I feel like banking is an industry where people get roles where they're over people where they wouldn't normally be in other corporate companies so they go crazy and ruin the job for other teller. There's always such an incredibly high turnover rate.
good,"Co workers friendly"
good,All I would like to say pertaining to the employment at Regions Bank is that it is sufficient for obtaining experience in an advancing finance career.
good,"I enjoy my job when I am able to collect money to reach my incentive mark every month, if possible. I is a quiet environment and cant get your work done without any disturbances."
good,There was no room for growth. It's a great company to work for though. Its just your typical bank environment. I was glad they opened the door for me in the banking industry.
good,"I believe Regions is a great place to work, my co workers were wonderful we protected eachother. The only down fall was management seems they had people in place that only cared about numbers and not the associates or the customers."
good,handling customer complaints. Helping with their electronic need getting online and selling additional products.        Enjoyed talking to different people
good,"The branch I work for seemed AMAZING when I first started out. As time went on, people began to show their true colors... I couldn't do anything without getting messages and constant criticism from management. Any time they asked for ideas on how to improve sales/service our ideas were invalidated saying ""that wont work"" etc, before they had even tried it or gave it a chance. They weren't team players and wanted the tellers help with meeting their goals but were not willing to help us by DOING THEIR JOB and making follow ups with our referrals. I really wanted to enjoy working here, but the experience I have had makes me want to leave and never come back."
good,"Created spreadsheets using Excel, with imported data from Access. Prepared penetration reports for upper management and these reports were placed on our Departments web site by me."
good,"Regions Financial provides excellent compensation and benefits.  The opportunity to increase compensation was available by meeting loan goals, customer retention, branch growth and sales of securities and annuities.  The most difficult part of my job was maintaining a good job work/life balance.  I enjoyed working with the customers and assisting clients attain their financial goals."
good,"good company overall, technology and products are good however expectations for managers are not reasonable with the staffing model"
good,A Typical day at work includes opening and helping customers via drive thru or lobby. Working on compliance and audit requirements as well as inbound calls that are coming in. Every day is different and you never know what to expect which makes the job more memorable. Helping customers of all kinds is an incredible feeling.
good,"Selling bank products and supporting the sales of the branch associates. Creating a coaching process for both platform and teller positions to ensure that associates are equipped with the tools to make them successful.  Achieving individual sales goals and making sure the branch is running to its full operational potential. Making sure all customer and associate issues are resolved in a peaceful manner while Branch Manager is absence.  Monitoring the quality levels of the branch services and coaching the staff to achieve branch sales and service goals when new products are rolled out.  Assisting the branch manager in scheduling staff, making selection decisions while reviewing and counseling staff.   My job also included, taking in large sums of money and multi-tasking on a daily basis"
good,"Regions does not have job security,Mangement is like a revovling door"
good,"- Typical Day at Work:"
good,Great health benefits a definite improvement from my last job.
good,A typical day at regions is very stressful because the managers are very petty about everything. I love my co workers we all work together and get along with one another.
good,Professional work environment always.   Job focus is analytics and federal reporting.   Also constant review and updating of bank policies as they to regulation changes
good,"If you need a job you can def get one here.  Turnover is imminent.  Salary is mediocre, benefits are great so I suppose the that outweighs the salary for some."
good,"Customer Service for me is a top priority.  I used a computer based system to cash checks, deposits, withdrawals, & all banking transactions.  I was part of a Key 3 Leadership program & coached & assisted two tellers.  I was acknowledged with an Excellence Teller Award for meeting all my quarterly goals with a perfect 1600 scorecard.  Most enjoyable part of my job was interaction with the customers & making sure their needs were met to the best of my ability."
good,It was a great place to work! Not much room for advancement. Hardest part was the hours. 7am-6:15 pm Monday through saturday. One day off a week. No organization from managers. Constant confusion in leadership. High turnover rate.
good,"I worked in a bank that was stuggling, there was a problem in the branch that caused turn over. We had 3 managers in the 6 months I was there. I loved the work. It was something new for me I have been in retail so it was a nice change. I enjoyed the hours and the customers. The hardest part of the job was matching the process to sales. As a teller I had a sales goal as well as a transaction goal. As well as control of as much as thirty thousand in cash."
good,"There's a lot of favoritism, not a lot of opportunity for advancement."
good,"Being a teller is cool however the pay is low. Offering a 2% is unacceptable for a billion dollar corporation. There are weekly sales goals that have to be meet and it can cost you your job if you do not try to attempt, meet, or exceed the goals. It can be stressful if you allow it to be but overall it wasn't that bad."
good,Good values and business model. Unfortunately systems are not advanced and there is little in the way of departmental support and training.
good,I enjoyed working at the bank. Loved helping all my customers and getting to know them.
good,"It is a 99% sales job. Selling products (checking accounts, credit cards, etc.). You’re promised a bonus if you achieve goal, but goal keeps getting increased and profit-equivalents keeps getting lower. You will spend your days and weeks making phone calls. "
good,Management was not in place during my time with regions which made it very hard for me to advance.  I spent more time at regions without a manager than with a manger.
good,"It is an ok place to work present culture is troubling. Not a very inspiring atmosphere at the present. Seems to be an unstable career venture at the moment, due to reorganization. Lot of talent looking for alternative employment. Recent actions tend to be leading to offshore contracting on the information and technology front."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers and forming a relationship with them.  The work place was not a team effort it was more of popularity and very uncomfortable on a daily basis.
good,Slow paced environment most of the time. Teamwork is a most for those mid-day rush. Goals needs to be met but too much pressure isn't applied. Incentive opportunities available.
good,"Our day stars with a morning huddle where associates make their commitments for the day. Sometimes, before closing we have an afternoon huddle to see how the associates did. We have scheduled choreography for the day and goals that we should meet. The most enjoyable part of my day is the interaction with customers. The hardest part of the job is everything is monitored and critiqued."
good,"The company does have very good benefits and pretty good job security for the most part. It depends on manager/group, but there are some options to work remotely or to have flexible hours. For most roles your job is fairly secure. There is no opportunities for advancement within my division. I have great performance reviews and feedback, yet there is nowhere to go. You have to put your ""time in"" which means make it to age 50 and you might get a change to lead/manage. The recent ""Simplify & Grow"" initiative made this worse by requiring managers to have X number of direct reports. It eliminated junior managers. The majority of managers today are at or near retirement age."
good,the direction of the company seemed to change several times a year that leaves you insecure of your job position.  Management changes and they have let go a lot of people who have worked there for more than 20 years.
good,"Since I have been here, I have seen several things change with the company some I agree with others I did not. But I do hope that it works out best for the employees that remain with the company."
good,"You have to be ready for anything. "
good,"yearly we have a week of fun it call Evergreen week. Regions is a good company to work for. I have been at Regions Bank 30 years. and planing to be here longer,more."
good,Fun place to work but just no money in retail banking. If you live a debt free life it’s kinda hard to sell loans to people. Not much ch for advancement
good,"Love my co-workers (except manager) and the regular customers I see, but the only thing that is keeping me at Regions is the benefits. Everyday I feel as if I'm not good enough and it really digs in when we receive low survey scores (must receive 5 stars, otherwise employees receive 0's.) We're constantly being criticized and asked to do more without proper compensation. Plus, you can't have a regular conversation with anyone without telling them about a product or service Regions' offers.Customers don't want to have products pushed everytime they come to see us. If you don't mention products, get ready to have your butt chewed.  If you want to work in banking, find an institution that appreciates their employees better and actually cares about their customers."
good,"Overall Regions is a decent place to work. The hours were good and you got all holidays off. For the size of the company, they seemed to care about the people."
good,In this role I facilitated Sales Courses to all levels of the Retail Line of Business.  I also trained Situational Leadership courses to the Retail Leadership team. I thoroughly enjoyed meeting so many wonderful employees and traveling to all parts of the south eastern U.S.  I left this company due to the culture of the management team in the Learning & Development area of the bank.
good,"It was a super place to work at first because of the many great employees, but after merging with larger banks, it lost its attention to customer service."
good,The salary does not fit the job requirements. Tellers are subject to rudeness from customers and that alone is a reason the pay should be more. In my opinion.
good,"Working with and supporting the public was the most enjoyable part of this job.  However, the good ol' boy system was firmly in place during my time there.  This is when it was named Amsouth Bank.  Hopefully the workplace culture, like the organization's name, have evolved."
good,"Many after hours call sessions if branch is not achieving goals"
good,"The people are very nice and is a very good Bank for the clients. Compensation is very low compare to the industry standards. Is not a bad institution, just needs to step up the game."
good,"Wait on customers, daily reports, open and close branch, oversee daily operations of the branch, hold security meetings. Best thing is have met quite of few coworkers and customers I can call family"
good,Regions is a great place to work. There are plenty of opportunities to grow there and the associates are great to work with. I highly recommend applying for a position with Regions.
good,Regions is a good place to work and I enjoyed my time there. Management at my location was not all that great. It is hard to go to work where you do not feel like management cares about you. The goals are very very high.
good,Employees are expected to carry their weight as well as others in their dept.  They are given more projects then they can handle at a time which causes each project to lack quality attention.  Unrealistic deadlines are provided and when not reached it's the employees fault not the department or manager.
good,"The people are great. Every September Evergreen. Great Benefits."
good,A high pressure sales environment related to the amount of bank products that must be sold quarterly. Key leadership is lacking. Salaries are relatively low.
good,"very stable company.  advancements are possible after several years. You can find a lot of good, hard working co-workers at Region."
good,Enjoyed  working four days a week .The hardest part working was the long  drive.Co-worker were okay. A typical day was sorting and opening mail.
good,No opportunity for advancement unless you are willing to relocate to Birmingham. I enjoy my co-workers & the variety of customers I meet on a daily basis
good,Great place for someone new to break into banking.  Otherwise if you are a longtime banker I would suggest you look else where.  The pay is low and no room to advance.  The work politics are deep rooted here.  Human Resources does not play fair and upper management is aggressive and have a work horse mentality.
good,"A very solid company. They have accumulated numerous recent awards and a company that has a lot going for it. The CEO is very personable, down to earth, and very informative."
good,Overall decent company. The contact center just isn't a long term job. It is more of a stepping stone to get you to another level by building your resume.
good,A typical day includes having our morning sales meeting to start the day. Then we set our sales goals for the day and open the bank for business. We have a afternoon and evening huddle to review our day.
good,"* OK pay for part time job $15 hour as banker"
good,No longer customer oriented . More about sales and the bottom line. Pressure and scare tactics.
good,"A typical day consist of great time management, which is something I learned more in depth about 5 years ago through my management training program.  It allowed me to prioritize all my daily task, interact with my staff and my customers without ever feeling pressed for time. The hardest part of my job would have to when I would deal with a customer struggling with a lost of a love one and trying to take care of that love ones financial business.  I love the interaction not only with my customers but I really enjoyed working with my staff.  Teaching and coaching them on a daily basis, was a true highlight.  I truly beleive in associate engagement, having a fully engaged associates; is a great feeling."
good,I've worked for this company for nearly 10 years and if anyone is considering applying for a job with this company needs to understand that they will be working in and walking into a High Pressure Sales Environment on just about every level. Growth is the game!
good,a lot of turnover and couldn't build a relationship with coworkers.
good,I worked there while I was in high school. It was ok for that time in my life.
good,"While at work, I complete task such as handling customer service. I fill out forms and balance money drawers and vaults. I also file paper work and organize our information box. I am skilled on different programs on the computer and am excellent on the 10-key."
good,"Enjoyed working with the public. Not all co workers were nice, but most were. it was a position I felt I could have advanced in."
good,co-worker's aren't all qualified for job.  they don't listen to anything management tells them.  too much drama in the branches with little actions taken again the problem starters.
good,"A typical day at work consists of assisting customers, counting money, reports, meetings."
good,"When working at Regions, we were fortunate to have a department where all the managers were friends as well as co-workers.  When one department needed help, everyone would pitch in to get the project completed.  Every manager had a minimum of twenty years of banking experience and was able to fill in for any other manager.  Most of the projects were mergers and bank acquisitions and it took everyone working together for a successful completion.  We worked many, many hours, but after the completion, there was time for dinners out and social events.  "
good,Great place to work! I had an amazing manager. The benefits and customers were great
good,"Stressful workplace."
good,I learned how to process loans daily. To be scan for the scanner each day.
good,Hired as customer service rep and later left as sale rep due to company changes. Pay was decent but the company lacks integrity. The encourage coercing customers into credit and make idle threats about firing if you don't do so.
good,Behind on product development; average management; good work life balance
good,"Company overll is good, with strong corporate support.  Great people to work with."
good,No real opportunities for advancement. Management can be biased based on personal likes and dislikes instead of performance.
good,"Fun place to work, good people. Smaller, more straight forward branch environment as opposed to a large office, or call center. Solid schedule, which does imply overtime can be a big issue. Biggest concern is four different Managers in less than two years. It makes for a lot of stress when one person after another comes in and not knowing what kind of mess they're going to have to clean up. Since it's a small branch, the problems can cascade from one person to another in no time. Another concern is that all the branches seem to be way understaffed. Very bad for the clients/customers. They may have thought they were saving by cutting corners here and there, but it clearly has cost in the long run, and will continue to do so in the future."
good,Didn't really have a problem with this company I just moved out of state and wanted to try something else. Everyone was really nice at the location I worked at
good,It used to be employee friendly. It changed. The customers are just a number now instead of a person. Turn over is high in employees because the goals are incredibly high and unattainable.
good,Regions is a fine place to work however I prefer working for a credit union.   My experience with Regions was fine but the banking industry is much different than the credit union industry.
good,Not always fair across there board. The pay and compensation was not all that great and could have been much better. The pay was not fairly distributed.
good,"The branch I worked at was fast paced, which taught me the skill of multi tasking. My coworkers all worked together as a team. Overall I enjoyed working there."
good,Job was hectic but rewarding.  Dealing with customers was the most enjoyable part.  Management for the most part was good.  Working atmosphere was favorable.
good,I enjoyed for the most part my time with the company.  The training is very intense to ensure you are knowledgeable of what is expected of you.  I've met some amazing people there.
good,It was a very calm and collected place to work. I was placed at a slow paced branch so for my personality it was boring but it was a great company to work for.
good,"Slower pace than the major players. Less sales pressure, which is great, but compensation tends to reflect as such. Technology is still quite behind. Seems to be caught between wanting to be a major corporate bank, but trying to cling to their Southern, small-town roots. As the great Brittany Spears once said, ""I'm not yet a girl, not yet a woman."""
good,Environment varies from department to department so management styles appear to be the biggest determining factor for how your work environment will function.
good,It was hard to work when it was understaffed. There is a lot of required  training throughout the year that had to be done while still doing your day to day job. The nice part was getting two personal days included with vacation.
good,I had great co workers and enjoyed the customers. Loved my manager. Dislike the  directions  Regions bank is headed with customers service.  But I do understand you have to keep up with the times and times are now more  Digital banking and not the  one on one face-to-face .
good,They are a nice employer for a job but not for a career. Nice benefits and open space environment.  Nice people for the most part.  Enjoyed volunteering for the Regions Tradition.
good,This bank was profit driven and really expected too much out of the employees. The pay was extremely low for the average banker. We had a lot of customers move their accounts because they were being bugged by the telemarketing department.
good,"While working with Regions, I feel that I was not utilizing my full potential. I met my goals, assisted my manager and assistant Manager with duties and was never recognized for my achievements."
good,Provide customer service in a retail banking setting to leverage relationships to grow business within personal and business sectors using knowledge of banking products and current rates and promotions.  Provide financial advice to determine lending solutions while following fair lending practices and financial growth.  Perform loan closing activities and daily account maintenance for customers while leveraging referrals to Regions business partners.
good,"The position that I held was customer based and while I enjoyed the customer interaction, I didn't enjoy make calls to customers to do financial reviews of their personal information over the phone, and the goal driven atmosphere."
good,"Being consistent with products and guideline across the board,everyone will to ross opportunistically was there, just needed management to take the time to train"
good,"Reasonable goal expectations, training was short and not hands-on. Great work hours. Manager was very understanding when it came to family matters. Referral system needs work."
good,While working at Regions for close to 13 years a lot changed.  The one consistent was being a team player.  The individual teams which made up the branches are what makes Regions what it is.  I use to believe the bank would be where I retired.  I use to love going to work every day.  Over the last couple years that has changed.  There is no loyalty to current employees.
good,"Great company to work for , it allowed its employees to grow from within by taking on additional projects, offering in house training, tuition reimbursement ."
good,"Good benefits, growth opportunity, succession planning.  Work life balance needs improvement,  Transparency, collaboration and engagement is the cultured, but at times are inconsistent within lines of business."
good,The job was an 8 to 5 job but there was often coming in early and working late.  My typical day was primarily at a desk working on a computer.  Phone calls and interactions with clients occured daily.
good,Interacting with customers all day long and helping with banking needs. Each employee has to to meet daily goals to meet their quarterly goal. Talking to with different people and learning about their life.
good,I have been working here for many years and have worked in many different departments.  The associates you work with are great and I enjoy my team very much.
good,"I wasn't expecting such a high end sales expectation with the position. I honestly came in with a different understanding of what I was doing. It's mostly about you making a sale versus really meeting a need.  If you are low performing, you will hear about it and really it's a numbers game in the end."
good,Where I worked was a relaxed and helpful experience. My manager would work me through any issue I had and would help me reach goals needed. The returning customer's are the ones you would build a great relationship with and that was satisfing as you knew your customers believed in you.
good,"Though I enjoyed the position of financial services specialist, I felt there was an overwhelming amount of pressure to meet unrealistic sales goals."
good,Speaking with people over the phone from all parts of the country and being able to leave them with a great feeling about their customer service experience.
good,"customer service, cash checks, make deposits, loan payments, pressure customers to take other products whether needed or not, never enough employees, stressful working conditions"
good,Learning all aspects of the banking industry. Learning how when making a deposit at one bank how it gets routed to another bank. Learning how to handle a situation if a bank robber would come up to your teller window.
good,"A typical retail banking brand, very little emphasis on employee development.  If you are fortunate enough to work under a knowledgeable management team, success can be had."
good,This was a very nice place to work.  The drive thru tellers were amazing and made what can be a very redundant job a lot of fun.  I have made lasting friendships with these women.
good,great manager while there. nice office. manager gave great work life balance. mainframe cobol cics java eclipse. cafeteria inside. building has campus style.
good,"I worked for AmSouth Bank and it was taken over by Region's before i left, therefore I never worked here.  I can not give an accurate opinion of working for this institution."
good,A typical day was pretty relaxed overall but there were frequent meetings about us meeting our numbers and the numbers set for us were most unattainable. Management was filled with good people but but did not have much flexibility when it came to personal stuff. The best part of the job was interacting with the customers but the hardest part of the job was meeting all of the unrealistic goals set for us and constantly being told we did to get better numbers.
good,sales are too much.   love the products and working with customer service.   Great benefits and vacation package.   great team building and team work.   Sales are a bit tough with their demands
good,"Regions is a nice company for a secondary income member of a household or post-college first-time job. The pay isn’t anywhere the standard it should be. The incentive payouts are mostly only reachable if you’re in an understaffed branch where you take on all walk-ins, or if you’re lucky enough to be in one of the booming branches in a big city. It’s heavily goals-based & becoming ever more micromanaged. Employees are not considered in decision-making. “Simplify & Grow” is the new tag line, but really all that means is more responsibly & pressure with relatively no offsetting benefit. "
good,"The people at the bank were great people and were very helpful. However, there was no room for advancement and in fact when there was a higher position available it was given to an outsider that came from another bank on more than one occasion. It wasn't a hard job, but it wasn't very rewarding either."
good,Worked with a motivated team to reach goals. This made for a fun work environment because we kept on challenging each other to help everyone on the team to reach their goals.
good,"I loved the people I worked for at regions, however the opportunity for advancement was slim too none in the state of FL, also the pay raises where also almost non existentt  my manager was wonderful but company policies where not always family friendly"
good,"Much Pressure as a teller because the company needs new customers."
good,"Regions has a good culture and works hard  to implement diversity in their workforce.  There is opportunity for advancement, but you have to work hard and be good at networking."
good,"Regions Bank is a good company to work for and they provide benefits that include 401k, health care, dental insurance, and eye care.  Regions provides  paid vacation time and sick time."
good,"The work experience at Regions since 2009 is essentially what the work experience was at AmSouth Bank prior to 2009. It can be stressful, there is not a lot of advancement, and management decisions will not always make sense."
good,Very aggressive middle/upper management. Constant pressure down the line to produce and very little recognition when you did. A lot of interpersonal rivalries between upper management.
good,Very fast paced sales environment. Calls are monitored. Maybe took 100-200 calls a day. The management never liked to answer escalated calls. Felt like we were forced to sell to customers that didnt necessarily need the product
good,Navy Federal is a good place to work but it very cut throat and competitive so it makes it hard to come to work knowing everyone is out for your job as well.
good,"I enjoy people and interaction with the public. I learned how to be tactful when dealing with finances. I also learned how to buy and sell foreign currency. "
good,This is a good paying bank and good benefits and the stress of selling products and put on quota's was very cutthroat.  It was very stressful in trying to reach their goals and the customers were tried of being ask every time they came in.  It didn't really notice good customer services.  It was all about numbers and goals pressured constantly.  Had a lot of turnover in upper management.
good,This is a very fast paced job. Worked on weekends and employees were required to get a specific number sales in order to maintain position. Employment here can be very stressful.
good,I learned a lot by necessity and without a lot of direction. Not enough product knowledge training.  Pay too little especially for what they expect of the employees.  Very nice people to work with in general though.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company because I was able to learn so much about the professional atmosphere. I was a great vault teller and loved helping the front tellers and assisting the customers, I also enjoyed the sales of the competions with in the banks and the branches."
good,help customers deposit and also withdraw money from their account. Also had to keep up with paper work for each transaction. Verify checks are valid..
good,My only work experience with the company was two internships. I interned as a Teller and in the Accounts Payable department. After college I interviewed for several jobs and was not selected.
good,It was long days and busy. as an employee you are required to refer 5-7 people a day to the desk side and many days that was very hard due to the repeat customers.
good,I wouldn't say this was a bad job but the opportunity for growth was limited and the pay wasn't as you would expect. But for someone just seeking work for now then here's your place!
good,"My branch had no assistant manager to help with regulatory audits. The Bank manager quit after he wasn't promoted, we had only one teller who had to function in the drive thru and lobby and run the vault by herself. The regional manager was not with the company long after my manager went to BoA. After I was hospitalized, a new BCM was hired but quit also. The branch ultimately closed down. "
good,There were parts of my job that I loved but the corporate culture of sale it even if you feel the customer doesn't need it and the constant manipulation of sales goals became more stressful than I could bear.
good,Great first job with great pay at the time. Room for advancement. Management was good. Didn’t like the pushing sales on people daily and the quota I had to meet.
good,"On the square in Oxford, MS. Doesn't get much better. The job was fun. My first real job out of college. Boss was a bit of a micro manager. Liked my coworkers."
good,"The bank was an ok place to work, the pay wasn't that good but the benefits were really good, you have to meet sales goals every week, I enjoyed being in the drive thru and helping my clients"
good,"I would get to work with another employee to open the bank. We would unlock the vaults, get our pans, then get the night depository bags and start working on them. The manager at the time was pretty good. The culture of the bank was very competitive. We were always having to sell products and services to the customers. It was very frustrating to get the customer to agree to a service and the customer service rep would not follow up on the lead, therefore I would not receive credit for the sale. I enjoyed my customers."
good,"Teams worked in-coming calls & provided customer service for bank's clients. Call volume was often heavy, and the work was very structured. Everyone took breaks at the same time as their team; there was very little flexibility. Management seemed to understand the work could be stressful, and they tried to make the job interesting, and the work environment pleasant."
good,"•	Supervised and scheduled ten employees of a bank branch. "
good,As long as you are producing product sales you will have a pleasant time working here. If you do your job and work hard the bank is very loyal to you .
good,"My original Branch Manager was wonderful, she had full respect and knew I could do my job plus more.  A new manger came in and wanted me gone so she could bring her own girl in.  I loved my job but then the enjoyment was gone."
good,Regions is a nice company to work for. You will learn a lot about federal regulations as they relate to banking. The hardest part of of the job is simply retaining all the knowledge.
good,"the people were great to work for, but they were sometime unorganized the management was horrible especially the manager for the tellers because she had no idea what she was doing"
good,"I am biased because I am certainly not a sales person and this job was NOT for me. As a teller, you are required to make a minimum number of sales referrals per quarter. This is extremely difficult, especially in a smaller town. As a teller, you will see the same customers every day. They get tired of you constantly pushing them to open more accounts. ALSO, at the time I worked here, Regions had a customer service rating system which was terrible. We had a script we had to read EXACTLY. If our customer service score was not perfect, we would be accused of not reading the script exactly as written. As I said before, we saw the same customers every day. You get to know these people, and they know you are reading a script. It sounds fake to them. They get tired of hearing it. In the drive through, I would have people drive away as I was still trying to shout my last few lines at them! We also had to take part in reviewing each other's script reading. We had to do multiple reviews a day, even on our busiest days! This place is ridiculous and I would not recommend trying to get a job as a teller here. It is simply not worth it."
good,left due to bad management. lots of layoffs while i was there. new manager was replacing the old staff with employees that she wanted. it was a very hostile environment.
good,The company stifled you with numbers to meet. More number driven than employee driven. I hope it gets back to what it use to be.l I use to like the place.
good,"Working with the public is never ""easy,"" but dealing with the public and their money is taking it to a new level.  I did learn a lot about finances that has helped me in my other careers."
good,"This place is salllllllleeesss driven down to the entry level teller, you are expected to sale!! I've been with the company two years and simply said they treat their long time employees bad ! Will pay someone off the street twice as much as you'll make to do the same job. BUT there is room for advancement!!! You will be micromanaged... observation after observation! Expect you to sound like a robot!! And give you really high unachievable goals"
good,I monitor and maintain the cash totals in the branch incoming and outgoing. I also balance my own cash box along with the vault. All while maintaining a relationship with the customers and meeting their needs.
good,Working at the contact center was really tough. It was mandatory to answer an average of 200 calls per work shift. They also have really ridiculous sales goals to meet. They provide you with pretty nice commission though.
good,You deal with a lot of rude and angry people on a daily basis because you can't always do anything for every customer.  You will have a few good customers.
good,Regions was a great place to work. The environment was pleasant and the managers and coworkers were easy to get along with. A typical day at regions consisted of speaking with account holders and assisting them in whatever they needed with their accounts. Regions merged with another bank by the name of Independent and laid us off to never bring us back. I would definitely work there again!
good,It was not my favorite place to work.  Changed Managers too often. Required to push product sales. Loved my customers. They would allow others to go ahead of them so I could take care of them.
good,There was more pressure in sales on the teller end of the position. The clients were reluctant to take advise from the Teller making it hard to meet the quote for sales for the month.
good,"It was a fun place to work in the beginning.   Very good to the employee's, however they are wrapped in the big corporate world of micro managing.  Like to be seen in the community"
good,I worked for Regions Bank in the Corporate Security department for a number of years. My department was outsourced to Diebold Incorporated in 2012. I enjoyed my time with the company.
good,"The management in the different departments will determine their own management styles "
good,"Having worked for another bank, I was surprised (at least for my area) the lack of technology being used.  The benefits however are stellar, and hard to be matched.  From I've been told, Regions is a ""good old boys"" bank, however I believe this culture is slowly changing.  Overall, great employer if you're willing to put your hard work."
good,"Hours are great....compensation can be great if you make your goal. huge diversity in coworkers, hardest part would be trying to convince a customer that they need a product.  Easiest part enjoying the customers and becoming friendly with them."
good,Large southern based Bank.  Was AmSouth Bank at the time that I worked for them.  Focused on sales.  Never fun to call someone during dinner and ask them about Annuities.  Seemed like the goals only got more difficult as these sales driven banks are apt to do.  Luckily hasn't turned into a current Wells Fargo situation.
good,"Regions Bank has many commendable areas.  With the retail practices, products and services as well as the training available, makes Regions a highly competitive bank to work for."
good,"Conducted performance reviews"
good,This company is a leader in some markets and less than a player in other markets. The people  who have worked there more than 3 years believe the vision of the company.
good,Good place to start a career a typical work day consist of 40-50 customers a day with regular transactions. Working with this company has been good so far .
good,Regions is a good starter bank. It is not as large as some of the other banks but it will teach you the necessities you will need in banking. It is overall ok.
good,Typical day would start with a meeting. I was also assigned to the UAT team. Learnt a lot in terms of how to manage time and prioritize work.
good,A typical day at Region Bank was very fast pace and meeting dead- line and i learned that you should not have a problem working to help someone.  Management was great and co-worker didnt mind helping.  The hardest part of the job was late nights and the enjoyable part was to see your pay check after the late nights.
good,"Folks at the bank are generally very friendly. "
good,"The job was great, good compensation (especially of you have a degree), meet lots of people, but management is what drives good people away!"
good,Love the training that this company provided. Lots of good inform on how to be a great customer service. Have the best time with customers helping them to manage their finances. To see the trust of those customers is very rewarding.
good,This was a good place to gain experience in various areas of banking.  The benefits were comparable to other banks.  The pay was less than desired.
good,"A typical day would be doing deposits for businesses from the night before, deposits and withdrawals throughout the day, selling money orders/cashiers checks,balancing your drawer and running payments for mortgages/loans. I learned a lot about banking that i didn't know, and i realized bank tellers do a lot more than most people probably realize. I really like the coworkers. My experience may be different because i started out with no manager, and my mentor quit after i was there for 3 weeks. The computers went down the first week i was on the line, and i was immediately hounded about referrals my second week. Those things probably contributed a lot for me not enjoying it from the start. The hardest part for me is referrals. If you are not into sales and don't like being a salesman then its not for you. I think they are too demanding on their referral goals. The most enjoyable part is the people. Some people make it really enjoyable talking to and helping them. To me its not personal enough i come from a background in hair-styling which is much more intimate. Some people are really rude and impatient. Sometimes there is alot of double standards (doing things for certain customers that you dont for others) i understand they want good customer relationships i just think rules should apply to everyone no matter what because when you start new and dont know customers they get mad when you dont know that so and so does this or that for them."
good,"I loved working for the company. I left because the company does not promote from within first, the company will bring in new people to be trained. The divisional operations team was not supportive."
good,On a daily basis the work pace was either too slow or much too busy. Coworkers were good to work with as a team. Managers were supportive
good,"Regions bank provided a pleasant environment for its customers.  I learned a lot about banking while being employed with the company.  The management team was not the best, but I have seen worse.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the public and providing their needs with a smile."
good,"You will take many calls about balance and overdraft fees.  You will also need to sell products to the same customers upset about the fees.  Some great managers, some not so."
good,"Decent company, management was a bit unstable. Overall good experience with Regions. Work life balance is as expected, being able to move up ultimately depends on management in overseeing area."
good,Regions bank became to large and was given no chance for a person to advance.  Was asked to do the work or 2 but did not get a raise for doing extra work.
good,"As a customer service representative.  Taking call from customer, helping them with their account.  Opening and closing account.  Issuing credit cards, changing address."
good,The corporate structure of the bank is poor.  Upper management is not involved in the local branch structure and they should be.
good,Overall Regions was a good place to work. Lots of opportunity for business as Regions was firmly planted in the community.
good,the hours are absolutely the best in the industry it allows for a great work life balance and they promote taking care of their employees
good,This was a typical bank environment. Performed transactions for customers ranging from deposits to cashing checks. Balanced cash drawers as well as ATM machine.
good,"Good place to work before the economic downturn. In addition, Regions and AmSouth merged making the work environment unstable. A number of employees took resignation payments to leave Regions."
good,I worked here for about 6 months. I thought I was doing well then I was let go for a miscalculation. It was not meant for me. I enjoyed working with people and learning about finance. The company blamed me for something I didn't do so I was let go.
good,"Regions is a really good company. They have great benefits and a good system in place for employees. However, the management is filled with lazy people. I guess you could say that every where... I liked it, however, they expect to much from their sales reps."
good,"A typical day as a teller starts with opening the vault and getting cash boxes out. After that I will run reports for the day before and sort papers accordingly. "
good,"Regions is a good place to work and mostly enjoyed working with my co-workers.  The benefits was great, but as time went on, they got a little cheaper."
good,"Main duties as a drive up teller include cashing checks for account holders, depositing checks, transfer of funds and withdrawals.  My duties also include helping with the night deposits, assisting customers in their safe deposit boxes, answering the phone and directing account holders to the correct banker for their needs. It has been most rewarding working with the hearing impaired customers as they have taught me some ALS which I have always wanted to learn.  All in all it's been an amazing group of account holders to assist on a daily basis."
good,I enjoyed the work I did.  The people I worked with were easy to work with.  I had good benefits.  The only reason I am no longer working there is due to my job being eliminated.  My job was not the only one that was eliminated.
good,The people that work at Regions in a whole are very polite some are even caring. The advancement opportinity is is not what you would expect for such a large company. The management varies from good to average and in some cases it is excellent. The hardest part of my job isnot be able to help everyone all the time.
good,I loved my job until I was fired for being sick. It had amazing benefits. I would recommend regions to many people. Minus the being sick policy.
good,"A typical day of work for me consists of opening the branch/vaults, processing night deposit bags, setting up station for the day. I then begin to assist clients in their banking needs and also try to refer and cross sell other products and services while remaining focused on present transactions so ensure accuracy. I am the operations manager of the branch and therefor I have quite a few reports I have to pull and reconcile on excel daily. I am also the teller manager and I have to be there for support and overrides for my tellers. All the meanwhile answering the phone,balancing my cash box, ordering foreign currency,coaching my tellers, doing the teller schedule etc."
good,"Co-workers worked well with each other, we had a good operation, everyone knew their role in our operation. Evergreen Day (a week of appreciation dedicated to the employees) made it a fun week."
good,"To assist customers with the many products that our company offers as a federal bank."
good,"Sales meeting - conference call - business development calls - branch sales and growth.  "
good,Work life balance. Great hours. Off every holiday. good benefits. Great people.
good,"Great company"
good,More competitive between representatives than as a unit vs other banks.
good,"There are many daily challenges of this job, but if you are focused this job can be rewarding, You meet so many people from all walks of life, which is great. The hardest part of this job is dealing with irate customers but you learn to stay calm and handle the situation to the best of your ability, and sometimes it works itsekf out. l"
good,Regions is a fun place to work and has outstanding associates.
good,"Since you are commission based with a draw it's dependent upon your daily routine and activities as to how much money you earn.  The mortgage business was a great way to earn money before the market collapsed.  Due to the low draw, I was forced to leave for a higher paying more stable position.  If you like going out and catering to real estate agents, builders, etc. This is the job for you.  It's a must to get your name out there and build client relationship or you will make little to no money.  Definitely flexible.  Requires some detailed processing of loan application but the automated underwriting systems give you quick results as long as you have gathered and keyed the correct information."
good,"The company itself is a great one for which to work, including great hours, benefits, 401k match, etc. The job itself is terrible.  It is great if you want to be a robot.  That is not particularly my style.  If you love meetings, conference calls, and endless training, this is the place for you."
good,The bank had great work hours. There was not a lot of activity at the East Marietta branch.
good,"My team make work fun and the days just breeze by. They are a great group of people that actually know that there is no ""I"" in team."
good,High stress pressure cooker job. Stressful atmosphere. Low pay.
good,Banking has changed so much in the last couple of years due to the technology that has occured.  Being a bank teller is no longer just a teller.  They want you to be a salesman on top of it.
good,General secretarial duties were performed daily for the Corporate Tax Department.
good,"looking to move out of financial sector"
good,"the same as all banks, Try to make you customer happy. and remember were they are taken care of."
good,Not fun at all. Management very rude. Some co-workers was good. Hardest part was communication with management. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers.
good,Great place to learn different sales strategies due to coming in contact with so many different scenarios.
good,"Job consisted of auditing mortgages"
good,The team was really good and cooperative. Learned a lot about enhancing a system in this project. Friendly work environment
good,Helped fine tone my skills of networking and finding new business to bring into the bank.
good,Work was hard. I was under paid. Needed something new. Job security was a thing of the past
good,"Conducted outbound and inbound collection calls on delinquent accounts."
good,"Just typically deal with customers and make fiancial advise and do loan paperwork.  The managers were real nice and they all had one thing in common, they wanted to be productive.  I loved helping people with their issues"
good,"How a loan officer approves a loan. "
good,I work as a Vault Teller in the bank and I am the customer service rep
good,"I was teller in the drive-thru part time in the evening"
good,"It is a buddy, buddy company. You have to know someone on the inside for advancement."
good,My endeavors @ Regions Bank were great & memorable. I've learned numerous things about management. Meeting objectives & satisfying customers'.
good,The job itself is a great job to start out with. Management can be difficult to work with. 
good,"After a 90 day probation, began to advance in OTS underwriting. "
good,"I have learned a lot about how to blend customer service in a fast-paced, exacting  environment. My co-workers and I have developed teamwork and implimented procedures to make sure that we support each other, while getting the job done. Both the best and worst parts of this job is waiting on customers."
good,"I enjoyed my time with AmSouth before it became Regions.  The branches and customers were great, but advancement was not for those who worked hard, but was for those who knew someone.  Pay was reasonable, but not very competitive. "
good,"Every day I would take care of money ordering, running a teller drawer, helping each customer that came in with account inquiries, withdrawals, payments, deposits, etc.  I really loved my customers at the bank.  However, there was too much micro managing from upper management and not enough praise for good work.  I believe that too much person information was brought into the branch which made for a hostile working environment.  The hardest part was not letting management get to me on a daily basis.  The best part of my job was my customers!  "
good,"A typical day at work would spped up my productivity, due to great management, and great team work. The differant type customers would be the most challenging part of the day. The most enjoyable will be making my customers happy."
good,"District management engaged at the branch level."
good,"limited advancement opportunities."
good,Great place to work and learn about all the aspects in banking.
good,"Lots of growth opportunity, and moderate pay for the job requirements."
good,Enjoyed the training and learning process with AmSouth. Appreciate the job opportunity.
good,Run Teller window
good,It is very fun place to work and enjoyed working with all my co-workers.
good,"A fast paced environment, many changes on a daily basis with growth and addition of new products. I was really able to put my multitasking skills to use consistently. My direct manger is a very diverse individual, listens to and implements ideas with an open door policy. My co-workers and I work as a cohesive team. While wanting a greater opportunity for growth, the best part of my job is seeing my own ideas, plans processes and procedures in action on a daily basis."
good,Sales is very important being placed higher than customer service. Promotions are highly competitive.
good,"A typical day involves counting money, conducting transactions, and talking to customers all day. I've learned how to multi-task, prioritize, and deal with rejection when suggestion product referrals to customers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rejection, and accuracy with cash on busy days. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my coworkers. Luckily I'm at a branch where everyone tries to be in a good mood and everyone works together. Also, getting all federal holidays off."
good,"Pros-Solid work schedule (called bankers hours for a reason). On the management level, lots of time outside of the branch spent on growing relationships with other businesses in the community."
good,"I worked at Regions for 10 years and in my opinon its good place to work. But like most bank the focus is on sales more than service. A typical day starts at 8:30 and end at 5:30. There is a lot to learn but you have help from co-workers, online classes and seminar. The job is basicly customer service and sales. The hadrdest part of the job is trying to selling products that people are not interested in. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers.(service)"
good,Beside the poor management and lack of communication. I enjoy what I do.
good,"As I bank teller I would manage and balance my cash draw through out the day to ensure accuracy. The branch was a team where we provided customers with services to satisfy their banking needs. There were many aspects within the branch that had to be done as either a team, it could not be completed by just one person. Knowing the different products avaialble was important so that when we delt with individual accounts we culd point them in the proper product direction. There were multiple vaults that held either cash, checks, safe deposit boxes, ect., with different codes for each, which needed to be known at all times. Depending on the day of the week, I had to open or close the branch, which was very critical."
good,This was for Regions Bank Not AmSouth prior to their merger. Employer was fair on all levels.
good,Busy place work. Ran drive thru. Had great co-workers. Selling products was hardest part of the job.  Enjoyable part was interactive with the customers. I learned to appreciate a teller job is not easy.
good,"I am on time at work everyday. I do my job and don't take breaks everyday. Take 30 minutes for lunch.  Fax documents to finance managers, Call to get missed documents for dealer contract. send out notices to customers for incorrect information on the contract,Management-Help my manager solve problems, call finance managers to correct the problem.  hardest part of job-Co-workers get lazy sometimes and I have to do there jobs. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting missed documents back from dealerships to complete the funders package to book deal."
good,I worked in collateral perfection dept. Enjoyed and got along with my supervisor but mgmt. and other depts. could learn to communicate with each other.
good,"Regions seems okay in the beginning, but you quickly find out that they don’t really know what they want to do."
good,Not as good as it used to be to work for but still better than most. Really hard to move up. Can be stressful at times but teamwork is encouraged. Would recommend as a decent place to work.
good,"Meeting customers banking needs is the priority of this institution, by determining the current financial status of customers profile and offering guidance from there."
good,"I loved this job great pay, fun competitive environment, great team work, great advancement opportunity, and great leardership/ bosses. They offer lots of overtime opportunities. They are very strict on attendance. They take pride in their customer service."
good,"Regions has undergone multiple periods of downsizing and layoffs, which I should have noted prior to taking a job there. Regions really invests in its people, when they decide to keep someone. Organizational structure changes frequently, resulting in instability for employees’ job security."
good,I have been employed with Regions 11 years and my current role is my ideal career job. The workplace culture is filled with dedicated leaders with shared values that strive to help one another and make work life better for the employees.
good,Was hired into a bad situation and I would rather not elaborate. No manager was there to guide me when I began my career. I feel like I could have excelled more if there had been better management.
good,"You die if you do, you die if you don't with Regions. I was pressured to sell products and make quotas to the point that I felt I sometimes had to cross the line in order to not get fired... yet I would get in trouble for sometimes blurring the lines, if a customer understood what I was doing. That I was trying to pressure them in a product that really wasn't necessary or even beneficial to the customer. There can also be a lot of power plays inside management and I often felt like I was not being heard or backed up in order to manage my employees correctly."
good,"I was a Branch Service Leader with Regions for 4 years.  The job was eliminated this year and I am now a Financial Consultant.  I have found aspects of the job that I like, but feel that all the time spent on coaching BSL to be leaders in the company has fallen flat and are expertise is no longer needed."
good,"Answer incoming calls about accounts after verifying the person calling, was expected to upsell service and meet certain goals each week. Management was available to help you if you had any issues but encouraged you to find the answer yourself."
good,"Managed daily administrative details. Prepared weekly payroll for proof operators.Requisitioned all expense reports, calculated large lockbox deposits and processed cash  letters daily. Worked independently with daily goals realized. Had a social culture where everyone interacted during work hours.  Enjoyed working at my own pace with timely results. Enjoyed annual employee recognition day with one day off rewarded all employees."
good,"Being able to advance with the company is hard. Cause when try to bid out management stops you, because the employees has to do there work for them all the time."
good,"Focused on structured calling programs and scorecard performance measurement.  Corporate culture in a community banking environment was the hardest part of the job.  However, the organization recognized ability and supports growth dedicated effort and job results."
good,Must be flexible and willing top multi task daily.   Interactions with various individuals and knowledgeable in regulation requirements is necessary  to perform many job duties.
good,"Open the branch, process night deposit, work night deposits, am huddle, service customers.  Management is involved, workplace is nice, associates are helpful to each other, most enjoyable part is helping customers."
good,"In my department, Consumer Lending, it was all about production. Co-workers were great, made a lot of lifelong friends. Management was only about production."
good,"Regions as a bank is pretty decent, especially when it comes to lending. But as with any workplace, there are pros and cons. Regions puts on a ton of sales pressure, which is made worse by the quality requirements on every product you need to sell. If you are in a slow branch, or in an area where clientele typically has poor credit, good luck hitting your goals."
good,Regions is a good place to work. The type place you can retire from. There are many opportunities to add value and exemplify the core values of the company
good,"We constantly  had cross training on each other jobs, very helpful to one another and worked as a Team. I was a reconcilement Clerk of incoming and outgoing account had to balance and research on the discrepancies and was a floater to other departments to  assist in finding  various discrepancies on the Books and making the various  corrections and transfers as needed."
good,The problem at Regions was my direct manager who did not support nor lead by example. She was very selfish. For example she took all major holidays off for weeks at a time which prevented others from celebrating with our families.
good,The market for finance has become very aggressive. There were times that was not necessary actions to take on a customer when funds are available for financial decisions.
good,Very rewarding if you are good at selling and are personable. If you are lacking in this skill set they will train you and invest in you. The hardest part is getting out of your comfort zone and learning what works when approaching people about product expanding services.
good,"I started Regions before it got too big.  It seemed like you became a number on a spreadsheet instead of a valued employee.  Also, we were always short staffed but had the same sales goals as large cities."
good,"My experience included learning various aspects of banking.  Growth has been slow as multiple factors determine advancement, I have enjoyed my time but believe that the pay scale is lacking as compared to the current workforce.  Benefits at Regions are good and offer the ability to maintain work life balance."
good,"Feel I was singled out at the end , unjustly for doing a good job and building life long friends.  left because of this, and was approached about another job.   no one reached out to see why left, etc.  was there long time and always met my numbers and goals. was a mentor for many associates."
good,I worked In the call center and a fast pace environment. Lots of time on the phone helping customers with their accounts .Points  deductions for long calls. 100 plus calls a day
good,Regions Bank has a lot of benefits and I love the work environment. The workplace culture is versatile and you have to have the ability to adapt in the production environment. The only downfall is that there is not any room for growth. The supervisor don't even know you exist unless there is a problem.
good,"this is not a banking job, its a sales job and if you don't like sales, do not work there, management is very hard to deal with"
good,"company is great, benefits and vacation time are decent and the job hours are normal 8 hours workdays."
good,"Demanding job, but there was some fun to be had. In the position I was in was tough b/c you actually had to work very hard. But the pay didn't match what the work duties were."
good,It is a good place to work with so many various opportunities. It is a typical day everyday. It is an average bank. Management is well informed and versed at passing that information along.
good,Working for Regions has been a great experience. I have learned a lot about myself. The hardest part of job is sometimes dealing with customers. I enjoy my coworkers. I get alone with everyone.
good,The overall company is semi pleasant to work with but the various tasks asked of associates are not compensated properly. The managers seemed to show genuine concern although there were a few inconsistent managers.
good,"If you like sales then this is the perfect job for you. If you are looking for a strictly customer service position steer clear. "
good,"Great Hours, most customer's are a delight. Not much room for advancement. Local leadership has had large turn over. Benefits were expensive for a whole family in comparison to coverage. Investment in growth and development was minimal."
good,"Very slow store so making sales was hard,but we always found ways to make it work."
good,Regions is nice to work at for a job right out of high school starting as a teller. Gives you the opportunity to become a great customer service representative.
good,regions was a good place to work if you can balance stress and your outside of work stress. You have to meet your quarterly goals or you get verbal and written warnings.
good,"Pros: "
good,"Regions Bank was my first job out of high school. I liked working there but I was not pleased about their training courses and they did not help me too much, I was also not pleased with the management. I decided to resign to go back and continue a college education. I did like my hourly pay and the benefits."
good,"Great Place to work, Very demanding. I have learned to be a better leader"
good,"A typical day will include a variety of transactions (usually involving cash flow) and proper completion of operations files.  I also am responsible for opening sales conversation to clients."
good,It seems this job is very demanding with little compensation. Where the benefits are great the salary is not. Regions is one of the lower paying banks that I'm aware of.
good,"answering phone calls, selling products, taking in transactions, balancing coin machine, balancing vault."
good,It's a Call Center. There is a mis-use of power and policy. Have a lawsuit against them now because of policy and procedure
good,"Knew what was expected of me on a daily basis. Learned that being like in corporate America is what gets you promoted so be friendly positive and outgoing. Management enjoys their life at the fullest so they encourage their team do that as well. Co-workers learn to work well with each other like a close nit family. Hardest part is change, but it is a challenge that we learn to overcome. The most enjoyable part is facing the challenges as a team."
good,I did not like the training received in the begining. Once working there other training was fine.
good,"Company offers flexibility and lots of community service activities. However, the pay is not the best for hourly workers and there is not a lot of diversity among management (at least in mortgage)."
good,You are given expectations of activities that are not properly tracked and in turn when your quarterly employee review arrives you are solely critiqued off of your activity numbers that are inaccurate.
good,Not a bad bank to work at. Good coworkers and collaborative efforts. Long Friday schedules and coninuous standing. Typically helping regular customer's that get to know you.
good,They are making great strides in employee relations but they can do much better when it comes to the branch side of the job.  I hope they get there soon.
good,"I was here many years and liked it but a new better opportunity opened to me and I left for that reason. Also, company had good benefits for self and family members."
good,"My experience at Regions was a good one while it lasted which ultimately became the problem as I was hired into a position that was not vetted properly within the executive ranks of the investment banking division. Thinking back then, with the benefit of hindsight, the timing was not optimal for me as Regions Bank had not paid off its loans from the US Government/ TARP funds that helped the company through the financial crisis of 2008 - 2009. It then became a quest to not to do anything to alert the feds which ultimately lead to the dismissal or, said differently, the elimination of the request for the formation of my new group."
good,"Good, mid sized bank in SE US.  Offers some flexibility with hours and working from home in non customer facing positions.  Fiscally conservative.  Good values."
good,"Company has good benefits as far as health care, vacation days, and sick time. Branch level bankers are untrained in the business banking capacity so the paralender and underwriter normally has to train the banker as well as executing their own job."
good,n this place no matter how hard yo work is never enough and they prefer to hire from outside than to give an opportunity to the employee that is constantly working hard to make sure the numbers are there been a team player .   this is all I have to said.
good,Company strives for competition but keeps it friendly by also incorporating team playing to reach goals. Relaxed atmosphere and lots of customer interactions so helps the day go by quicker. Lots of opportunity for advancement within the company and they provide most of your training. Training is extensive and precise to your job title.
good,I enjoyed my time at Regions Bank. The atmosphere in which I worked was good. I was only part time so the pay was not that good. I had a great supervisor that trained me.
good,I have learned a lot during my time with Regions. I feel like there are some advances that they could improve on. They really focus in on coaching the team and leading them to sales goals.
good,Regions is a great place to work. They really care about their employees and their families. Management is always there to help you. I would say the hardest part about my job is when a customer has a sad story about something that has happened with them or someone in their family has passed. I enjoy the volunteer activities that Regions allows their employees to participate in.
good,I was only in the branches for a short time so I was not really there long enough to complete an in depth review.  I really liked my manager and how she ran the branch.  There was a good team here.
good,"Overall, pretty good place to work for.  However, no room for advancement with little to no opportunity for advancement. Very strict on being sick and missing work, even with a validated doctors or note from hospital."
good,Stressful work. Overall culture is great but local management is very pushy and focused on only sales. Too many tasks given for one day. Coaching is actually just telling you that you need to sell more.
good,"regions is about the client needs, but the structure in not accord of their expectations. Nevertheless, is an excellent place to learn about banking, and the trainings are awesome. It has growth opportunity. The salary is not bad, but the commissions can definitely be better."
good,"New accounts, maintenance clients accounts. work teller line when needed. Tried advancing to the next level was not given the opportunity. "
good,"Regional management lacked the ability or desire to make the tough decisions and support what is morally and ethically right. The duties of the job were easy enough, and the customers were largely great to work with. Not much different than working at any other bank."
good,Not a bad place to start a career in financial advisement. You will need to understand the importance of teamwork and be strong in sales. The job will teach you how to maintain professionalism in all situations.
good,"Educating, advising and empowering the community and business . Managing staff to growth and progress. Working closely with direct supervisors and training to advance to the next level of leadership"
good,"There are daily huddles to set the tone and expectations for each day.  You must reach out to customers on a daily basis for a financial review or to try and set appointments.  Assist customers with any financial transactions or concerns.  The atmosphere will vary from branch to branch, but I feel that my branch has a family environment.  There are reports and reconcilements to be completed and monitored daily.  The hardest part of the job is the challenges with getting loans approved in my area.  The most enjoyable part of the job is my teammates and customers."
good,Regional management is located in Baton Rouge which makes it hard for them to understand the sales culture of the Lafayette and surrounding area.  City President did not follow thru with promises from hire date. Setting up employees for failure.  Pay and benefits are awesome.  However do not outweigh the stress of poor management.
good,"25% Phoning"
good,"Department has a general unwillingness or fear to adopt new technologies. While other companies and departments are using the latest analysis technologies, employees here rely on pivot tables and think that will always be enough. Compensation is great and so are benefits, but in order to advance, the general mindset of ""This works now so we don't need to invest in new technologies"" will need to be changed."
good,"The bank is looking for ways to reduce expenses and consolidate.  If you are looking to work here, make sure you are in a revenue generating position."
good,Regions offers too many similar accounts/products. The teller referral process needs improvements. It's a southern based bank so all processes are outdated. The turn over rate is high.
good,Fun and management is great. The only issue I had was the amount of work for each employee. Only for cashiers at each bank and a lot of work for them. The pay wasnt fair.
good,"The office I worked in was going through a great deal of turnover at the time. A former employee had opened his own bank and taken nearly all of the employees with him. I was there for the aftermath. They were doing very well considering the situation they were in. However, everyone there was ""green"", and not really understanding the laws and how, when and why to use them. That alone created many unhappy customers."
good,"I adored working at Regions, your branch really becomes like your family. The hours are perfect and you only have to work a few Saturdays out of the year (I worked 2 the entire time of my employment). I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys sales."
good,The only downfall about regions is that they push push push you to make sales goals! And if you didn't meet them they threatened your job.
good,"AM Huddle with Team - Commit to daily activities and accomplishments."
good,"Great work environment."
good,"Overall I enjoy working for the company, but now it seems to be difficult to move up internally. I did get a promotion but a very small pay raise. Coworkers are great to work with and goals are tough to reach. Upper management doesn't communicate very well."
good,"I enjoyed my position with Regions, however, their was no room for advancement, and the atomosphere was one of working in a sweat shop. Large room with 200 employees making phone calls all day with quotas on how many phone calls must be made. Our work was not evaluated on individual performance but rather on how survey's of individuals in the State of Mississippi who performed this type of work were paid."
good,I loved banking. Co-workers were great. Management there was constant overturn; sometimes not even having a manager for months. Corporate not the best but loved the job itself.
good,"I worked for Regions for going on six years and worked as a manager when the managers were out of the office which was every day. I took care of the lobby traffic in the branch with loans, new accounts, problems and held meeting with other employees throughout the day. I worked very hard to achieve all the goals the bank expected of me and went above and beyond for my co-workers and clients."
good,A day at regions  was never boring . And I taken what i have learned on to other places of employment
good,Very stressful. Not high enough pay for the amount of work. Customers come before employees no matter what.
good,"A typical day at work is stressful, but at one time it was also fun to work there.  As the company has gone through changes the fun is gone.  The management presses down hard on sales, which used to also be enjoyable.  The hardest part of the job is satisfying management, and once satisfied not being acknowledged.  As I said, it used to be fun to work there and it isn't anymore."
good,Under staffed most of the time but good work environment. The pay is very low comparative to other companies of a similar size and function.
good,"I normally come in and pull reports for the ATM, make sure that there is enough for the day. Pull the night drop bags, work them.Then I'm ready to open and start my day. The hardest part of my job is trying to help customers when there is not enough employee to help gettting them in and out. Trying to search for what the customer may need. Getting them the right products. Most thing that I like is meeting new people."
good,Working with Regions bank offers a great foundation for the financial industry.  They offer a great training program and individual development.  A progression plan is in place for associates looking to grow within the company.
good,It's hard because it mostly about the checking but the bank is good. Just have to have a good manager. My manager had a lot of favoritism and like to spam out of control base on her home life.
good,"If you need a job the pay is decent and the benefits are good, in certain departments advancement is easier than other departments. Ask about that in your interview."
good,"Wasn't a bad place to work, but it was very faced paced and the [ay was really low when I worked there. The upper management is really hard on referrals"
good,I am just a teller at this bank. They are willing to work around schedules and are very understanding. It's a great place to open doors into the banking business.
good,Very customer oriented and driven employees working together for a common goal to exceed expectations. We  found ways to make work fun and interactive.  The common goal to make each customer feel appreciated as well as handle their needs according to Regions policies for the good of the customer and Regions is the common atmosphere through Regions.
good,There working towards a more tech savy company with less employees. Its all well in good but there eliminating to many jobs and were super slow to implement change leaving the employees who were there to pick up the slack. The sales goals were reasonable but due to being short staffed a with only three tellers the personal bankers were stressed to meet the goals due to constantly having to go back and forth on the teller line.
good,Worked here as an underwriter and then Regions closed down that dept and transferred me to Risk Management where I helped the with HMDA and selling of uninsurable loans.  This also eventually shut down and received a large bonus to stay and close that dept down too.
good,Regions is a good job for anyone looking to get their foot in the door of the banking industry. however because there is relatively no room to advance it is not a career job
good,"If you enjoy putting smiles on most faces and bettering an individuals of families financial security, this is a good job."
good,"Fast paced environment, fun place to work. I enjoyed meeting new customer's and getting to know people from the community. Exceptional customer service."
good,"Everyday we provide friendly service, count and balance cash drawers, deposits, atm and offer new products.  My hardest thing was I spoke Spanglish(more English, some Spanish). I enjoyed putting a smile on a customer face."
good,"I banked with Regions many years before I decided to actually apply. I applied as a teller but never got hired. Then the position for and Operations Vault Teller came open, I applied.  I interviewed...and didn't get the job. They called me back for a second interview (which I should've been wary from). I met all the managers in the department and a week later, I was offered a position."
good,"Great place to work at, with great work life balance. If you are looking for a job with sales and great potential this is the job for you. Management could be better"
good,To me this company operates on management styles versus leadership style. I am used to working in corporate with leaders you can talk and relate to.
good,I really enjoyed working for Regions. I left due to a trust issue with my co-workers. If that had never occurred I would have made this job my career.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew and it was more difficult to get to know the new people."
good,"I really enjoyed Regions Bank and my day consisted of checking reports, morning huddles, setting the tone for the day, creating excitement, and bringing energy. I enjoyed working with my co workers and helping them out as much as I could. There success always equaled my success so I wanted to make sure we all were on the same page."
good,Lots of online classes to take and some that if you wanted to advance you could. Believed in teaching security entering and leaving the branch. Management for the branch that I worked was not the best.
good,"Depending on your area/department, the management team can be either really supportive or not. The culture is very laid back and the typical work day is from 8-5. Co-workers are friendly but usually older. Hardest part of the job is maintaining resources needed to do job more effectively and most enjoyable is exposure to senior management and many areas of the bank."
good,"Setup a production line with 5-6 other people."
good,This bank went from being a very pleasant place to work and for customers to bank to a unpleasant place to work and a difficult place for customers to bank between 2007 and 2012. Things were continuing to deteriorate when I left the bank. It was sad because of memories of the earlier part of the decade.
good,A typical day involved receiving incoming calls to assist with mortgage questions and changes to escrow.
good,The job and the coworker was fine. I thought I needed to face other challenges and better opportunity.
good,Good place to get the experience needed for future banking jobs. High turnover at my branch so it was hard to know when your shift would be over. My teller supervisor was wonderful but upper management were not easy to work for at all. Benefits were fairly good but pay was not great.
good,"Company always expanding, New Technology. Staying on top of trends and fully supports its employees learning more getting certified and trained. Great Company to work for!"
good,"Very good place to work.  If you're in sales, you can't market on social media at all (they claim that it's a small disadvantage but it's not).  They do very little if any advertising or marketing outside of Birmingham, AL."
good,It gives you the opportunity to learn more about things that are happening. It will let you meet new people each day .Customers become like your family. My coworker were so patient with me.
good,"Regions Bank has been a great chance for me to get into the field i like which is finances. A typical day art work is making 10 before 10 am sales calls, help customers on any maintenance needed on their bank relationship and also to provide them with advice and education on how to manage their finance situation. The management at my branch was mildly helpful . There is a great ethical work culture at Regions Bank. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the lack of traffic on customer at my location, i like to stay busy, as i am a hardworker oriented person. The best part of my job is when i am able to put a smile on a customer when they needed something to get done."
good,"Good place to work"
good,"What Regions stands for is amazing, it is definitely a great place to work. Unfortunately at the end of the day it is all about the numbers. How many accounts, loans, referrals, etc. And how did customers rate you on online surveys. If you don't mind ""sales"" and corporate nonsense you'll be fine. At the end of the day my customers make it all worth it, they are like family."
good,Regions is a good place to work but the pay is not great. A lot of associates need to switch banks due to this reason. When getting promoted the  raise is very low. My  recommendation is get experience in this company then switch to a better one.
good,"During this internship, I only worked on assignments with other workers. I learned about Risk Management and Risk Analysis. It was a very inviting atmosphere, but It is not the kind of work i am interested i."
good,A typical day at Regions is an interaction with multiple customers. We are asked many questions pertaining to banking processes and details.  I love the interaction of the customer and the ability to effectively apply my job knowledge and skills.
good,"- Lead and direct teller staff and teller operations in addition to providing support for policies, procedures and processes withing the branch"
good,Although everyday I would say was repetitive you did get to meet and personally get to know new people. Met a lot of great people that friendship will last for a long time. When short staffed days can be overwhelming but wasn't an issue. Love having goals set for me and being able to achieve those goals to earn the incentive was a great bonus.
good,Very high demand of customer service. Must be very accurate while handling customers money during transactions. Make business transactions for customers on a daily basis.
good,"I enjoyed working there, goals are attainable, nothing crazy. Great customers"
good,Always given a chance to move within the company. Management cared about the people working for them. Most of the co-workers there have been there for a long time.
good,I'm not crazy about how the company is going as far as cutting staff but keeping the same goals.  It is getting harder to do the job effectively.  There is no help when short staffed which happens more than not
good,"Regions is a good company to work for however you dont make a lot of money being a teller"
good,It's ok. Mgt needs to get a vision for IT. Clueless as to what we should to do to compete. We don't use modern tech. We don't have a plan to get off the old tech. We spend millions of dollars making sure we never change...
good,I hated everyday that I was there.. I love the customer service aspect of the job but the employees were horrible... I loved being up front and being able to handle the customers.
good,"I was a Teller and I loved the branch where I worked. I got to know the local community and they knew me. However, I don't feel Tellers are compensated very well. I had to process transactions very quickly. I have been mistreated by customers for not knowing who ""they were"". I could easily be fired for my drawer being off even though you were pushed to run transactions as fast as possible. Depending on which branch you worked at, your life could even be in danger."
good,The management was not very good and always had their favorites.
good,great job for college students or people that want to work in finance! benefits are probably the best thing the job offers. job does have long hours sometimes
good,"The benefits for this job were good but they put too much pressure on the employees...how do you sale products but you don't sale products. you ""meet the need"" which is basically selling products."
good,The specific location I worked at while employed with Regions Bank had a great management team.  We were like a family and that is rare to find. I was given additional responsibilities which has helped me progress with other employers.
good,Regions bank was the most interactive place I have ever had the pleasure of working. it taught me that working with money was a key factor of knowing how to save money.
good,"Company gives great benefits and plenty of time off for work/life balance but you seem to get reprimanded when you actually use the time given to you.   Pay was very low unless you went from bank to bank to get a higher pay, raises were not good for loyal employees."
good,"Typical day at work, taking calls, assisting agents and being a important role to the team. We are also responsible for making sure all of the accounts are taken care of. Brand the name at the end of the calls and continue to provide excellent customer service."
good,"This company has great benefits. The management team is very good. The team I was on had great drive. "
good,This is a call center. It is continuously short handed so call volumes are always high. Most people do the bare minimum which doubles the workload for those of us who like to go the extra mile. The few good workers that I met while I was there have since resigned. This department is headed by extraordinarily smart people strategically placed to run the company but mediocre managers over the employees.
good,The work was pretty easy but management had become similar to Wells Fargo with the pushy sales and your job being at risk if you did not sale.
good,"A typical day may include helping someone balance their account or opening an account for a physician or lawyer. There is a real push towards sales now because the more products a customer has with a financial institution the less likely they are to leave. Management at the time was amazing. My managers never yelled at employees in front of other people, criticism was always uplifting and creative, and I never dreaded going to work. The hardest part of my job was knowing the richest people were the ones with perks and the regular blue collar people like me had to pay for things. The most enjoyable part of my job was talking to my sweet older customers about their grandkids or what dance they met the love of their life at."
good,The work environment is great and personally i  feel as though this is one of the best work environments ive ever worked in. My team is awesome and we all get along great. We help each other out and work as a team. It is production based so u have to meet the cph goal.  U also have to have tough skin because the customers can be really mean and rude sometimes but with time you'll become more comfortable and knowledgeable when it comes to dealing with customer phone calls.
good,They offer training classes to assist with your job and once a week send out information to keep you up dated with new ideas and training. Offer learning tools to help with your job.
good,"I loved my job and did it to the best of my abilities. Had one issue their which caused me to get laid off, I feel the situation could've been handled differently and there should've been more employer backing."
good,"You can get promoted quickly if you play the game and kiss up to management."
good,I originally was an employee of Union Planters Bank. Regions Bank bought them out and it quickly became a very cutthroat environment. I don't really have much else to say.
good,"Assist customers banking needs, open & close accounts, sell products."
good,This was my first exposure to using general ledgers and ending fiscal year accounts. I loved every minute of this job but it was only temporary.
good,"Overall I loved the atmosphere, however I dislike having to “watch my back” with anything you do. I was terminated due to a member of management writing a statement”allegedly saying she saw me take someone assessment “. Meanwhile, the are others surrounding me as well as a member of management conversing with me (hands visible). If you are not a member of management, you WILL NOT HAVE A VOICE NOR JOB SECURITY."
good,"Poor management. The scheduling was only done by manager, and it only benefited her. If you use your company provided sick time, other employees there will hold it against you."
good,Only when we had Evergreen day but it was cut short be get back to work. When you got up to go the lady's room they always question you asking is you on break.
good,"Worked for Regions at the height of the great recession, The oversight was poor and they tried to pump out mortgages for money. But overall it wasn't a bad place to work."
good,Data center there was no potential for advancement or professional growth.
good,Regions Bank is a excellent company.I have learned something everyday working here.I loved the fast pace and the hands on customer services.
good,When i first began working there I loved it. However new management and new rules drove me crazy and sucked the life out of the branch. It would be better if management actually listened to employee concerns.
good,"A little behind the times for financial aspects. I expected a lot more from the company and I have honestly been appalled at the lack of technology. Coming from a smaller company to a Fortune 500 company, I expected to step in the future of banking."
good,"I love working in a Bank (Branch), however if your Branch Manager does not want you to go farther that him/she then that's it, NO ADVANCEMENT FOR YOU!!!"
good,"I worked for this company for many years. As the economy was turning so was the banking industry, in my opinion for the worst. I believe the overall rating for this company depends on the market you are in. For me it was the market manager, and his political behaviors that are formed within management was my issues. The market manager is materialistic. EX: customer drove a BMW and we were questioned why we didn't sale him a Credit Card, just because he drives a BMW does not mean that this person is eligible for a CC. Unethical behavior in the hiring process, not from HR but from market manager, (type of school you went to, where you previously worked) someone would only know if they worked there."
good,I really enjoyed working with the Tellers truly team players.A typical day check cashing and processing deposits.
good,While I have worked with this company for years the changes that are being made are hard to get behind. I will continue to provide the best service to my clients and work to achieve my goals but will actively look for something any is more conducive to my personal situation also.
good,"The typical day as a balancing clerk is quality production. Using a 10-key you key in information needed to correctly process banknotes, documents, and serial numbers on checks that need to be processed through the bank.  I have learned that by doing this job you have a better understanding of how daily banking transactions from the customer and the bank operate in real time."
good,"Regions is the strong powerhouse of the Southeast no question and it's upper management is very capable.  Middle management...not so much.  Much has changed since I resigned, but the management is still an issue."
good,Great Intro to banking and learning about financial institutions. They are the lowest paid tellers and bankers and micro managing is very high. Enjoyed my co-workers and managers.
good,"Answer a high call volume, sell products, suggest products,meet quota by getting referrals with each call, assist with technical support  for internet banking."
good,You will have to sell products at a quota. Cross sell additional banking products. Phone bank to get more business. Financial Sales Representatives sometimes require that you work at the bank on the weekends.
good,"Several changes in management, which made it difficult to know work approach that was expected because it changed with every manager."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my co-workers and the benefits. I do not wish to provide additional comments.
good,"Great training, and atmosphere, expectations are out of control in the Indiana market.  However this will be a great place to start a new career and grown professionally."
good,Great place to get your foot in the door of banking.  There are truly some great people working here but upper management is awful in most departments.  Pay is minimal.
good,"I enjoyed working at Regions for the most part however, there are things I feel could have been better to make things a little less stressful for their employees. I have gained a lot of knowledge by working there that otherwise I would not have known. I worked with a great bunch of people they were like family to me and still are even though I no longer work there. My eyes were opened on what I was capable of and I was pushed to further my knowledge and reach my true potential."
good,"Make transactions, try to tell customers about new products and services, try to meet sales goals, count daily business deposits, wait on customers and tend to their needs, attend weekly AM meetings to discuss goals. "

good,Great teamwork.  Loved developing client relationships that lasted for my seven years there

good,"great place to work, "
good,"A typical day at work would involve perusing over emails sent and setting the pace with a list of tasks to complete. Also, this would include staying abreast of law, policies and regulations applicable to the work that you do and making sure the bank is abiding by those standards. The culture was challenging, engaging and professional. The most enjoyable part of the job was not having to punch a timeclock, but retain the expected understanding to complete tasks that you are responsible for in a timely manner."
good,The goals set were within reason for making bonus money & the employees were friendly. Since I left 12 years ago I'm certain rules & requirements have changed
good,Worked daily with sales.  Held meetings with my staff to encourage them on their sales.  High sales environment. Quarterly meetings. Cash Handling.  Cold sales calls. Opening new accounts.  Paying and receiving teller.  Reports
good,"Regions is a fairly typical large public company, with the normal good and bad points that they usually have.  As one of the last major regional banks in the southeast, it occupies an important niche in Alabama."
good,Steady place to work. Hardest part is it requires a lot of time away from family and weekends. The most enjoyable part about working there is the building a relationship with your customers. The hardest part is missing out on time spent with your kids if you have a family.

good,"Like any company, it really depends on your specific role and department. Good people and roles are here!"
good,Some management look to advance employees and help them to grow in skills. There are managers that are hands on and willing to help their teams to the best of their ability.

good,"The bank is cutting back on its work force, creating an situation of under staffing.  It gives the impression that the bank will be sold in the near future."
good,underwriting environment is fast paced and has become micro-managed.  Work place culture primarily depends on manager's style.  Multiple recent changes make for difficulties to perform the job.
good,I have a great branch manager.  He makes work not feel like work.  He cares not just about the customers but about the employees as well.  I learned about the in's and out's of banking.  I have a new respect for the industry and how to manage my money better.  I love my regular customers that come in.  I couldn't ask for a better place to work after a long hiatus from employment.

good,"Reward your employees for their hard work regardless of whether they reached their goal. If it's not a concern about worth ethic, then their contribution to the workplace should be recognized."
good,I started with Regions in an alternative financial delivery system.  Financial sales in located in Publix Supermarkets. No bank experience was a requirement to facilitate a pure sales environment. The concept did not fly. Regions gave me a crash course in traditional banking witch I launched my work financial sales.

good,I enjoyed working at Regions. Regions offered great opportunity for advancement. Regions offered a variety of services. I did not enjoy working every Saturday.
good,Competitive banking environment that I thoroughly enjoyed for the most part. Regions Bank does not have many of locations in the area that I worked in.
good,Basically it was a good place to work.  The only part of the job that I disagree with is having to sell products to customers each time they came to your window even though they had already told you they were not interested.
good,"Ensure accurate and timely invoicing per customer requirements."
good,"A typical day at work can be stressful, depending on the customers that call and the stream of issues at hand. However, the team-oriented and associate-centered atmosphere help make the day go by faster. The sales incentive is fair and easy to attain, as long as you follow the procedures."
good,"I would rather not talk about my experience at thus far about what occurs within my regular work day. The company is not a bad company to work for - management is a hit or miss.

good,depending on your supervisor and your branchs location it can be very stressful atmosphere. need to be very proficient with attention to detail. Great benefits.

good,"Good place to work, unique culture, limited market share in area.  Opportunity to learn, grow.  Very sales oriented workplace, high turnover in certain areas"
good,8:30 to 5 Monday through Friday was nice. 8:30 to noon on Saturdays was manageable. Enjoyed meeting many new people from all walks of life. Office drama like every

good,"Regions is a Financial Institution with several groups within the organization."
good,"Fun place to work with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,I was able to work in different parts of the department and learn more. I worked with many different managers and learned different management styles.
good,I love working for Regions. They really take care of their employees. Compensation could be better but other than that it's great.
good,"A very positive, productive team oriented organization to work for. This is an organization that will bring out the best in you, and will help you to grow in your leadership skills in and out of the work place."
good,"I loved working for Regions. It is a friendly environment to work in. They also have plenty of room for promotion. "

good,"A typical day at work consists of opening procedures, customer interaction, and the ability to assess a situation or problem and be able to fix it in order to better assist the customer with their financial needs. My management and co-workers are a joy to be around, and provide the stability I need to better serve in a team environment. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the changing rules and regulations and making sure to stay up to date on them. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to serve customers to the upmost and make sure they are completely taken care of financially."
good,Loved my job and enjoyed going to work each day until the new manager was hired. She was not a friendly person and did not lead well.
good,"•	Handle consumer and commercial accounts from opening to close-out. Process "

good,"A typical day was busy from 9-10 and after the traffic, I would do my daily reports and coaching. Lunches were from 12-2.

good,"I worked at Regions Bank for 19 years.  I loved working at a large bank because it offered so many opportunities for a young person starting a career!"
good,"Balancing cash box, learn about new bank products, and management would hold meetings every morning to discuss different bank changes, new products, goals, and important bank news. You learn to work as a team with co-workers in order for the bank to operate smoothly and achieve goals.

good,Responsible for all inside sales activites of a branch. Operational liaison. Grow and retained new and existing households
good,"Good environment at the branch and community where I worked.  Regions expects a lot of different hats to be worn by their financial services team.  Instead of compartmentalizing different aspects of financial sales (insurance, annuities, checking/savings, loans, mortgages, small business etc) each individual is expected to cover those areas and meet the highly competitive goals.  Most branches have a manager and maybe one other sales associate. Managers have the same if not higher sales goals, which decreases the time needed to actually manage employees and associates."
good,"Bilingual (English/Spanish), 7yrs Customer Service and Sales oriented, front desk (MSI), Microsoft Office, Excel, Outlook, 40wpm"
good,"A typical day of working at Regions Bank was not typical, as banking is never really typical as each day in banking offers many challenges.  However, each day presents opportunities to meet new and interesting people while working to achieve the required standards and goals required by Regions."

good,Regions Bank was a great place to work.  My co-workers were great.

good,I spent 11 years with the company and learned a lot.  Would love to go back.
good,"The company has gone very sales oriented, thus this is a big portion of your job. If you do not meet goals there are consequences."
good,"The team I work for a Regions is very focused on what we can do for the customer, how we can help them make better financial decisions.  In the morning we have a huddle. This allows us to have a focal point for the day, a goal that is in our reach. At the end of the day we share our success stories. The hardest part of the day is making sure all daily tasks are completed according to policy and procedure, but having a team that feeds off of each other makes the day enjoyable and that much easier to manage. I have been able to enhance my customer service skills. I have also learned how to pay more than the normal attention to details and how to work towards individual and team goals."
good,"A typical day at work involves morning and afternoon huddles in which customer service and sales goals and successes are discussed and recognized, meeting customer needs and accurately processing their transactions, and completeing daily branch reports. My management and co-workers are supportive and create a fun and friendly yet professional work environment. I do not find any part of my job difficult, and the most enjoyable parts of my job are meeting new people and learning new tasks and skills. While working for Regions, I have learned to quickly and accurately meet the needs of my customers by processing transactions or providing advice, to manage time and multi-task more effectively, to be more detail-oriented, and to more effectively use computer programs such as Microsoft Excel."
good,"Lead the teller staff in carrying out its function including responsibility for vault control, cash control, financial center balancing and administrative reports. "
good,"A typical work day consisted of completing customer transactions and managing a cash box. I learned how to work fast, yet accurately under pressure. The management was nice and would offer many opportunities for advancement and outreach into the community. My coworkers were fun and very helpful with problems and/or concerns. The hardest part of the job was the pressure you're under because money is very important to the people that earn it. The most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy and reaping the benefits of excellent customer service. "
good,I loved working for regions bank. It gave me a great experience in the banking business.
good,"Great company, moderate compensation not so great insurance."
good,"Manage the banks money in the vault, ATM, and the Automatic Cash Dispenser. Provide customers with solutions to better fit their needs and future goals with money  management. The most enjoyable part of my job is the face to face interaction with other associates and customers."
good,This company does a great job with training new associates and helpong them grow in the financial arena
good,Good company to work for while I was there. Company has had many mergers since I was there. 
good,Informing customers of financial needs and helping them achieve these goals.
good,"Respond to high volume of incoming calls in a fast paced, competitive environment. Follow through on customer inquiries, request, or complaints; resolve issues promptly. Maintain high sales performances. Evaluate customers’ relationship and business objectives to properly recommend additional services."

good,"Opening,deposit, Providing customer service offering new products,generating new accounts."
good,Burlington Coat Factory is a o.k. place to work. Just like most retail stores its open everyday. For management its not that bad. I just wish it was more promotions from the inside
good,"Greet meeting people. But easy to loose your job. I followed all the right steps,but still lost my job b/c some looser altered a check. Regions felt like I should have noticed. It was too hard to tell. I couldn't have noticed."
good,Enjoyable work place with the ability to assist at other branches in varies city's.
good,"My job was eliminated, and I received a compensation package."
good,Regions is trying to gain a larger market share in Florida. There are several competitor financial institutions in the same markets. Goals are fair but the compensation for the amount of effort needs to be reevaluated. Regions needs a focus on local marketing to have a better customer reception in these markets.
good,"Challenging work environment. To become and remain successful, multi-tasking and working at a fast pace are required. When compared to competitors, Regions Bank underpays its employees.  It was a great first corporate job, but I am not sorry I moved on."
good,I enjoy working for Regions bank however I am seeking to get back into management and there are no immediate opportunities there.Regions provides good work life balance but there is no salary in my current role and I would like a more stable income.
good,"It is not that bad of a place to work,there is just some managers that don’t do their job right. They give you opportunities to grow but is not as fairly paid as other banks might be"
good,You will start your day with a morning huddle (meeting). you will be required to make 10 calls by 10 AM. Management will not ask about sales. This bank does not product push.
good,"Regions bank offers a reasonable rate of pay all while offering employees good benefits. The biggest problem is management and the many incompetent employees they hire. The do not offer the best practices, services, or products."
good,"I loved my job, but made it stressful.  She wanted to know all of our personal business.  Told us who we should be friends with.  Wanted to know in detail why we had to take a vacation day or sick day.  If we were sick she wanted to know in detail what was wrong and what the doctor said.  When I had surgery I had to call her everyday before 7:00 A.M. and give her an update."
good,Regions is a great company to work for. I have been employed here for several years. I have also worked for various branches. I have learned a lot about the banking industry while employed at Regions.
good,"Regions is a good place work. Great for different career path, from entry level positions to executive positions. Regions provides a great work\home balance culture and gives back to the community."
good,Good place to work if you dont mind the corporation management they changes policy's every three months and the they make it really hard for their tellers to achive there bonuses
good,Banking for me was a fun job. I enjoyed the sales part because I was comfortable with the products and my job and was a very good salesperson. I loved getting to know my customer and taking care of them from a financial standpoint.
good,"Work Life Balance is great.  fun place to work "
good,"As a mortgage loan officer,  your job is dependent upon several factors, The housing market and interest rates.  Favorable market, favorable rates good for business.  Unfortunately, the reverse also applies which can make it a struggle to earn a living."
good,I enjoy my coworkers and work life was good. I learned a lot working at Regions. The training was good. Workplace culture and team oriented made for good work place. Regions even helped me to buy my home.
good,It was a good place to work. Laid back for the most part and most everyone worked together to get things done. Always had plenty of work to keep you busy all day
good,"They define clear and specific expectations for what success looks like for the job. "
good,"Regions was a good bank and they were good to me. But I felt if they focused more on who they hired the morale would be 100 times better throughout the entire bank. The morale was just not there and motivation was lacking to put it nicely. It being a bank that's been in the area for years there were many employees in the same position for over 40 and 50 years which shows complacency. You're comfortable at stats quo or average when the above mentioned is the case. If this was improved, it would have been a great place to work. I came in as Asst BM and acted as BM for 3 months right off the bat which I did not know was going to happen. The employees that had been with Regions for 10, 20+ years had a difficult time with people above them. Instead of taking constructive criticism and individual coaching sessions as a learning tool some felt they were being picked on. Or they felt entitled which led to a negative vibe throughout the entire bank."
good,"Regions overall was a good company to be employed to work for. Although there were inconsistencies with implementing the company values, and favoritism with certain position levels, it was still a good company."
good,"I have worked for Regions for 13 years and it has overall been a pleasant place to work.  The job can be stressful at times but with the teamwork from  of the branch associates, it is a pleasure to be at Regions."
good,Most of the day is spent interacting with clients in person and over the phone.  Great management team that is there to help you grow professionally.  Reach sales goals by helping client reach theirs.
good,Regions Bank was a great place to work.  I was able to move up internally based on my skills aquired with each position I held. I learned a lot and appriciated the opporunity to word for a wonderful company
good,"Regions is a great place to work if you need a set schedule. There are sales goals which must be met. However, relocation is often necessary for advancement."
good,Overall regions is a good company to work for. The fact that we are not too big yet causes most locations to be very slow and in the 3 years i have been here they have closed many locations.
good,"When Regions bank mail relocated, I decided to end my employment because the mail room moved further outside of Birmingham. And I decided, I wanted to do something new."
good,"It was fine, I learned a lot while there. I tried to make the best of not having a degree and i learned that they did not care how much you knew, or how hard you worked, if a new grad came in, they were your supervisor and you had to train them."
good,I enjoyed my time with Regions Bank. I really thought that I would have been employeed with them long term but had issues with management being unreliable. They seem to put high expectations on you and make you feel incompetent when you do not meet your sales goals.
good,They have good pay and benefits when starting out but then there is little advancement. The company is going through several changes and they are really effecting the employees and they still require to meet min. goas.
good,"I loved everything about this job.  I had autonomy to do my own thing within the parameters of the company by-laws.  It was a lot of work, but I was able to get everything done every day and very rarely took work home with me."
good,"The financial industry has changed so drastically after 2008.  Before, at least in my position, it was all about getting to know your customers.  Regions Bank encouraged this and provided opportunities to strengthen relationships.  Unfortunately, this is not the case today."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to manage a team of 16 bankers. To coach and develop bankers to meet and exceed company standards and policy. I have learned banking terminology, laws, and systems. The hardest part of my job is I have basically trained myself as there is no training for management. The most enjoyable part of my job is my bankers. We have become like family and my bankers allow me to develop them and are very receptive to feedback and constructive criticism."
good,It is very much a routine. You know what you are going to do everyday. I have learned a lot about banking and loans. They have an open line of communication so you always have someone to go to. Regions has a very strong work culture. Hardest part of the jobs is dealing with the people. The most enjoyable is dealing with people. Its customer service you have to take the good with the bad.
good,"Very sales oriented and goal driven, stressful with no job security. Poor management, very limited on growth within the company. Good benefits and 401k matching plan."
good,"Not sure about this company. It was good in the beginning, but management changed. Employees are not friendly. One person tells you to do something but then they say they did not authorize you to do it."
good,"On a normal steady day and the customers are happy, the work flows easy. I love working with the team. We are like family. However those days when all goes haywire; holidays, check day, income tax, or outstanding outages...Family??"" Every man for himself."
good,Management make sure you have the tools you need to perform your job and also make sure they train you for your position and keep you updated and inform.
good,Normally it was a good place to work. My coworkers were all very friendly and were all willing to help me expand and learn from them. Team building through verbal praise and acknowledgement. Management while I was there left something to be desired their communication skills were lacking. The most enjoyable part of my job was my coworkers.
good,fun work environment but very slow in many locations leading to difficulty of advancement as well as compensation good team environment
good,"Although this is a great job for those that have great sales experience, it does put a lot of stress in meeting those sale goals vs simple Customer Service"
good,"A typical work day at Regions is coming in at 8, logging into your workstation, preparing your supplies, and getting your money drawer ready for the day. I learned quite a bit about myself and banking during my time at Regions Bank. You meet people from all different walks of life on a daily basis, and you're responsible for making sure their financial needs are met and taken care of. The management and coworkers were great to work with. All of our different personalities meshed well together, but the only thing I would've changed about it was more unity as a whole. I consider my management and coworkers like family, and when there is clearly a disconnect in the wholeness of the work place, I feel like it's easy for others, especially clients, to pick up on. The most enjoyable part about my job was the ability to talk to people all day long, put faces with names, and develop business relationships. I consider customer service my forte, and I enjoyed working face to face with people."
good,Regions is a family friendly employer.  Employees worked together and everyone got alone.  When there was a problem management handled it well.
good,"A typical day at work was spent inside a small cubicle taking 80 to more than 100 calls per day. I learned to deal with escalated calls and how to remain calm while helping the customer resolve their concerns. Management was very efficient, friendly, and helpful. I did not interact with my co-workers very much due to being in a cubicle all day. The most difficult part of the job was the pressure to make the call volume and sitting inside such a small cubicle all day long. The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of accomplishment from helping others while also using my Spanish skills and receiving compensation for this skill."
good,"Been with the bank for over 8 years. Takes micro managing to a high level. Many of opportunities to move up, but you have to stand out and produce to be consider."
good,This organization is a great place to work for.  It provides a great work/life balance.
good,"I work in the call center which means you are expected to sell.  What I don't like is they say meet the needs of the customer.  If I truly do that, I don't sell as much and get asked why I'm not hitting my numbers.  This to me is stressful.  It is hard to advance in the call center.  It isn't based on what you know, but who you make laugh.  They do however give a good amount of sick time, vacation, and have prizes you can win.  Friendly staff and upper management often talks with all associates.  There is also an employee appreciation week where they really do celebrate the employees.  We also have mandatory overtime."
good,Management rewarded staff all the time for good job perfomances. Great work schedule. Benefits were pretty good.
good,"I worked as the main drive thru teller. On a typical busy day, I can help up to 300 customers on my own. I learned more cash handling experience along with more customer service skills. I learned new programs. My co-workers were excellent, I could not have asked for a better team. There really was no hard part to the job, I enjoyed learning new things but the most ejoyable was helping and working with the customers."
good,My position was eliminated & I will really will miss it. We had a good team of long term employees. The last few years have been tough but I learned alot.
good,"Though the job posed it's share of challenges, I truly enjoyed working with such a motivated team. My Manager is a true leader and motivator and was a true joy to work for and with."
good,The job is best suited for a person with a set schedule. I was enrolled in college courses at the time and was unable to stick to one schedule
good,Regions offers great benefits like full paid maternity leave. Great place for advancement. Management will work with you to advance within the company
good,"Overall, this company isn't so bad to work for.  Going into working for a large regional bank, you are expected to meet high sales goals.  One caveat to that is that you are micro-managed (which is put in place by the company), having to meet very specific goals throughout each and every day which could be daunting when there were long periods of being understaffed."
good,Overall good company to work for relocated so I had to resign but I was going on my 4th year with the company when I left. The only issue was staffing.
good,"I like working for Regions as a whole, but a lot of your experience is going to depend on your location. I used to work in one branch where I truly enjoyed the people I worked with, I liked my job, and the balance between life and work was equal. When I moved, I was given the opportunity to transfer to a different branch, and here I go home hating my job wondering if I will be fired, and I don’t get to spend as much time as I want with my family."
good,This company has a lot of training and prepares you in every way to succeed in your position. Goals from quarter to are sometimes unattainable because of decrease in traffic.
good,"I choose not to write a review at this time about my opinions on typical work day, what I learned, management, workplace culture, hardest part of the job etc"
good,Great people to work with but not a lot of room for advancement.  No corporate presence in the area since their headquarters are out of state.  Lots of reports and criteria to meet on a daily basis.
good,"Management is a little out of touch, but mostly ok.  We are going to open seating which most of us career IT developers/team leads are not looking forward to.  All new positions are supposed to be filled from India unless business case can be made to fill from US talent pool."
good,"This was one of the best jobs I worked. The supervisor was great to work with, trained you well. Good working condition all around. Departments were relocated to another city."
good,"With Regions Bank, things moved a little slower.  My position was unique for the area, however, on the retail side of things, Regions pushes sales goal very hard.  Must be hungry for sales."
good,"Work day in operations consisted of being surrounded by many cubicles and several diverse departments involved in the daily process of back office banking. My favorite time of year was Evergreen week, the company celebrated the employees contribution to the corporate goals and environment."
good,Good company and good people.  Good bank and good environment.  Could be the right place for many employees.  Met and cultivate many friendships during my employment here.
good,"Regions Bank covers a 16 state footprint.  The St. Louis office is constructed of Private Wealth, Commercial Banking, Marketing and Credit.  With St. Louis not being Regions Headquarters, access to spread your wings into other departments is not an option unless you are willing to relocate.  Regions as a company in whole, has a powerful mission statement and is truly trying to create a culture that encourages associate engagement and community involvement."
good,I have enjoyed working for Regions. The culture and community are conducive to innovative solutions for a great customer experience. Regions is well established as a top regional bank.
good,"I enjoyed MOST of my time with Regions.  Unfortunately, I got promoted to another department, underwriting, and that was a letdown.  I was not allowed to go back to my former position."
good,"Typically very busy. Transferred to jobs without any background in that job. Some good managers, some not. On the job training was typically how to do a function but not WHY a function is done or the overall picture behind what you do.  It's a clean work environment, the pay is ok. The benefits are good; however, they keep costing employees more out of pocket on almost a yearly basis (deductibles, coverages etc...) Some room for advancement but typically the company goes outside the bank to hire managers. Good work hours, decent incentives. Dress code includes ability to wear JEANS now!! Loved that. They often have programs or luncheons to help employees with different things: health, finance tips, etc.... They offer tuition reimbursement! They have a week to celebrate the employees and give them a free day off. Big contributors into the communities they are part of. Overall not a bad place to work."
good,"Management is awful. You get little support and its’s sink or swim. If you’re proactive and ask questions you can figure it out and survive the first few months. Their software is cumbersome to use; it’s just awful."
good,very busy with a multitude of opportunities which doesn't allow you to focus and do several things great. good benefits.  making CEO and stockholders rich is a priority
good,I was the Senior Generalist in support of the Technology Division. I was able to do a lot of HR work. Regions did a lot with Associate Engagement and worked hard to make the workplace exciting.
good,- the best thing about working at Regions was the constant education you received from them. I loved that and that's what made it a great place to be.
good,"Good place to work but it also depends on the branch you get. Co-workers in your own branch can be either be really nice or really shady, no in between. But Overall it's a good place to work. Not stressful. Short staffing is a problem and management only seems to be pulling help from one branch to cover all other branches which puts  a strain on that branch."
good,"A career at Regions Bank is something to be proud of. There is no perfect corporate job, and Regions Bank is no exception.  I did enjoy my direct management staff, but I did feel like there was a disconnect with the senior level managers.  The goals that are set for each associate are attainable, but to receive compensation, you must hit your threshold. The difficulty of hitting threshold varies based on your branch location.  I would recommend applying at Regions Bank."
good,Great people and great opportunities to move up if you have the right management.  I enjoyed my time there and I miss all the wonderful people I met along the way.
good,"Multitasking in own department as well as assisting with other departments with no compensation. For this financial institution to be as large as it is, its shameful they don't pay their workers for the professionalism that is expected and delivered."
good,"The banking industry is always changing which is exciting, but it makes hard to have time off due to the busyness.  There is opportunity to advance and learn more about what we can do for customers.  This bank encourages providing the best customer experience and provides many hours of training to learn and grow.  The manager I worked for was not an effective leader, which makes the workplace environment hard."
good,Regions is a great place to work.  They treat you fairly/ well.  Work from 8 to 5 Monday' Friday every week. Not my much more to say about Regions Bank.
good,"Regions Bank was difficult to work at in some respects. There was a lot of pressure to achieve goals at the expense of what was right for the client. This drove some associates to make the wrong recommendations or even to fudge their numbers. Some of the upper management team was demotivating because they could make a public spectacle of what they considered your failures as a branch were. Compensation for the job was fair but bonuses were difficult to obtain.  Having a good branch manager could make the difference between loving or hating the job.  Some branches enjoyed an upbeat, motivating manager who made them feel special, important, and unstoppable, while others had managers who were very negative and made them feel like a failure.  It really does make a difference."
good,Working at Regions was always an adventure.  I worked in the Abandoned Property area and the largest part of this position was to inventory abandoned safety deposit boxes.  I never knew what I was going to find in each box.  Sometimes the boxes were unimpressive but sometimes they held many mysteries.
good,"As a Financial Services Representative, I assisted customers with banking needs such as opening new accounts, Certificates of Deposit, assist with balancing checkbooks, and general questions.  I was also a back-up Receptionist and Relief Teller during lunch times and other times as needed."
good,Regions is a great place to work with great employees. The hardest part of the job can be based on the numerous initiative the bank is working on and the resource constraints associated with the initiatives.
good,"Banking in general is a good starting place if you're wanting to gain professional knowledge, however, being a banker isn't what it used to be and it is a sales position. This is not limited to Regions, however, there is still a push to sell banking products to customers."
good,"This was a very fast paced job, but I enjoyed it. The only thing was the pay grade. It was a stepping stone for me in getting to a better job within the industry. I did spend almost 10 years here and I enjoyed the job and its employees and employers, but the salary was low."
good,"Structured work place, managers were friendly, job was not difficult, most enjoyable part of the job were my coworkers.  Work place was keep clean and comfortable, building had an on site cafeteria that served breakfast and lunch."
good,Good place to work. Very good in training and preparing you for the job in sales and customer service. Will acknowledge you when you perform a great job.
good,Regions is a big believer in its core values and doing what is right for employees and customers. The company has very loyal employees that stay with the company for many years.
good,Opens a lot of doors and sets you up for success within and outside of company through company events and customer relationships.
good,Easy to build a working schedule. You learn every position. Customers are usually regulars and you get to build relationships with them. Accounts are free to employees
good,"Regions provides all of the necessary training and support to launch a successful career in the financial services industry. In addition to training, the compensation is market competitive and benefits are comparable to other Fortune 500 companies."
good,I mostly worked in the drive thru very fast paced I loved it. I also worked in the lobby as well not as steady little bit more work like money orders and western union and other job duties.
good,"The job I had got me through college.  After graduating, they were willing to promote me but not pay me enough to pay rent. I did love my co-workers though"
good,Regions bank is a great place to work. It is fun as a team. They make sure the staff has everything that they need to complete the work day.
good,"There are several things I can say about the company as a whole both negative and positive. I think the company provides great benefits to its employers and it may be the best I've ever had. Negatively, the company doesn't provide upward movement in a timely matter. I know individuals who worked here for years and are sometimes stuck in certain positions not allowing for growth opportunities. Training can be improved. I think training can set the foundation of the employee and it can sometimes make your job harder that what it should be."
good,"Great people to work with! The majority of the customers are great, too. Some days were really slow, other days were really busy. The only downfall was we always seemed shorthanded."
good,It's a lot of paperwork and daily tasks to be done on top of handling customers. The service is good and Regions Cares about their employees and Customers. and Community.
good,"Enjoy working with others, during the things I enjoy which is communication with the Branches and working together as a Team to get the Job done to have Great Customer service brought to our Customers."
good,I've met a lot of really great people at Regions who have helped me grow as an individual. I truly enjoy working with the public.
good,Regions is a good place to work.  A typical day starts from home and takes you to various businesses that you want to convert to Regions Bank customers.  While there I was exposed to underwriting and financial ratio analysis that I found works well with my Six Sigma background.  My co-workers were for the most part hard workers. Most all managers were good to work for.  As in most cases there is always one or two managers that do a poor job of managing.  The hardest part of the job is if you work with one of those managers.  The hardest part of the position is working with one of those managers.
good,"I worked with Regions for a total of about 4 years. Been through two acquisitions before they became Regions bank and was instrumental in that process. My particular branch was a great place to work. Good rapport with my coworkers and branch manager. Saw one retire after many years of service and hated to see her go.  She was a great asset to the company and customers knew her by name.  The company downsized while I was still there and eliminated a few positions at most of their branches. Unfortunately, one of those positions was mine. I truly enjoyed working at Regions and would again if they were in my current location. I would recommend anyone looking for a career in banking to work at Regions."
good,"sales goals are high, not much movement in upper mgt"
good,The typical mortgage lending days consist of working with bank customers advising and working toward financial goals.  Project managing is required to carry the customer to the closing table.  I have learned to manage time and work with tight closing date.  I enjoy working with customers developing managing and completing loan applications.  The most difficult aspect of the job is the commission/pay.
good,"Great place to work if you're comfortable with multiple responsibilities and managers."
good,"Regions is a good company, very good opportunities.  The opportunities for advancement throughout the company are best at the HQ located in Birmingham.  Good co-workers, good management, great pay."
good,Generally a professional work environment without excessive passive-agressive behavior on behalf of most associates.
good,Good Place to work - Downsizing very heavily and closing branches
good,"Company is great overall but benefits, pay, and full time hours could be better. don't like the fact that there are no full time openings available, and do not like that co-workers that are in higher positions can sometimes make you feel belittled"
good,Absolutely loved working in banking until it turned into mostly calling off lists to sell to customers in order to make personal goals. Does not contribute to team co-operation when employees strive more for their own gain then to the needs of the customers.
good,We were challenged every day with new opportunities. The company (Union Planters Bank) I started with was smaller. We went through a merger with Regions. This was a great learning experience for me.
good,If you are not a people person than this job is not for you. If you can sell and stay positive you will be very successful. You have to be able to come to work to work if not your sales will be low and you could possibly be looking for a new job. In the contact center the turnover rate is high. I enjoyed it because I stayed positive and embraced the changes. I can sell pretty well so my sales were always exceptional.
good,hands on banking experience.  I enjoyed working with our customers .
good,"Banking kept in the local farming community in TN."
good,"From an aspect of customer service, financial basics, how to conduct myself professionally, to how to manage a staff, AmSouth/Regions laid the foundation plus more for my career path."
good,good company. so much better than most banks. Fair and respectable. Good compensation.
good,Regions Bank provides a great schedule.  The job is rewarding but the pay could be better.
good,"You may be a teller but you have sub job titles. You have a lot of reports that you have to do while keeping up with your referrals and completing customers. The people that you work with are cool and you have SOME nice customers. "
good,"Overall Regions does a great job with providing opportunities for career growth. The possibilities and options are seemingly endless. Getting your foot in the door can lead to a great and exciting career doing something you love."
good,"Their management is not bad, at times, they need to make sure how it impacts all regions vs the corporate region employees."
good,"I learned the banking system, how to open and close accounts. How to run credit checks and submit credit applications"
good,"My experience at Regions has been mostly good.  I've had many pleasant interactions with customers and have been able to practice sales as well as operational functions.  That being said, having multiple supervisors each with different sets of instructions and the ever-changing nature of bank procedures can lead to confusion and there is a lot of cross-selling required with almost no added benefit to the employee.  Compensation is very meager."
good,I enjoyed helping people solve their bank account issues or getting them to the right department to get assistants.
good,"Learned a lot about the Banking Industry. "
good,A typical day at work includes great customer service and working in  a fast paced environment.  I learned a great deal of patience and consistency in working at the bank.  I enjoyed assisting customers with informing them of their financial options.  Banking gives an opportunity to come in contact with a lot of different people with different financial history.
good,"A typical day at work involved staying on top of your sufficient supply of the cash drawer; intermittently trying to balance throughout th day; being aware of he customer's needs for they could invariably change for the next customer; and consistently learning the old and new products of financial opportunities for the customer."
good,"poor management, good co workers. Best part of the job was being able to help customers."
good,Too many sales goals that need to be met quarterly  and too much responsibilities for an under paid job
good,"On a typical day, I spend time on the phones with customers discussing with them the in's and out's of there various banking relationships.  I get great joy from hearing the joy in a customers voice when all the pieces fit together, or the gratefulness of when I have helped them through a tough situation.  It can be tough sometimes but if I make just one persons day better...its worth it"
good,"A typical day includes me reviewing underwriters' income calculations, reviewing denied Modifications, Short Sale & Deed-In-Lieu files to verify the denial reasons are within investor guidelines. It may also entail me representing the bank on a mediation call to advise the borrower of the best Loss Mitigation options and training other associates."
good,Learning the mortgage business can be challenging.  I learned so much and had wonderful people to help me through.
good,"The hardest part of the job was working without getting bonuses or worthwhile pay increases.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the daily customer interaction and getting to know all of my customers on more than just a business relationship level.  I learned how to adequately work through a work rush while maintaining a sense of calm and that working as a team will make the work day sail by smoothly.  My current manager and co-workers all get along well and are easy to work alongside.  A typical day at work begins with branch opening procedures, collecting items for processing from night drop, pulling/filing reports when necessary for head teller, opening for business and then processing transactions for customers in the lobby and drive thru in a timely matter."
good,Very stressful environment but can be managed with patience. Awesome supervisors.
good,Being a Teller was a busy job. There was always someone coming through the doors or the drive thru with transactions. I learned how to identify counterfit bills and to always be aware of your surroundings. The management at the bank was good when I started but the turn over in management is plentiful. I got along with all of my co-workers and enjoyed working with them. The hardest part of my job was making successful referrals. You can not make a persone do something that they are not interested in. I enjoyed working in a public place and meeting new people.
good,"Regions, as a whole, is a great place to work. My coworkers are genuinely good people. The company has a steady expectation of what they want you to do. As long as you meet your sales goals, you have a good chance of having an easy job. If sales isn't your cup of tea, I wouldn't advise working in the branch."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of outbound calls to certain customers about their banking needs. Everyday I learned how to become a more efficient customer service representative and my co workers were great and we would always come together, that's called teamwork and I am a team player. The most enjoyable part of my job was making sure that the customer is satisfied."
good,"Not a bad place to work, there are good things and bad, but if you are in the right area under the right management good things happen."
good,I didn;t really have a problem with this bank.. they work with you and its like any of bank
good,"i was happy there althou it was too hot to keep me there, lots of varied work"
good,Regions drills their associates on a daily basis on the importance of customer service. This is tiresome to have to deal with every day. Enough said.
good,Regions is good company to work for but salary wise it’s not competitive with other financial institutes that’ what I think.
good,"Regions is a great place to work and expectation is to deliver results and maintain the infrastructure to keep our banking customers happy. "
good,Regions has a difficult mortgage software program you will be on a first name basis with help desk. The central Midwest has an awesome Regional/area manager.
good,Regions is a pretty good company to work for. They teach you a lot and they do encourage you to learn. I do highly recommend Regions to get your foot in the door in banking because you will learn everything and they will pay for you to get your insurance licenses.
good,This is a overall a good bank to work for. They invested a lot in training. Unfortunately I am not in a metro market and my department was eliminated. I would work for them again.
good,"It was a challenging job, which I enjoyed very much. I was always learning new things. Met with different types of people daily. Loved helping others solve their financial needs."
good,"customer loan services interviews and calls, I learned to open up and put my self in others shoes to better understand their needs, also to become very organized, management wasn't bad but I had never worked in the financial field, I wasn't at all sure on what to expect from management, I experienced a rough time because of my Hispanic heritage, even tho the company culture said it was something it would not happen at the workplace, hardest part about the job was the fast paced environment, keeping up required much effort."
good,Working at Regions was fun. i worked in the collections department - the department was competitive yet fun. Meeting the department goals wasn't hard if you are focus and willing to negotiate with customers. The management was pretty good and my coworkers were nice. Every day was interesting. I can honestly say Regions value their employees.
good,I worked in a small town where I was able to really get to know my customers and their needs. Benefits were fair and I loved the employees I worked with. I would have stayed and retired from there if my branch hadn't closed.
good,"Love the interaction with customers and other tellers but manager and assistant manager wasnt well. They just didnt know how to talk to certain people, it was their voice. Its not what you say it how you say it."
good,"Enjoyed working for this corporation, but with a good review, was not able to stay employed. Laid off. However, direct supervisors were very understanding to the stress of having to depart."
good,"Typical Days can include meetings depending on your position. "
good,Great place for part-time work while in college. At the time the pay was good. It was very fast paced. The consumer collections department worked off of a dialor system.
good,Everyone worked as a team.  It is was our goal to offer excellent customer service in a timely manner and to follow up with the client to make sure that the situation had been resolved to their satisfaction.
good,"Good pay, benefits, holiday, personal time and vacation time. Decent pay for what you do. Must meet quotas in order to keep your job. Any employee doing bank account transactions have no protection on making sure the transaction went through and validated. NO checks and balances"
good,Good place to work overall. Pay should be commensurate with job responsibilities. Work load should be decreased in order to avoid high turnover or additional staff hired to decrease account load on current staff.
good,"I had the chance to contribute to the company and department goals and was rewarded for it.  I'm very thankful to have had the opportunity to work with the Credit Risk team.  Made some great friends and thought the culture was good but company was too slow in decision making and execution which frustrated me some. Overall,  I enjoyed working there and would recommend Region Bank."
good,"This job dealt  more with  customer services internal with the bank branches.Which can come in the form of calls, email, faxes, and mail."
good,I had fun at work everyday. Great company to work for. Being at a smaller bank meant more intimate time with your customers. This allowed us to get to know them on a more personal level.
good,branch manager over 10 subordinates
good,Enjoyed working at Regions. Would recommend Regions to anyone that wants a balanced lifestyle.  Regions is very good and fair to their employees. Although could be better with payscales.  But all in all Regions is a great place to start a career.
good,Great Place to work!       Great work life balance and opportunity for advancement in the Branches.  The culture is great and always looking ways to improve the communities'.
good,"Fantastic bank to work for. Consumer ethics are high and doing What is right is priority. Currently going through some realignment, so jobs descriptions arent as clear."
good,Company culture has changed over my 18 year history with Regions. I enjoy working in the HR department and helping candidates find employment. Expectations are high.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Regions however the culture has changed and it does not line up with what I am looking for, it has become more necessary for one person to perform several roles."
good,"Very easy to learn, depending on the branch in which you work, the management runs the show, not HR. "
good,This is a great place to work and is very family friendly. Good work/life balance. Good benefits. Management varied per department. Great paid vacation
good,"The company had great benefits. Plenty of training and room for advancement if you are willing to relocate. Unfortunately, the management in my area got a little shaken up and a lot of people quit because of that."
good,"Regions is a great place to work, but with any banking job there is always constant change, the minute you get comfortable and into a flow with something new that has been implemented here comes along another change."
good,Bank with solid internal controls and good management ho strongly adhere to control environment.  Associates know what is expected.  Bank treats associates well.
good,changing environment.  System processes that are changing and adjustments are difficult and occurring quicker than the bank is ready to make. They are trying but the pain is difficult for the employees.
good,"Always going thru changes. procedures, practices.every day something is changing. usually for the good of the customer. even though I don't work there any more I still bank there."
good,"Regions is overall a good place to work.  However, working with the public in a financial institution can be extremely stressful at times.  Regions does do an excellent job of training you and support can usually be found in your coworkers and weekly corporate communications.  "
good,Working at a call center was very different. It was fast paced and you had to know a lot of different information due to the type of calls I received everyday.
good,"Nice staff & coworkers games and more, and staff recognition they should give more than pennies in raises outher than that it was ok to work there !!!!"
good,Very big company-that's why a lot of greed. Employees are not appreciated . But very good benefits (and a lot of opportunities ) But woman are not promoted as fast as men
good,I like working for Regions overall. I do not have much negative to say. The pay is average at teller level and minimal at the next leadership level. I would recommend working for Regions.
good,Regions is a great place to work.  There are many opportunities within the company and a growing desire to help their employees develop into their full potential.
good,Regions' strength is in its people who I've found to be dedicated and hard working. The company as a whole is undertaking organizational and technological change efforts that will ensure its viability and growth in the future.
good,Everyone got along well and worked together as a team. However I feel they don't pay the bank tellers enough. They look out for you. During the time I was there a few of my coworkers were promoted.
good,Regions Bank has the potential of becoming a great workplace should they change making goals a top priority and realize that the associates are the greatest assets and should always be top priority.
good,Regions is a great employer.  The Corporate focus is on excellent customer service.  If you work in the Corporate headquarters in Birmingham you will have better opportunities.  Regions is active in the Communities it services
good,I worked for Regions for 15 years and loved it. I had many opportunity to advance in my career. I would recommend Regions Bank to anyone looking for a career in the financial industry.
good,"This is a GREAT Company to work for!!!"
good,Good bank to work for.  Goals are sometimes unattainable.  Many layers of work processes to go through to complete customer request.  Worked with good people.
good,Regions is a great place to work if you are into sales. Just like any other sales based job if you do not make your numbers by end of quarter you are gone.
good,This job is very repetitive and is stable if you know what you are doing. Good environment and plenty of opportunities to learn about the industry and have a guidance while doing so.
good,"Before I left, The branches dealt with high turnover and it never seemed like management was moving fast enough to fill any of the open positions but we alway happy to raise the sales goals!"
good,"Worked at one of the corporate locations in Hoover, Alabama.  Great benefits, management is very fair, teams had good synergy.  For a customer service position, it was the best I ever worked and it helped transitioned into a new career."
good,I worked for Union Planters Bank which had just taken over Regions Bank shortly before I left.  I truly enjoyed my time at Union Planters Bank.
good,"My experience with Regions has been great, though disappointing due to the multiple layoffs I have experienced over the years as an employee. Great employee morale and culture. I have gained life-long friends just by being employed there. It's an experience I will never forget."
good,"I experienced a lot of different changes, co-workers were outgoing and not so outgoing. Management was overbearing, but still got the job done. Very balance work, but some older people could not keep up with high volume customers."
good,Learned a lot about corporate working and guidelines. Great benefits and professional work environment. Great learning potential about banking and mortgage.
good,Employees were very well trained. The management held frequent training sessions that kept employees updated. Communication from the management down to the employees was excellent. The machinery was up to date.
good,Overall solid company. I came into the company very young and was able to be groomed into a solid professional. I was there for almost 7 years total
good,A typical day at work is very rewarding. You get to establish relationships with your customers and your co-workers. I've learned a lot with problem solving and cash handling. The hardest part of the job is trying to sell products to your customers on a daily basis.
good,"A typical day consist of maintaining reports for accounts being closed, managing the loan in my pipeline, opening new deposit accounts, opening investment accounts, helping customer manage their check books, talking with new customers about products and services, managing a teller draw, and overall making sure the branch runs smooth whether we are full staff or not."
good,"I was a Auditor for the Mortgage Department, I learned a lot about the housing market and how is involved in purchasing a house. I enjoyed my co-workers a great group of people."
good,"I love my job in helping Regions internal technology users as well as working with  co-workers to resolve issues. I work 40 hours a week, Monday to Friday. The hardest part of the job is when there is a Technology Malfunction, the phones do not stop ringing though it makes the day go FASTER."
good,"Process all Business banking loans daily"
good,"Sales driven, I felt internal communications was something that could be improved, however overall the hardest part of the job was to remain motivated in a slow traffic branch. I loved meeting new people and being able to go out and solicit new business."
good,I learned how to make a negative experience positive for the customer.
good,"Company as a whole is a very great place to work. health insurance is  great, along with vacation times, sick time, a free paid day to volunteer in your community. Although its a great company, the people who work for the company sometimes are not so great. Be very careful if your applying to the Downtown Ocala Branch. Its a circus and management is a joke. If you put people before paperwork and follow bank procedures, this is NOT the branch for you. I finally left because i was in a terrible work environment."
good,"A typical work day for me would be to log in to the phone and computer systems and answer calls. My position was in a call center enviornment. The environment was laid back, however it was very competitive. We had monthly goals that we had to meet. One goal was sales. This was the hardest part of my job. Selling does not come natural to me. The most enjoyable part of my job was engaging with the customers."
good,"Good company to work for.  Regions is not locally present, but from what I experienced I would recommend working with them in the Southern part of the country.  They are very recognizable and moving in the right direction from what I know."
good,"Regions can be rather challenging with the sales goals, and demand from quality. . . co-workers are like family, and benefits are awesome"
good,"Performing a wide range of tasks starting with working on Deposits from Night -drop. Cross-trained for Vault -teller and learned printing daily reports. Working closely with other tellers to reach our referral goals and having Morning meetings. "
good,Enabled customers to have web access with the bank. It was an enjoyable position since I spoke with up to 40 people or more in one day. Multi-tasking and efficiency was a must. Building good rapport from the moment we said hello almost always determined how the call would be handled. Security measures changed constantly so adhering to policies and procedures and changing banking compliance laws was always a challenge.
good,The hardest part of this job was not being able to keep all the clothes
good,I enjoyed the customer service aspect of this job.  I got to meet and interact with many different people on a daily basis.  The atmosphere at this job was very fun and energetic and my co-workers were amazing.  I did not feel like there was much opportunity for advancement and as I was working in a small branch there was a lot of time spent with little to do.
good,great job. great for advancement. I would not bad mouth this company some things could be Improved. management was good. some co workers made work feel comfortable. fast paced. have to retain a lot of info. most enjoyable part was meeting some great ppl
good,"A typical day included meeting new people and helping them with their financial issues. I learned to assist numerous customers with various issues and give each one individualized attention. The management and co-workers are like a family unit, we support each other and bounce new ideas and strageties off each other. The hardest part of the job is maybe not getting the desired increase in compensation or opportunities to make a bonus based on your individual location. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing someone face who I have helped and they are very thankful for taking time and really putting their needs first."
good,"Cash Handling"
good,Management team was very knowledgable and accessible.  The culture was positive and uplifting.
good,"Like every other bank that has bought out, acquired or absorbed smaller local banks in order to compete nationally, Regions is an amalgamation of branches with very different approaches to their product. Because of this all to common phenomena, the culture, and consequently the comfort, is dependent entirely upon the people you work with. If you are lucky enough to enter into a team that has worked together for a long time and has fostered a great environment, then this is one of the best banks you could hope to work for."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job are the many customer faces that you will see and encounter
good,"A typical day at work consist of providing exceptional customer servicing to customers and employee contact in other departments. Trouble shoot and solve problems with customer accounts, inquiries, and online banking. Answer and educate information regarding online banking services including bill pay, western union, mobile banking, mobile deposit, and etc. And educate customer on protecting their identity and accounts with safe guard measurements,"
good,"You can start a career hear.  When there are opportunities for advancement, they prefer to hire internally. good environment for the most part."
good,Regions Bank was a very nice company to work for during my time with them.
good,A wonderful place to help others with financial needs. I learned a lot from the people that I came in encountered with.
good,"Gathering all documents and information needed to review and send to underwriting. Co-workers and management were great to work with. The toughest area of the job was having to communicate with the loan officers that their loan docs. were not ready, for various reasons out of my control. The best part of the job was learning new tasks and being with team members and working together to make a difference."
good,"Managed supervisor's calendar and independently scheduled appointments, reconcile general ledger accounts, maintain office supplies; and maintain control of all purchases made and invoiced using QuickBooks software."
good,"A typical day consists of answering high voulme calls back-to-back all day long! You will navigate through many computer programs to handle calls. You will also be responsible for staying in compliance with different training programs in between calls- which is stressful! You also must sell and cross-sell bank products. Management is available for escalation, call screening, and performance reviews but not much else. The hardest part of the job was juggling call per hour requirements, resolving a customers call under the pressure of getting them off the phone quickly, and training in between calls. I felt like I was treated more like a machine than a human in that aspect. However, the most enjoyable part was the interaction with co-workers, occasional free lunches or dinners, and holiday parties. I also had a great schedule- early morning shift which left plenty of time for work/life balance."
good,I enjoyed the comfort of the routine and some what challenging task on a daily to improve and develop my skills as a teller and productive worker. I could have use more adequate training as far as the intial training is concerned. I felt lacking behind in having to ask questions my asigned mentor was suppose to have taught me. I often lack confidence until I independently learned the things I needed to in order to improve my working skills.
good,"Did computer data input, review of appraisals, property titles, environmental issues, as well as flood insurance work."
good,"I have been with Regions Bank for a little over two years. At my branch, we have three tellers and three financial service representatives. When fully staffed, things run very smoothly. When someone is out, the problems arise. Things tend to get lost ""in the grapevine"" at times. My co-workers and I get along at work as well as outside the work environment. The hardest part of the job as well as the least enjoyable part is the sales referrals and goals. For some, this is not a problem; however, sales is not my forte. Also, upper management sets goals without actually working in the branches and seeing how things operate. They seem to be detached to the branches.he most enjoyable part of the job is working with and getting to know our customers. I have met many great people while working at Regions."
good,"each day involves working with coworkers who have become friendsand management I have learned agreat deal from, to all come together to provide the best possiblecustomer service in every situation.... The hardest part is making time to work all filesand reaching all quotas without any overtime, but it gets done! It's a good feeling knowing you have helped people close their loan sooner than expected... I have learned that hardworkand teamwork will get the job done everytime."
good,"AmSouth/Regions is a good place to work, and I enjoyed my time there."
good,Was able to have great relationships with customers. Gained a lot of experience. Great community involvement. Wanted more operations experience and back office experience.
good,"Too many managers and too many goals to make, extremely sales oriented without as much customer focus, lots of unhappy customers. The benefits and pay were very good though, lots of flexible time."
good,"I review incoming subpoenas and locate responsive account information within the subpoena request. Working at Regions, I have learned to manage my time effectively. The culture in the legal department is laid back and can be stressful at times, but we do have fun...we are like a family. The hardest part of the job at times is managing the work load. Management is understanding of  when you need to be off and is there to help when help is needed."
good,Sales calls. Servicing client's accounts. Opening new accounts and originating new loans to meet sales and loan volume goals. Perform needs-based conversations with customers face to face and through phone calls to match needs to bank products and services.
good,Regions has good benefits and work/life balance.  Pretty high pressure sales though.  So far so good though...                                             .
good,Great place to work and friendly environment. They have a true culture of living the values and coaching Up. They believe in promoting from within. Love it
good,"Overall, a good company that cares about its employees. "
good,This was a nice job that was not very labor intensive. My biggest concern was that job security was unstable because company was constantly changing its structure and strategy so you could never really get into a good groove and feel like your job was safe.
good,"Regions is enjoyable place to work, defined goals and generous comp plan. Bonus structure best in industry . Upper management is good mid level management is a bit unneeded"
good,There is an opportunity to learn a lot if you're willing to work hard. It's a great company to work for and it was a pleasure to go to work every day.
good,A great place to learn and grow. My employer at Regions is always looking for classes and steps I can take to help me move forward into a leadership position
good,"The corporate culture there is great.  They promote a healthy work/life balance and encourage employees to give to United Way, take a volunteer day during each year to help in the community and to be supportive and respectful of their co-workers."
good,"Over all a decent company, very family oriented. Okay for starting bankers. training took a while but most of your learning will be when you finally sit behind a desk."
good,Plenty of opportunity for career advancement. Family friendly company.  Positive work environment. Management looks internally to create a bench for promotions.  Annual review includes career path discussion.
good,"If you want a customer service job that isn't too pushy on sales Regions is good.  Regions is one of the banks that doesn't quite try to force sales down customer's throats.  I enjoyed my time there, but not the career I want to end up in.  If you are personable and tech savvy you can succeed and move up here."
good,I was with Regions for over 13 years.  Due to merger with another bank the mortgage department was centralized and my position eliminated.  I worked for a while as a Production assistant preparing the loans for transfer to central processing.
good,It is a good work environment. Great co-workers. Was asked to do more than my pay grade which is no problem but never appreciated once tasks were completed.  Regions really does treat its associates well and it is a good place to work.
good,"It is a very helpful environment! People are excited to work with you, and advancement opportunities are around. However, it is a very strict corporate environment, and so that extends to workplace attire, for example. If you don't mind that, it is a very nice place to work, and most people I ran into there had been there for upwards of 20 years! "
good,Working in the proof department meant not having to deal with the public and we had a lot of down time in between shipments from various banks in the N. Alabama area.  Pay was based on speed of processing.  People were nice.  Department was shut down and moved to B'ham.
good,I enjoyed my job at Regions.  There was a lot of flexibility in my department.  The culture was trusting.  I felt my opinions were heard and valued.  Really enjoyed my manager.
good,Sales and Service goals for banking center. Day to day operations of lobby and drive thru. Build and develop customer relationships in Business and Consumer customers. Financial Goals through investment products and Insurance.
good,Enjoyed working at Regions Bank and loved meeting new people. The hardest part of the job was having to memorize all of the different types of procedures.
good,The company started off being a great place to work.  With every bank purchased the overall environment changed.  The positions were more numbers driven without thought for the customer.
good,Regions Bank was a new adventure into a totally new career for me.  I have learned everyday new things about the banking industry.  I have been rewarded for my sales success.
good,Regions Bank have a good training and alot of advancement opportunities. Location of the operation center is good. Management staff very knowledgeable and helpful. Benefits are expensive.
good,"I worked here for several years.  It was easy work, but not much room for advancement.  I also didn't enjoy the push for sales from tellers.  Overall, it was an ok job, they helped pay for my college.  I enjoyed most of the people I worked with.  It just wasn't the forever job for me."
good,"I have worked with wonderful people throughout my tenure at Regions bank. The bank is currently going through a process called Simplify and Grow and my position was eliminated. I loved my job, but now I am searching for a new role with a wonderful company."
good,"▪ Develop sales strategies that incorporate client segments, market opportunities, competitive forces and"
good,"I worked at Regions a couple of times, so a typical day at work varied for me. A typical day at work consisted of creating application code and pushing/pulling from Git which was the primary source code repository. I learned a lot about customer facing applications. Managers at Regions never like to admit fault or wrong doing, and it's definitely a politically charged environment. I enjoyed working at Regions most because of the yearly festivities for Evergreen. Everyone always got along so well during that time of year."
good,"I am proud to say that I learned a lot during my 3+ years.  I must admit that my manager afforded me the opportunity to get outside of my comfort zone and expand my overall banking knowledge. For her confidence and encouragement, I will always be grateful. She afforded me the opportunity to advance my management skills while overseeing weekly sales management meetings in her absence.  These opportunities promoted respect from my fellow RM's and allowed me to advance my managerial/leadership objectives.  Having been a top producer for my past 4 banks, I am eager to directly manage my own relationship management team.  I know that I have the ability to motivate, train and inspire and am looking forward to that chapter in my career advancement."
good,"Our branch opens at 8. it is small so you get to know your coworker really well, really quickly. Some times we are really busy and others we sit for an hour between customers. It is never the same."
good,"I only left Regions because our department was transferred to Birmingham. I had an excellent manager and the upper-level management was very supportive as well. "
good,Strong culture for growth.  The work life balance is encouraged throughout the organization.  Senior management is easily available and collaboration among various teams.
good,Working in private wealth my opinion mattered. We worked together in a team orientated environment. I have a self-starter position with little supervision and had to anticipate the associates I supported daily and future needs. Assist and participate in customer meetings and customer needs.
good,"Love working at Regions, Hatted a lot of the new small waste of time task, Management Should be able to coach and receive coaching from associates. Hardest part of the job being Micro Managed. Greatest thing you meet great humans."
good,"A typical day started with a dual control team performing night drop, separating bags and processing deposits before the bank opened. Once everyone had their bags done we would have to sell money to the vault in order to keep our drawer balances where they need to be. The branch I was employed at was one that held a lot of commercial accounts so we were always doing change orders and processing deposits for various stores and restaurants. We also had several businesses that sent multiple deposits in that we all had to process. At anytime during the day the bank would either be extremely busy or nothing to do. "
good,"Regions truly cares about its associates and customers. ""Doing the Right Thing"" is literally built into the company motto. Branch life can be very stressful at times, but it is very rewarding when you impact a customer's life in a positive way, sometimes revolutionizing their life."
good,A typical work day was prospecting and meeting with existing clients and prospects.  Enjoyed the interviewing process with my clients and matching appropriate products and services with the need of the client to help the continue growth of their businesses.  There is a constant learning environment as services and products change to keep up with the changing environment.
good,"Face paced, customer service learning advancement."
good,"Regions believes in integrity, customer service and doing what is right. Regions is an excellent company who's importance is to working in an ethical environment."
good,It has  been quite some time since I have worked here and many of those I worked with have moved on or retired.  Not sure what the environment is like now.
good,Was a good place to work and learn.   Co workers were friendly.  Felt like a family at times.    Hardest part was going through a merger with a local bank.
good,"-	Assisted short staffed branches to maintain daily operations"
good,"Regions is a great firm. There is work life balance and each of the employees feel like family to each other. It is sometimes difficult to advance in your career given it's smaller size, but make the work load a lot easier."
good,"Regions Bank is a great company to work for, they have a solid foundation in which to work. Their core values are seen thru-out different departments and community involvements."
good,Great company but pay and benefits could be better.  Focus is mainly on selling but it is a sales job so its what you would expect. The job itself can be very stressful with the sales goals.
good,"very busy working environment. Meeting sales goals, following the company image and work ethics. Team work, learning new things, report to management. Monthly audits, compliance."
good,Regions is a great company.  The organization and pay rate could be a little for the sake of all the workers have to do within and outside of their actual assigned title or position
good,The Jacksonville team really cares about there employees and will fight for them and take it as fare as they can to help someone keep there job others not so much.
good,The organization does an great job of defining and communicating it's core values.  There are amazing employees to work with across the organization and the people are what define this organization.
good,Started working  at Regions (Formally First and Merchants) in 1975 and found it enjoyable. In my stay at Regions I moved throughout check processing department.
good,During my time as a Regions Financial Corporation employee I grew not only as an individual but also as an employee. I enjoyed my job as well as my co-workers.
good,"great company good management and footprint, flexibility and good compensation, growth opportunities with many training advancement opportunities, se company"
good,"No  laid back days, job was demanding somethings stressful, deadlines had to be met. Minimum room for advancement. Being in collection field employees are not well recognized."
good,a typical day consists of multitasking a fast paced delicate transaction for a customer that you have to find objections to their current account to see where we can improve their banking needs.  I personally enjoyed working for this company but i do believe working in the bank was just not for me.
good,Great company to work for in the Birmingham area. Management is flexible. Company is family oriented. I've been with Regions for over two years and have had a few family emergencies requiring out of state travel. Management has always been understanding.
good,"Regions is a wonderful company with it's employees best interest in mind.  As an intern I made $18 an hour and got a job offer to return but I wanted to stay local in Columbus after I graduated from my undergrad.  Regions can be a spartan place, though.  They didn't offer much in the way of work escape."
good,Applications development department allowed room for grow in career. Scrum environment made it easy to produce result for product owner for project. Co-workers eager to work together to accomplish ask.We were able to leave every  other Wednesday before 1pm after demonstrating results over 2 week sprint and we ended up at lunch together and enjoying the rest of our evening at home or with family.
good,Typical 8am to 6pm job. Associates need to be on time everyday and be able to work long hours on your feet and handle peer pressure. Providing good customer service is number 1 and selling products of course.  Short breaks throughout the day and lunch time is given.  Managers keep an open door and coworkers are usually easy to work with. workload sometimes get overwhelming with short deadlines but feasible at best. Willingness to travel to different branches and do presentation at multiple businesses.
good,The workplace is very consistent with its day to day operations. My coworkers were very helpful and informative. Once the process was learned it was a walk in the park majority days.
good,Great company to work for. Offered career advancements and would work for them again. They take care of their employees.

good,A typical day at work is usually high pace and very busy. Making sure I am understanding my customer needs and asking valid question to find ways to save my customers time and money. The most enjoyable part of my job is when the customer is happy and feel comfortable about the financial decisions we make together.
good,I have always fit into a work environment because I strive to be my best for the good of the district or team.  My production is always at the top 25% and I try to share my experience with team members to help make them better.  I enjoy POA meetings to learn something new from team members. My record of sales and achievement in the Pharmaceutical Industry is documented.  I have worked in Birmingham and all of North Alabama as well as some of Georgia (Athens to Augusta). I feel I would be a valued member of your team.
good,"I am able to multi-task in high pressure situations and maintain confidentiality while providing exceptional, friendly customer service."
good,adequate training provided; great hours and pay ;paid holidays were a plus; easy job with no real issues to report; not much room for advancement on the teller side
good,The work was interesting and loan input was always rewarding and bus. i enjoyed working here and my work. The paperwork was fun to work and input in the computer.
good,I had longevity @ Compass Bank. I was a senior processor and team leader. I learned a lot with this company and it increased my knowledge of the banking industry. I've taken that knowledge & skill over to Regions Bank where I have furthered my career in so many ways & I look forward to a brighter future.
good,"A typical work day would start out by opening the branch and getting all inventory out for the day and start running night drops before lobby opened at 9. I learned a lot about financing and how banking procedures worked. I loved the ladies that I worked with, they were one of the best work family that I have had within a work setting. There wasn't many hard things to do with the job. I loved the people that I worked with and enjoyed the job that I performed on a day to day basis."
good,Productive employment with the Timber Fund Alternative Investments with a two year interval between new investments.
good,"I especially enjoyed the interaction I had with the customers.  I was able to help them with their financial security and improve their quality of life.  The working environment was like a family of co-workers, each helping the other through the busy times.  I enjoyed the busy days, and the reward at the end of the day of balancing my work and cash drawer."
good,"Great benefits"
good,"A typical day at work can be as simple as showing up performing your daily task and going above and beyond for the company as well as the customers. As an employee of this company I've learned a lot from my supervisors from start to present. I am now more aware of my role as a leader and a team player. I owe a lot to my current supervisor as well as my co- workers. They've made my job both difficult as well as a learning experience. I would not have wanted it any other way. We've learned and grew together as a family. The hardest part of my job is having someone cross my path and not always being able to satisfy them as customers. Sometimes you can give your all and your all is not always good enough. The most enjoyable part of my day is having someone tell me, "" You made their day"" or ""They appreciate all of my help""."
good,Great company just need more areas for advancement.  Good benefits.
good,Face to face customer interaction was the best part of this job.

good,"I started out as a teller & ultimately ended up processing various types of loans.  "
good,"Opportunity for growth. Can be stressful"
good,The staff and management are top knotch.  The mortgage division is large enough to offer the programs needed for most customers but is  small enough to get the assistance you need when working of challenging mortgage loans.
good,loved my job. I had the best head teller ever. The only reason I left is because it was not full time
good,"Typical day at work was answering incoming phone calls. I learned alot about student loans and deferments. My coworkers were great, we got along well. The hardest part of the job was the times payments were going out and the phones were extremely busy with people who wanted to know when they were getting money. I enjoyed learning about student loans and I was also picked to help with a group to do Lender Verification Certificates."
good,I loved the job but needed to make more money. The customers were great and the people I worked with were like family.
good,Enjoyed my time at regions. Sometimes it can be stressful. There are several customers that are very rude. At times it can be relaxing specially when raining.
good,This bank was acquired by another bank. I did enjoy working there though.
good,Working with Regions was great but got in an environment where management made it hostile. Was under great stress at the branch but problems were not through out the company.
good,The experience was fun. Great company to work for. Flexible hours.
good,I loved my customers they were the reason I want to work everday.
good,I had developed many new skills in banking and I had a great learning experience working for the bank. I had an opportunity for growth at another institution and decided to take it.

good,The work environment is very easy going. wonderful place to work and grow. Great opportunity for career expansion
good,"A typical day included handling calls from bank employees at other locations. In a typical call, I would assess the problem they were having with the computer/ software (if recent update) and resolve the problem. Fill out all call sheets completely and log them. About twice monthly, I would restamp all the computers in the training room for the upcoming computer training for other bank employees in the region. Prepare materials for upcoming training classes."
good,"Before branch make sure all my report are pulled, reconciled and filed away. Branch a.m meeting make sure my teller staff know what their goals are for the day. Branch open greeting customer taking deposit, payment, cashing check, and whatever customer service issue I can assist with. Leading and directing teller staff where needed. I would say the msot enjoyable part of the job is dealing with the customer just that small talk, the hardest is sometime just not being able to help the customer as far as fees are concern"
good,Our workday starts at 8:00 am. We have a high quantity of night drop bags that we record in the night drop log and disribute to tellers.
good,"I appreciate the opportunity that Regions bank has given me, however I am in need of a career with more growth opportunity. A typical day on the job includes cash handing, Cross-selling, Needs based conversations, and Customer Service. The company has taught me how to uncover needs of customers and suggestive sell different products and services."
good,"A typical day at work would be to go in and count my drawer and set up my desk. Once the bank opened, customers would come in and I would make deposits or withdrawals for them, whichever they preferred. I learned my job very fast and well and that I could move up quickly. My co-workers did not seem to like that well and that caused a problem. There really wasn't a hard part about my job. The most enjoyable part of my job was doing what I loved best and that was banking."
good,Regions has some of the best benefits I’ve seen. The training is done very well. You are prepared for your job. The customer interaction is great. We were often short staffed and that causes customers to complain
good,With the right team you will be able to grow and enjoy a wonderful career. I enjoyed many factors of the job. I enjoyed the team environment and the benefits cannot be beaten.
good,I really enjoyed working at regions.  It gave me a chance to grow personally and in my career.  I would recommend their services to my friends and family members. I would refer any one who is looking to work  in banking to apply for this company because of their outstanding commitment to their employees and customers.
good,"Great company, best training program I’ve ever seen.  Regions puts a lot of personal attention into their loan officers.  Loved the training program in Birmingham.  The travel was a bit much though."
good,Regions is a great place to work. I just prefer to work 8-5 (or something similar) or if my schedule is an all day (currently 10-7pm weekdays & 8-2pm Saturday) that I am working from home.
good,I enjoyed working for Regions. I enjoyed my co workers! they taught me so much being they had over 30 years experience. My branch was fasted paced but it kept me sharp and I gave them 4 years!
good,"I loved working at Regions my 13yrs  it takes lots of team work to get the requirements needed. With the right team, you can succeed and meet the goals required."
good,"Sound management with a strategic purpose.  The bank and mortgage divisions operate as a partnership. Flexible, competitive loan programs.  Knowledgeable professional teammates"
good,This company provides good compensation and benefits. Very stable work hours/schedule. Advancement opportunities are available as well. Tuition re-imbursement is offered also.
good,Overall a great company to work for. The level of dedication via the StregthFinders 2.0 in Fl is amazing. The company invests a lot of time into their people. You are not just a number.
good,"Although I didn't work here long, I thought the people were very nice. The location was very nice, although the parking lot was big and it was a quite a walk from the lot to the building. Overall good experience."
good,There were many challenges that had to be overcome and often creative solutions were required.  People worked together the overcome the challenges and meet the needs of the project.
good,"This company can have a positive environment with many new ideas to grow you, meet new people and create a great flow. Also, i have learned any idea you have to make your day smooth you'd team is always open for suggestion."
good,"The company was great to work for. It was very structured so that you always knew what you would be doing hour by hour. The basic day of a Financial Relationship Specialist was run the cash line, do your sales calls, do choreography, go to lunch, cash line, desk time, choreography, cash line, go home. There is a morning huddle and an afternoon huddle so that you know what you will be doing and then can see what you have accomplished. This is helpful and of course things don't always go as planned, this is where having good management is important. I left this company because I had awful management at my branch. We were never organized. We would make a schedule but halfway through the day she would change it and not let anyone know and yell at us for doing the wrong thing. This is ultimately why I ended up leaving the job, it just became a toxic environment."
good,Regions was the perfect place to start my banking career. It gave me great opportunities to learn and advance within the company. Regions cares about its employees.
good,it was great working at regions until they became really corporate and got away from customer service. But it was a good place to work. Very supportive staff
good,Employment here was nice. The employees were very nice and the job was fairly easy. The office was small and the hours were perfect 9-5pm. The pay was not that great.
good,"Great hours"
good,"fun place to work "
good,"Regions Bank overall is a good place to work.  Good management, Knowledgeable staff, good collaboration among employees.  Team oriented.  Friendly coworkers."
good,"Good place to work, but I worked in the downturn of the economy so lending was very tight. Worked hard to service existing customers and the synergy with Birmingham was good."
good,I was working in the call center I have a lot of fun. at the beginning was overwhelming  but you have a lot of Supervisor and coach helping you all the way. Unfortunately for me the call center was to far from i relocated so i wasn't able to work for them no more.
good,Here at Regions Bank I experienced how to be a professional working with high net worth and international clientele.  I made great connections with customers during this position.
good,"Regions is good about promoting internally. For employees who want to advance, their opportunities are endless. Some departments offer flexible hours and remote work while others aren’t as accommodating."
good,I no longer work for this company.  I worked there for 18 years.  I worked in a lot of departments and learned a lot about banking.  I wish to go back to banking.
good,"great training environment, great team members, met coworkers that i will consider great life long friends, great experience with potential for advancement."
good,"In the 2 years I've been there I can say there have been a lot of changes some welcomed and some unwelcome, however I would say it's pretty much what you ultimately decide to make of it. The CRM group is very competitive."
good,I really enjoyed coming to work everyday when I worked at the Panama City branch.  I learned responsibility and how to interact with fellow employees.
good,consist of assisting customer with some type of relief with mortgage payments.  Providing them with a new plan until they could catch up their payments.

good,The work is done in a timely manner. You work well with others. Everyone has your best interest. Everything has to be processed correctly. The co workers are friendly.
good,Excellent work environment with excellent senior management. The hardest part of the job was the administrative support.  Most of the personnel were not up-to-date with computers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the good rapport with colleagues and immediate supervisors.
good,Regions was a good company to work for.  I love that they had an employee appreciation week.  The benefits were ok.  Pay was ok until I moved to a different state and saw that they pay much more then La.
good,My typical work day at Regions Bank was all about waiting on customers and performing other scheduled daily tasks.  Regions had quarterly operations training to keep Branch Service Supervisors up to date on the most recent bank regulations.  Regions was a good place to work.
good,I absolutely loved working in the mortgage department at Regions Bank.  Had a great boss and great coworkers.  I hated that they moved my job to Arkansas.  Best job ever
good,"I worked here for 10 years and hated leaving to take care of a loved one. My co workers were so wonderful and enjoyable to be around, there was never a dull moment here. Our customer retention was excellent and so personable. Always encouraged for any advancement within the company."
good,"Exceeds Requirements:"
good,This company is Nationwide and a great way to get your foot in the door at some major companies.  I recommend this company if you are seeking employment.
good,Fast paced environment with excellent people to work with that care about their jobs and what they do. Offer great benefits and know how to treat their employees.
good,Good benefits and good company. The company has integrity and understands family work life. Competitive pay for what you are expected to do. Nice work place culture
good,"First job, worked drive thru, loved my job. just better opportunity elsewhere. Must be a people person definitely at customer interaction job, if you dont like the public dont work at a bank"
good,"I enjoyed the team atmosphere that Regions was able to provide. I also enjoyed providing consumers with financial options Regions offered in terms of individual or business savings, retirement, and loans."
good,"Regions was a great organization to work for.  The culture is such that of a work family.  Although very busy and quick pace, the work wasn't stressful due to the staff working collaborative to achieve results."
good,I am currently retried from Region Bank. The  bank was a good place to work. The assignments where very challenging and very rewarding. I worked om several different system from online systems to server with oracle data base.
good,New hires will receive extensive on going training both to be completed independently and with senior staff.  Schedules are Monday through Friday working two half day Saturdays per month
good,Regions is a nice place to work when everything is consistent. The problem is when the branch is not fully staffed. The company takes its time to hire new associates and sometimes took over six months to fill vacancies which causes a stressful work enviroment.
good,"Regions bank is a very flexible and laid back place to work. I had no intentions on leaving until my branch manager began revealing her true, unprofessional  colors."
good,Regions Bank was one of my favorite places to work. Very professional. I also like that you were able to advance based off of your work ethic. Regions was great.
good,Life at Regions bank was overall satisfactory. Goals were high but reachable. Management was good as long as you were doing your numbers. If you had an interest in moving up as long as you put in the work you had options to move up.
good,Nice work place. Good job for you if you’re good at being a sales person. Very fun and positive environment overall. Provides good experience for a customer service.
good,I really enjoy working at regions. I have been with the company since 2010. Every management that I have had really cares about their team as a whole.
good,"Teller, cash handling , customer service rep .  Daily activities were pleasurable experience. Meeting and speaking to customers daily.  Always nice to meet New People."
good,"I enjoyed the work very much, very full filling and professional. I loved the challenge of the day to day work load, and working with the customers that came in to see me for their financial needs."
good,N/A Working at Regions Bank has been fun and interesting at the same time. While I enjoy working with customers I don't have it in me to product push anymore and that is huge at our branch.
good,While I was there we were offered good benefits and fair pay. There are usually lots of opportunities for advancement if you work hard and do your job properly.
good,I've learned a lot about banking but environment is stressful. The pay isn't worth the stress. it's good to see improvement & growth in the company but they're more for the customer than the employee.
good,"I enjoy the culture. fun. relaxed. fast paced. great benefits, employee discounts, ability to work remotely; great managers and leaders. employees are cared about"
good,It was a fast paced high energy work environment at times.  Helped to manage staff of 7 or more individuals.  I was able to learn how to handle customer and associates concerns in an effective way to satisfy both parties while maintaining optimal customer service.  I was part of the management team so I made sure that associates knew that someone at their  job cares about them. The area was a fair to middle class environment which we treated everyone the same. The hardest part of the job was not being able to meet the needs of every customer. The most enjoyable part was to exhaust all avenues before having to tell the customer.  I enjoyed coming to work surrounded by a group of people I considered my extended family.
good,It was a great place to work. Pay was fine. Management was fine. Benefits were fine. Hours were fine. I just want to do something different. I would recommend it to other people.
good,A typical day at Regions Bank was entering accurate data to  confirm information received from area branches regarding small and personal loans for business accounts.  It was a check and balance system for corporate directors to make sure that lending  information was correct.
good,They put a lot of pressure on the bankers to open accounts and sell customers loans. It was pretty cut throat and they were always talking about what we could do to sell more products to people.
good,"Great atmosphere. You are always learning and updated on new laws and scams. Management, depending on their personality is all business. Dealing with customer service you will have people you love and some you will try your best to make the best out of it. Not really a hard place to work."
good,Best Manager I ever had she was very involved with her employees and made us feel we were always able to talk to her about anything very caring and great work place.
good,Great place to work. Flexible with scheduling. They care about their employees and customers. I would work there again. Very friendly environment. Great managment.
good,"The job was great, the pay wasn't for what I was being asked to do. I initially started out with commission but it was taken away. I don't know that many sales positions that don't have commission."
good,"Regions was a good place to work......management was fair and"
good,Great place to work.  Wanted to branch out and experience great job opportunities.  Worker for the bank over 16 years which I had a Great experience.  Would recommend to others!
good,"Regions is a great company overall.  However, if you were to get burned out in a certain area of expertise, it does not appear that they are very big on giving you other options.  I have had ample opportunity to move, but it has all been in the same arena.  If I attempted something other than what I am already familiar with, they would never give me the interview."
good,To work at Regions was a challenge on certain days of the month for a teller. Some customers were not friendly nor understood banking but on the other hand most customers were friendly and well versed in the knowledge of banking.
good,Very good place to work had good reputation to begin with Good people to work with and enjoyed till President changed and then downhill.Got rid of Agricultural business
good,"Had to meet referral quotas for full time tellers, which was difficult, but the staff was good about working together. Could be very fast paced during rush periods, but also slow when few customers were in the branch."
good,They value their employees while doing what is right for their customers.  The reason for my job search is more of a balance with work/life having almost an hour commute each way to work.
good,"I still work at Regions, I would love to stay however, I cant seem to advance with this company in my desired career field. Over all the company is good and dont mind working with your family schedule."
good,"I do like working for this company, but I am focused on knowledge, networking & career advancement. I Will Fill In More Later. I would like to give an accurate description."
good,"Worked her for many years 10 yrs company merged with capital one, then union planters and then regions bank, learned alot at this company as this was my first company"
good,Working at regions was a roller coaster. When it was good it was amazing. Some managers are great upper management not so much. The company as a whole is great. Individual branches can be a bit cliquey.
good,"I have learned a lot at Regions Bank multitasking, customer services, Regions Bank have taught me many banking skills.  Very friendly staff. I love working and helping the members/customers."
good,Regions is a great company to work for but can often be challenging to expand on current training and/or experience personal growth due to racial and sexist tension.
good,the branch overall is a pleasant place to work. Great customers but the compensation could be more than what it is. The benefits are decent. Management could be better.
good,"This was a great place to work.  I was only faced with difficulty when applying to advance with the institution.  After working at the bank for years and acquiring excessive knowledge and skills, being omitted for promotions and advancements becomes tiring.  Watching them hire inexperienced new employees externally instead of those currently working trained and knowledgeable for the upper positions, tends to turn discouraging and disrespectful."
good,It's a good company for. The branch depending on the manager can be a little stressful but if you have a good team it's worth it. The higher management could be more aware of how the upper management are responding to the branch employees but in essence the company is a great company as a whole
good,"A great place to work. Many growth opportunities for young professionals. Enjoyed working with motivated employees, our branch team was tops year after year. Sales culture was a little intense at times. Loved the perks such as bonus opportunities, Holiday pay, and weekends off."
good,"Regions Bank is a Funtastic environment to work in with tons of advancement opportunities!  "
good,Process paperwork for personal and business loans. Processing credit checks. Management was very positive. Fast pace work place. Working with customers and loan officers.
good,I started at this company not knowing anything about banking and after a short five years had a tremendous knowledge of how it all worked. I am very thankful for my time there.
good,"A typical day at work? Fast pasted"
good,"Regions is a wonderfully positive place to work.  There are many opportunities to advance and move up within the company and by having locations in many states, relocating is not an issue and the skills transfer regardless of location."
good,"The workplace is great,my manager is not breathing in my ear all day, just a real peace of mind. You should come to work and be treated like an adult, and Regions does just that"
good,"A typical banking day with waiting on customers. I learned alot of management skills, I managed a teller row of seven people. I learned how to manage my time. The hardest part was the companies demands but I adjusted very well. I love to work with the public and help people with there needs."
good,"Went into the position with no bank experience and was able to learn quickly thanks to management. Workplace culture depends on the branch you are located at. I personally love my team, managers, and customers at my location."
good,Room for advancement and you are recognized for what you do.  I had a great supervisor and gave me raised that were well deserved.   She worked with you and could help with any issues m
good,I enjoy the work environment. Its is very rewarding. Everyday is a different day in the office. I enjoy being an internet banker. The management works directly with you to ensure you have the tools and required training to ensure your confidence.
good,A typical work day is very busy. Management is good. Hardest part of the job is selling. The most enjoyable part of the job are the employees and customers
good,"I like AmSouth because I learned the basic of becoming a "
good,I love my position I just want to grow. They provide generous time off.  We have a week which is called Evergreen week where we celebrate the week.  Also they give us a day (evergreen day).  The scheduling is also flexible. Great place to work.
good,"Nice place to work, enjoy my co workers and supervisors. Position I'm in is not suitable for me. Expectations of making 100+ calls a day is not what was told to me during the hiring process."
good,"Very employee friendly, easy to use programs and good training. Very busy which makes the time go by fast.Would recommend to anyone,"
good,"Good company to work for, good team environment., ok work load. Parking ok , working with good coworkers. Enjoying the days off"
good,Opportunity to meet and assist multi cultural clients to obtain their financial goalswith the help of a supporting team.  Enjoyed meeting and exceedig goals
good,"I loved the banking world, just building relationships with the customers was a joy for me, if your a people person this could be a good fit for you and you will do fine."
good,"While working at Regions Bank IT department, I gained much knowledge about professionalism and Software Development. The atmosphere was friendly and I enjoyed the work environment. A typical day would be executing tasks given to me."
good,"A typical day at work is one that includes many daily goals being meet and exceeded. I learn the most with the customers that I interact with through their personal financial needs. By listening to them, I am able gain a better understanding of their financial needs and assist with the best possible financial guidance. Management and my co-workers work hand in hand with getting the job done and working as a team. The hardest part of the job is having to turn my customers down who may not qualify for certain products. If they do not qualify I attempt to find solutions that would help in rectifying their financial crisis. The most enjoyable part is putting my customers mind and ease, when problems may arise."
good,"Great company work for, nothing bad to report about Regions Bank. However, advance in the company is slow, Is going through a hiring freeze for the past 6 months."
good,"Regions have existing Commercial and Consumer Online Banking Application, but nothing that meets the particular needs of small business."
good,"Small company, not much room to grow. Supervisor and team leads care not only about your work, but you as a person as well. Took inbound and made outbound calls to customer regarding mortgage. Co-workers are amazing. The training at Regions taught me so much about mortgages that has not only helped with my job, but also in personal life."
good,"Wonderful associates "
good,Home Depot is a good place to work and learn. I learned so much while working there that I got other jobs in the fields where I was selling product before
good,Great company...stable company. Pay sucks and the benefits will increase in amount you pay. Overtime is a negative. I hear you can advance but you do have to wait a year.
good,I worked with great people and enjoyed the face-to-face interaction with customers.  Regions Bank is a fun and great place to work.
good,The bank is great to acquire experience . low pay with minimum benefits . Overall great people to work with and exposure to financial services if your great at selling retail banking at regions Is good for you
good,"we learned a lot from this company.."
good,I believe this company really cared about their employees and treated us fair. What a great place to work and learn from!
good,"No issues with the company until the bank merger that caused my location to shut down. The merger caused most of the employees to be laid off.  Some were able to find other positions in another city nearby, but that was over an hour away and relocation packages were not offered.  Severance packages were fair and COBRA was generous.  Probably would've still been with the company if it wasn't for that merger and lay-off."
good,"Very fast paced environment. Great place for networking. Manager is thoughtful and supportive."
good,A typical day at work was keeping our department's portion of the web portal updated with the latest news on credit card information. I learned the processes of credit card applications and enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,We worked hard to obtain the goals that needed to be met on a weekly basis.. if one fell short the other would jump in and help.. Best experience I have had in the work place.
good,"This is a great company to work with whether you are full time or a contractor.  Work environment is great, most people are nice and easy to talk to.  If you're looking for a career then apply."
good,I was a great place to work. I enjoyed every moment I was there and if i never moved then I would still be there. They make you feel like you aren't even at work some days.
good,A company that awards based upon performance and commitment to the company. It's a great environment although it can be somewhat challenging with all the changes that take place at a moment's notice.
good,"I have nothing really negative to say about my workplace, just being that I recently moved several miles away just attempting to find a new place of employment. Transferring is an option, but the amount of time having to wait to transfer is far too long. As well as the fact I'm looking for new opportunities to enhance my work abilities."
good,I was training to be a part time teller. I had some difficulty with the timing of the training and had to resign. It was  bad timing in my personal life so I reluctantly resigned from the position.
good,"Regions Bank is a good company to work for. The Company inself is a thriving business that wants to insure the business is handled properly,"
good,"Great pay, good benefits, low PTO, great co-workers, low stress environment"
good,Fast Paste. Always busy and opportunity to advance. Responsible for teller referral goal.
good,"Start the day checking for overdrafts, respond to emails.  Provide customer service through out the day, Clear exceptions, request current financials, etc.  Work with loan officer to submit applications for new and renewed loans."
good,The day to day customers are what made this job great.  I loved seeing my regulars and I also loved metting new people.  It amazed people when you asked questions about their vacation they just took or how their kids were doing.  It showed that I listened and cared about them.
good,"I really enjoy this job, working closely with the customer, and the people I work with. The job would be almost perfect for me if it wasn't for the sales part. I have a hard time selling things to people they may not necessarily need. I have learned alot of helpful things from this job mainly including the training with the various office equipment."
good,this was a first joureny for me in banking but i was an outstanding teller for 14 months and recieved and award each month. i also was a mentor for the other tellers and that gave me the opportunity to go the other branches and give the advice on how to sell our products to the customer.
good,"I am looking to exit the dealer line of business and use my background to move to another facet of banking. Perhaps risk, mortgage or other ancillary loan operations duties."
good,when the laid us off we got a good service package and miss co-workers so much. when I do my job I give 100 percent!
good,"Pretty standard for a regional bank.  Pay is above average, but the culture isn't the best.  The driving motivation of the bank is profit for the shareholders.  As a result, there is very aggressive sales which ultimately leads to sales practices and recommendations that are not in the best interest of the customer base, which oddly enough is very loyal."
good,"I had an excellent supervisor"
good,"I love working for Regions, unfortunately I don't feel there is a lot of room for advancement. It is a wonderful company with wonderful people and great benefits. I am looking for somewhere that I can advance and move up the ladder."
good,This is a strong regional bank with good management. Good place to work.
good,I started as a part time teller at Wachovia Bank with flexible hours that went well with my college school schedule. I enjoyed the atmosphere and learned a lot of basic knowledge about banking needs and financil support. Customer service and sales were two factors that I learned with the position and still use in my career today.
good,Loved learning new things within the company. The position has help add to my experience.
good,This job was very demanding and always keep me on my feet. Everyday I went to work I continued to learn something new about my job field. The people I worked with were always willing to help if I had questions or had a problem.
good,"A typical day at work consists of processing payments and deposits (consumer and commercial) for our customers, cashing checks, and counting cash.  We also try to discover customers obvious and hidden needs.  Management does a great job in coaching us to achieve our monthly/quarterly sales goals, along with providing us daily updates on the latest bank policies and fraud schemes.  My co-workers are very friendly and we work together as a team to make sure every task gets completed. They're a fun and loving set of individuals to work with. The hardest part of the job is trying to juggling several task at once (cashing checks, making deposits, payments) all while trying to provide great customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you were able to help satisfy a customer's financial need."
good,I really loved this job. The company was really good to work for during this time. Management was good to me and they really taught me more then anything about being a good banker.
good,"Working at the main branch in a major metropolitan area has its unique challenges. The volume of customer transactions could be overwhelming if not managed properly. This large volume of customer traffic had to be balanced with the duties of maintaining a million dollar cash vault as well as meeting sales goals. The upside of these things is that I became an extraordinary multi-tasker. "
good,"busy branch office"
good,Typical work day includes running transaction cross selling products to customers based on customers needs.
good," Responsible for maintaining monthly and quarterly goals. Branch Service Leader (Teller Supervisor) backup and Vault teller backup.Required to know how to print and reconcile daily reports. Have knowledge to order currency shipments. In charge of ordering branch supplies. Able to process all teller transactions. Follow all bank procedures and maintain annual required security trainings."
good,I never worked for for regions bank. I worked for amsouth bank before they merged with regions. I opened account for regular customers. My main job was taking care of the banks personal financial customers. I reviewed credit once a year. I worked with these customers very closely. I paid their bills and handled all of their bank needs.
good,"I enjoy being around different people every day, so my job at Regions was alot of fun."
good,Great place to work.  Small work but great people and learned a lot.
good,up was a great company before the merger with Regions bank. my dept was promised not to be laid off after merger but was the first to go
good,"I had a wonderful branch of co-workers. I learned a lot about customer service, and cross-selling product. Also, I learned how to resolve customer complaints."
good,"Aware of what is expected of you daily; balance drawer, meet referral goals, maintain professional demeanor. "
good,Company concerned with community.  Structured environment with career progression opportunities.
good,Structured working enviroment. Engaged in up sale consumers to products offers
good,• Developed profoma statements and cash flow projections
good,i really dont have much to say about them you would work 1 satuday of the month
good,"great people, loved the customers, I was the first person to greet everyone and talk to our customers that would come in, it was fun meeting people from all over the USA."
good,I learned the correct way to train new hires. Challenges being met and solved in a professional manner.
good,"Every day at work a steady fast pace, have to focus co-workers have great team-work."
good,"Assist in cash flow for paying agent and trusteeships. Monitor account and assist with monthly, semi-annual, and weekly disbursements and payments. First and only point of contact for most clients."
good,"A typical day at work would start out with outbound dialer assisted collection call to business banking consumers who were delinquent on their lines of credit. After completion of the penetration rate, each specialist has been assigned a queue depending on the delinquency of the account. All options were exhausted to bring account current such as immediate payments, payment arrangements, work out plans, and loss mitigation efforts. If unable to reach customer, skip tracing practices were completed using various systems. Communication to consumers were completed via phone, e-mail, fax, and U.S. Postal. All collection efforts were governed by the FDCPA, BSA, and AML. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team work atmosphere and how well we worked together as a unit as well as individuals."
good,"working on regions bank was a great experience for me. I learned so much because they gave me the opportunity to learn more about banking. I was the back up of the head teller, everytime any head teller was out of any branch of columbia, SC. I just to handled any problem when the head teller was out. The co-workers were great , it was fun because I helped a lot on Spanish costumers services and be able to comunicate with them. but the reason i quited becuase i wanted to finish college and do more things."
good,"Nice management and people to work with. The customers were really great. Busy office, and always kept you on your toes."
good,"As a teller, I took care of various functions, including taking deposits, payments, and referring possible new accounts to personal bankers. Managment was frequently changed, as we were under review for a merger with another bank. Co-workers were easy to get along with, and always willing to lend a helping hand. The hardest part of the job at the time was the stress level, as the location was in a high traffic area of the city. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all the customers of the bank, getting to know them and their stories."
good,Enjoyed the cusotmer and management all the co-workers was great I miss Amsouth bank
good,"I worked for Regions Financial corp for 10 years, and I had the opportunity to always do more than what I was hired to do. The most enjoyable part of my job was the human resources and administrative aspects of my job. I enjoyed being challeneged when issues would arise, and I was faced with finding the best possible solution. The hardest part of my job was not always getting the guidance I asked for from my direct manager, but it did not stop me from doing my best."
good,You get the satisfaction of truly helping people with their financial needs and goals. You get to help people prepare and get to their future on their terms.
good,"Work life balance was good. "
good,I was able to work remotely for several years.  I was able to hire people regardless of their location.  The leadership really cared about the customers.
good,"Regions Bank- has a great culture and motto! A. G. E. "
good,"Can be a great place to work at times. Other times it can be very stressful because they expect alot from you with your referrals to platform. Depending on where your placed and who your branch manager is you may have an easy flowing time here or not so much. If you try your best do what is expected of you, should enjoy it! Great benefits, vacation pay. I only left because I had my third child and daycare got to be too expensive and I weighed out my pros and my cons. If it wasn't for daycare being so expensive I'd still be there..."
good,"Great training program "
good,"This was the best job I ever had. When I worked for them they were so customer oriented it was inspiring to be apart of. Manager was the only thing that made me decide to leave. Everyone ended up not liking him too. Company values were excellent, pay could have been better but I went to work everyday and didn’t feel like I was working and I think that is such a rare thing that it made it worth it. My coworkers were like family, we were at a small branch so we all did stuff together on weekdays and weekends. I miss this job every day!"
good,"The best training courses you could ask for. Management was poor, but I believe has since been replaced. If we hadn't had to move I would not have left."
good,"It is a great company. They have an amazing employee retention policy. I mean, associates have been working for even 25 to 30 years with the organization."
good,Regions is a small bank in the south east United States area and the work load was very relaxed. Clients lived the experience of a community bank that knew them by name. Very transactional and time consiming. Not enough partnership within the bank with other like of businesses
good,"I’ve been working for Regions a little bit over 3 years now. My coworkers are great & I love the hours. I just hate that they are SUPER sales driven. BUT, they also make sure you’re putting the customers first. One thing I truly hate is the scripts and having UPPER management hover over us to make sure we’re using those scripts. It’s as if we’re robots sometimes. If sales wasn’t pushed so hardly here, I’d love my job. I love helping people and making sure their financial needs are met, but I don’t need anyone asking me why I didn’t push a product on a customer through every transaction. Overall, it’s a nice place to get your foot in the door in the finical industry. Opportunity for growth is at a sieze, on account, everyone’s moving into the universal banker role... and roles in corporate are being condensed."
good,"Regions Bank it’s a great company to work for, great benefits, banker hours, plenty of Holidays, and set schedule. It’s a good company, the only issue I see with working for Regions, your opinion don’t matter, no one listens to their employees voices and no one values their long term employees and that’s sad."
good,Good company to work for. Currently experiencing some internal restructuring which has altered and unfortunately changed some career growth opportunities. Leadership is strong and processes are customer-centric.
good,Career for some. Job for others. Good benefits. Nice people. When there is a good team going to work is awesome. They incorporate fun things. But with a low staff work can get hectic. It becomes survival of the fittest. You will work hard.
good,"Leadership seems to have recognized that in order to stay relevant as a bank, they need to reinvest in the business model of the bank, including digital banking and branch operations. Regions has been recognized by several industry publications as an excellent bank when it comes to customer service and technology innovation, which is one of the reasons I chose to work here. While there are kinks that need to be ironed out, overall I believe this is an excellent bank and employer who truly does empower leadership to be compassionate, empathetic and transparent.  Not all people are meant to lead and that is evident by reviews found both here and on Glassdoor...but these seem to be exceptions to the general pool of managers here at Regions."
good,Regions was a great place to work. I had the best managers and it was a learning experience. It will be long days of work but nothing out of the ordinary. We had one day off on the weekend and one half day on the week. That is the only thing I didn't like. But that is just a minor thing. If you want to advance depending on the department you could the only thing is that you will get paid less unless you came from another company.
good,You will have a work life balance which in total replaces pay.  You have to be a quick pace learner as well as pay attention to detail at a constant level.
good,I loved my customers and helping them with their banking needs. I was really good at sales and thinking outside the box. But it was a high stress job that pushed for sales and I believed in the right product for the right customer. I didn't like pushing a product I knew wasn't right for them just so the manager could meet her branch goals....
good,"Regions definitely cares about not only their customers, but their employees as well. If you want a career in Banking I highly recommend them. Especially if you live in the Georgia/South Carolina Region."
good,"This was a wonderful job. The management was very fair,easy going but business. It was very much a good customer relation atmosphere. The bank gave a small town experience to all customers. I was able to start at the bottom then received several promotions. The most difficult about my job was being held up at gun point and not able to trust the people that would walk into the bank."
good,"This was a good first job after graduating form college, the staff was excellent and the work environment was very good. It was great job and they offered an excellent benefit package when I was laid off due to a merger"
good,"Great company to work for, leadership team was very supportive and provided a great, great life work balance, pay was not so good the compensation plan was weak"
good,"I obtained this job right out of college and am blessed for it.  I was able to use my previous job experiences in the business environment to move right into the assistant manager role.  I oversaw six or seven employees there, some more seasoned then myself, and reported to the branch manager.  My day began around 7:30 or 8:00 and ended around 5:30.  We serviced customers with their financial needs, opened accounts, serviced loans, and referred customers to specialty areas of the bank.  My job also consisted of conducting audits, assisting with sales calls in the community and leading weekly meetings for our staff.  The branch environment was comfortable.  We expected our staff to produce and to do their jobs efficiently, however we did not micromanage them.  While I do not feel like I fit into the sales culture of banking, I thoroughly enjoyed working with people, helping find solutions to their needs, conducting daily operations, and helping our staff grow."
good,"Assistant head government bond trader.   Inventoried government bonds for sales team.  Conducted risk arbitrage trades in USA and foreign government bonds, options and currencies.  Developed software programs for upper management to review trading activities"
good,Verify and compute deposits of businesses and customers accounts. Assist customers in Safe Deposit Vault. Duties also included computing reports and working Finance mail room.
good,"Really enjoyed working at Regions Bank would love to go back. Great area not to far from home, understanding management, slow pace none stressful environment. Really like Regions work environment."
good,"Good place to work, people are team spirited and happy to be there.  Great environment and manager really do try to understand family, health and work balance.  I really like working for Regions."
good,"Management was very helpful accommodating work schedule to school schedule, as well as competent, efficient, and comprehensive. I learned a lot regarding finances and the computing systems they use. I got to open consumer & business accounts, credit cards, loans, referrals, etc."
good,I lucky enough to have a great manager and head teller to assist me in my development in this new work field. Everyday was something new to learn and strategies to approach all sorts of customers. I was able to learn more in-depth problem resolution and work more as a team.
good,I liked working here. I just got tired of being on the phone the whole time which I knew what it would be like but I wanted to build my career in different positions.
good,"If you are looking for the stability of a great company, this is the place for you. Do not seek out competitive pay, as it will not be the case. Great leadership, but bureaucracy slows down any process and cannot affect change within the company quickly."
good,It's a decent company. Just too slow paced for someone who is use to a being busy in their position. All the days off are GREAT. Training is almost TOO much.
good,"During my tenure at Regions, I've seen a lot of good people elevated through the ranks of management.  My area is Tele-Banking so we're on the phone a lot.  My coworkers tend to be younger so there is some turnover.  The most enjoyable part of my job is talking a frustrated customer off the ledge by giving them a way to improve their situation.  Hearing thank you for being that one is very satisfying to hear."
good,Regions Bank is a great place to work. The managers normally try to make work fun and exciting. Ideas are always welcomed and encouraged from employees.
good,"Being a telebanker your phone literally always rings, keeps you talking all day. Makes for a bad day when you have a sore throat but if you are a people person and able to make conversation while helping out a member of the bank then this is the job for you! I would help members find out stock rates, rates on our cd's, give information about their checking or saving account and when I seen they didn't have something on their account that I thought would help them out I would suggest a product to make their life a little easier."
good,"Stressful but fulfilling work with ample opportunity to serve and help people."
good,"A typical day at Regions is very busy. Sells through the entire day meeting sell goals. Very energetic co-workers. The hardest part of my job is selling to elderly people. What I enjoy about my job is helping people who do not understand banking. When I put a smile on my customers face because they understand how to balance a checkbook. When my customers tell me I did a excellent, job I know that I did my good deed for the day."
good,"Regions Bank offers opportunities for employees to learn and grow, however during my time there, i experienced quite a bit of turnover which created a more stressful work environment. Management at Regions were supportive of their staff and encouraged a positive work environment."
good,"I enjoyed my job at Regions, loved working and helping the customers.  Some days where very slow. I learned how to help someone manage their money and how to process loans and help people maintain and improve their credit history."
good,I enjoy working at the bank. Helping customers day in and day out is the best. Helping others on the team can be fun and rewardiing
good,"While working here I really enjoyed the first hand experience with banking. I learned and serviced a variety of customers and products from Consumer Banking, Priority Banking, Business Banking, loans, deposit accounts, credit cards, technical support, online banking, and the list goes on."
good,"Management is supportive and takes employee issues to heart. They listen when there are suggestions. They offer numerous incentives for their employees including benefits, sport events, outings."
good,I was able to move up within this company which is always rewarding after dedication so much time and hard work to a position. This company also exhibits great core values which is something I greatly appreciate in a workplace environment.
good,This was a part time job and so I left seeking full time position.  I dealt with people on a daily basis and balanced money.  I was never out of balance the entire time that worked there.  I have a great personality and was able to communicate well with the customers.
good,"A typical day at a Regions operations center involves punctual clock in procedures and self-reliance from then on.  Bundles of reject work are processed by automated sorter and balancers will compare them to the job number they have been captured and tallied under, and will then use sequential numbers stamped to the back of each item to determine where they were supposed to fit into the run and will check the physical items against missing information to complete the database for that set of work.  In my last position, I learned how to compile these databases using the AS400 and automated server systems, and how to maintain and repair Unisys image capture equipment.  The hardest part of the job was determining where items may have gone missing or what information may have been lost when an item becomes unreadable, and replacing that information so all accounts are balanced.  Solving these puzzles successfully is the best part of the job, easily.  Co-workers and management are friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed most of the time.  Management treats you as an equal."
good,Regions was a great place to work. Met and interacted with new people daily. Work was simple and not confining.Great management teams.
good,Great pay and benefits! Good training for new reps and a very positive atmosphere.
good,"work at a bank cash handled, customer service, phones, had to have good PR.  The hard part of the job was trying to make the your goals at the end of the day. I got along very well  with my co-worker"
good,"A typical day included upselling consumer loan products based on customer needs through needs assessment as well as training team members on products, policies, and system usage."
good,Great people to work with. I made a lot of friends at the company. They are really trying to compete with bigger banks such a Chase and BofA but they just dont have enough customers. It was a hassle to sell products to the same customers and hard to meet goals due to this as well. Other than that great company to me for the year that I worked for them.
good,"I enjoyed my job. I really enjoyed assisting my customers, as well as, my teammates."
good,"Typical day would be servicing existing customer accounts and looking for opportunities for other banking needs."
good,You had better be ready to sell. Great environment for the sales person. Goals are high
good,"I started out as a file clerk in 1989, in a few months I moved up to a desk job which I worked on the rejects and nsf items for  all of Mobile and Florida.  A few years later I went to work in the Branch System as a Teller and moved up to a Financail Sales person. Then I moved up to Assistant manager for two years. Then a position came open closer to my home and I went to this Branch as a FSS. "
good,"Sales are required per quarter. Depending on the branch, it could be easy to meet your quarterly goal or difficult."
good,"I worked for both AmSouth and Regions. While at AmSouth, I was an Administrative Assistant. I worked with a fun group and the job kept me busy. I worked in the Properties department, which opened new branches and provided facilities services to all branches and departments.I really learned a lot. While working at Regions, I was a Teller. I really liked waiting on customers and I balanced exceptionally well; however, I did NOT like the cross selling of products to customers. Unfortunately, the branch manager at my location was very numbers driven and if you couldn't accomplish sales goals, you weren't a fit and she would place you on the ""chopping block"" by writing you up to eventually terminate you. I clearly saw the writing on the wall and I resigned."
good,"Regions provided a well-defined job description and ample training at the beginning of my work with the bank, until I felt confident and proficient in my work. The bank set goals for tellers that I was able to exceed, and I was also able to gain more security and operational responsibilities as I displayed competency in my position."
good,Great company overall just wish we closed down an hour for lunch so that we don't have to rush eating our food.
good,I left this bank when I realized my dept. would be eliminated. I took a job w/better pay. Hate to leave AmSouth/Regions Bank.
good,"Regions Financial Corporation is a great company to work for and has a great company culture and values. There are many benefits as to working for this company and they have excellent vacation and sick time options. Also, there are many different opportunities for advancement with other positions. I like the fact that Regions awards its employees with a week of excitement and entertainment."
good,"I had a great experience working here, very easy to move up in the company I started part time and moved to full time within a year. Great customers to work with as regulars!"
good,"I started at a time that they were very short staffed, however, I love the two ladies with whom I work. My branch was not super busy. I haven't really been working too long for my review to be super accurate but so far so good. I work a little harder since it is short staffed at the moment and it is still a fairly stress free environment."
good,Regions is a pretty good job. The pay is decent and the hours are alright. My location had weekends off but this varies by location. I typically work 9 hours shifts so I get an hour lunch. Regions provides benefits.
good,"I have only been with Regions for about 8 months so far, and I have learned a lot during this time. This job helps to teach me about myself and how to apply that to my career with Regions."
good,Great place to work as company provides all the necessarily tools to make your job easier. Regions does follow their workplace culture. I learned more about finances with Regions than other companies I have worked for.
good,Great work environment and team serving the top 5% of bank client base.  Most enjoyable time spent was leading a team of professionals providing excellent service and solutions to complex high net worth individuals.
good,"Regions was, overall, a fairly decent company to work for.  My branch manager made an effort to help everyone in any way possible, however, the moral of the branch was drastically altered in a negative way by a few individuals.  Unfortunately, it provided a feeling that those who worked hard were encouraged to work harder without receiving compensation, while those who slacked off (slept at the teller counter) were not disciplined in any way, but still received similar compensation as those who actually tried to perform their job to the best of their ability."
good,"A very good place for a 2nd employer.  The work day is no more than 8 hours a day. Typically, a job as a proof operator is mostly numerical.  Your keystrokes to be considered is 10,000.+"
good,"I spent most of my working life with this company and enjoyed it tremendously. Regions is ahead of the pack on issues of diversity, health care and wellness, and benefits in general, including a 401(k) match. They offer twelve paid sick days per year, and four weeks of vacation after ten years."
good,"A typical day at work are the following: executing procedures on opening/closing, accuracy on cash handling, engaging around business and non-business conversations with clients that help with financial well-being, answering questions on transactions if a client has any, pulling reports and filing them, making deposits/withdrawals/payments, and helping with different financial needs."
good,"I had a great crew.  I had a great branch manager.  "
good,Very strong regional bank.  In a very strong growth mode right now.  Management cares about their employees at a very high level.  Great product set to help satisfy both personal and business customers.
good,"Regions is a good people driven company, the pay is fair and you get ample paid time off along with paid holidays.  They care about employee engagement and charity work."
good,"My perspective is bias due to my direct manager, I was treated extremely well, well respected and my opinion counted. I would still be there if it weren’t for a life changing opportunity I felt I had to take."
good,Performed all teller transactions including drive-thru customers.  Good chance of advancement - positions available to current employees before being posted elsewhere.
good,"My assigned branch of Regions Bank had many commercial business accounts, which caused each day to be fast paced.  Most deposits arrived in bags and week-end night drop deposits made Monday mornings very hectic.  Ten to fifteen minute lunch breaks were common on busy Fridays.  "
good,Regions is a good place to work. They try to be fair and if they do not want you to stay at a certain bank then they will advance you. It was hard for me to transfer only because they were wanting me to stay where I was at. But I love my manager and my branch.
good,"A typical day of work is helping customers with their financial needs offering guidance and education (loans, CC, accounts, service, etc)  Regions is very lending driven and they also have a strong focus on household growth and attracting new clients.  Management can vary from office to office but I am fortunate to have a very good manager that is extremely supportive and leads by example.  He works just as hard if not harder than the rest of us.  Time management is definitely the hardest part of the job.  Since Regions does not have all the most up to date technologies, there are several things that are done in an inefficient manner that can take away time from the things that really drive revenue and and your commissions.  However, I love that we still that we have the ability to directly communicate with our credit dept to get loans approved and fight for our clients.  This is something you do not see at the other larger financial institutions. My only complain is the pay and compensation structure.  It is very difficult to hit the ""numbers"" or sales goals to make a decent quarterly bonus. if you're lucky you will make 2K-3K every three months and that's before taxes and I work in one of the better areas for banking."
good,"Regions has a great incentive program for sales. If you excel in sales, you will excel in this company. If you do not care for sales, this is not the job for you."
good,"Good company to work for; values work/life balance; solid benefits for full time employees, and cares about associate strengths and professional development. Places ethics and what is right for the customer's actual needs high on their priority list."
good,"This is a great company to work for. The pay is great. The hours are great, which gives me time to be at home with my loved ones in the evenings and continue my education online."
good,A typical day at work as a contact center representative you are taking at least 70 calls per day. I learned how banking works and how to better manage money. The most enjoyable part of the job is working on a team to reach a common goal. It helps you to meet and interact with new people.
good,I only worked around 30-35 hours a week. The hours were great and I got to wear jeans every day. I loved my boss. Not sure what I was thinking when  left.
good,I loved working at Regions Bank. This is the reasons I worked there so long: They have an amazing work/life balance. They celebrate their employees. All employees have the opportunity to grow and learn.
good,"My job was to install and support the GEAC A/P system. Although I was a team player, my major responsibility was to work with my counterparts in the Finance Department. I collaborated with them to keep the projects on track and to see that quality assurance was guaranteed."
good,"1. Attained aggressive sales goals by turning phone inquiries into sales opportunities by making an active attempt to cross sell the full range of bank products and services to meet client’s needs"

good,I worked for the Bank for 15 years and enjoyed each department. I processed an average of 50 subpoenas a month. I learned a lot about banking and how important my job function was. Management and co-workers were very friendly. The hardest part of my job was to meet time sensitive deadlines. I enjoyed all the challenges and friendships I made over the years
good,I feel this was one of the most beneficial jobs I had over the course of my entire work experience. Management and other team members were more like a second family.
good,"Regions Bank allowed me to learn and work in a whole new facet of the banking industry.  I was able to work with our Area President, Private Banker, Commerical Construction Lender and Business Banker.  I also worked with our branch employees."
good,"Fast pace, several loan documents to be reviewed, very few calls in from bankers,"

good,"I started at Regions in 2015, and I loved it! My coworkers at each location I worked at over the span of 2-3 years, were amazing! I had an awesome work, life, and school balance while in college. Towards the end of my time there, there were changes being made that might have had a negative impact on the perspective/future of Regions, but I loved every moment of my time there."
good,the average work day was fun and productive. the work environment is very friendly and the managers make sure you are well taken care of. e most enjoyable part of the job is being able to earn an incentive bonus at the end of each month.
good,"Processing daily transactions, meeting goals, overall the environment was very nice, I had great co workers. I decided to leave the job because I felt we had plenty of responsibilities and the pay was very little. Health benefits were not working in my advantage."
good,"I have learned a lot from working here. I was able to advance in positions. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. The manager created a very laid back atmosphere, as well as being a cood coach and mentor."
good,"The management team at Regions is constantly undergoing training and learning. This allows them to be in tune with what their employees want and need to be successful. In addition to this, the management team is always improving to make their customers interactions with the company more positive."
good,"I was only at Regions for a year, I worked in their internal help desk call center, which at the time was in Montgomery, AL.  But, that was one wonderful year working for them."
good,"This was a typical banking experience with the expansion of adding insurance and other such ""sales type promotions"" in order to grow their business..."
good,"Wonderful benefits, great training but very pressured for sales. Some markets verses others. You work 40 hours a week and in rotation on Saturday if you in current area."
good,"Financial Service Representative (Personal Banker) at Regions Bank. My primary duties was to help my clients with opening checking and savings accounts, sell loans, annuities and certificate of deposits.

good,"Working at Regions has been one of the most enjoyable jobs I have had.  I enjoyed working with the family oriented coworkers that I had in my branch.  We all had the same goals to succeed and pushed each other on a daily basis to exceed the expectation.  I learned to have more confidence in myself as not only a professional, but also in my personal life as well.  I loved being able to see and come to know the people of my community.  My customers came to know and love me as well.  The hardest part about my job was the travel for training, but the company paid back the travel expenses and made it all worth it.  I loved working for Regions."
good,The corporate environment of Regions provides great opportunities to learn and grow.
good,This is a great company to work for. Appreciated their employees.
good,"It has been over 14 years since I worked for Regions Bank so I'm not certain how my ratings would reflect on the company as it is at this time. My time at Regions was in general a pleasant experience and I was exposed to a whole new direction that banking is taking. My co-workers were in easy to work with and many of them were highly motivated in this field. I always enjoyed assisting the clients. The hardest part was ""selling"" at the highly aggressive pace that was expected. Many clients complained about this."
good,I learned that a company with good values makes a great company to work for.
good,A typical day at work is providing assistance to Regions Bank employees when there is a software or hardware related issue.  The employees and co-workers are great to work with.  I get along with everyone.  I'd say the hardest part of my job would be the Atlanta traffic when traveling to branch locations.  The most enjoyable aspect of my job is the stress free work environment.
good,I enjoyed working for Regions Bank. The joy mostly came from helping people and knowing that I can put a smile on their face by being there for them financially. I did not have the best manager at my last location but it was a learning experience. What I didn't like about the job was the down-time. There would be times where no one would come to the bank to ask for help so looking for busy work was an adventure. But overall a good place to work.

The company was awesome and helped everyone train and get to know the banking world and the products that they offered.

good,Great job. Serves its role as a good starter job. Lacking leadership when I was employed. That was over 8 years ago. Growing bank. Great job Regions on cultural environment
good,"Though it was a great place to work, the goals were so stressful. Some management were very callous and uncaring. The workplace itself was good, some of the co-workers were cut throats.

Also that many promises would give u a level 5 for our goal for that day depending on your department in collections. Management is great u will get coached by your team lead twice a week for 30-60 min twice a week and a group meeting once a week. Your achievement will e recognized and awarded. Co- workers  are pretty good people as long as you keep your business to yourself as in all call centers. The hardest part of the job is staying top performer and not losing focus because the environment is highly competitive. The most enjoyable part of the job is the recognition for your performance and the bonus pay.

good,"While working at AT&T, I learned to improve my customer service skill. My team manager was great, very helpful and understanding. I was able to make long-term friends. The hardest part about it was when the calls were back to back and sometimes the calls would drop and another one would come in before having a chance to properly close the last. Schedule was tough having to work until 9:30pm and every weekend, but it's great to attend school in the morning. For someone good in sales, it's a great company to work for because they offer good benefits and give you many opportunities to make more money, other than your regular salary."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,"I worked as a drive thru teller taking care of transactions with speed and accuracy.

good,"The bank was a good place to work up in position, but the corporate side of Regions was too stressful and not customer friendly."
good,"Stays steady throughout the day "
good,I really enjoyed this job and the time and experience. I am currently working at Regions now because of it but with CBRE in Corporate Real Estate due to my accounts payable position with Regions Mortgage.
good,We work together as a team and there is something new to learn daily. There is a lot of turn over in management as well as among the tellers. Everyone get alone quite well and in harmony. Sometimes it hard to fill in for someone in there absence because this is someting you do not do reguarly. We try to make our job e in a fun and pleasurable setting.
good,"great hours, great pay, great people, proof department was easy but boring."
good,"Each day I input loan applications based on client need and qualifications utilizing discovery questions and rapport building. Through training and self education, I have learned all aspects of the loan process from discovering client needs, gathering all necessary information for underwriter review, contacting customers requesting additional information, setting loan closing dates and coordinating with branch officers, following up with customers to ensure satisfaction upon loan closing. Monthly incentive is both individual and team based encouraging not only personal goal completion, but also the importance of team work."

good,I was a co-op student/part time teller. I loved this job and everyone treated me really well.
good,I came into contact with many different individuals in the community and actually miss a lot of my customers. This company can provide many opportunities for advancement if banking is your passion.
good,"As an employee who was employed at this company for 10+ years, it was a learning experience that gave me the opportunity to move throughout the company. I enjoyed the employees and the company itself. The company offered alot throughout my time employed."
good,Great company with great values and a genuine concern for the customer. I have nothing more to say about the company other than that. Thank you and have a great day.
good,"The hardest part of starting work at Regions was the realization that a 9 to 5 job does not exist anymore. There were people that left at 5, however if you did most of the coworkers were angry with you."
good,Regions is a great bank however the treatment of primetime tellers were not equal to the level that I was accustomed to. However I would recommend US Bank to other friends and colleagues to go to work for Regions in their appropriate position.
good,"Great company to work for but has since been sold to another company and therefore, I cannot provide a basis on the current climate of the company. This was a really great place to work. The people were great and the management was understanding."
good,"management at the branch i worked at was very incompetent, never took responsibility for his actions and mistakes and would always try to put the blame on his employees. I learned to manage my money better, count faster and more efficiently. the hardest part about the job is politely dealing with angry customers. the most enjoyable part interacting with the different personalities you encounter throughout the day."
good,"overall the job paid very well my co workers became like family the management didn't do their jobs, they ignored their phones or sent you to voicemail when a customer would ask to speak with a supervisor, while they gossiped about the employees."
good,"Working at Regions has been a pleasure. No two days are alike. I typically deal with multiple individuals across various lines of business creating marketing strategies for the uniqueness of our geography, From event planning, volunteer coordination as well as managing various internal communications functions, my job has great diversity. However, the advancement opportunities are limited at this point."
good,"Too many management changes, many do not have the experience that their team would have.  Not good for back office communication, processors were the worst every.  Great underwriters"
good,"Your day will start with a morning huddle where you will set the sales goals for the day and your commitment to those goals. When branch opens you will spend one hour making outbound phone calls, and then you will start helping clients in the lobby."

good,Regions is all about what you make it out to do. If you work hard and learn more the more important you will feel and be. You have to stay on your toes but its better than being somewhere else.
good,A typical day at Regions is that you will always have something new to pop up that you have never dealt with before. With that being said it has allowed me the opportunity to gain a wealth of knowledge.
good,"Great company, Great benefits. The female teller manager and female branch manager had jealousy issues. I am just a fun friendly person. They are/were insecure women. A lot of the male customers would laugh and talk with me and bring me breakfast and they didn't receive any so they were upset.  I did my job and always was in the top 5 for meeting my sales goals the entire time I was there."
good,"Collections can be stressful], but the management staff tried to ensure a relaxed environment, department lunches, and incentives were just a couple of tools used. The management staff always had an open door policy."

good,"Lots of responsibility with a banking job. Learned a lot about customer service here. It was a small office, so I learned to manage many different job skills in a day."
good,"A lot of opportunity to move up within the company. I did not like that I have to wait so long to apply to move up given the amount of experience I have, a side from that it’s a great company."
good,It’s a bank so you know what you are getting in to. Really loved the people I worked with. They ask to much of the tellers and you don’t get any credit.
good,There a great company to work for very professional and great environment.The Customers are friendly but some of them need the one on one almost weekly and that’s ok too
good,"Regions is a fast paced environment, that practices an open door policy.  I would definitely recommend as a place to work.  I am just looking to advance my knowledge further on different areas of banking and finance.  Hopefully that will be with Regions.  If not, I am open to considering opportunities elsewhere."
good,Their is a real attempt to create a friendly atmosphere in a corporate setting.  Each branch of the bank has its own individual personality.
good,"Helping customers, and providing customer service though-out the hotel was enjoyable.  You have a variety of jobs to perform which keep the job interesting, and you motivated."
good,"This company was customer focused and supportive management ."
good,My first professional job.  It was a real eye opener for me.  I enjoyed this job because it taught me good work ethics.

good,Amazing experience kids were a joy to work with. Co workers were very helpful and very easy to get along with.
good,"Great company to work for and the management was very good in leadership and training. The workplace was great and the employees always seemed to be friendly and considerate to all. I worked with a great group of people and my department was very close knit and worked together for all, not for themselves. We are a caring department making differences in customers lives."
good,job was really easy. laid back. it's for someone trying to maintain a job and go to school. there was no opportunity for advancement in the department i worked in.
good,Arrive at 8:00 AM
good,"Restructuring of management can be challenging, but otherwise an all around great environment. "
good,Working in the Tallahassee market specifically was wonderful. I also worked in the Melbourne market  after moving and unfortunately the manager did not seem competent enough for his role. We had been with the company for the same period of time but I knew more about their product knowledge as well as banking regulations than he did. It also put a high stressor on my assistant manager and myself.
good,Regions Bank offers many opportunities to advance your career.  There are many avenues available to have continued success with the organization.  The benefits are average with discounts given to employees for bank products.
good,"Great work place, great benefits.  Management is great to work with.  Great holidays with paid vacation.  401k and benefits and paid sick leave provided."
good,"Very busy with clients, can be stressful sometimes, but a great place to start a career, Regions is an exceptional company to work for, I am at a point in life, the stressful level of meeting sales goals is not good for me at this time in my life."
good,Great place to work. Great atmosphere. Help you in the beginning with all of the training and help you when you need it. Overall great place and great staff.
good,This was a great bank to work at always promoting from within. Great intuitive banking systems and awesome knowledgeable management team
good,"Fast paced, nice work environment. Always keeps you on your feet. Good co-workers. Learned how to manage ATM's. General ledger for vault management. Hardest part of the job would be working while under staffed. Most enjoyable part of the job would be always working together."
good,"A great place to work. Very family oriented, and a place where they reward their workers and not just to work them to the bone."
good,"My day would entail of checking customer's account who had someone to commit fraud against them.  At the end of the day, it was my job to help people."
good,Regions was an incredible place to work! The people were great! Company communication was good and we had great customers.
good,I typical day involved dealing with customers and that was the nice part. The hard part involved selling to customers.
good,"Enjoyed working at bank, interacting with customers and learning new tasks.  A fun challenging job that encompassed all my skills.  Do to a relocation to area, staying employed with very young children forced me to choose to stay at home.  Employees very supportive and encouraged positive learning."
good,great job because you will have time with family on weekends and holidays
good,"Some days were very busy and very hard, and some days were slow."
good,Regions is a great place to work. I've learned alot from the company and my peers. I love the Regions Bank family.

good,"Toughing base with customer about their loan and assisting Loan officers"
good,amsouth recruited me from freds.  they liked my honesty and work ethic and attention to detail. worked here (amsouth bank) for almost 7 years.  they were bought out by regions about a month after i left for better job. i left when better job came along.  at the end of my time there management had been pushing tellers to get referrals from customers who had been repeatedly asked for referrals to the point of angering them and causing many to leave for other banks.  i didn't like harassing my customers and didn't like being hounded about my job security because of it. because i mainly worked the commercial lane of the drive thru i had same business customers every day. i was referred to citizens national bank by one of these customers who left.
good,It was a great place to work and they helped me when I was in desperate need for a job!
good,"Fabulous company to work for; merged with Regions Financial Corporation while I was there, and I continued to love my job. I had a baby during my tenure at the company and regretfully left to be a stay at home mom for a while, but I am now ready to return to work and utilize my legal skills and banking skills that I have been fortunate to have expounded on in the past."
good,Regions is an great company to work.  There is ample opportunity for growth and Advancement.  My career has been very rewarding and look forward to the opportunities it will provide for the future.
good,It is a great working environment. The company has a clear policy and the management ensure that the staff are adhereing to them. I wish that the pay was better
good,While working at Regions.  Some people were there for more than 20 years.  They were eligible for retirement but chose to stay.  Easy job. Fun atmosphere.
good,"Regions does a better job than many large employers at stating, and maintaining focus on, a core set of values. Those interested can look them up. One is also able to maintain a reasonable work life balance."
good,I enjoyed my job at regions. I had a nurturing relationship with co workers. Management at my branch were mostly kind and understanding. I enjoyed helping customers in a way they could feel confident in. There were some referral goals that were right on the line of doable and too much. It is a very structured schedule that makes it hard to manage other life issues.
good,The company is well structured and operates to get the maximum out of its employees. They train and push collaboration at every opportunity. It was a really good match only left to pursue a new location.
good,Enjoyed this job a lot. Good people and nice bosses. I shouldn’t have left. That department is closed now. i would gladly go back !! Miss my coworkers a lot
good,They need to revamp the metrics system. They treat employees like robots. You have a certain amount of time to speak with the customer. This takes away from offering the customer your complete attention.
good,"A great place to work enjoyed each and everyday of work"
good,"If you like a place where it cares about the well being of their employees then this is the place for you. There is a great work-life balance away and at work. Walking tracks, ping pong tables, and many amenities on campus."
good,Overall a great company. Worked at Regions for 8 years total. company seems to care for their employees. Regions is currently going thru a lot of changes and laying off.
good,this bank was great until the goals became more about money than the customer. It is a customer driven business and we should care more for their needs than selling items
good,Great company to work for.  Been here over 18 years just want to relocate to another state.  There are great opportunities for growth.  Most employees stay here until retirement.
good,I learned alot about money its self. Lots of money handled. Not just anybody can handle money. Hardest part was leaving my co workers. I gained alot of respect for someone who handles money on a daily basis.
good,"Regions is a great company where  the company mission statement  and values are congruent to what associates are expected to do on a daily basis."
good,Good place to work. Left the company to go back to property management. Would definitely work there again. They spend a lot of time training employees.
good,Regions is a good company to work for. Benefits are very good and the work life balance is very good. Some of the people that have worked here for a long time (and that is a lot) have a hard time with change.
good,"Regions in Minden was a good bank. The worker bees, ie tellers, were fun to work with. We all got along for the most part. The first branch manager I had was really cool. She was fair and very knowledgeable of the ins and outs of banking. The second branch manager was really cool too at the end. He is always for his team players and will not let the customers attack them."
good,"Regions was a great place to work. The management was caring about your needs as an employee, and very approachable if you had any concerns. They valued each of their employees."
good,"I was a commercial teller, so it was very fast paced, and I enjoyed staying busy and counting large amount of money. I also enjoyed being in the vault and helping keep it balanced."
good,I love my team and love my job. Its sometimes hard to move up but you do get the chance of you have great skills at the job you want to move up to and meet all the requirments.
good,a good place to work I enjoyed working their benefits good a place to advance  friendly environment. good benefits try care  about their employees what ever whatever whatever
good,"Life at a branch was busy and fulfilling. I loved being able to help my customers whether by deposit, or withdrawal, correcting a dispute or just giving overall exceptional customer experience."
good,I enjoyed working part time.  It was 20 hours per week only on weekends. It was a laid back position. People were team players and boss was great also.
good,Working for Regions was a great expericence. I work there for 7 years and learned a lot about banking. I started out as an Administrative Assistant and moved up learning more about banking.
good,"Regions is a great company to work for!  I truly feel they care about me as a person.  However, I do not enjoy my current role - banking in general has gone to more alternative ways to do banking, which means bankers are having to do more outbound calls to reach their goals.  I prefer face to face interactions with people."
good,"Liked what I did. I liked making a difference in peoples lives like helping with banking and even selling life insurance."
good,I have had great experiences with Regions in the past 10 years that I have worked there.  They have opportunities for advancement throughout the company.
good,"I  miss working for this company. But they had a really bad management problem that was causing several people to leave the company. The atmosphere was very different and maybe it was just me,."
good,"Enjoyable co-workers, except for management. Liked dealing with customers on a one to one bases. Some policies hard to follow. Some days where stressful. Overall enjoyed the work!!!"
good,Great incentives and culture. Wonderful time off plan and compensation. Commission brings in extra 5k a year. CEO believes in family time. Get day off just for being employee
good,"A typical day at work as the backup to the head teller requires: supervision of the teller staff, pulling and analyzing reports required for audit, record retention, maintaining an adequate money supply to stay within branch limits and service customers, solving customer problems, accurate transaction processing, making sales referrals to financial service specialists."
good,"The company has  a great culture, believes in work/life balance.  Transparency through management.  Able to learn first hand the job."
good,"I learned a great deal and was impressed with the culture of the business. I was fortunate to met great people with a lot of knowledge to share, that I could build life long relationships with. I was able to grow in my career! :) Awesome teamwork!"
good,Enjoyable place to work with a great support team and great management team. I've learned the importance of treasury management and how all all the parts work together to help a company function better. The most enjoyable part of the job is research and learning from others.
good,This company has good work/life balance. The group I work in is exceptional and cares about fellow co-workers. Bank has well postiioned itself as a community leader in southern states.
good,"Co-workers are fantastic and very supportive. Hardest part of the job is the long lines and really working on staying positive with customers about the lines. The most enjoyable part is the co-workers and meeting a lot of new people.  Company offers full benefits to full time employees almost immediately upon hire and partial benefits to part time employees.  I will say the biggest negative about the company though is they are very strict with their leave policy and number of hours worked per week. If you are full time, then all 40 hours must be accounted for each week or it is considered unapproved time off and can result in being written up. Even if you are only 15 minutes short for the week."
good,"helped with daily transaction,opening accounts, also helped with cross selling bank products. making daily deposit and withdrawals."
good,I loved working here. The staff was amazing and I loved being a teller. this company also has great benefits and I really loved the hours.
good,"very organized and very big and busy bank."
good,"Gave attention to training and remedial help but expected minimum goals to reach bonus', which I did but when they decided to raise the bar without raise in pay; my bonus' would disappear, I opted for 2 years compensation and early retirement."
good,"Daily I set up and prepped titles, loans, and insurance policies and batches so they could be imaged into the system. I loved the job."
good,It's a comfortable place to work with good people.  Management is personable and laid back.
good,Very corporate environment with a lot of Type A personalities.  Truly like the people I worked with.  Never have I worked with a more competent group of people.  Everybody there is very smart.
good,The banking industry is a great place to be. There are many people that think highly of you because you are their banker.
good,"Enjoyed the job even though most days it was stressful, but that goes along with handling money every single day."
good,I love working with my customers everyday and helping them manage their finances and offer them solutions for their needs.
good,deposits usually started the day. I learned a lot about bank office work and management was extremly helpful. keeping up with the survelience of my branch and outside ATM was the hardest part because I would jam or just not record. the free career advice I recieved was the best.
good,My job is a pleasurable place to work.  I get along really well my co-workers and the stress level is too a minimum.  I consider my workplace a fun environment and my coworkers as family.
good,"Everyday could be different. For example, one day could be very busy when the next could be completely dead. I learned how to sale products to customers as well as non-customers. Having product knowledge came in handy at these points. I learned to use benefit language. My co-workers were very easy to get along with and they were always willing to help out. The hardest part of the job was trying to get non-customers to become customers. The most common reason was that they didn't have enough time. When they said this, I always said we could set up an appointment; the majority of the time they were still unwilling. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers out. It's part of doing what's right, meeting the financial needs of the customers"
good,"Great people and place to work"
good,Good working environment. My manager was the greatest. He did not mind going to bat for his employees. Co-workers were a great group of people to work with. Typical day at work included all aspects of customers seeking information on their credit cards. The hardest part of the job was remembering to verify each customer that called especially when it is a busy day.
good,"Fun place to work, challenging and upbeat . Sometimes a lot to deal with but i like the challenge"
good,"Typical day: co-managed the teller line, solve customer’s problems"
good,I love my job with Regions Bank. My frustration is trying for advancement. They've changed it in the last few years. I'm not sure how I like it. But I do like working with regions.
good,It is a Great company to work for. It’s a great opportunity if you are looking for a long term job and you are dedicated. Let Regions bank be your place to work with great people.
good,good place to work with good benefits and good people. I really don't need to go into details as the doesn't have anything to do with working for another company in a different location
good,Regions bank is a great company that provides good opportunities for advancement in the field. Some locations are better than others so make sure to ask pointed questions in your interview.
good,Regions was the perfect place to start my banking career. It gave me great opportunities to learn and advance within the company. Regions cares about its employees.
good,A typical day at work is getting there and MSP is down. I learned to move to something that doesn't intel using MSP. Management on an average is good.
good,"Opening and Closing Procedures"
good,Great place to work. No cons I can think of. Associates are friendly and helpful for new hires. Management is great. Lots of collaboration with other lines of business.
good,"Regions averaged between 65% & 80 % internal hires during the downturn in economy. Offered many internal training and development programs supporting talent management. Every employee awarded (1) day off for employee appreciation. Also, offered a comprehensive benefits package."
good,"Regions cultivates their employees, with on-the-job training as well as offering additional educational opportunities. Great place to work for, fast paced and with great management."
good,"Environment was mixed at days, the hardest part of the day was not being noticed by your co-workers, Got to learn many things the hard way when unable to understand certain things even though training was taken."
good,I loved working at Regions. I really enjoyed my job as a commercial loan assistant. All of the lenders and loan assistants were always friendly and helpful. The customers were my favorite. They were truly a joy and made me needed and appreciated.
good,"Great company to grow with. Love the security this company gives, and the relationships that have been built. I wasn't a huge fan of the pay, but one of the ways to supplement the income is through bonuses. Another idea will be to seek advancement. Very stable company."
good,Working at Regions Bank has been a pleasure and I was passionate about my position in the company.  I thrived on the balance of sales and service goals and the time spent developing associates.  Regions believes and executes on it's belief of training associates and making them the best financials consultants for the good of their customer base.
good,"The hardest part of my job was trying to find new relationship. It was not impossible but it was hard."
good,The culture of the company is changing. The exsisting team was not happy with the change and it created an environment that was not productive. Some days better than others.
good,"If you can get a team that works well together and gets along, it's great.  I've worked with great teams and with not-so-great teams.  The pay could be better.  They need to work on adequately rewarding their most valued associates."
good,Region was my first banking job.I learned a lot from the people I worked with. Many may think that being in banking is hard but it's truly not. Just take your time and learn everything you can and it becomes second nature.
good,I feel Regions is a great company to work for they take great care of their employees however they have very strict sale goals which is the only con of the job.
good,"A typical day includes daily am huddles where we review the successes from previous day and get commitments for current day and pm huddles where we view the successes of the day. We greet every customer at door and escort them to proper channels. We conduct daily calls(10calls by 10 am), make sure we provide the proper advice, guidance and education to every customer; we open loans, checking/savings accounts, home loans, conduct account maintenance, help with online banking, etc. The most enjoyable part is showings customers better ways to save money and time and helping them enjoy life."
good,Great place to learn&grow entry lvl. employees treated& fairly great PTO structure.Constant mgmt change limits the growth oppty for seasoned employees
good,"My days started at 9 A.M. on certain days I would have to create shipments for my vault. I learned professionalism and work ethic. My management was very supportive and helpful in any situation that may have occurred, and always listened to any problems I may have had. The hardest part of the job was trying to make every customer happy when they would come in with issues with their account. The most enjoyable part of my job was the amount of times I was able to serve in the community, and meet some amazing people."
good,"Management viewed staff as family. When changes were implemented, training was offered as long as necessary. Promotions were offered in house before ever being publicly announced."
good,"I enjoyed working here. Just sad that the local branch closed. Regions motto was encouraging. Loyal to customers, as well as associates and community."
good,I worked in the Personal Trust Dept. as a file clerk and than later moved to the Payroll Dept. as Payroll clerk. I was a fast pace job and always had dead lines to meet
good,"Great Place to work and climb up the ladder. I worked in the call center it was a very stressful environment and procedures where constantly changing which made customers upset. Dealing with the customers can be the most challenging and the incentive/bonuses where not as lucrative as they should have been, but the pay is stable and secure. You must be a good Sales associate you don't want to be on the edge of the chair every month guessing if you will reach quota. The atmosphere is fun and there is always a contest."
good,Regions Bank is a great company to work with. It's very challenging in the sales roles and the associates needs to be committed in order to accomplish the sales quotas.
good,I loved working for the company. My job was to insure borrowers were able to keep their home. The job could be stressful because you have to deal with a lot of negative borrowers.
good,The team in my branch was great. Supported me and helped me learn a lot of things. Company culture is very people and life focused. They value people relationships.
good,"Perfect if you're looking for a competitive, sales-oriented workplace. I learned a lot about customer service and people skills. A lot of non-sales tasks are also included, but the workload isn't too heavy."
good,"Preparing my window for the days business. I worked night drop bags every morning. When I was the vault teller it was my job to make sure that all the tellers had the proper funds to work their windows. I learned to become the back up to the head teller as well as active head teller when needed. Also I ran the commercial and vault at the same time. I had wonderful co-workers there. The hardest part of the job was making sure all my daily duties were met as well as the tellers questions were being answered in order for them to be able to serve their customers. Honestly I really don't consider this being hard to do, but a challenge. The most enjoyable part was knowing that at the end of the day all of the customers we had were helped and well taken care of."
good,"Fast pace working environment"
good,Fun place to work for but management show favoritism. You have plenty of chances to move up in life. Great benefits and saving plans.Very flexible with your personal life.
good,"I enjoy the customer relationship environment by providing needs based sales and service. In order to provide the best recommendations a Quick Profile is completed by asking questions to better understand each client's individual needs for short or long term goals."
good,The only reason that I would want to leave this position was that my home town is in Indiana and the job was in Mississippi.
good,Enjoyed working there and especially learning my cliental and helping them with their needs.  Learned a lot of new skills and confidence.
good,The hardest part was that I was a loan processor and the mortgage industry was not stable at the time
good,"I began my career in banking as a bank teller. Soon I was vault & head teller. I progresses from teller to customer service, doing loans, collection asst branch manager, and more responsibilities explained upon request. "
good,I loved working for Regions. Great support from upper management. They only reason I left is because of pregnancy.
good,"I've really enjoyed my time at Regions. There's no doubt I have received the most amazing sales training ever. Regions has made training their staff a top priority. The only place I feel Regions lacks is in the compensation for commissions for their associates. I've seen Regions make the choice to pay less each quarter for the products that are being sold, which translate to less compensation for the employees. "

good,I loved working at Regions Bank and would not have left if I was not moving out of the company footprint.  The team in West Florida can't be beat! I highly recommend it.
good,Regions Bank is a great place to work if work/life balance is important to you.  The company philosophy is centered around core values which are to make people first.
good,Being required to make referrals when the opportunity does not fit the situation is not my favorite part of the job.  Customers come to the bank to get their business done and see my smile.

A typical day at work included completing compliance reports, memos, interviewing and helping potential new hires, helping co-workers with daily questions related to their benefits, policies, etc. Assisted the Human Resource manager with whatever she needed me to do, conduct training as needed, order supplies, participate in career fairs, follow-up with co-workers to make sure they had the Federal compliance courses completed on time. I work well with others and can work alone as well. I learned that its very important the stay organized and prioritize the daily task.

The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people, having the ability to feel like I was able to help others."

good,"A typical day entails, working deposit and withdrawal transactions. Counting and checking accuracy of money and interacting with customers. I have learned how to process various monetary transactions, interact with a plethora of people and personalities.  My co-workers are extremely nice and very helpful with training and answering questions. The hardest part of the job would have to be making sure all money is accounted for and documented. The most enjoyable part is meeting the many new people and working on different transactions."
good,Regions is a family company. They love the employees. they show appreciation of each and all of the employees.

good,"A typical day at Regions Bank is that we make it to work around 8am and we begin preparing the branch for opening. Under dual control we open all the vaults and we all prepare our teller windows for when it's time to open. We open our branch at 9am and our customers are normally already lined up at the doors waiting for us to open.. There are very few days where we are not busy.One of my greatest reasons for enjoying my job is because I feel that I have one of the greatest managers in the world. She is very understanding and so loving. My manager and my co-workers make such a great team because we all know our jobs and we do our jobs. We are one of the top branches in South Louisiana. The most enjoyable part of my job is laughing and joking with my co-workers. I've had jobs in the past and it's hard to find employees with different personalities to get along so well. Also, I enjoy counting money and meeting new people. I love going out of my way for my customers. I always put myself in the other persons shoes and my heart goes out to them. There are times I may go above and beyond the call of duty. Because I have so much love for people and I wholeheartedly enjoy my job, I honestly can't find anything hard about my job.."

good,Regions really does treat its associates very well. The culture is unlike anything that I have been exposed to. Every year there is a week called Evergreen Week where the focus is thanking the employees. Great environment.
good,Regions is a great place to work. I recommend Regions bank. The only issue is I am trying to relocate closer to my house and they don't have any openings
good,"I LOVED working for Regions- I had to quit because I moved. Its a great work environment with a team that looks out for each other. There were a lot of branches in the city so it was easy to move around if you wanted to change branches. My coworkers were like family to me. Regions has lots of events that brings all of the branches together. The work is easy, hours are awesome (weekends and holidays OFF) the pay could have been better and they DO NOT allow overtime. There is always someone there to help."
good,"Regions offers great training and support.  The branch environment is often fast paced, but the best branches know how to keep it fun. I learned a lot about banking laws and regulations.  The hardest and most enjoyable parts of the job are being in a customer facing position."

I downloaded information and ran an excel spreadsheet and sent to management and external companies.  It had enough work to keep me busy.  There were a few downtimes a month.  When I had downtime, I would check with my co-workers to see if they needed help on their desk.  Even though I was part-time I did cross train on another desk for their back up when they were sick and on vacation.  Management was great.  We had a weekly meeting to keep us posted on incoming items and problems that needed to be resolved.  The most enjoyable part of my job was that I was not micro managed.  I knew what was expected of me, my deadlines and was knowledgable enough on my desk I required little help from others and my Manager.  Regions was an excellent place to work and was ran very well."
good,This was a great place to work. The location where I worked had the best customer base I've ever served. My head teller was so knowledgeable and helpful.

The Branch Manager sets the example in the branch by displaying and reinforcing desired behaviors, leading the team to success!   I learned that providing a positive experience and fulfilling the financial needs of our customers are our top priorities.  I worked with an awesome management team.  They believed in me and that meant a lot to me.  I also had great co-workers who also believe in me and my Abilities, Skills and Knowledge.  The hardest part of my job was  not being able to offer a product to a customer (checking accounts, loans, etc.) The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I was able to help a customer with their financial needs and making lasting relationships."

good,"Great company to  work for, but Regions could pay their employees higher salaries."
good,"Regions is a good company with a solid focus who empowers and strengthens its employees.  Managers are somewhat overloaded but this is industry typical.  Training is excellent and ongoing.  The company stays on the leading edge of technology and products and seems to care about its customers and its employees.  There is a recognition system in place that rivals many other jobs.  The sales goals are high for some areas and expectations in this area can be daunting.  It's a lot of hard work and dedication but the end result can be very worth it."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy. You had the opportunity to get to learn many things. If applied your self to the job you learned a lot about accounts payable.

good,"During the duration of my employment with Regions Bank I have realized that the main priority with the company is customer service. Regions does not succeed unless the customers are happy. Therefore, as employees, we must do everything in our power to keep them satisfied. The management team is so dedicated on making sure that we are aware and very knowledgeable about the new and upcoming changes that are going to take place. I am so appreciative of the hardwork and encouraging efforts that they give."
good,"great working environment, and great team work, flexible, family values, excellent management, great advancement policy"
good,"I enjoyed working at the Lafayette location. Customers make or break your day, so if you treat them with kindness, for the most part, they return the favor. You have to pace and teach yourself through the online classes. And its continuous learning... Regions has plenty or resources and links available. There is no excuse to fail!"
good,I enjoyed my time at the bank. When I first started their goals were so unrealistic but thankfully while still employed there i believe they realized it and made it easier on us. I had to quit due to a high risk pregnancy but definitely would go back if I could. They pay their tellers top pay where I am from and the benefits are great as well. The hours are good for a mon-fri job and 1-2 Saturdays a month (half days) it took about 2 months from the first phone call to actually start working there. They did two in person interviews and usually always have 2 people to choose from even after the last interview you have. I was nervous but I got it and worked there for 16 months. I definitely miss it!
good,"Great company that promotes diversity and inclusion for all. Just a few of the benefits include company wide $15 minimum wage, fathers can take a 6 week paternity leave, flexible and remote schedules available, and great incentive plans.

good,"I currently work here, and it's been my favorite job.  My current job responsibilities include assisting customers with new accounts and account maintenance, teleconnecting to find potential business and products, working on cash line part of time if needed.    I've worked in two different branches.  The first was a small town community feel.  The branch was very relaxed and the manager was very lenient. She didn't stress about things as long as we were getting our job done.  I was such a wonderful work environment.  Then I moved to a bigger city.  The team is still nice and easy to get along with. Even though it's the same job, it's more of a corporate feel.  The goals and activities are pushed more here and stressed when not met. At the last location, we were not open on Saturdays anywhere, which was nice.  Here, we are open The day to day activities, however, are pretty easy to follow.  If you just do what is asked of you, the job is simple."
good,This internship gave me an inside look at the Private Wealth Management side of Regions. This opportunity showed me a lot of aspects of the bank that i was not aware of before. The culture while working was absolutely fantastic and that's what blew me away the most. Everyone i worked with was always happy to help each other out even if it was not their job title. I highly recommend working/interning here if you have the opportunity.

good,Started at First Alabama (which later changed name to Regions Bank) in 1985 they trained me through the years to be an efficient and capable banker.  We had the same local bank president all the years that I worked there who really cared personally for all the bank employees and worked hard to make sure we had opportunities both professionally and personally to grow.  Regions afforded many training opportunities for me in lending and compliance as well as personal growth through education and civic affairs.
good,"I had an amazing experience while working with Regions Bank. I had a fantastic team that really work together to cultivate a good environment. My manager while relaxed, he did not micromanage, but he did provide excellent leadership to help his team hit goals and motivate us to excel in our positions to give us the opportunity to move up in the company. He really wanted his team to do great things which reflected in our employee relationships as well as client relationships. "
