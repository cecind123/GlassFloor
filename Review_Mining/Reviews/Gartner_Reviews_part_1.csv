rating,review
bad,"management are very relaxed "
bad,Management is dishonest and slippery. They talk about people and take their ideas to use as their own. Very unprofessional atmosphere and poor quality of management . Don’t waste your time on this loser company.
bad,Extremely high attrition due to poor manage and clueless about Federal market. SOA Federal organization has consistently missed their plan since 2010. Manage by intimidation. Poor pay. A lot of promises about exceeding plan which are not true.
bad,Tremendous workload for below market pay.  The prior positive culture has tanked more and more as layer upon layer of micromanagement smothers creativity. Their diversity is dismal.
bad,"Big mistake with acquisition of CEB. Their employees are very junior and lack the skills and expertise required to represent Gardner."
bad,"Working for Gartner is great when you work with the clients -but back at the ranch it is a different story.  Tons of micro-management by metrics that dont always translate to success for the client.  The analysts are great but the sales organization is very transnational.   Most sales managers are managing up and dont care about their people.  The sales management team is a like a college fraternity.  Good ole boy network at its finest.  The direction of the company is to put everyone down to 1-2 accounts.   If you lose a renewal, or sale, you have no place else to go to make things up.  There is so much pressure to achieve double digit growth at any cost.  "
bad,"not a great job because there was not much for you to do, oversaturated environment, young inexperienced manager who probably is preppy and highly annoying, recommend taking if your last resort"
bad,"They make you feel invaluable and tell you that no one at Gartner gets fired, that is a lie. The training was amazing, but if you don't fit in with the social culture or if one trainer doesn't like you, they will make sure no one else likes you. They will start to call you names like ""combative, rude, and aggressive"" if you have a difference of opinion. This for minorities, especially black women is dangerous! Minorities be aware,  all that blessings diversity and inclusion are not necessarily true. "
bad,Lots of change due to acquiring CEB and poor change management. High turn over of key people in the organization. Poor work life balance and management is inflexible and unsupportive.
bad,"Gartner is like joining a cult.  They are doing a great job luring in young people and weeding out experienced people.  The CEO has very aggressive growth targets and sales people are going to 1-2 accounts per person.  If you cant hit your number, you have no place else to go so they manage you out, often replacing you with a younger person.  "
bad,"No matter what you try to do to achieve your set results, 95% of the time outcomes are completely outside of your control. You have sales metrics, even though you work with delivery. They set you up for failure from the start and if you work at the client services organization you are up for a really frustrating ride. They will make you feel like you won the lottery during training but as soon as the honeymoon phase is over (less than 6mo if you are a smart person) you will understand what you really signed up for. They take pride on promoting from within and don’t really apply anything they advise their clients to do. Chances are that your managers and VPs have less than half of your educational experience and have no idea of what goes on outside of their bubble and their limited experience working at Gartner for their whole life. They manage numbers, not people and do not take any criticism or suggestions lightly. They have a top-bottom approach to change and no advancements opportunities outside of management within the call center. If you want to move horizontally, you will have a hard time. If you work with real IT or in sales, your experience may be different but at client services it will be like this. There is an insane amount of administrative work and useless processes that could be easily eliminated or automated. Employees are all unhappy, turnover is so big that HR is struggling to keep up. By the way, HR is horrible, non-existent - basically a joke. Current employee morale is at the lowest point all across the board. Leadership knows it and is still averse to fixing"
bad,"Van pár dolog, amit le lehetne írni, de nem szeretném."
bad,"I worked at Gartner for 16 months. It was a very stressful and political environment. If you didn't drink the kool aid, then chances are, you'll be out the door. If you weren't in one of the cliques, then you'll feel less important or worthy than those on the inside. It felt like a Sorority House. Most managers were young and inexperienced, and were quick to put you on a performance plan if you didn't ""play along."" Gartner also has a very liberal culture, and are tolerant, as long as they agree with you. STAY AWAY!"
bad,"Gartner was once a great place to work, they used to really care about their employees. Many years ago (before 2016) they used to treat their employees with respect and value."
bad,"This is not a company that people stick around for too long. The average tenure of a new AE is 7-8 months which is honesty horrendous. The company culture of being laid back and low key is a front. The company is incredibly metric driven."
bad,"Gartner is a results based company (which is how the company grows ) but being a favorite has high influence as well. I personally believe Gartner needs to train their management teams more throughly. They don’t want you to ask questions because it’s more of a yes sir/maam mentality. Although you may meet your numbers, you MUST be highly collaborative OUTSIDE of work/working hours. This comapny has many happy hours/team outtings that are outside of working hours. If you do not attend, no matter the reason, you are immediately an “outsider”. Advancement will more than likely not be in your future. Great benefits but do not seek help from HR, highly unhelpful. They pay better than most companies in the area."
bad,"Gartner is the second-worst company I have worked for in 30 years.  The corporate culture is all about Sales, not clients.  Sales managers have taken over key advising areas of the firm and are running operations like a used-car lot...the focus is on metrics that reflect Sales versus performance, and clients and employees are leaving in droves."
bad,"I was given two weeks to learn their system. I didn't receive their computer until the third day. Everyone else got theirs day one. The computers were supposed to come already set up to go with just an addition of a flash drive to install other software onto the system. I had to figure it out on my own. The 'trainer' did a lousy job. Trainer would  walk everyone through what they had to do except for me. A clear sign of favoritism. Was told by someone else, in a position of power, that there were ""... people there that did not want me there."" (Serious WTF moment). Found out who 2 of the 4 were. Unfortunate that people in positions of power play with other people's lives that way. Wasted my weekend learning Pivot Table upon request of a supervisor there just to be let go the following Monday for them to say I was not working out. ."
bad,"Silly sales culture. You are force-fed a sales methodology that trumps everything you'd do naturally in a discussion, so you end up looking kind of nuts in front of your customers routinely."
bad,"Quick to reward men in the organization, only one female senior leader. Opinions not valued. Expect 12 or more hours from employees at very junior levels every day."
bad,"You are fresh out of college and have no idea of what professionalism looks like. The recruiters at this company are the best sales people. The career advancement opportunities are minimal at best and picked purely off of popularity and not performace. It is only an inside sales company, there are not any outside sales positions available in the SMB market."
bad,I joined this company due to the reviews it has of work life balance. But exactly opposite. Even have to work on weekend every months.  Managers have higher then higher expectations. Very depressing environment they have created. No appreciation even after working odd hours and weekends.
bad,"I never saw my manager consistently.  I saw him during training my first week and maybe once again before my temp assignment was over.  Good innovating company to work for, just a shame that management barely cared how his team was performing."
bad,"You don't want to work in IT org at gartner. Managers are bad, no mentoring, appreciation. 8am-5pm strictly enforced and no work from home"
bad,"This was a hard place to work, the location is a growing office with constant changes. That might be physical desks, managers, metrics to meet, or opportunities to advance. It is a hard place to be unique and have your own style, they were open to cultivating it but when it came down to it it was best for you to conform to their ""proven best practices"". A lot of micromanaging and disgruntled workers. High turn over rate and call center vibe."
bad,"Affer leaving the company, my direct manager has since retired, and his boss died, so the landscape may have changed into a more employee supportive and less antagonistic environment."
bad,"Gartner looks great on a resume, as well as the connections you make with c-level executives and Analysts. As a top achiever, a mentor/coach and a shadow lead who introduced candidates to Gartner's culture, I was dissappointed in how abruptly SMB shifted away from my morals and values.  I found my achievements meant little and my job was never secure (all things I was told to tell applicants) ""Limitless opportunity"" was very limited and the culture became very corrupt. My manager was known for how much business she brought in, but never interrogated for how she sold it. She taught my team how to deceive my clients, lie to them and manipulate them to bring in a deal.  Her email editing and forging skills were spectacular - she was valued for this behavior by VP's.  Playing the corporate politics game is crucial here (but this is likely relevant for all SMB sales careers). Because services are sold through manipulation and when they weren't needed, retaining the accounts was nearly impossible.  SMB will need to make some big changes if they want to save the department (hence the downward spiral many of us 2-year vets have experienced).  Summary: Ask a new SMB Gartner rep and they'll say Gartner is awesome. Ask someone who has been there for a couple years... odds are they are trying to get out ASAP.  My advice would be to get many alternative thoughts on Gartner before you apply. Current reps are compensated very nicely for telling you what you want to hear."
bad,"If you are well liked and placed on a verticalized team you will do great. If not, you will have your work cut out for you. They mostly hire people from fraternities and sororities so the culture is as such. Be ready for theme weeks and outside of work gatherings that are not obligatory but you might be seen as  not be a part of the team if you don't go to those events. Management is very spiteful so watch your back. They are not afraid to stab you. Management will clearly identify favorites and potentially promote people for that reason alone and really immaturely."
bad,Gartner is light on benefits. It can be rewarding if you have a good manager but they have too many managers and you will be micro managed unless you get lucky and have a competent and secure leader.  Kind of a cult mentality and a lot of nepotism.
bad,"Very data and metrics driven in any group. Difficult environment to work in. Success is possible, but not easy. The work life balance is challenging making the salary not really worth it"
bad,stay away. bad management. bad culture. limited growth opportunities. work/life balance isn't bad. Most people you work with are intelligent and motivated.
bad,"Gartner definitely needs to hire new HR staff and strengthen management within RES. They need to hire honest people who abide by policies and respect individuals. The dishonesty and scheming that goes on regarding the Specialist role within Gartner and as a Contractor is horrific. The pay gap is extremely irrespective of the contracting duties."
bad,"Not a place for anyone with ambition in their career. Management is entirely lacking in any ability to communicate, manage, or enable employees. Pay is fine, but it’s not worth relocating to a very bad town in Fort Myers."
bad,"Gartner does an incredible job of preparing young professionals for a successful career. However, they promote too quickly with people that have absolutely NO business being in a leadership position. One woman, in particular, has a horrible reputation for leading by fear and being absolutely terrible and has now run off many very talented reps due to her leadership ineptitude."
bad,"What i have learned from my 11 years at Gartner is that they pay lip service to their corporate values.  The claim five corporate values - of integrity, objectivity, no-limits mindset, collaboration and results - but with the sales organization they fail at the first value.  There is no integrity with sales management.  You can not believe what they tell you, so be cautious if you are thinking of joining the sales team.  They very much prefer younger people - and those in approaching the end of their careers are being replaced with younger talent.  "
bad,"Gartner has been through an enormous amount of change in the last year and it has taken a toll on the culture. Company meetings are routinely started with apologies from leadership about how poorly transitions have happened and how difficult things are. In the last year, 50% of our workforce has quit and moved on. This is primarily due to a lack of investment in existing talent, poor base compensation, and blatant lies from leadership about the company's development and strategy initiatives. "
bad,The company has dramatically changed over the years...it's no longer a fun place to work. It has become heavily matrixes and focuses too intensely metrics.
bad,"The management in the SMB channel is terrible.  People are promoted into the role after one successful sell as an AE.  They have no business being a manager and no aspirations to help others.  The culture has turned into a negative fueled, manipulative, lying environment.  The amount of turnover is unreal.  New hires are coming in by the truckloads and territories are shrinking with absolutely no adjustments to quotas or expectations.  Favoritism runs rampant throughout the office. Some employees breeze through with less than average results while others go above and beyond expectations with no advancement in their career.  If you can be hired on as a field account rep, that may be okay, but as for the Ft Myers channel, I would think twice."
bad,"In sales, they hire very young. Management experience is also very limited.  Very aggressive stressful sales culture. they train you to be a drone. Good for young talent first job. Not good for anyone with experience."
bad,"Drink the cool-aide or this will be the worst fit for you. Gartner is the least flat company you could ever imagine. There are literally like 8-10 levels between the field and the CEO. Each manager has to create his or her ""catch phrase"" (Game on) and team name. If you are a follower or a sheep, check out Gartner."
bad,"Gartner is a culture like no other. Management tends to vary depending on which area you work in. Co-workers are nice but standoffish. Working remotely is the norm there so people are not always in the office. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to work from home. The hardest, dealing with some of the management."
bad,This is very much a cookie cutter place to work. I you are over 40 you will not fit in. The managers are very young and inexperienced. The benefits and the building are about all the place has going for it.
bad,The structure of this company was set up so it competed against the parent company. We were selling product that Gartner was selling. We were not working with each other. The concept was good but the execution was not.
bad,"Good benefits but no room for advancement."
bad,"If you're in sales, this is a great company for you! If you're in events, look elsewhere! They like to beat you down to build you back up. It's a toxic work environment."
bad,"Management not easy to work with.  HR dept to dependent on payroll to answer Benefit questions."
bad,Good company. Bad management. Upper management was cocky and didn't want to listen to us 'lowly' employees. Didn't understand the job that they were asking us to do. No support for a sick employee.
bad,if you are working in controller's group you will be working a lot of overtime and will be under appreciate. There is a favoritism and only favorite people will get promoted. Benefits are great but the stress and moral is not worth to sacrificing.
bad,if you're male or a female without children this is a good place to work I think.  Long hours expected and not family friendly.  Lots of micromanagement towards the end (2018).
bad,"Growth at all cost model. Culture changing as the business realizes organic opportunities as slowing - so company is starting to slowly chip away at employee rewards/benefits/etc."
bad,"This company has so much potential.  The business units are good with the Great Managers, but are a horrible place to work if you have a bad Manager.  Expected to take work home, they do not value Life/Work Balance."
bad,"Gartner spends more money marketing their support of diversity, inclusion and veteran support, than they invest in their ability to hire talented people  from any of the groups they supposedly support."
bad,Fast Paced but Frat Culture.  You need to be able to drink the blue cooled if you are going to be able to survive.  It's a great place for a person with no work experience or outside perspective.
bad,"Excellent pay with very limited job security. Its a trade-off ""Pay vs. Everything else"". Management hires/fires on a whim. Workplace culture is strictly based on department worked in and can vary from brutal to friendly. This is not a place for the faint of heart."
good,"Advancement always seems to be based on sales results and you have to be lucky to get good accounts. Progression depends on being a member of ""the Boys Club"""
good,"I was working contractual work for them, and during my time made many friends, worked above and beyond expectations and did nothing but my utmost best.  I was friendly and kind to all and had no enemies, or so I thought.  Apparently they feel it right to lie and make up heinous untruths about someone.  I was accused of bothering other employees by continually asking their salaries.  Who would do such a thing?  That doesn't even sound like a GOOD lie!  I would not recommend this place if you value your honor and your good word.  They will slander you and make you sorry you ever did anything good for them."
good,"The CSO  is a very stressful call center. The management is disorganized and are solely focused on metrics. Regardless of the fact that your customers are finding value from their services, if you don't check the box in Gartner's eyes your clients aren't happy."
good,"I was so thrilled to be hired by Gartner.  The brand recognition of Gartner is a HUGE plus.   I am very thankful to have worked 6 years for this organization & learned a ton.  This is where the positives end.  When I started the person who hired me shortly left and referred to the consulting arm of Gartner as the red headed step child of Gartner.  I didn't want to believe it.  Sadly, this is very true.  Particularly in past two years the consulting organization seems even more ""unloved"" than any of the other arms of Gartner - i.e., Sales, Events, Research."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my associates and working together to solve issues. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the problems recent processes changes have caused since we have experienced significant growth. Additionally, the growth has lead to a lack of transparency where no one truly knows what process changes are being implemented until it is announced last second. This has led to many unsuccessful implementations that have harmed our processes."
good,"Gartner has a good research product and a good sales training program.  However lately many managers have left for larger IT companies, and a void is felt. Lots of pressure to meet quarterly numbers at times at the expense of long term deals and client relationships. Successful salespeople complain of ever increasing risk to their portfolios."
good,"Gartner attracts great talent and can be a great place to work depending on your manager who will have your back or not.  I had 5 managers in the 6 years I worked at Gartner and each person had their own style.  I started as a remote worker which I have had lots of experience and success doing and suddenly management wanted everyone to work in the office adding a 2+ hour commute to my day."
good,"I worked in administration and event planning at Gartner for about a year. This opportunity offered me a very good starting pay rate, but I found that employees were very much undermined and were treated with such an attitude that any small talk had to be done through email (I.E complete silence was encouraged but listening to music through headphones was not). Instead of managers coming to you offering advice or feedback, it was told through rumors that eventually trickled to you. When that happens, you often don't know what you were doing wrong for some time. I would recommend this job to someone who is just starting out, but would not recommend it to anyone who is trying to network or try for a promotion as it is very difficult."
good,"Gartner is a fast paced company known for it's consistent growth and success. "
good,"Nice open plan office in Egham, flat structure with good access to senior leaders and friendly teams overall. Good opportunities to travel and learn from teams internally. "
good,Gartner is geared for those workers coming out of college. Post that without an Ivy League education your advancement opportunities will be small. If you have consulting background from the top five companies you are guaranteed upper level advancement.
good,Great company but the average employee only works there for a single year. Also your work friends are your only friends. You cant go anywhere without seeing co-workers in Fort Myers. They will also tell you over 50% of employees make winners circle and after working there I know its more like 20%.
good,Consulting is a difficult environment with a small number of really good consultants and a very large number of generalist consultants. Leadership has historically been focused on hitting monthly numbers at all costs and often to the detriment of the project teams. It is extremely difficult to take vacation and effectively if you do you have to make it up at some point during the year or you will miss your utilization targets.  Pay is below market for several key specialty areas and HR does not incorporate upticks for specialties in compensation models. Annual review process is opaque and heavily reliant on hitting utilization and other financial targets above all else. Overall the project work can be rewarding given the right project teams and management.
good,"It is most likely the sales department that is like this. Its just if you are not into sales don't do it. Stick with what you are passionate about. The company itself is a strong company, but if I was in a different role my opinion would be different."
good,"The company is great to work for. Some amazing caliber folks, some not. The work life balance if you have the right manager is great. Mobile work force but depending on your manager, can be micromanaged. Policies aren't set across the board and there's a lot of room for manager's discretion. I had a great manager for a number of years and then another one that I struggled with."
good,"I was working at the Stamford branch as a contract interactive developer and have to say the web producers were indecisive, lack in communication, and were arrogant and self-righteous. Although management stated remote work could be done that proved to be a lie 8am-5pm strictly enforced; except for the numerous times I had to work remote on weekends."
good,Gartner is a good place to work fresh out of college. Lost of people have long term careers. Job serves as a great way to build a sales foundation and skills.
good,"The company has a subjective certification which APPEARS to be highly biased.  Two people in my class did not certify, both non-certifications SEEM to have been influenced by one of the trainers more so than by actual performance - especially when compared to existing personnel."
good,Your interview continues beyond the offer letter.  Field academy is another component to the interview process for additional screening.  Make sure you understand you can still be let go after that five week process.
good,"Busy work day"
good,"Gartner suffers a bit from valuing politics and popularity at the same level as delivered value.  Understanding that these two can be linked (the ability to successfully navigate politics can directly influence your ability to get the job done) - the emphasis is clearly on political side."
good,"It’s all about working for the right manager and having the right accounts.  Gartner is laser focused on its business and driving growth and the products/services do help clients make better IT-related decisions.  Unfortunately, the government doesn’t always value the insight Gartner provides because of its reliance on contractors who, in many cases, understand the agency’s nuances far better than the generic Gartner analyst/SME."
good,"Has not moved on with the times, employee engagement is something that needs to be worked on. Greater focus should be put on retention of good employees instead of solely winning over new recruits."
good,While this is an okay place to start all of their industry alignments before and after the Gartner Acquisition has been in disarray and great uncertainty.
good,"If you are a new graduate or young professional looking to get great sales and professional development training, Gartner is a great place to star. However, what Gartner possesses in great training it lacks in professional development and management. This job will stress you out, and you will be expected to perform or they will replace you as their turnover rate is extremely high. Do not be fooled by the pool tables & lax culture...you will never enjoy those amenities without your manager sitting you down discussing how you are not presenting a good corporate image. Also upward growth is very political and usually not until after 2 years. You will not find a more boring town then fort myers. Overall, would not recommend."
good,"I work from home and my current territory is the State Government, which is always changing with new CIO's and changes within the NYS ITS account. I have learned to build my brand and that of Gartner but my territory is too small and feels like selling in a fish bowl."
good,For those right out of college this is a great experience.  If you have work experience and a mind of your own it will not work out.  You have to be a robot and just do what you are told without question.
good,"Traveled to events as finance lead, great way to see the country and meet a large variety of people."
good,"Working at Gartner is an amazing learning experience and the training provided is extremely insightful, complete and helpful for any sales professional."
good,Gartner 7 years back and now is very different. The culture is not great and people with right contacts get all the benefits and has grown to become a mom&pop shop. Performance is overlooked and biased with relationships.
good,"Overall a great company but if you get assigned a bad account,t your career at the firm will have a short shelf life. I was assigned a problematic account and I later found out that there were 6 people in my role in 7 years. Gartner is a great place if only you have good accounts."
good,"Huge growth happening at Gartner due to acquisition of CEB, but that has led to a lot of growing pains that they are trying to figure out, but it's going to take a while to get there."
good,"A new department head has just been brought in and I've never had a more patronizing, narcissistic, disrespectful manager before. If you enjoy being talked down to and treated like you are absolutely useless, then proceed."
good,Gartner is now a nearly 40 year old company and many of the elements that once made Gartner a unique and exciting place to work are missing.  Gartner's business model and value proposition has not changed much and the market for Gartner services is mature.  Gartner's approach to these challenges has been to increase standardization of sales process and to rigorously enforce that process.  Gartner is a great place to develop C-Level relationships and access to senior executives is greater that most any other technology firm.
good,Gartner is a great place for people just breaking into the workforce. You'll learn a ton and the pay is pretty good for recent grads especially if you sell well. They are shifting from a start up feel in SMB to a more corporate call center culture. The message they spread is that the rapid growth in account managers means more opportunity when reality is that they are just increasing numbers to have enough people to manage the accounts left vacant to improve retention numbers. More sales people actually decreases the amount of opportunity available it's simple math. Territories years ago were 3-400 names per account exec now we're looking at 100-150 if you're lucky. As a result turnover is pretty high. Lastly if you're used to a fast paced city Fort Myers is the polar opposite.
good,"Gartner is a fun company that is very youth driven. You will get to work with exciting technology companies and your opportunity for advancement can be realized rather quickly if you are close to the right people. That being said, several people who are not necessarily qualified to be in management get promoted. Having a good manager will make or break your career at Gartner. The only other major drawback is having to move to Fort Myers, Florida."
good,The culture for the company is good and the people are nice but there is poor management in the IT department. There is also little room for advancement in most groups.
good,The company has changed for the worse since the CEB acquisition. Research has turned into a production line activity supervised by incompetent middle managers. Cost savings are on top of the priority list. Waves of layoffs of senior employees since 2018.
good,"Pros"
good,"Great culture, but driven by unreasonable metrics. I expect future challeges, at least in the role I am in. I expect continued great results for the company, at the cost of employee work-life balance."
good,"Pay was good, management and integration is a bit all over the place. Workplace/ culture encourages all the benefits, management of this is very select and not consistent."
good,"main responsibilities were business analysis for a couple of regions. while working at Gartner, I was asked to help with other projects due to my experience."
good,There was a lot of learning in the beginning and then it just felt like they were turning the place into a sweatshop. The management does not really care too much about what you are doing rather than how much money you make.
good,Sales and the value clients get from every interaction are of the utmost importance here.  They invest a lot in their employees as they want them to grow with the company.
good,"It is not as integrated as they portray, no minorities on their OC team, and very clan-like behavior. The best part of Gartner was the challenge of the job."
good,Long interview process.  Intensive new hire training.  High growth company but high turnover.  Process intensive.  Expect a lot of pressure from management
good,"Excellent 2 month training provided at the start of your tenure."
good,"I have to write  up a review in order to continue on Indeed.com. I haven't worked at Gartner in over a decade, so this won't give you any information at all."
good,"I enjoyed working at this company and really wish I could have stayed, but circumstances out of my control amounted in my resignation. I believe the poor management and strenuous relationship between the IT Department and the Business Department produced unfair working environments through improper allocation of funds and resources. At first, I was underused or not working at all - no one gave me anything to do. Then I was given the work of a team of 8. I completed that work primarily on my own, but eventually a second team member was assigned to work with me and we finished the gigantic redesign and redevelopment nearly a year after the business team needed it - then they planned to redo it again. I resigned shortly after."
good,"Excellent training & learning experience. Great first gig out of college with 21 days PTO. "
good,"There is a chance for great camaraderie if you're in the right group. The company is respected in its field and looks great on paper. The team I was in was a well oiled machine until a new manager came in and changed everything, now they are just limping along and all looking to get out (or for the older ones, make it to retirement under the radar). Nice cafeteria. Train shuttle. Nice campus on the water."
good,"Gartner hires people slowly and promotes quickly putting less than best people into management.  However, they have a great environment for people right out of college."
good,"At one point in this company you were thought of as an individual, and treated like a member of a start up, but now you're just another replaceable member of corporate America."
good,"•	Good reputable company to work for"
good,This is the place to work if you want to get great professional expertise.  Very fun people to work with.  Management/Company has high expectations for you and long hours.
good,"Hit or miss on if it will work out for you. Two month academy training is intense and if you don't graduate, you don't get offered the job. Once on sales floor, get used to lots of busy work and really long sales cycles. Most people only close 2-3 new clients per year. Leaves a lot hanging in the balance and can be stressful."
good,"Great manager."
good,Wonderful opportunities to work with the some of the brightest people in IT.
good,"Unfortunately, there is a ""one size (or model that)fits all"" sales mentality that can handicap/frustrate those selling to large, global accounts. Further, although they do have some remarkable folks in senior management they do have an unfortunate history of putting the wrong folks into the wrong jobs."
good,Great culture and work life balance generally speaking. Excellent career progression opportunities. Well-defined metrics for success. Great product and service.
good,"At the end of the day this job really does depend on your manager and your VP for your  region. This company can be a great experience or it can wear you down. "
good,interesting place. Good benefits. flexibile for personal appointments. diverse culture. alwyas something new to learn if you want to learn it. new challanges dialy
good,"the hardest part of the job is keeping your head above water. Lots of copy and paste, very administrative. Morale in the workplace is pretty much at a low point."
good,Focus is primarily on selling and retaining customers with little regard to the product or people they sell it to.   As long as you can check off the metric every month you will be good and advance quickly.
good,"	Provide research assistance to our research and vendor teams."
good,"This place isn't bad, but isn't great. Its best for folks coming straight out of college, but after 2-3 years nearly everyone leaves. Management kind of sucks but isn't so bad to make you hate it. MEH."
good,"lack of advancement for certain roles,  focus on metrics not people"
good,"In general, a great company. However, Gartner wants to quantify success. This is not always possible. I struggled to meet metrics entirely out of my control. The metrics in my control, I was the best in my organization. However, the former made the difference. I lost my job, even though others performed worse than me."
good,"The workflow is not constant. It is very stressful and everybody is very busy towards end of months, quarter or year otherwise it could be nearly empty."
good,"Good and Extensive Product Training."
good,"I worked at the company CEB for about a year, and then for another year after we became Gartner. The position of Account Manager is disappearing, and I do not find the position of Account Executive to be a good fit for me,"
good,"Gartner provides a good work life balance and their compensation is fair, not outstanding. Job security is not very good and management varies from dept to dept."
good,Great company to work for from a work life balance; but there is a lot of gap in terms of performance objectives and assessment which leads to lack of career growth
good,Great company with a spectacular track record in the technology space. The Small/Medium Business unit on their End User side is really experiencing some growing pains. They've promoted some very junior people into roles that may be slightly above their skill levels. It starting to show in some struggles their having.
good,It was fun while it lasted. I did enjoy the bonuses but i got laid off.
good,Very flexible and employee friendly culture. Work culture is unparalleled and managers are hired with great attention to detail in order to ensure employee welfare and culture fit.
good,I only worked for Gartner for a short time after an acquisition.  From what I could tell the company was a pretty good place to work.  They later sold us off so I was only there for a short time.
good,Each division is different but the overall company is great. they really do take care of their employees. The EAS position is not easy but has potential to make good money.
good,"Gartner has good benefits and competitive compensation, but it can be difficult to advance, especially in IT. Some managers are very good and get teams to work together, and others are less good. I had one of each, and recent reorganizations have made things a bit worse in terms of management."
good,Good company but was not for me.  Good management team.  Smart CEO.  Clever company with clever people.  Very structured environment.  Growing and will continue to do so...
good,"If you are looking to begin a career in sales or technology, go for it. Just know the environment can be a bit overwhelming if you are a loner or independently driven. They have a heavy ""everyone in"" collaborative work environment which is good for some not for all. Finally, Fort Myers is a city best suitable for my grandma to retire from teaching. Very slow town so be cautious."
good,Overall Good Place to work and learn from different team how to handle work and manage work in effective time and do it in Quality as well as Best Practice.
good,Great company but it is a hard product to sell. Training is amazing. You have to really get behind the product to be successful. Selling an intangible service like Gartner is very tough but the company carries such a strong and respected name which is very helpful. Culture is amazing. Poor choice in making Fort Myers their sales office.
good,"The day to day is okay - lots of micromanagement and cold calling. Did not realize I was hired to be a dial bot. "
good,"	Currently providing research assistance to our general inquiry team."
good,"Gartner is great if you want to be in sales, there is a fantastic development structure and it is clear how you should progress. "
good,"Inconsistent work life balance across departments, otherwise it’s a good company to work for.  Promotions are limited dependant upon who your line manager is."
good,"Learned a ton about my sales process and have, overall, become a better sales person. Management, however does not expect you to succeed, nor are there effective tools to help succeed. It is very much a ""next man up"" culture and focused more on the organization than the individual advancement of their employees. Almost zero accountability for upper management. The culture among the sales team though is amazing. There is a ""we're all in this together"" type feeling that you get when working together."
good,Good Place for freshers and consider only for outside of India or outside of Government Domain. India business has all accountability with Account Managers while team managers get long ropes.Hire-Fire and Hire new culture prevails. All want performance and and team managers have no role in finding the way.
good,Opportunity to work with leaders of global Fortune 1000 companies and learn from talented teammates on a wide variety of business issues and topics facing the world today.
good,"Culture of a frat house. Lots of favoritism shown towards certain employees. Great learning experience, as you are taught and provided with extremely beneficial feedback. Very forward-looking company."
good,Il management di questa azienda non è così preparato per gestire un team dovuto al fatto che tutti i manager sono promossi dall’interno dell’azienda.
good,"Typical day is fast pace, non stop emails and you're sitting at your desk all day."
good,"Gartner is growing and its hard to argue they don't provide a useful/much needed service to enterprises across the world. However, the RCS position is a dead-end essentially. One quickly realizes after a few months how there is essentially zero career development in the immediate department, management is just happy ""keeping the lights on"", and legacy employees bring the rest of the department down. Avoid RES if possible. Otherwise Gartner is  a great company. Love the service it provides and benefits are generous."
good,"While Gartner is a strategic Information Technology consulting service geared towards helping companies improve their focus and path towards achieving their desired strategic mission, vision, goals and objectives"
good,"Gartner is a good place to work but they are known for underpaying their employees. The workplace culture used to be very flexible, with work at home options, but it is now going through a change and is much more strict."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,Great place to start your sales career but due to enormous growth there is a large amount of leadership that is under-qualified.  Gartner also provides a great benefits package.
good,"50 hour work weeks, but you have the opportunity to make a lot of money if you try hard. The co workers are also young so its fun."
good,Although the Pre event organising was very stressful and time consuming the onsite results and feedback from customers and Sponsors was worth the hard work.
good,"Good experience, young co-workers, great social life. Traveled to conferences which was a great learning experience."
good,"Best place for work-life balance, growth curve depends on your business unit, excellent and helpful HR, Global outlook, good people and collaborative work style."
good,"Gartner is a great place to begin a career.  They invest in their associates by providing them formalized training from day-one.  The company is focused on growth so like a lot of growth companies, sales is at the center of everything that they do.  Would recommend for a sales role."
good,Gartner was a great experience. I received professional training that prepared me for the position I was in as well as received one on one training with a employee in that position as well.
good,"""If you are young and inexperienced in high-tech, this is an excellent place for you to cut your teeth. The knowledge you can acquire is vast. However, if you are highly skilled, creative, and have had a lot of experience in technology, stay away. Gartner has a playbook, a methodology, and a process for everything. Innovation is suppressed. Inexperienced managers are prevalent and rewarded."""
good,"Gartner provides one of the most interesting, challenging, and continually changing jobs in the tech industry (my role was as a research director/analyst).  Unfortunately the job is also stressful, very fast paced, requires long hours (50+/week when not travelling, 80+ hours/week when travelling), high travel (30%-50% or more is not unusual), and is highly competitive between analysts.  The management team (with only a few exceptions) do not manage you, they manage your numbers: there is little or no career development, continuing education or retraining, career guidance, or ""top-down/bottom-up"" management there: It is all top down, management by demand.  "
good,Jeg luket ugress og vannet planter. Jeg klippet også plenen en gang alene. Jeg likte jobben.
good,Fast paced and great culture. Incredible Investment in TA.  You will be challenged to be the best professional you can be. After to be receptive to change and leading through change.
good,"A typical work day at Gartner is fast-paced. Gartner is going through some changes since the acquisition of CEB but overall it is a good place to work. The company's culture is nice, teamwork is highly encouraged."
good,"Work / life balance can't be beat."
good,"Forced exercise. This is a forced exercise. I'm not interested in reviewing the company at the moment. It's not that I'm adverse to sharing my thoughts, just not right now."
good,My company was acquired by Gartner and it is a wonderful company to work for. They are very clear about setting expectations and ensuring it is a positive workplace for all.
good,"I work very hard and love the people I work directly with, but am not adequately rewarded or compensated for my hard work and goal-hitting. Management does not seem to care about the front line staff, despite our commitment to our jobs and the company. I think there are a lot of great career opportunities at Gartner, but I feel I have no support achieving these opportunities and instead do everything on my own and have to push myself through the process. The best part about the company are the people I work with."
good,"A good place to learn the core knowledge to become successful in I/O psychology. Good project work with large, Fortune 500 clients. Good place to learn important skills such as job analysis and data analysis."
good,This was a great place to work. As an SMB Account Executive you will manage a current book of business and prospect into net new logos.
good,"It was a big opportunity to work at the Gartner Symposium ITexpo 2015 event in cape town. I have learned how to efficiently communicate with people. The most enjoyable part of the job was that after finishing all my duties, I was able to sit in, in conference rooms and listen to IT trends in the workplace."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me going into the office at 8am. I would unpack my company laptop at my desk and the start working on projects that I have been assigned for the associates that our team of Computer Financial Consultants manages. That includes getting information on clients, putting in data to salesforce, Excel spreadsheets, emials, and personal projects for the associates, ect. I also manage all the associates expenses . Which I make a report and find receipts which they send and send it to FL where the main headquarters is . I make travel arrangements for the associates daily. Car service arrangements too. Keep a filing system. Also a inventory system for the office. I fax and copy all important documents. I pick up most important phone calls from clients and associates as well."
good,"As with most places, if you have a good manager you will go far.  There are several sub cultures to navigate, all depends upon the department.  Overall leadership is solid and strong.  Sales orientated culture, most successful leaders came from sales.  Good people, so normally it is a good day as everyone makes it fun."
good,"Although very performance-driven, has devolved into  urgent need to maximize billable hours, rather than focusing on quality of service delivery and competiveness of offerings."
good,"Busy place, great community involvement, and amazing professional administrators who are not appreciated as they should be. "
good,Most technology work were in solution evaluation and assessment of existing needs.
good,Great experience - loved the people and the clients.  Work was always interesting and challenging.
good,"Pros: Great People, Great Pay, Great Environment, Great Career Advancement Opportunities"
good,Great place to work. Excellent environment to get your hands on many different technologies.
good,Great sales program. Management can get bureacratic though making hard to move up. Culture was not too bad. If you work hard and are likeable by management you will do well.
good,"Organization is good and more professional organization, work balance, salary is average, good work culture, can learn more if have interest to learn."
good,"One's experience at Gartner truly depends on one's manager. While the performance review process is a 360-degree one, there are some managers there that have no business directing the activities of employees. Other managers are superb. I"
good,"Very high pressure environment as they are publicly traded.  Great training on their methodologies, and decent territory splits for those new to the company.  The tools they use for sales professionals are lacking in several areas, although they state they'd  invest in the tools to enable more results."
good,"When you work at Gartner, you represent the leading IT research company in the world. This is a huge competitive advantage. Gartner can be a great company to work for but a lot depends on getting a good territory with a low comp plan otherwise life can be very stressful. Great perks but excessive travel. Overall I would recommend Gartner."
good,"Gartner has a niche in the market to provide the best research to companies around the globe.  "
good,"Great company to work for...work life balance is good, but the travel piece can be a bear.  If you want the opportunity to visit lots of different places, this is the job for you.  Good opportunities for growth."
good,"Great place for a new grad to learn sales and corp culture.  Lots of great leaders and opportunities to grow.  They have a cafeteria, gym, and other attractive perks for their employees.  Call center sales atmosphere."
good,"I have worked under 5 different people in gartner and two of the five were beyond extraordinary. I admire them as and count them as dear friends. Those two were as much my representative to the rest of the company as they were the company's representative to me. They had my back there and i went above and beyond to have theirs. Unfortunately, the rest fall into a catagory of corporate drones. The company over all is rather impassive. you are not a person are not an employee you are a cog. The benefits are excellent, the HR department was efficient, and over all its a decent company to work for, like many others greatly influenced by who you work for and with."
good,"Great place for sales training and boot-camp, to cut your teeth, to see if sales is really for you. However, I found out I was making 20-25k less in my base than some 4 years less experience class-of cohort and when I asked for a comp true-up, I was given a $3k counter. Insulting but understandable different money pools, new-hire from Corp. HR money pool v.s. my VP's pocket money budget pool. Great place to network, they definitely hire top-tiered people."
good,"Gartner is sometimes called 'the machine' inside the organization because of the regular, consistent, and defined way the roles and parts work together to produce growth and profit. While those in research jobs get the opportunity to be somewhat creative in terms of their research agenda and approach, on the whole, Gartner isn't a place for people who thrive on creativity but instead of maximizing production. For the right kind of person, this can be perfect--if you know your topics, are productive, and like the flexibility of working from home, then Gartner offers the opportunity to publish research and advise clients. There are drawbacks--if you like change, things change quite slowly in the company. And while Gartner's leaders talk a lot about growth and the need for future leaders, the actual opportunities for job growth and leadership are quite few and far between.  Make sure you like the job in which you land, and you can enjoy a long, happy career at Gartner, but if you expect growth, new challenges, and career progression, this might not be the best place for you."
good,"It was a great place to work when I started there, and for many years it remained a great place to work. But management changes (both mid-level Ansonia senior management) changed over the years, and not for the better..."
good,"Gartner is a place that challenges you and educates you every day.  Whether it be in the Research Organization or any other.  This is a company of life long learners and people passionate for serving their customers.  If you are looking for invaluable experience, hard work and a clear mission to follow Gartner is a place you should consider."
good,"Contractors are treated differently, not as well, except for pay. Diversity could be embraced and appreciated a whole lot more here. They tend to hire youth mostly and aren't shy to say someone is too old. Groupthink is a real issue there."
good,"The role lacks variety but there are opportunities to move and develop internally, very sales driven culture and management is very hit or miss. good company to work for IT experience."
good,"Pros"
good,"Gartner overall is a good company, but could learn a bit from its own research on driving productivity and not slowing reps down with internal processes."
good,This is a technology research and advisory firm. Survival depends on reading and communication so you can answer questions and field research requests. It is also important so you can identify new business opportunities.
good,"I worked for a vendor, and the relationship (mine with Gartner) lasted as I worked at 3 different companies over a 10+ year period. The fact that I continued to work with them says many good things about both me and Gartner."
good,A little focus on company culture and employee engagement would go a long way. This company is sales and bottom line focused. Does provide good benefits and PTO.
good,"As one of Forbes Magazine's top 5% growth companies globally, Gartner attracts only the best individuals. With a focus on cutting edge productivity and cost management, it requires staff who are emboldened by theirs and the company's growth."
good,Fun work place everyone mostly worked as a team. Stressful at the end of the month. Closing of the month and getting reports done and NCE reps making their monthly mark can be stressful. Helping the NCE Reps with there e-mails and letters to clients.
good,"Unique selling methodology and process, which although feels slow, does not penalise pay."
good,Partnerships that exist with engaging & forward thinking clients can be personally rewarding & financially lucrative. One downside is that many clients currently facing financial scrutiny view the services as nice to have versus need to have. There is an excellent corporate culture that nurtures / rewards successful engagement.
good,"For Fort Myers Office only: "
good,"The company is headquartered in Stamford, CT, with many domestic and international office locations."
good,"Great place to work, great bunch of people! Love working in a global team as you get to learn so much more about the company and how other regions deal with similar issues."
good,Gartner is a wonderful company to work for.  There is a good work/life balance and the people are wonderful!  My manager was wonderful.  The team was great and super collaborative.  The deadlines are tight but the work gets done.
good,"surrounded by smart and fun people."
good,"Most biz is handled over phone/email."
good,Very flexible culture via remote environments and balanced hours. Nice office ambiance and really great healthcare/HR benefits. People there are really caring as well.
good,Gartner is a fun place to start your career. Loads to learn and a fast learning curve. You get to work with like minded yet diverse people coming from different backgrounds to problem solve on real problems and create an impact. Every individual is working on something high value to the company or high value to the clients.
good,Working at Gartner had a lot of benefits and will be a great resume builder for me as I continue to pursue other opportunities. The training is on a level of its own and they really invest in their employees. The work-life balance and flexibility to work from home is way above par.
good,"Fair in all accounts. Great leadership, great incentives, the only knock is that if you're promoted from within you won't be paid as much as people hired from the outside."
good,"Gartner is a great company if you like working in a typical corporation. Follow rules, listen to your manager (even if he/she is incompetent), and follow rules. However, I have to say that it was fun working there since it gave the opportunity to grow, meet people."
good,"Great place to learn where people are really open to help you be successful."
good,Gartner is a growth company with a performance based culture. Company continues to grow and has almost doubled in the past couple years. This growth will present both opportunities and challenges.
good,Working at Gartner was a great starting place for me and my career. It allowed me to gain management experience before moving on to my next challenge in life.
good,"Gartner will work you hard, but the benefits were great and I was able to work remotely. Too many managers, not enough workers though, they try not to be silo'd but they end up with work silos. Mixed messages from management can be confusing at times. Tend to think promotion through ranks as a measure of employee worth as opposed to focusing on quality of work and valuing employee work-knowledge. Merit and compensation are confused. They can say they want one thing but reward another."
good,I learnt how to build on my collaboration techniques with colleagues from around the world. I learnt about the growth i can achieve based on my qualifications and what I aspire to achieve.
good,"Gartner offers a very flexible workplace. Its a people oriented company, they value their employees. You get to learn a lot from your work as well as your peers. Peers here are very approachable."
good,"Everyone works very hard.  They are very tight on space, however, and there is a feeling of disjointedness in the culture as a result.  Some managers never come out of their offices."
good,"Great company to start your sales career, they have an amazing training program. This is not your traditional sales job, you will be required to stay up to date to the changes in IT and the industries you cover. You will notice the organization will provide you will a lot of training and resources to be successful in your role. If you're not able to get the flow within the 1st 90 days you will be re-trained and given up to a year to perform or at least have the right mindset. "
good,Need to meet weekly activity goals and requirements. The best part of the job is working with clients to help them with key business priorities and leverage their services.
good,A service provider of senior management consulting services.
good,Great working atmosphere. Ability to work from home when needed.
good,"I started work an hour early, and set myself up for the day."
good,"Very good"
good,It is a wonderful place to work along side a large group of SMEs.
good,Cooperative peers and management. Open to new ideas and good opportunity.
good,"Gartner is a great place to start a sales career. You'll receive world class training. The only drawback is that it is growing so quickly, many first time managers are leading teams. Your career trajectory can depend on a lot of luck."
good,"Even though benefits are good, life\work balance is promoted and people are awesome to work with, I noticed a high employment rotation, lots of contractors and interns in and out. Perhaps that is what makes the wheels to spin well at Gartner."
good,"I spent 4-years at Gartner and my biggest concern was the constant change of manager. I had a half a dozen bosses and this was disconcerting, because, even though I was a great employee, my work history was forgotten. I knew all aspects of my job and I was good at it. However, I had to prove it for each passing manger. This takes time  which better spent becoming familiar with taking on other assignments. And Since management only knew me for a short period of time, I was unable receive references for attempting another position within the same company."
good,"Smart, well educated coworkers. I have learned a lot from leadership. Paid time off is generous, and you’re encouraged to take it. While there is definitely work/life flexibility, the volume of work is high. I don’t enjoy navigating through the internal politics, and I don’t believe the pay is competitive."
good,"Benefits great. The culture is young, so it works for some people. Hard to be serious and motivated at times and management is closed minded at times."
good,"Gartner was a great company to work for because they gave me extensive training once I joined the company and after training, allowed me the opportunity to run my book of business as I saw fit. They demand sales people go up and beyond the call of duty, which I was all for. The job can get stressful but the work environment made up for the pressure."
good,"Gartner continues to grow and evolve.  My time there was extremely productive and rewarding."
good,The work-life balance is maintained in a decent manner. The management works really hard to balance the indian and american standard of work. the work flexibility is another positive aspect to work in that company
good,"Good culture, good benefits, good training, going through transitional period, so lots of change. Collaborative environment. Good reputation and products"
good,"Gartner is a fantastic place to work. It’s corporate, so it faces a lot of the challenges corporations experience. I enjoy my role and my colleagues. Would recommend."
good,"Gartner is worth relocating for- all the effort you'll put into moving, training, mastering your role, etc will bring you so much personal growth. If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. "
good,"Received meets"
good,Great benefits and 20+ days of PTO. Had to leave because my team got relocated otherwise I would have stayed. Pay could have been better given the cost of living in DC is high.
good,Job paid well and provided a lot of room for growth and professional development. I honed in on skills that I didn't realize I even had. Learned a ton.
good,"Days are faced pace"
good,"Overall, great company. Great work culture and people and good work life balance. There does not seem to be much advancement unless you are in a hub office."
good,"Wonderful culture that fosters team building, creativity and learning.  Accessible C-Suite executives who care about the company and about their employees."
good,"We recently got acquired by Gartner so do not know much yet.There is nothing much to review. My previous company CEB was very good organization, so we are still awaiting."
good,"The job was very fast paced, stressful, and cut throat.  Everyone there was driven to succeed and further their careers even further.  Everyone around you made you work harder because no one wanted to be the one that fell behind.  The hardest part was that it was an unpaid internship, that only paid in work experience.  Overall learned a lot from the work environment."
good,"Internships at Gartner helped develop and enhance both my skills in research and analysis in the corporate sphere. I spent time supporting the marketing department where I engaged creatively to develop campaigns to engage clients. I also was able to perform an analysis on the effectiveness of email blasts on clients. "
good,"The work life balance is fantastic and they do a great job of reinforcing this.  You'll enjoy who you work with and not feel as though your in an office dialing all day.  Great learning experience for younger sales professionals, however if you have 3+ years under your belt go somewhere else.  You'll get more money and have more impact."
good,"Great benefits, PTO , compensation. Nice place to work. CP role is great for a self starter . Gives you room to grow and learn."
good,"In my tenure at Gartner I have held a variety of positions. It is a good company to grow and make career moves within. They have good benefits and paid time off package. Most of my managers were effective, professional and willing to help me move forward in my career. Generally my co-workers have been friendly, professional and competent."
good,Gartner is a growth minded company with strong data to back that up. They are continuously investing in employees as well as improving their services to clients.
good,The company is well renowned and I am happy to say I work here. The pair is fair and the team I work with are great. There is much opportunity to travel too
good,"When you work as an analyst at Gartner, you'll be focused on specific technologies.  That can be great, but if you're attempting to cover a new area or service a smaller technology area it can be challenging to meet your metrics for readership.  Strong culture of performance and collaboration, good teamwork, and many opportunities for travel and growth."
good,"Assist software companies schedule appointments with Gartner research analysts to provide an introduction and or update on new products. In this role I have learned from management the importance to build an individual brand which will reflect upon the department and company overall.  In addition, build relationships and earn the trust of our client while providing excellent customer care to our clients. Adopting the mindset of ""There is always room for improvement"" it is difficult at times to continually identify opportunities to strive for excellence. Working as a quiet leader and assisting my colleagues and manager has always been an enjoyable part of my day."
good,Gartner is an amazing company. It offers great insight to its clients through research and advisory services. My only complaint as from an internal sales planning perspective. The territories are very small with limited opportunity for growth
good,"A company with strong values such as spirit of generosity, etc.  Decent compensation package and benefit."
good,This is a challenging place to work but you are rewarded for results. The more time and effort in the better the results will be. The company rewards for high achievers.
good,"As a remote Account Executive, there are inherent challenges that come with the role, but they are easily overcame with proper guidance and leadership.  The benefits are very good, with a stellar HRA matching plan, low cost insurance, and 4% 401k matching.  Worst part of the job is that there are too many redundant internal meetings which are very hum drum.  Most enjoyable part of the job is that Gartner's name is strong enough to open many doors for CIO's and other high level contacts."
good,"Gartner is a great place wherever you are in your career. I was originally part of CEB when we were acquired by Gartner earlier in 2017, but the two organizations are very similar - everyone's nice, smart, and driven. Plus, there are plenty of routes to go once you work here, whether it's up in a current department or laterally into another part of the business."
good,"Gartner is a wonderful company to join if you want to build your career and have the resources at your disposal to be able to do so in a structured manner. A typical day was very fast paced, very structured in terms of process, however very flexible when it comes to being able to manage your own day and clients in suitable manner. The management teams were dedicated to help you with self improvement and were always helping to set personal targets and steps to achieve them. There is a huge amount of collaboration between teams so it's a great place to get to know a wide range of people and build your network. The hardest part of the job but equally the most rewarding was working to very high metrics to achieve and reach on a quarterly basis. This is however regularly reviewed and the team help each other out if anyone was struggling in a particular area."
good,Opportunity to collaborate with a lot of very smart people.  Clients understand the value of the intellectual capital they are receiving.  Good opportunity for advancement and competitive benifits
good,"Gartner is a great org, with very sharp employees.  A leader in Research and consulting, it is ultimately a sales-driven organization."
good,"Very good company-- fast paced and growing every year.  Working through the growing pains from a small nimble org to one that is large, so very exciting time to be part of this change/transformation."
good,I'm not interested in sharing via text.  its a great company overall. life long friends are created. work life balance is good. depending on department you work for it could be awesome or stressful. Management needs improvement.
good,"Pros:"
good,"Great company that will open a lot of doors for you. This is NOT and entry level job, this is a career. I would only have great things to say about Gartner if they had a little better management put in place. All and all, great place to work."
good,"Great place to work, managers and senior management is approachable at all hours."
good,I give profound thanks for the opportunity to have worked with the world leader in technology research and in a global capacity.  This place is just like their research - top notch.
good,"Both the best and hardest place ever worked.  Loved the brand, product, people, etc. and ultimately miss the environment very much.  Very well regarded career move."
good,"Gartner is a great place to get a start and learn a strong foundation to sales.  They invest in their employees and really emphasize career advancement, which is not very common in other larger orgs."
good,"Tough and long sales cycles but if you do well, you do very well. Overall I would recommend this job to anyone in IT sales. Just know that Fort Myers, FL is kind of boring!"
good,"The culture is relaxed and friendly, lots of flexibility, some people come in really early and leave early, some come in late and leave later.

good,Typical day includes a lot of prospecting & client calls.
good,My attorney was high maintenance but it was a varied and highly interesting job that required attention to detail; never any slack time; contact with clients was a must and you got to know them very well and confidence was high on both sides
good,"Gartner invests in developing associates through the distillation of essential elements of success...the ""science""...around which one gets to wrap their own individual ""art."""
good,"Fun culture  that can at times be a distraction for some. "
good,"Great benefits and flexibility working from home; not too much travel compared to other consultant work"
