bad,"The Managers At The Wal-Mart I Worked At Were Always Pulling Every Sales Associate In Different Directions, Little To No Time Was Spent In The Department In Which I Was Hired In."
bad,"I expected Walmart to be open to my school schedule and they where not. They always over-rid it. They managers also had favorites with i do not believe to be far, so if they did not like you even if you did your work, you still got in trouble. My fellow associates where great though and i love them and my customers."
bad,Initially enjoyed my time working there but near the end i got
bad,"Typical day was assisting Customers as needed and stocking shelves "
bad,"In all my time there I never heard laughter in the breakroom. I never heard anyone say ""I love my job!"" or even ""I like working here!"" and after spending almost two years there, I get it. You're not a person. You are a tool to be used until you're too dull to use anymore. There is no culture. And literally everyone there has an unfavorable opinion of the place. It's a crazy and soul-sucking environment to find yourself in."
bad,"Once was a great company to work for  the past few years it has gone down hill  "
bad,Working in the environment definitely teaches diversity and build self character. Being engaged with customers on a day to day base dealing with others emotions and conversations can open you to many new things in your own life.
bad,"The job as a order filler was very rough on the body, the continuous wear and tear you put your body in is not good looking back on it. They was no benefits of working hard."
bad,Well it is okay at the beginning. But later you get treated pretty badly even though you do your job. And you get complained to about because your not fast enough. That being said not enough workers helping you .
bad,Walmart is good in high school because they are flexible but everyone there in a management position is power hungry and over entitled and treat you like garbage.
bad,I've been working for Walmart for 6 years. when i first started everything was good the company gave you enough hours to get you by and would work with your schedule if you were going to school. but not with the new management and policies and cut backs on hours i feel like my whole time trying to build a career has gone to waist.. managers say they will work with you but completly forget about what they promised in an hour tops. i have complained about my hours being cut in half and never got and answer to my problem. over all its a good job for teenagers who don't have bills to pay or for students to make a little extra cash for school.
bad,Meeting new people and learning the workings of retail. I enjoy helping associates and understand the needs of associates. I learned a lot from my HRM and enjoyed the meetings with my fellow HR management.
bad,My managers did not care. I got sick because someone had spilled paint thinner during the day and no one caught it. As I cleaned up their mess (not my job) I was pale and dizzy and they did not want to help me nor send me home to see a doctor. On top of it all they would make me do jobs that others were paid higher than me to do FOR THEM.
bad,The job is fine but work security is low with the amount of absences you can acrue low. Pressure to provide good customer service with no recognition of hard work
bad,"As an APASM, the duties constantly changed depending which senior manager was in charge for the day.  Unable to complete corporate directives due to the needs of the store.  AP was treated as spare help for all situations without regard for their primary duties and responsibilities.  Co and Store manager would ignore your shrink findings and put the blame on you when things turned bad,  So sad that they don't really care if they have theft and inventory loses."
bad,"Compared to last work environments, the managers have poor communication amongst themselves and the associates they manage. Overall environment produces a low work morale and high production expectations. Great benefits and pay, be ready to work for it though."
bad,"There is a lot of things that are more negative than positive when it comes to working at Walmart. "
bad,"They pick favorites, They dont notice youre good job just the mess ups.They expect people to survive with only 30 hours a week with a 11 dollar pay, It was good at first but management changed, Been there 4 years and was told I do not have the experience for management for the dept I worked."
bad,Great co workers but upper management dont communicate with other upper management. Set you up to fail. Corporate changes in sick time and how many days you can miss it takes two long to be able to accumulate more sick time.
bad,"This company only cares about $$$ not the people who are bringing in the money for them."
bad,"This is NOT the job you want if you have small children or some kind of illness or disability. Their absence policy is absolutely absurd when it comes to someone needed serious time off. You are allowed 3 absences in a 6 month period or else you will be terminated. You also do not get paid well for what you have to deal with, when somewhere else like Target hires at $13/hour."
bad,Very rarely do they care about employee wellbeing besides assistant managers and higher up. When there is a management position open most times they choose someone to push whatever agenda they want to push that week. They  have refuse interviews with people qualified for the position just because they dont like them. Almost all the assistant managers that work at my store do absolutely nothing and push their work onto lower associate and management. The only thing that's made me stay this long are my coworkers. I have a small family here but I cant keep working here and being stepped on.
bad,Walmart doesn't put your academic career before their work.They personally kept scheduling me for Friday shifts when I had college classes repeatedly.
bad,Walmart is not a job I recommend for anyone trying to find a long term solution the mangers are disrespectful and do not care about the workers only their bottom dollar
bad,"Personally, for me, this isn't an ideal place to work at for a long time. It gives you money, yes, but it isn't a place I would recommend working at. I am only working part-time here to build my bank account in the meantime. We always stay busy though. Throughout the day. There is always something to do. No matter what my job is, I am a hard worker. Typical day at work is stocking shelves through the day and keeping the customers satisfied. The culture within the workplace is pretty average and fair. They do not disrespect you in any shape, way, or form. Management could honestly be better and more fair. They don't always treat their employers all that fair. Could be better."
bad,"Associates are not treated equally "
bad,"For the place I worked for the manager there didnt quite understand what a human could handle as temperature wise, as I had to do a lot of the cold areas without proper equipment to handle the cold. Have gone in many times sick and was told to go in there regardless, claiming that it would do me good. Most of the complaints were more about management and not the co-workers as they were great to work with."
bad,"The management at Sayre walmart is not welcoming at all. You get shoved in to your job with a little information. It is very hard to maintain your life with the hours they give. "
bad,"Very motivated worker , fast leaner and worker ,dependable, gets the job done always ,accountable ,great listener ,great with customer service ,I worked the service desk everyday and did a very good job taking care of the customers ."
bad,There's no organization nor management skills from the top to the inmidiate supervisors. Schedule sucks.
bad,"The company is a great place to work and I've learned new skills to use, as well as, learning how to handle both good and bad situations. Also,the work environment is very great (like family)."
bad,When I worked at Walmart I had a third shift employee constantly make s**ual remarks and harassed me. To no avail nothing was ever done about it because they probably didn’t care. So I left since they would also schedule me over my availability times and not see the problem ever.
bad,A typical day at work was communicating with customers. I learned more communication skills. Management wasnt great neither was the workplace culture. The job was not hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was scanning and checking people out.
bad,Used to be a family. Not that way anymore.  Trying to do too much without  enough support.  Management  doesn't  care about  you as a person.  Don't  work  here.
bad,It was good at the beginning...then it got terrible quickly. I don’t know how anybody could truly enjoy working for Walmart. Management was so bad for me.
bad,You are going to put up with a lot of stress from customer. You will be asked questions all day every day and you better like dealing with people if you're going to love your job
bad,Keep yourself busy and read the rule on the online not what people say. Do your work and keep yourself safe. Can move head in the work place but expect more work then others
bad,I ended up having a mental breakdown due to all the stress that store caused me.   Management did the best they could at helping me out with that issue.
bad,"That's it, pays better than other minimum jobs. Management only cares about filing up their wallets. Will use you and not acknowledge associates going above and beyond for the customer, will only act when customer complains about associate meaning you will get punished even if the situation wasn't your fault. Also no overtime no matter what all year long including Christmas holidays. Only go for Walmart if you are planning on getting a management position or just having this as a first job. Once you get job experience. Get out of there asap."
bad,"As walmart is a big company and lots of different kind of people work there, so you need to cope with multiculturalism. the management is not bad. Again not very good. Depends on how you manage your relationship with them. If you are a straight forward person and don't like to oil every time to management then this is not a right place for you to work."
bad,"It took me 3 years to get health insurance, and I make less than two dollars more than when I started. Management heavily enforces many restrictions that they will not follow themselves. Members of management will not listen to workers complaints in a legitimate sense, but will also believe every word a customer says."
bad,"The work is always fast paced. I learned how to manage time. Management is often not fair. Hardest part is during the holidays and black Friday. The most enjoyable part are some of the people I worked with, they are all down to earth and overall very genuine people."
bad,"hiring minors who can't work the line (while refusing to fix the lines inability to sort) and cutting the hours of main crew, putting them on the line repeatedly causing them to get burnout, and when they leave, their reaction is the shocked Pikachu, promising one truck days while stuffing the one truck with the amount of 2"
bad,Las entrevistas y el procedimiento de ingreso esta bien el ambiente laboral es muy estresante y el trato de los directivos es despectivo.y humillante.
bad,Some managers look for employees to succeed while others only care about the numbers. Hourly pay is decent but no bonuses and time off was extremely limited.
bad,You get points for calling in sick. They'll schedule you every weekend. You don't feel trained for the job since you watch videos on how to do your job. You always getting pushed by management to go faster. No one fixes issues. Always behind. Only get a 2% raise.
bad,Typically a very busy retail setting. Often short-staffed. Staffing hours constantly get reduced while prescription volume increases. Pharmacy now open on all holidays except Thanksgiving and Christmas.
bad,"wal-mart is a big compony,but if your not like you wont make it when I worked at Walmart I had to learn what to do no one to show me management,is very bad they yeld and don,t help people at Walmart is what makes the store run hadest thing for me was management if your looking for somethink but time it,s ok but not full time the past part of my job is seeing my co-workes"
bad,"The job has its ups and downs. And is highly unorganized. Management can be clueless at times. The overall productivity of employees are slim and sometimes you are asked to go above and beyond for the company without recognition or compensation.  Overall if you need a job they will hire, but the environment is not that great."
bad,The job is fairly decent even though the pay could be much better since we are heavily understaffed on stockers for night crew and expected to have everything done.
bad,"Walmart sucks  they work you like a slave for less money, they call you in on your off days then tell you can’t be off the next day if you worked for somebody else management is horrible"
bad,"I like the working/fast pace here. But pay is low for a full time position here. The management or the associate aren't trained well. The benefits are a joke, don't get paid extra for holidays. and it's heavily understaffed."
bad,"My store was always understaffed, disorganized and always a mess, and only a couple managers actually care including the store manager. The people were great but the store was overall a mess."
bad,it was bad  poor management no opportunistic expect you to do way more than what you are paid for politics and favoritism play a big role in who gets the rules bent for them and who gets punished
bad,"Since it is a salaried position they take advantage of you and sometimes schedule you 8 days in a row, each day being a 10-hour shift. Culture is bad, everyone is miserable to be there and not very inviting to new people."
bad,They treat there employees badly then never have a set schedule or times to request off there always on you for nothing and they try to make getting hours hard
bad,"The biggest problem is communication, one manager would tell you to perform a task and then a different manager would yell at you for doing that task.  It was sadly reminiscent of High School, cliques of managers that never did anything until someone higher up forced them to.  The other associates that were in my position didnt do their jobs and were not disciplined, while the working ones got chewed out for not constantly working, because the store stayed open because of people like myself."
bad,"Management is trash, they are not welcoming and have no concerns of employees' needs or wants. The overall company isn't bad to work for, just the managers."
bad,"I worked in the produce department, and it was a fairly simple department. Lots of food handling and physical labor, not that much interaction with the public. Management wasn't all that great at my location."
bad,"The company has A LOT of great benefits, pay is good."
bad,"Personal de RH sin profesion, crecen a cualquier persona sin la experiencia ni eduacacion para poder atrar y retener al personal que merece una empresa de este nivel. Estos factores tan simples de no tener y llevar la cultuta como tal la describe Walmart es lo que hace tener tanta rotación y pesimo ambiente laboral. (La.empresa muy buena, quien la.maneja no)"
bad,"Things at the Walmart Contact Center are not as peachy as they first make it seem. You have to work an entire year in the building before you can get promoted to the actual home office. Once you learn your initially assigned queues, they will train you in an additional 3/4. Oh, and no raise. If you prove to be a hard worker, they will stack more work on you and treat you like a robot. Meanwhile, those employees who are ""personal"" with their supervisor will be able to aux into alternative codes which means they won't have to take as many calls. There was a girl on my team who worked on her resume while we were taking a bunch of calls but, of course, the AOM was on her side. If you have a college degree, do not think about starting here because it has no value to anyone. All they care about is how many calls you can take per day. The only people who rise above in this environment are those who are willing to suck up and be complacent."
bad,"A person in position is there to long, and gets comfortable and complacent. They ignore rudeness and disrespect, and encourage negativity and arguing amongst the employees."
bad,"Discrimination at its finest at Walmart. Tried to use the open door policy and management never cared about my problems I brought attention to. Nothing like how the original owner of Walmart had management treating his employees, that’s for sure."
bad,"When I first started at the facility, I recommended working there to all my friends and family. Almost 5 years later, however, I would not make the same recommendation. Benefits have continually decreased and some even taken away over the past few years. For a multi-billion dollar company, insurance is poor and there are a lot of hoops to jump through if you have to take extended time off due to injury or family issues. You do not have any holidays off, other than Christmas Day, and sometimes can be required to work extra shifts with only 24 hours notice based on business needs. Scheduling time off can be difficult as there are strict policies in place depending on the time of year. Wages are great, with timely raises for the first 3 years. After that, you max out, and a 3 year associate will be making as much as an 20 year associate. Communication is very poor in some departments between management and associates.  Not to mention there is no real consistency between the way managers handle situations, or relay crucial information. I really enjoyed working here at first, but it only took about a month to see that the direction the company was heading in, is definitely not the direction that Sam Walton wanted for his company."
bad,Walmart as a company Is great to work for. The managing teams is what's horrible.  In all my 10 years of working I have never been call nasty or other degrading things. I worked my butt of as a department manager and got blame and treated like trash for every little mistake someone else did. I got wrote up for telling my district manager the truth.  I was told next time I'll know what to say .when he come in. ThThe manager team
bad,I would really only reccomend working at walmart if it is your first job as you will get some job skills out of it but that is about it. The job can be stressful at times and the management is not professional to say the least. There is definitely favouritism with the management and I personally feel like I am one of there least favourites. They also have given me phoney write ups and have made me feel like I am a really bad and lazy employee when infact the opposite is true
bad,I consider myself a very hard worker and I never get the respect I deserve for what I put in. I wouldn't recommend working here because of everyone putting so little effort in their work. I am scheduled two times a week most work weeks and I am ALWAYS getting called in to fill for someone which may not seem bad at first until you arrive and everything's a mess. Which of course isn't your fault but the way they talk to you when you desperately try to get everything done when you started behind is very belittling and frustrating.
bad,"stay at a steady pace do not socialize,  and make sure you do what you are told. lunches are an hour and breaks are 15 and we get 2 breaks, we are also not able to leave the campus of the store on our 15-minute breaks"
bad,"The only company I’ve ever worked for in 52 years where instead of covering an employee’s workload if they’re absent, they shove it off on the other guy there or just let it float and figure someone will jump in and cover it."
bad,The overall experience was just horrible the management was very ignorant to everything unless they got it how they wanted it which took forever then they would get mad for us doing it the way they wanted if it took to long
bad,"Worked for them for 10+ years. It's a job. Retail Will suck the life out of you, not to mention you deal with very low class people on a daily basis who usually have bad attitudes. If available, I'd find somewhere else to work."
bad,"it is a constant pressure that you get headaches, it is also too hard to do your job freely, there are people on your way that have the same pressure that they don't let you succeed."
bad,My experience at Wal Mart was not the best. I feel I came into my position expecting more regarding my job title. I was eventually turned into a cashier. I was not fulfilling any major details related to my job description.
bad,I loved the associates that I worked with but after time the work became to stressful considering they were asking for insane numbers with barely ANY work.  The mangers refuse to listen to associates and even the higher ups.
bad,I took a lot of verbal abuse from the customers and other older employees.  Whether it was playful or not it's very disrespectful.  An older white employees said to me don't be stealing nothing.  Just got tired of it.
bad,"Been with company 5yrs, was able to move up to manager in a year so room for advancement. But once in in that spot there are constant threats of firing,coaching etc. Makes for an unpleasant work environment. Was threatened with a coaching on my day off"
bad,"This Wal-Mart... This Shawnee Wal-Mart is not ran very well at all!!! As being a former employee of this Shawnee Wal-Mart in KS, I was actually a transfer from a Kansas City store on church road. This Shawnee Wal-Mart is the worst when it comes to customer service. The employees are always complaining about something, mostly about management, and therefore nobody except me was ever in a good mood. Front end management is HORRIBLE!! They never know how to run things, nor give out breaks and lunches. They had VERY strict labor laws for minors, but management NEVER listened... Associates were constantly getting locked out of their systems due to them being on the clock for way too long! We had customers always yelling about something that was Wal-Mart's fault. Manager's would take forever to handle any kind of situation whether it was coming to approve a transaction it would take them 5 minutes to get there. Imagine on a Monday night when it's not too busy and you need to approve a transaction and you and the customer are just standing there looking at all the other customers leaving the store, waiting for this one little thing to be approved! One manager that was fired because of how she decided to run things, asked me about my availability when I was first transferred, and would schedule me outside of it! She had me 1:00pm-10:00pm and 2:00pm-11:00pm evenings AND weekends... who wants to work that as a student just out of high school?? I was a good employee and I know I was a good employee because I was constantly getting asked for help by EVERYBODY especially the CSMs because"
bad,Not a very pleasant place to work at. This job is good for a teenager to work at for their first time job. Job advancement only by who you actual know
bad,We are constantly doing other jobs that we do not have to train to do. They lack the ability to understand that we are overworked and can't finish the assignment do to other things we are pulled for. In one weekend 4 people quit do to this problem and many more.
bad,The company does not treat the seniors fair and tried it’s way to get ride of them   Any reason they can thank of. The pay is ok but the work environment is not as good as it should be
bad,"The work i did at walmart was tough, hard, and very stressful but the people i worked with made it worth it to come in everyday. Managers would give us seemly impossible tasks and make"
bad,Management does not support team members at all. When given a new position or task you're to figure it put on your  own. They run you in the ground doing your job and theirs.
bad,They had a system for how many hours a day your tasks should take you. I averaged 15 hours of work in an 8 hour day and got paid less than minimal for it. I worked hard because my management team was nice and worked with me. Its easy to feel overwhelmed and underappreciated at a place like this.
bad,"In the beginning everything seemed great, but shortly changed as I was told to help customers. I would help customers but then got told not help unless they asked for help. Almost like pay attention to the work only and ignore customers unless they asked for helpAlso other employees that had been there longer were rude, and stuck only with each other. Management doesn’t communicate with each other very well either."
bad,Understaffed under paided over worked underappreciated. They always have negative feed back even when u and ur team is killing it. It's never enough for the upper Management.
bad,"The job itself was not bad, I quite enjoyed the work that I did, but I have never dealt with managers like these before. They aren't all bad, but the majority of them are. They do not provide the support that is needed when they are asked for it. Instead they will sit in the office and tell you to call them instead of coming to address the problem properly."
bad,used to love working at the place now it is nothing but misery. you are not recognized for your hard work unless you are favorited or unless there is something mentally/physically wrong with you. I know it is rude to say but only a select few are rewarded and they don't even do anything for the company. I have worked overtime a lot just to help get the job done because others do not know how. no one takes the job seriously. and if you are a good worker they take advantage of you and make you do everything. management doesn't do a thing for anyone and the front end is absolutely run very poorly. only good thing about this job is that they work really good with your schedule and the pay isn't bad whether you work full or part time.
bad,Management does really help you get your job done. If things don't work their way you get in trouble and blame it on you for not accomplishing whatever is given to you to do.
bad,"I have worked at a Wal-Mart neighborhood market for almost two years. I joined as a cashier and after a month moved to stock meat. Within 3 months my work ethic was noticed and I was told to apply for a management position. I didn't get the position, although I wasn't expecting to. Since then I haven't been offered any such positions to move up in rank or pay. Openings have happened and instead of posting for the upcoming position vacancy, another person already in that position is transferred from a different location and fills the job. I need out."
bad,"Working for  wal mart has been a roller coaster for me, I myself and other including employees and customer feel like we aren’t treated fair ! They make it where most holidays you have to work and on top of that you don’t get Holiday pay! When sick it count against you unless ur on a heavy medical leave! They show favoritism to certain employees! you will get lied to in your face and they turn around and do what they say cant be done!"
bad,Some managers at walmart are very rude and not understandable. I took off work a lot in september because my mom found out she was real sick and i got fired for being with her in the hospital
bad,"Half are manager and half associates ,awefully all managers are interfering in your job!!"
bad,The staff is lousy and they leave unfinished work the managers were rude and so were the supervisors we didn’t have a friendly staff and the staff members were stealing so you can’t trust that
bad,Depending on the department you are in is dependent on what you make. You get one hour lunches and fifteen minute breaks. They operate on a point system and offer stock options.
bad,"Walmart is an okay place to work for. Work for a Department Manager consist of managing inventory, customer service, restocking the returns, a lot of stocking, price changes, organizing the sections 1 at a time, and few other duties that is given on daily basis."
bad,I get told I'm moving to a better position but other bosses played favorites and moved over people before me and kept me where I was even though at the time my body couldn't handle it
bad,Always push u to max.no respect for ppl.u are a number and thats it.one day you do well the other day even if u do we dont get acknowledged.we had pump trucks only to pull heavy skids of salt.no mechanical
bad,Management was ill experienced and rude. Negative work environment and no communication between workers and management. Most managers did not have a full understanding of their department and made poor decisions.
bad,"I worked at the same Walmart for just about 2 years and the enjoyment I felt going into work slowly went away more and more with each shift. The schedules are subject to change daily, the management is poorly trained, and the employees are overworked. Overworked employees with no raise in compensation gives rise to a horrible work environment in which everyone dreads walking in. There are very few members of management that are concerned with the betterment of the employees even when it is due. Advancement or promotions are also said to be easy to obtain while are often taken away from the best applicant because they are ""invaluable"" in the position they are in already."
bad,"Very stressful environment with not the friendliest managers. Pay is decent (for first jobs) but other then good pay and great benefits, it wasn’t worth all the stress and disrespect."
bad,I beleive there is no comunication between management teams. Walmart has been a good company to work for. Ive moved up fast. They were willing to work with you on your schedule. The employees are great people to work with. Its been a couple ruff years. They are switching things up and changing alot about the company. Walmart use to be about their associates and theyve changed that
bad,Management retaliate against there associates bad communication they talk about there associates and be mad when we let them know they wrong. When cooperate comes to the store they wanna act all nice so nobody will open door them management need to learn how to talk to us. Support managers can’t pass a test so management takes the test for them
bad,"If you're trying to get a job that respects you, pays you well, and takes care of their employees, I would start looking for a different job than this one."
bad,"a typical day would be rushing"
bad,"They pay you well and have good benefits. That's about the only upside. Other than that it is a pain to work for as salaried management. No other retailer will pay you what Walmart pays you so that makes it hard to leave. However, they have a hard time retaining quality management given the nature of the company and the position."
bad,"Management team need more training on how to treat their fellow employees. They are  always too busy to answer questions or to help if needed. Stores go through too many store mangers, no holiday pay either."
bad,Worked with some super people. Couldn’t qualify for insurance. Had to cut my hours to get Medicaid so I could get treatment for cancer. Only got unpaid medical leave...But at least they did hold my job for me. The HR person at the store at that time was super wonderful.
bad,"The actual work itself was easy enough as a CAP 2 associate, but the lack of respect for the individual hurts my opinion severely. If I were less of an ""oddity,"" I could see myself liking this job! Management, surprisingly, was also very poor. The only regret I have leaving is that it's 11+/hr for an entry level position."
bad,"Management doesn't collaborate with each other.  I was given a position I told management I couldn't handle,  was not trained at all.  Just told to ""figure it out"". I spoke to the store manager and said that I felt like I was set up to fail, and he literally laughed at me."
bad,I just want something new because i feel like i have no tyoe of freedom here and everybody acts so up tight. Im tired of feeling miserable here i just want something better.
bad,"Depending on the store you end up, you could have a great experience or quite the opposite. Each store seems to have its own culture and management strategy"
bad,Walmart does not pay their employees enough money. They do not give overtime. I have been there almost three years and I absolutely hate it. They don't like to give you the time off that you request. The point system is absolutely horrible.
bad,"only work at Walmart if its your last option. The pay is good but the managers suck. You make good friends, but you get horrible entitled customers who treat you like garbage. When you get hired for ""full time"" make sure you are getting the benefits of full time. I had to fight for my benefits event though I worked full time every week."
bad,The hours were never the same and you would get worked 40 hour weeks and then get 28 hour weeks back to back. You'd also have unobtainable quality standards in the time given. You also rarely had a scanning device to stock with
bad,Working for walmart is challenging. There were some good days and some bad ones. Management is horrible and if you plan to go to school they will not work with you. There is no work/life balance working for them.
bad,I loved working in produce I loved every experience and knowledge that was able   learn  from them but I will never work for that company  again. But I do thank them for giving me a chance
bad,Only good thing is you will not be fired unless you steal. They treat you more as a number than a person. Worst management team i have ever experienced.
bad,Management could take issues more seriously and their shouldn’t be as much friendly relationships amongst upper management and associates and could be more customer focused
bad,"very busy fast pace, more responsibilities then compensated for. perpetually understaffed. retail and grocery work. Work with public. There is a lack of communication here making it hard to stay on the same page."
bad,Management needs alot of training. They don't communicate with other managers in other shifts and complain instead of being a team. I don't recommend anyone to work for Walmart unless management is better with the associates andmanagers.
bad,"The job itself is easy, but management isn't great and the policies aren't either. They have a 5 point system for absences and they don't accept doctors notes unless you're pregnant."
bad,Its jus too many people want to be the boss when it's already a head person in charged. I feel they need to up pay an jus maybe people will come to work. Because i feel 11.00 is not enough for the work that's done. We already dnt get our bonuses.
bad,"From a day to day basis my job consisted of unloading the incoming freight for the day, stocking an aisle or two, assisting customers in searches for items, and maintaining general cleanliness around the store."
bad,I liked working at Walmart in the beginning it I started as a stalker then they moved me to cart Pusher with the bad thing about it is at night when bad weather was around are you still have to go get the card soon and all I gave you was like a little thin plastic Poncho but it was hard work very hard work
bad,Expected to work in fast paced environment with low staff and to help other departments when own department is busy. Management does not have store under its control.
bad,You can put your all into this job but won’t be recognized or considered at all. Will be accused of a lot of things that weren’t even true. Good place to make some $ but management makes the experience terrible.
bad,"Sucks with giving you time off especially when needed, you only have 4 call outs until your terminated, management sucks, as a cashier you do most jobs management should mostly be doing."
bad,My last store manager was the worst.... and thus I would never recommend this job to anyone.. he was intimidating and retaliatory in his ways.... The others members of the team were great but overall he’s the most influential person on your career...
bad,"Worked 12-18 hour shifts regularly with out a lunch. Upper management was not supportive, or good at teaching and leading  hourly employees were okay for the most part but not held accountable"
bad,I hated working at Walmart. They work you to death and you have to stand in one spot for 8 hours or longer (usually they ask you to stay late). I was always pressured into taking shifts on my days off. Only thing I liked were some of the managers.
bad,Decent place to work for just starting out. Management could have been better trained and more friendly. Encountered lots of discrimination but overall the benefits and bonuses were very good.
bad,"Worked at Walmart in Augusta, GA for over 5 years. Work force decreased year by year, but for the Department Managers, the work load INCREASED year by year. Sam Walton is turning over in his grave. Management is a joke, having relationships over and over with subordinates and people are reluctant to verbalize. One Store Manager gave thousands of dollars of fixtures to associates and terminated someone who had knowledge of this. SAD!!"
bad,"They change the schedule 48 hrs prior to your day off. Don't tell you about it."
bad,"The overall work at walmart was good, but the managers need to focus more on the employees health and stability. There was many times that me or an associate would be close to heat exhaustion and we wouldnt get any help or relieve"
bad,In the beginning I enjoyed my job because I worked as a cashier and in apparel. I loved helping the customers.  Then I changed jobs in the store and started working as a Cap 1. Which is a stocker. Pulling stock from the back room and putting it on the shelves.  The first supervisor I had was great! He helped me out in learning what to do.   The training in the vud
bad,"would not recommend, what i learned management work place culture the hardest part of  the job the most enjoyable part of the job what you learned work."
bad,"Management is set to cause stressful work environment no matter the load of work, whether or not it feels like a relaxed day once a week or not. Be prepared."
bad,Most of the Customer Service Managers does not show much concern for customers. They also fail at assisting Cashiers with customer relations. The store where I worked switched Store managers 3 times in the short period that I was there.
bad,The people I worked with was pleasant. But at times was pretty stressful too many tasks at a time and tasks that you are not trained enough to do so that makes it stressful I didn't enjoyed that at all.
bad,"Management listens but hardly work with you. Upper management just lies to employees. Pay can be better. Workers are good, food is good there, management just needs to change."
bad,"Aunque en este trabajo obtuve mucha experiencias, para mi no es buen lugar para trabajar a menos que ya tengas la obligacion de hacerlo. Es muy estresante ya que el equipo de trabajo es muy poco profecional. Es muy triste lo que hay detras de una compañia tan grande y famosa."
bad,"Overall,not a bad experience.This company is what YOU make of it.Attitude is key.Learn to get along and communicate with various types of people.Always stress communication between employees and management."
bad,"Poor management, always on their phones then yelling at associates when they are on theirs. They expect way too much from you. They take you out of one section to help then expect you to finish your original area. The main store manager is too strict, never there but when he is it's just all stress. Family emergencies results in a point"
bad,its a good place to work at if your with the right team and management. but in my case the front end male CSM had slept or is interested in a good amount of the cashiers and seem to give all the girls special treatment ( i was the only guy for the most of my time their) the assistant store manager was related to him so their was no consequences and was best friends with a former CSM that changed positions ( which was great because she would never do her job and spend her time hiding in the cash office or back room)  but overall the people that did their work and the ones that embrace what working at Walmart should be is what im going to miss the most!
bad,"Management is terrible, work hours are stressful and I am used. I stepped down from management because the manager over me didn’t like that I had a disability. Now she’s gone and Theiss me when they are short on customer service managers."
bad,"I've only been working at Walmart for a little under a month but I am putting in my resignation tomorrow because of the management and scheduling issues. At Walmart, you can get up to 5 points for clocking in early, late or not showing up at all. I'm already at 3 because my manager, who I've never met, keeps changing my schedule the day before or even the day of. When I first started I was handed a handheld and sent off to work without even teaching me how to log into the dang thing. The work is ok once you figure it out but it's not worth the struggle of being way understaffed and not having a manager there for over a month. It's also a physically and mentally demanding job."
bad,"Management was always on your case about every single detail even though nothing was really out of place. Constantly contradicted themselves when giving a task, really poor communication. Always a shoplifter on the daily, really tough to be more ""aggressive"" with the customers when you really can't do much other than ask politely for a receipt. Management would push me to do better at handling customers when they themselves wouldn't listen to them, really hard to help someone when you're getting backlash from moving from your spot. Maybe it was just my location but it certainly was not a good experience, left once the shoplifters got more aggressive pulling out weapons at us for doing our jobs, $11 an hour not worth putting my life on the line."
bad,"Walmart is an ok place to work. My co workers were mostly nice, but the management is very demanding and the pay stinks. It has helped me pay some bills, but I do not really feel my skills are apprciated  or compensated there."
bad,"your not always treated fairly, i personally worked 3 departments for the past 2 years and out of no where getting thrown into places im not use to nor strong in. so in that case i would get treated poorly to the breaking point that i cant handle that enviroment anymore."
bad,"It was okay. Learned about composition and printing. Worked woith canvas printing and building. Learned a lot about the different mediums within photography from photo, to product, to customer."
bad,"Having more responsibility at Walmart is not a good thing. They don't provide the man power, time, or resources to get your task done, and then wanna write you up when you fail!"
bad,"good temporary job but not for the future, no job advancement , its more about whos likes you more at walmart, also pay is terrible and manegement is just terrible they get any bum off to street to manege."
bad,"Young management, Drama everywhere, poor pay compared to factory jobs, , high expectations, people/employees are miserable, they are in a vicious cycle of over promoting the young, mgmt. are arrogant."
bad,Work/life balance is the biggest struggle. There are lots of nights and weekends and hours are not enough to live on.  Scheduling is bare minimum and you always need more help especially cashiers. Some managers sit in office and will never help. Others are great.  Good starting job for students. Hard to move up.
bad,over the few years i worked here so much has changed and they say its for the better and all its doing is making more people not want to work there. and management has went down hill from wheni satrted.
bad,Higher managment sucks could of been alot better the management staff pretty much got paid to sit in there butts not helpful at all would only recommend this place unless you need a part time job
bad,"Some of the people were ok. My boss was awesome, but we rarely had the same schedule and she never stayed for long. There was a lot of drama. They didnt give overtime. And they only gave you 5 days out of 6 months to miss work. I was a customer host and it was so tedious. We had to stand in the same spot for 8 hours."
bad,"Walmart has switched to a new model in which they fire anyone who starts to make to much money.  So every 2 years the company comes through and eliminates the bottom 10 percent.   They say its random, but it's always who ever management doesnt get along with"
bad,"I will rate Walmart below average overall review. You have to be tough to work at Walmart physically, emotional, and mentally. They have a strict policy, changes all the time."
bad,"Terrible work environment, would not recommend staying to work for Walmart for more than a couple months. It is steady hours, but there is barely an inflation raise and they will fire for any possible reason."
bad,Always worried about getting fired because they seem to want to get rid of any long term associates. Trying to move up is nearly impossible unless your buddy buddy with management. Hard to get days off approved and they wont work with your schedule unless your the favorite of the department.
bad,You will always get your hours but the pay isnt good you get a check every week. You get to meet new people everyday. The work environment is great. You can grow in the company.
bad,"Sueldo de 4000 al mes, no hay utilidades y si las hay son menos de 1000 pesos. Crecimiento hay pero con casi el mismo sueldo."
bad,They want more and more out of you no matter if your trying your best doing everything you can do picking up the slack. But don't want to rein verse for us taking on extra responsibilitys it's a stressful environment overall.
bad,"Most enjoyable about job is being completely in charge. Hardest part not having the tools, or personnel to do your job. Repetitive courses taking up valuable work time from you."
bad,Great place to work. i worked at the Walmart D.C. for 18yrs. but it was time to move on. I ONLY worked three days a week. but it was some long 12hrs. but i loved that job
bad,"Walmart needs work on their management and how they treat their underlings. they also need improvement in their own focus and over all productivity in how they manage their schedule, organization, and communication"
bad,"Break-out stock for preparation,cook/bake/glaze/decorate. Pkg and price  donuts. Change over steam table items to fresh containers ,cover and replenish from days usage to maintain a quality product.Restock product for next days sales. Cleanup and polish all tables to Eco-Lab specs . Hose the floor down and squeegy it dry for slip-factor and safety maintainance. Count waste for P/L statement.Take and turn in a daily order suggestion to Bakery Mgmt"
bad,"Management doesn't have your back as an employee and asks too much of employees with little pay in return.Overtime is asked to be ""killed"" even after being asked to work over. Corrective actions aren't done at all or done incorrectly, but are still somehow documented."
bad,Stay to yourself. Too much drama. Managers try to talk to you like a kid. Customers are rude disrespectful. And all the cashiers up front are stuck up and will try and get you fired.
bad,"I will do the break down suggested by indeed;"
bad,"In management Walmart pays very well, but there is a down fall in management  as well. They don't ever train their employees properly, no one likes to take responsibility for their actions, no one likes to be a team player they only like to make their self good. Upper management talks down on everyone and always see the bad in people nothing is ever good or they are never happy with anything that you do, even when you are working very hard. The turn over rate is very bad as well."
bad,"Management needs to learn how to back off of their top performers and just let them do their jobs. You can do the work of three people and they will still demand more. Corporate policy also doesn't take into consideration exigent circumstances. If you struggle with your mental health, avoid this place like the plague. If you don't, pray you don't get the flu or something."
bad,"No support from your boss, you make one mistake and you are immediately judged by that mistake. Horrible support system for base employees. If you want a paycheck that is all walmart is good for"
bad,The store I worked for could do alot better with picking its management team and the overall morale. The also need to explain the policies in depth not just day what they are and how they work on the surface
bad,Management  team is horrible.  They are not a team and couldn't manage there way out of paper bag.  Always giving conflicting direction.  They will send you to work in another area and than get down on you because you didn't do your work. Home office is so out of touch with what it takes to run the store cutting associates and then wonder why  surveys are bad....STAY AWAY
bad,"I worked as an overnight inventory manager, and had 2 jobs in the company prior to that. Whenever I got a new position, they would then add my new positions responsibilities on top of what I was as already doing. By the time I quit that terrible slaver of a company, I was doing overnight stocking which involved unloading the truck, then throwing about 5 aisles of new stock on the shelves,  then I'd continue onto my SECOND job there, which was dairy, and a fulltime job by itself! THEN id go onto my IMS job"
bad,Very difficult culture.  Aggressive company tactics.  Will work all holidays and have to meet unattainable goals.  No work/life balance.  Management work 70+ hours every week.
bad,"When i worked here they had promised a raise from $9 to $11 within 2 months. On top of that they had us request off days we needed online, so doing that I needed a week off for my sister's wedding and did everything they needed for me to request off. Well fast forward to when they reschedule us they had me work on the week of the wedding, I asked if they had checked, the manager said that she doesn't check the computers and you have to write it down on paper and hand it to her. Well I pretty much saw this as a ""I didn't check or I did and didn't care so I'm going to lie to you."" So withing that time I turned in a two week notice and was out shortly before my trip to the wedding."
bad,"The pay is good and can get 40hrs if you really want it. But even if you work 40hrs, they still list you as part time and dont give you benefits. They make you work the most stressful positions alone and the CSMs will NOT go out of their way to help you. And most days it is too busy and crowded to be able to get anythung done."
bad,You don’t get paid enough for all the work you do. Some departments have to work in other areas that they don’t usually work in. It’s hard to get other associates to answer the phones. It’s hard to get a hold of anyone on the walkie cause no one likes to answer. When you ask for help for a customer or other things people will say there’s no one in that area instead of saying that they could help the customer. Some managers will say that’s not my job even if it is. We only get a 10 percent discount but not for food. You overwork yourself and don’t get enough pay. The raises are almost non existent.
bad,"Working here has made me so unhappy , I cannot wait to find something better , it is just not worth it anymore . Please dont apply here , make this your very last option ."
bad,It is by far the worst job I have ever had. They always want you to do more than just your job but yet when ever you do more they would yell at you and write you up.
bad,"if you don't mind how people will treat you then you got no problem"
bad,"It may not be at all stores but my personal experience with Walmart was not the greatest. I started out as a CAP2 associate and was thrown into the CAP2 Supervisor position without any kind of training. The management team at the store I worked at failed miserably at communicating with staff and fellow teammates. No one was treated equally and there were always people getting written up for incidents while the managements pets got away with it.  We went to training courses throughout the year and learned process and procedures that the overall corporation was to follow, but when we tried to instill them at our store we were shut down by the store manager and assistants on multiple occasions. The benefits and bonuses for the company are great but you have to be prepared for a lot of things that are not done with common sense."
bad,Not a good place to work.Thats all i really have to say. Management is out for themselves and cannot be trusted. Its not a family environment as much as they try to convince you it is.
bad,The Sams club I worked for was always busy. The management was never friendly and the workers were constantly being overturned and under paid. I would not suggest working there.
bad,Started day with meeting then began taking freight to sales floor to begin stocking.  Would continue until any product that could be stocked was placed on the appropriate shelf.
bad,Liked the co workers and loved the customers- lots of satisfaction giving exceptional service however corporate all about the dollar and treat employees with little consideration. This changed recently- was different when I started with the company 12 years ago
bad,After 10 awesome years at a company I admired the changes being noted in other areas crept into my department. As headcount cuts became a regular occurrence and benefits were cut the stress of wondering if we were next destroyed the productivity and morale of the department. In spite of all the wonderful experiences I had at Walmart I have come to believe that company is gone and the dog eat dog atmosphere of a company run for shareholders is not for me.
bad,"You are given unmanageable work loads that would require more than one person to complete. The standards are very high and whether or not a manager is helpful or not is a dice roll. Customers are rude and there is very little you can do besides try to get a manager and fail or grit your teeth and wait it out. I was made a part time worker but given a full 40 hour schedule, which meant full-time hours with part-time benefits"
bad,"This job is exactly what it sounds like, a job. Management doesn't really seem to listen to your problems or work with your schedule and sort of treat you as lessers. Not all of them, there are some good managers but unfortunately corporate Walmart is changing so much that it no longer feels like a place where you're valued.I would recommend working at Walmart as a college student is the pays pretty good, but don't expect much"
bad,I like the coworkers but I don’t like how management does whatever they want but then say we can’t do the same thing because we aren’t management. It’s not fun just standing there all day watching people.
bad,"only worked there for a couple months as they didnt do much person to person training,just expected you to jump right in with no help or experience.the management was not helpful either and would not adjust hours due to my disability.was alot to learn in a small amount of time."
bad,Management will tell you they'll work around your schedule if you go to school but they won't they'll just work you min. hours. They will not hire you on as full time to avoid giving associates benefits. They used to have me schedule people only 8 hours a week.
bad,"Es una buena empresa, su cultura es hermosa, solo cuidado con el monopolio de RH el área que se dedica a la gente, imagínense !!!!!"
bad,"The managers at walmart seem to still think this is the 1800’s and we must submit to all authority. They don’t like to be told they are wrong and the shut you down when you have comments/concerns. They put their hands on their hips and mosey past you as you are hustling to meet their productivity requirements and will say its not good enough, and then just leave, as if if theyhave no power to help get things done. No matter what you do here it will never be enough you have to kiss butt to move up it has nothing to do with work ethic."
bad,Walmart was a great company when I started many years ago. Too many changes that aren't beneficial for the employees. You are expected to do three and four peoples jobs- they are very under staffed.
bad,"Many of the managers and supervisors were incompetent and were frequently replaced by equally incompetent ones. Those who were competent quickly left to go to other stores. The constant shift in management made the work environment very unstable and left little to be desired when it came to pursuing a higher position, thus I do not seek to ever work at Wal-Mart again. I'm sure that not all stores are as bad as the one that I worked at, but it is not an experience that I would like to have replicated."
bad,Do not bother.  They do not care about the employees.  They want you to work in scorching heat and not give you your breaks when needed.  They only care about the money they make not about the employees or the customers.
bad,"Very fast paced. Must meet high production rates in assigned area or get fired. More of a competitive environment than a teamwork environment in the distribution center that I worked. "
bad,Weekends are busy and requires a lot of patience with customers and management. Co-workers make it a better place to work. The hardest part of job is not knowing if you will have a job after changes occur; changes occur every couple of years. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and being part of a team.
bad,"When I started Walmart, I loved it. Over the years it became somewhat stressful and the bad started to outweigh the good. It was definitely favoritism. I was there for almost 6 years and still wasn’t given full time even when I asked management about it. I would recommend it but make sure you have a plan for your future. Don’t end up stuck because after a year, you definitely end up stuck there."
bad,"It really depends where you work in the store that depends on how bad or good you get treated my management. Cap 2 does some of the most work for the store including unloading trucks, stocking large amounts of freight in small amounts of times management gives us. When you start working there some places in the store no one trains you, you just get thrown into the position and situations."
bad,Very little interest in team play everyone is looking to advance themselves. From assistant managers looking for there own store to co workers trying to avoid work. I’m really surprised the store I worked at is still in business.  The associates know very little about customer service and race starting at the top is an issue.  I’m sure that at other stores the culture is better but this store was a life experience I’ll never forget. Right on gene.
bad,It was an OK job to work at while I was finishing school. But managers could be really harsh on you. But I did like the job and met some interesting people and formed friendships.
bad,"I love my job, and working with people. But, the company is clearly more interested in the bottom line, than they are in keeping their employees happy.  I am faced with having to work in an environment where employment is uncertain, and operating procedures change frequently."
bad,Walmart has changed since I started working there. They seem to be hiring only part timers and are getting rid of positions. Managers only seem to care about money.
bad,"Walmart is dedicated to working with as little as possible. this translates into heavy workloads for employees. on top of that they do not provide great support to the workers and do not care about their long-term physical and mental health. the lack of an ergonomic workspace and their disregard for doctors notes despite knowing that their stores are high stress, low tolerance spaces is desreputable. they would do better to look after their workers better and to provide them with a space that is understanding of the stressful environment that we work in."
bad,"The work atmosphere isn't pleasant, everyone tries to one up each other and as a cashier you can stand in the same place for your whole shift just cashing people out. This causes incredible foot and back pain. Also, the customer service managers do nothing besides override things when necessary, otherwise they are standing near each other gossiping or talking about non-work related business."
bad,"The work was easy & well paced, but the management made working there a nightmare. You never get recognition & only move up if you're sleeping with someone higher up."
bad,I feel like Walmart doesn't pay enough to its employees. I use to work at Walmart but since I have two kids now; I wont consider it because $10.00 isnt enough. Plus you can't work their full time only part time.
bad,"I worked there from september to december and the managment played favoritisms, and they were horrible. The hours and they pay was good, but they bosses were horrible"
bad,"People lose their jobs all the time because of them getting rid of positions. They say that you can have a home life and they want you to have balance, if you have a limited availability you don't get hours. They tell you that if you open up to open to close then you would get hours but it's your fault that you don't."
bad,"People work here when it's their last option, and it shows. Walmart likes to promote within the company, so those employees that were at the bottom of the barrel and applied here because they ran out of options will get promoted into managers. This place is so poorly run from top to bottom because no one ever wanted to be here in the first place. A typical day at work is working around the call offs while already being understaffed. Working harder to make up for it while you watch management mosey around the store. I could go on, hut I'd rather not spend too much time here. Pay is decent enough for retail, and benefits for full time employees are good (if you're fortunate enough to get full time)"
bad,Don't waste more than 6 months working for this company. They over work you for little pay and only give you short brakes. You will be nothing but a number at a walmart DC
bad,"Management is very stuck up and not very approachable. I used to enjoy working here when there were certain members of management who took the time to listen to you and were passionate about what you had to say. Some employees are just rude, because they are tired of their job too but won’t do anything about it. All anyone cares about is OGP and that is bull. Nothing like feeling worthless at your job. That’s supposed to be a great company to work for."
bad,"No matter how good you are, even if you're the best pharmacist there, you will work every day with the possibility that at the end of your shift, you will be laid off and escorted out to your car."
bad,unlaod truck in a timely manner. stock the shelves until time to go home. you got about an hour break. you might have to unload frozen dairy trucks or dry grocery truck
bad,Decent pay. The managers are pretty awful. I’m having to look for other jobs because even after asking my assistant manager for hours and showing initiative and showing up to work everyday for the 2 months I have been working there he kinda blew me off and acted like I didn’t matter. The cashiers I work with don’t seem happy either as I don’t really get along with any of them. Even after trying to be friendly.
bad,Support managers told me that I was not 100% satisfactory on my work performance and that was a total insult to me I tried my best to satisfy the managers at Walmart facility and the managers like to push their Associates they told me my performance was not good enough for an 8 hour shift and I work really hard during my shift very stressful I was working in the toy .department Department Department..
bad,"Face paced job , no time for enjoyment or homelife, constant change of schedule and hours , no respect towards employees, treated to make your self-esteem didnt matter."
bad,The job it self is not hard but the company doesn't care about its people or its customers its all about money if you need a job and cant work anywhere else or your retried its okay but you cant live happily off of it.
bad,"When I first started it was a good place to work. They seemed to really care about their employees. Now it seems to be more about profit. Very stressful place to work.  Have to be careful, because they will take advantage a good employee."
bad,They have bad management stressful and full of drama.. there was ups and downs some good people some bad people work was easy had some heavy lifting. I loved helping people
bad,"If you work too hard, you'll get fired. If you don't work enough, you'll get fired. Be sure to stay in the mid-range of working hard and acting like you care or you'll be out the door.  There is no loyalty here regardless of how many years you sacrifice.  They aim at firing all long-term associates to make room for cheaper and more naive young workers to save a buck."
bad,"Deli supervisor gossiped about everyone to everyone.  She started alot of the trouble.  If they would have transferred me, I would have stayed there. I requested  to be moved many times and got the run around each time.  Everyone said working in the deli was the worst job in the store and they were right.  I hired in to work in bakery, but when I told them I wanted b as key, after starting there, they said it was all the same drpt and never moved me to bakery."
bad,"The pay is good but the hours are HORRENDUS I went in there and told them I could only work certain days and certain hours and after my current manager left they started schduling me till 11pm one day and come in at 6am the next day. Both on days I didn't tell them I could work. "
bad,"Walmart Sucks The company constantly comes up with ways to screw over both long time associates as well as newcomers, because of a greedy CEO. Not enough staff. Abuse of middle management by upper management, and then it all trickles down to hourly associates"
bad,If you have someone sick including yourself in  the  family they don’t care they just need you to come in and slave for them and they DO NOT approve time off request. One girl couldn’t even go to her grandmas funeral without when she can’t back she was on probation and if you get hurt they make sure you do not get paid
bad,"A lot of management issues, not willing to work with you over emergencies. Not a hard job at all just they expect more of you then what your paid for and aren't great at training."
bad,"Though not all management was terrible, the majority was. They mistreat their already underpaid and overworked employees. But, what do you expect? It's Wal-Mart. Would not recommend unless you are desperate for a job."
bad,"it was an ok place to work at, but the managers and people above them seem to not care about the employees such as cashiers, stockers. cap. they have a ""everyone can be replaced type of attitude"
bad,They don't care if you have children and you need to pick them up from school or if you ride the bus and they'll just schedule you whatever. If you have no kids or anything that's fine.
bad,"Being a team player, assisting customers and maintaining safety regulations on vehicles, flexible work schedule, opportunity for growth, job security."
bad,"You dont have a set schedule, if you sick doctor excuses doesn't work managers talk to you any kind way customers will lie on associates and management believe them"
bad,"I loved my job as a receiver...worked 4AM to 2PM. but management was unfair in how they treated you. And now I am permanently disable to lift more than 20 pounds, and do the job that I was very good at. PLus they didn't coach the associate who injured me."
bad,"The job itself is fine. Lots of opportunities to learn. Management can be hit or miss. As a result of competition, you'll find frequent sabotaging of each other in order to grow. Lying seems to be frequent in many Walmart stores. "
bad,"Everything sucks at that job, the sleepless nights I had was crazy....... i wasn’t recognized for the work I did do..... and the overnight managers was rude to the point I couldn’t take it so I quit n I was one of there best .... I never bother anybody I got my work done and went home"
bad,"Foi uma experiencia para se esquecer, mas em um cero momento ajudou"
bad,"This job is OKAY for $11/hr. Mostly grunt work, get used to doing 3 man jobs solo. Management was hard to find when needed. Training sucks, you're basically on your own once you go through the 8 hours of required computer courses they have you do. Did I mention cashiers get the same pay too? Doing less work?"
bad,"Walmart will hire just about anyone so I guess that’s a plus."
bad,not a good place to work for . some people are nice and some people are very mean to you . what I have leaned is don't trust not one in manager . call think is crazy.
bad,The Hartselle store I regret ever transferring there from the Cullman store 7280. The supervisors at the Hartselle store are highly DEMANDING and hateful. If you don't do exactly what they want when they want they make it very hard on you till you walk out or they let you go.
bad,"Processes customers returns.  issues money orders, does wire transfers,"
bad,Can be busy at times ... Outside and inside helping with customers . Not happy with the environment. They don’t appreciate you. But I’m working 2 jobs supporting my family...
bad,"Only for those who thrive in adversity. Minimum 55-60 hours every week for supervisors and managers. Expect to react to non-ideal situations every day. Your scheduled shift will most likely include an ""extra"" day, possibly in the middle of your weekend. Weekend night overtime shifts are common. High turnover on all levels of the organization."
bad,Walmart has very strict and unfair attendance policies. To keep your job is to kiss the managers as. I don’t knapsack what else they want me to say in this comment. Release me
bad,I was transferred from a single concentration position to a three way concentration position with no expressed warning. I was expected to have prior knowledge of standard operating procedure and I had not been exposed that environment.
bad,"This company started off a good company but as the years went on. They cut the amount of the raises , our insurance sucks, and the store is always short handed."
bad,"I wouldnt recommend ever working here unless your desperate. Management is terrible, they never resolve any issues, they assign more work than reasonable. They treat employees like garbage, tell you to do one thing then get mad because you were doing it. The only positive is that they offer alot of benefits and recently increased the pay rate."
bad,"The management is dismal and puts fault into the employees when it is really managements fault. The do not take responsibility for what happens. The job itself is not bad, but the management makes it a very bad place to work."
bad,"Being short staffed. Management expects the employees on the floor to pick up the slack with no recognition or appreciation whatsoever. Very few managers will lend a hand with daily tasks, however, if things aren't done you will be pulled in the office. There is little to no team work  between associates. Way too much favoritism on managers part. Every manager tells you something different,  lack of communication big time. Also, employees do not show up for shifts and now management has enforced a new policy where we need a paper from a doctor for every absence. Only thing that was enjoyable were a few employees and of course most cuatomers.. stay away"
bad,"I regret to inform that Walmart was one of the worst jobs I have obtained in my life. Only because the management didn’t really help me to their fullest extent. I was treated unfairly by management, I am a very determined hard working individual that strived to make a difference in the community. Keep in mind that you’re allowed to call in for 5 days in a 6 month period. I had 6 occurrences and was let go while co workers of mine had 6+"
bad,Staff seems to be more in charge than management some blatantly disregards the message given by management .... management plays favoratism and promotes the least deserving and qualified employees and lacks praising the ones deserving of praise.
bad,The Walmart’s Managers aren’t enough focused to evaluate the coworkers. Many coworkers doesn’t working anything and they are evaluated the same with others. That’s the big problem for motivation of the workers.
bad,"A store managers position is one of total box ownership. There is never time off. You are always connected to the job. If there are short falls you expected to not leave until the issues are resolved regardless of the consequences to your health, welfare and impact on your family."
bad,"Walmart is an excellent company for which to work if you are looking for job security, and don't have stellar job history. If you show up on time and do as you are asked, you will continue to have a job with Walmart."
bad,Good place to work 3/5 stars... Some people nice some people the usual work environment enjoy warm weather enjoy cold weather this place is for you your gonna enjoy it
bad,Walmart is simple....they want you to worry about keeping your job.  I fell into the trap.  If you want to work six to seven days a week and still be questioned about working hard -- sign up!
bad,"I worked in all fresh areas of Walmart. In the Deli it was my responsibility to set up deli cook food, slice meat, make sandwiches, wraps, and salads. I also waited on the customers. In produce I culled old produce put out new. In the bakery I made donuts,put them out for display and boxed them,baked bread, bagged and labeled it also. Beside customer service I also did production."
bad,One thing stood out while working at Walmart. That was the working relationship with other employees. They were more than happy to share information and ask questions as well
bad,"The work itself is not hard and they offer decent benefits, but for every associate (employee) there are two managers. This results in a lack of communication, and a confusion of orders between management and associates. What's more is that even though they have radios on hand to communicate with each other, none of them let the others know if they need to borrow one of their associates so whenever a manager sees that their associate is gone the associate gets in trouble for something that was out of their control. Honestly it's a dysfunctional and quite frankly hostile workplace that seriously needs to practice communication."
bad,My advice is to get hired in and apply for another job at another location. They mess with your family. Dont give any personal information about yourself
bad,typical day i did the same thing for 6 years management was always saying something that was unbelievable we always had a time limit every night there no ups or even close to what amazon is doing the pay is 11 dollar and hour if your wondering but they are now training for you to do cashier if you need a job I guess its for you but I wont be there for to long everything changes a little to much I worked at 1105 on mc cain to this day i still dont know how i did it well good luck if you sign up
bad,"Walmart offered plenty of room for advancement, but seemed rather selective. Anyone who didn't fit a certain criteria was moved to another station in the store so often that the person would quit for a sence of stability. Management constantly argued over the walkie talkies for all employees to hear and publicly berated anyone for making mistakes. Complete lack of professionalism."
bad,This store uses you wherever they please. The new manager put in charge of my schedule made it impossible to work the amount of hours I was originally promised 9 yrs ago.
bad,"The pay is only nice because they lowball their workers. You will not have free time, you have work 60 hrs to earn 1 he of PTO. This should be a short term job"
bad,You get get little or no advanced warning of a schedule change and even get undercut in hours. The managements ability to coordinate and plan shifts/tasks for the employees varied and no one ever seemed to be satisfied with employee performance no matter how much work was actually completed that day.
bad,"Walmart its self wasn't horrible but the managers were not understanding and do not care about you as a person. They see you as a body and not a person, if you dont mind working all the time and working every holiday with no holiday pay or like being stressed out all the time walmart is for you."
bad,I’m looking for a new job so that will tell you something. Work life balance is non existent and promotions are based on who likes you and who you know not your proven track record.
bad,"Tiene una calidad de vida pésima, es el peor trabajo que he tenido en mi vida."
bad,The DC pays well for the area and has good insurance and benefits. There is no chance for advancement within the company. They hire outside people for the higher end jobs like management. They give no chance for manger jobs for experienced associates that have worked in their respective positions for years.
bad,I was trained for about 30 minutes before being thrown out there on my own. I would see my manager maybe once a week. Restrooms are always too busy to actually get in there and clean them and when you do get to close the restrooms to clean them customers are at the door complaining and rushing you. This position is literally a nightmare. Managers constantly bother you. If you enjoy cleaning  diarrhea and  urine that's all over the toilets and floor this is the perfect job for you.
bad,It seems to me by my experience with Walmart that they hate their employees and don't care how hard they work but only what they can get from them. Stupid company
bad,management never knows whats going on and hours are always changing per week but most of the other employees are pretty decent and you also get benefits
bad,"It was alright for a high school student and college student. it wasn't a lot of money if you're fully supporting yourself, but it'll help. The hours w"
bad,"Management is very harsh towards employees and don't help with overworked staff. The atmosphere is alright, but they set super high standards for workers to meet and when they don't meet that they consistently blame the employees rather than help the situation."
bad,I am making the same rate of pay as a new hire after working for five years with company lack of supplies to do job because of budgets allowed for store most benefits they had before have fizzled away hope you enjoy hearing the same songs four times a shift other than that it’s a good job
bad,"It's really easy to get into, but hard to get schedule changes. If you're in college you are screwed. And don't expect to make real friends. Just saying  watch your blank"
bad,It can be a stressful environment at times. I love my job itself but management is awful most times. And very hard to get off and get paid for it if you have an emergency.
bad,"The managers play favorite and don’t care that production is impossible to hit. You get punished for absolutely everything, the overall environment is poor and the only real positive is that the pay is good and the workers all agree that it’s a horrible place to work"
bad,"The general labor tends to be simple, repetitive, and mindless. However, the expectation of work finished is based entirely on the whims of management, who often have no applicable experience and won't know what is and is not possible to get done in a shift."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working here to my enemy. If you're just starting out and it's your first job it's great $11 an hour to stand around and talk on your phone. But if you've been here for any length of time there's no compensation for the new starting wages of Associates which breeds discontent amongst anyone who's worked there for a year or two or more. And because of that $11 starting wage they rarely hire full-time Associates. If you've got a good store manager then day today would probably be all right. But I don't. It's very stressful, I always feel threatened about losing my job, they ask you to do tasks but they have no comprehension of what it entails, the processes are relatively new. I believe the company is there to make rich people richer, certainly not the values that it once had especially as far as treatment of their employees."
bad,"Typical day at work was fine, would have been nice to have more support in terms of customers treating us badly, i.e. not allowing customers to verbally assault workers. Learned lots about pharmacy practices, etc having to do with my job. Management was ok inside pharmacy but on the store level (store manager, etc.) they didn't really seem to care. Workplace culture was fine, lots of different people to meet and everyone is friendly for the most part. Hardest part was dealing with customers mentioned above but most enjoyable part was dealing with other customers who were more understanding."
bad,"1) plane the day with coworkers"
bad,"Poor management, scheduling, and communications. I often worked alone in electronics where I was in charge of electronics, connection center, photo, and sometimes fabric(right next door). It was way too much work for one person. Management spouts the company line of caring for their employees but don't care if a department is under staffed. They will slash hours every time they need to pad their budget."
bad,Ever hear a story about how bad it is to work there? Well they're true. The managers were incompetent  and never listened to the people who had worked there for years.
bad,"The pay is nice, but the managers and customers are abusive and atrocious. Not safe for open LGBT* members. There are frequent breaks, which is nice. The recently relaxed uniform policy allows more individuality."
bad,Not a very professional work place. Management isn't professional and associates and customers are very rude. Everybody is very miserable there and hours are always being cut.
bad,Working overnight offer very little advancement opportunity. Benefits are pitiful. Everyone and everything creates drama. Managers don't really care about associats unless they kids their butt.
bad,"Management and upper staff was unprofessional, rude, and passive aggressive toward employees. They were not accommodating or empathetic in any way. It wasn't a good work environment and It's not a place I would recommend to anybody who needs a job."
bad,"a typical day at work depends on which walmart and location you work at. for me my day could go smooth and fast sometimes, but most of the time it feels like as if the store managers are being unnecessarily mean to all of us. the employees of the store are always cool and fun to work with. they make it a bit more easier."
bad,It's an okay plave to work but has had so many changes within the company over the past two years. Management needs much tweeking and standards. Effort and hard work ethic must be considered and appreciated much more.
bad,"I think that this job would be okay for someone who enjoys mindless work. They either give you absolutely nothing to do, or way too much for you to finish in one day. The managers have no idea what they are doing or how to be managers. Instead of actually fixing problems they ""fix"" them and make them worse. For example, they will pull people into other departments to help finish their work, but then the people who get pulled to other departments get yelled at for not finishing their work. If you work at night, (6-11ish) good luck doing anything besides zoning for hours. They are constantly understaffed because people leave so often, the biggest reason being the new requirement to register train everyone. so if you don't want to ever work as a cashier, I wouldn't recommend working here. Managers will also blame everyone but themselves for anything that goes wrong. They also recently changed their attendance policy, so you can not call out as often anymore, but full time people who earn more paid time off can call out more. I would not recommend this job."
bad,"During the interview and training process, one is led to believe that you will be entering a professional culture where individual merit is not only noticed, but rewarded.  Depending on the position into which you are hired, you may find yourself needing to work much harder than your peers if you want to meet your daily expectations.  You will also discover that the majority of your peers will leave messes behind that you have no choice but to clean, before you can even begin your assigned tasks.  This is a daily process:  Clean up after other, less responsible ""adults,"" (who will never be ""coached"" or fired for their latent inabilities) so that you can begin your responsibilities.  Cleaning up after others occurs throughout the day as well.  During the hiring process, they will tell these simple facts to no new employees.  It is also important to note that the longer you work there, the more you will come to realize that most of the management staff move and work slower than yourself.  You will find them slowly walking down the back hall together, talking about their favorite video games or their farms, wasting company time on a daily basis, all while being paid double or triple your wage.  Walmart, as a company, as a culture, is not a corporation that is worth anyone's time as a source of employment."
bad,"Dominate company, They are doing great things with on-line business, how ever thier lack of support in some stores do to  high expenses of over ordering. Walmart is all work no time for family. If you are management you work 60 hours plus a week. The benefits are great, but the work is not rewarding. Walmart runs thier grocery department similar to general merchandise areas, Walmart constantly changes how procedures and processes are done."
bad,"Enjoyment of the job is highly dependent upon management and coworkers.  The job was not difficult, but highly repetitive.  Management could never agree or remain on the same page.  There were three different expectations from three different managers, and they seldom ever aligned.  Pay is on the low side."
bad,"Walmart is a good job to have. Although for many of us, being there for just two years seems to feel like ten years and you are worn out. Walmart works with its associates for hours they can work, unless it is the weekend, or holidays. Walmart does not do holiday pay, and if you are scheduled to work a holiday, and you cannot work you are severely penalized. Even if you request the holiday off six months in advance, you are more than likely to be expected and scheduled to work that shift."
bad,Walmart is Walmart. This is a job that I would only take if absolutely needed. Pay is low and employees are easy to replace management has no concern of company moral
bad,"So surprisingly enough I loved parts of this job. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and the times we were busy and also getting to work with the customers. I honestly really enjoyed having to clean and zone and put things away. I like staying busy and having to run around like a mad person. I didn't enjoy having to deal with crazy substance abusing customers all the time though. Being afraid of getting attacked because of the brawls that they would sometimes get into, talking to the cops every couple of weeks if we were lucky, nor a lot of the management. I loved my first supervisor though, he was absolutely amazing and would never make you do something he wasn't willing to do and was actually willing to teach you how to do things."
bad,"No Communication, Bad Management, Double work load and a decrease in benefits. No time to take allowed breaks. Cut overnight pay and moved 5am shift to 4am."
bad,Poor adherence to procedure. Unproductive management. Insufficient workers to cover all areas with the expectation that we work outside of our own areas to make up for the lack of sufficient employees. Extremely negative mood throughout all associates. Rude and angry customers never held accountable for mistreating associates.
bad,"Working there for 4 years, management has changed a lot and not for the best. Moral dropped and people left and standards went down, shift hour were changed and no overtime and night shift differential was dropped."
bad,"good work place good company with good benefits. thhe co workkers were very friendly and helpful.and management was good, breaks were on schedule and they have alot of perkks for there employees. but they would not give overtime"
bad,"Good place for part time and to earn some cash. not great for a career. Minimum wage, poor management structure and communication. No benefits. low job stability."
bad,"The place was ok to work, However the Assistant manager is horrible. Especially when there is no Store Manager. I do not recommend working in this particular store."
bad,"Turned out money didn't buy happiness. I was miserable, and wanted to work somewhere I could feel proud about the work I did. As upper management, I oftentimes felt pressured to be too volatile with associates to accomplish company goals, which was against who I am."
bad,"Very high turnover at WM Store #5601.  It is ""fast paced"" as in ""fass-fass!""  There is favoritism.  People are fired, regularly.  Hours are not predictable.  Opportunity for advancement is low.  If you have other options, make Walmart 5601 your last option, not your first."
bad,Working at Walmart was disappointing because management did very little to provide co workers capable of handling the customer base. I could have been an asset to the company
bad,"Constantly being pushed to do jobs that aren't yours. Management doesn't care about your well being, thy just care if you work or not. Best part of the job was some of the customers I got to meet."
bad,"The reason I left Walmart is because I was constantly being pulled up front to ring on the register, my job was as an electronics sales associate."
bad,I liked that the hours were overnight. Sometimes the hours were not guaranteed and other times we were understaffed causing more stress and pressure on  the rest of the workers there.
bad,I enjoyed my time at Walmart as a pharmacy technician. The coworkers made the hectic work more manageable. The pharmacy manager was likely overworked though and seemed to be stressed.
bad,"what you would expect. Flexible, but a lot of work, for very little pay. I'm looking for a new job. Flexible hours are the only positive I can think of."
bad,"They lure you in with the hourly rate but then they dont give you enough hours to live off of. Hardly ever saw my family. Was fired for ""leaving early"" which never happened but they wouldnt look at tapes to prove it. I'll never go back. Cant get second job as everything is conflict of interest."
bad,Overall a decent company to work with. Coworkers are very helpful but management can be a little difficult to work with. Answered very few on my questions.
bad,Very greedy with hours the pick there favorites in the store if your not a favorite you won't get to keep the job as long as you want. It will be till they want u gone then they will make up and do anything to get rid of you. They expect 1 person to do the job of 2 or more could do. If you get FMLA like I did for my sick dad. They will find a way to let u go even when I have never been in trouble. The pay was not bad but you don't get enough hours for the pay to make a difference. And any time they decided to change days you can miss or PTO and other things that goes on how long you have worked there and all the hours you have put in. They change it with no care that it makes people start all over after all the time there it's like your new again. They just don't care about employees like they say they do. It's all a lie.
bad,There is a lack of management skills at Walmart. Management treats you like you are less then them and they are VERY unprofessional. If you are not “friends” with a manager you will get no where.
bad,It’s hard being at a place where people don’t pull their own weight. You constantly have to walk into a mess and pray you don’t fall behind. It makes it even more difficult when management doesn’t know how to manage or hold people accountable for the things they do wrong. If you don’t work and are a slacker than this place is for you....it’s full of free money. You can easily move up if you look like you’re doing something and kissing managements behind. The company doesn’t care about the associates and what life brings them...they just know you better show up even if you’re on your death bed or else. This place just rips your soul out and spits on it.
bad,Many sketchy visitors not enough security. Alot of miscommunication between workers and salaried managers. A few co-workers get away with breaking rules such as new employees versus employees that have been at the store location/ company for more than 5 years.
bad,"Its a decent place to work if you want quick and fast cash, i wouldn't recommend working their long term. The hardest part of the job would have to be the management. They have unrealistic expectations for their employees"
bad,"My job is okay, but the management micromanaged too much then gives little to no support. There isnt any stability at my store. Its beyond inconsistent"
bad,The way they assigned shifts and duties was sloppy. Bad communication from management to staff constantly (a reason why I left).All the staff was friendly for the most part.
bad,"Walmart is not a healthy environment and they keep cutting benefits costs and vacation and I feel like im being stripped of my pay/benefits. I used to like this company, but time to look for another career opportunity."
bad,Supervisor could either take you or leave you. Had to track potential shoplifters. If you messed up you were disciplined or fired. Was trained at two worst stores in the area.
bad,"The hourly employees were pretty good. Got the job done when asked to assist. Other management sucked. Didn't support or assist their peers. Treatment was brutal and without respect. I'm surprised Walmart doesn't stay in court with the number of HR concerns it has. Anyway, I wouldn't work for the company again. The pay was excellent but isn't worth it. I tried to make it work for me and I just couldn't get past the contempt and lack of respect or lack of support and team effort."
bad,"just isn't for me. Training is very long and orientation. They need to change the orientation structure. I was hired with Spanish speakers and the orientation person could not even translate anything for some people and it was a bit unorganized because now, they aren't able to know exactly what is expected at work and everything else regarding their pay, Paid Time Off, etc. Management is hard to find. If you're looking for them for something important, expect to go on an adventure; off the clock at that. The hours are very long mostly. And working 38 hours, almost full time on $11.00 pay is such a horrible thing. People are friendly and managers are very stuck up."
bad,"Management is poor to an extent, workplace culture for cart pushers is atrocious, constantly overworked with no foreseeable benefits of doing a good job such as a raise, bonus, or promotion. The tier list of people who actually care about you range from the average worker, CSM's, and then ends at department managers, after that unless you are suffering from a heat stroke most of management could care less about your wants and needs. So if you are going to work at Walmart please take any other position that isn't a cart pusher otherwise you're going to be used and abused until you quit or are thrown out."
bad,"Working at Wal-mart is terrible.  Employees steal them blind. In my opinion, Walmart is a sorry employer. They do not take care of their workers, a #."
bad,"Worked at my local Wal-Mart for 6 months. My previous job was fast food so I was used to working fast, I was so bored. I went from cashier to customer service (sometimes). I wanted to grow more and more, show them what I got. They didn't give me a chance to really grow to my full potential. Main reason I left is because, I couldn't pay my bills! The only reason why I had long hours is because I had long brakes, hated that. The most they give you is 32 hours so they don't have to pay for benefits, or so the rumor was told amung with staff and managers. The one good thing at this job was how friendly some of the staff was."
bad,"This store is the most unprofessional place a person could work at. The problem lies within the managers, who partake in gossip on a regular basis. An incredibly stressful and toxic work environment."
bad,"Its walmart, you're expected to stand in the tech area and answer questions, try to keep things off the floor, and generally try to control the chaos."
bad,The culture was different there was effort but not enough follow through. The managers tried there best to follow through with training regulations but it starts from the head .
bad,"I would not recommend anyone work for Walmart pharmacy, it’s hard to become full time. They stay busy but under staffed. The pay is not that great at All!"
bad,Management is not much help to their associates.. Only focused on their tasks. Not much help to employees in their department. Managers are on leave of absence more than employees and expect you to do all the work.
bad,Wish they’d let me drink on the job but it’s frowned upon. Better off talking to a tire than asking any salary for anything. Shut the office door and chill on Facebook.
bad,"Decent pay for part time work but not the place to try to make enough money to live on. Unless you have another source of income and benefits, this store is not the best place to work."
bad,"Spent one month as a department manager and in that time I never received the training I was promised. On top of that, I received less than all of the other department managers, had one employee in my area... overall a pretty awful time"
bad,enpresa com chance de crescimento profissional na área de atuação
bad,"It was fast paced, but you are able to work at yout own pace. The day shift seemed to be longer than the night. The manager was nice, but she was hardly there."
bad,"I started with Walmart in 1983 and meet Sam Walton three times."
bad,This specific walmart needs a better management  but overall somewhat of a good work place. Can be a little hectic on weekends and everyone gets stressed out.
bad,Was very stressful working there and management was bad. Couldn’t even question there “commands” without being pulled in office or being written up. If you need a job badly apply if not find somewhere else
bad,I though it would be a good place to work it was till I started workxing there for aehile i mean the people are get its just broing because your doing the same stuff over and overr again and it gets kind of boring.
bad,"Favoritism. Long hours, work during your lunch. If they dont like you they'll fire you. Policies are absurd now. Everything is just going downhill. Don't advise it as long term."
bad,"Physically demanding job, yes it does pay a little more than most jobs of this kind but the job itself is very tedious and needs to be fast. Always lifting more than 50lbs for 10 hours"
bad,"Worked for over 15 years here. Pay at the distribution center was good but they constantly cut hours so the hourly pay really didn't matter.  I was an office worker and our GM made it clear he didn't care for the office help (we also got no raise one year,  and half of everyone else the next year). Benefits are absolutely terrible,  almost as if you don't have any.  I ran away from that place after all those years and do not regret it one bit.  So have over 50% of the managers there."
bad,they take away ot and bonus and sick days and holida pay. They r fadt paced most of time and very busy during holidays and other parts of year. They dont pay
bad,"Ineffectively managing associates. This company needs to make sure that the salaried members are acting with integrity, and maintain the a fair and honest work environment with their associates. Respect for the individual also needs to be of highest importance. Management has a lot of opportunities for improvement. The management team is only as good as their associates. Management should lead by example and always strive to communicate with respect and make decisions UNBIASED. Retaliation from management is also a huge opportunity that needs to be address, as well as conflicts between associates not being handled accordingly"
bad,It was fun till I had to work at 4 am which they couldn’t change the time which sucked so I ended up being stressed out because it was hard for me to wake up everyday at 3 and go to work at 4
bad,i put 3 1/2 years into this place just to be put down and to have my self esteem lowered. you do have some good managers but not a lot who care about u
bad,"I would say if you can come to work everyday knowing that you will be getting yelled at and sometimes belittled for your average or above average work than this is the place for you.  Management had a strong bias to people and did not show an advance to care for associates.  Management is incredibly mean and will talk behind your back unless you are in the 1% of people that they like.  Job performance helps a little if you want to move up, but sucking up pulls further weight.  I worked there for over two years, I would NOT recommend people to work here."
bad,"If you’re looking for a job to get by this is for you. If you’re looking for somewhere fun to work, I’d recommend looking elsewhere. If you’re the right kind of person you can make a career out of it."
bad,poor management other maintenance ppl just standing around talking and not working maintenance supervisor just not doing her job and try's everything to do anything but maintenance and end up with her boyfriend before shift ends and taking longer breaks and hanging out with other employees talking instead of helping the maintenance crew when even short handed so you hade to do 3 ppl job in one shift instead of yours which meant store was not 100% clean and management on that night  didn't care
bad,"definitely not safe when working overnight , especially since the store is 24 hours. very fast paced and you do deal with A LOT of rude customers. very few registers are open . so its always short staffed"
bad,The managers could be a little bit better at what they are supposed to do. But they are great people and some of them can be super helpful when you need help.
bad,Walmart is an okay place to work. Unfortunately many of the veteran employees have a sense of entitlement and do not treat new comers properly. Upper management does not enforce the policies of the business and seem to allow this type of behavior depending on who you are. We are consistently being trained on different ways people are to be treated but they are not enforce.
bad,Walmart is definitely not a place to work unless you rally need a job!! Management is horrible they are not fair!! When I worked there the paid was definitely terrible!!
bad,Mostly leaving the job because managers don’t want to listen to request of being moved to other areas. They over work associates that have been there longer than ones who just came. Managers rather just keep pulling the associates that have been there instead of teaching new associates different areas.
bad,"Not the best place to work but not the worst. It was a good first job for me, but I probably wouldn't do it again."
bad,It was a beginners job or an elderly persons type of job. It had zero skill sets required other than to be polite and inviting to the customers and assist them in any way you could.
bad,"so much is expected of you in a short amount of time that it can become impossible to get it all done. To much work not enough time, had to stay late to get things done or come in early to relieve the person getting off due to lack of coverage."
bad,The corporation mainly cares about profit and ways to force more work out of its associates by limiting their freedoms over time. Getting into a store that is devoid of corruption or favoritism is a coin-toss at best. Don't expect management to work with you on anything and be prepared for sudden and life-altering policy changes at any time.
bad,"Pay is very good, but there is a point system so you can not miss many days or be late. Some managers are good others are rude. You can get PTO. Never had enough cashiers"
bad,Not the worst place to work the pay is not the best but its a good environment if not for the managers the workers mostly try their best the pay seems like next to nothing
bad,I learned how to scan inventory into and out of stock; I learned to put overstock away. I learned that a pallet jack takes time to learn to maneuver. The management were great on so shifts and nightmares on other.
bad,"Starting pay is good, but there is no overtime allowed and hours can be very inconsistent. Raises are very rare and often are not very much. I've been at Wal-Mart for four years and my only raise was for 20 cents, and that was two years ago. It often appears that upper management does not hold employees and customers in their best interests. L"
bad,"My manager and co-workers were always confused and telling me to do the wrong thing or they'd ignore me because they didn't know how to help. 2 days of ""training"", which was someone standing near me on their phone walking around the store and refused to help me, plus 2 days of computer tests that always crashed the computer. Inconsistant schedule. Old technology that was difficult to understand."
bad,"The combination of terrible customers regularly harassing you and the really poor pay is enough to make me never want to recommend anyone to work here. But, the awful, inconsistent, and demeaning management is what makes me hate the place as an employer. Management does not care about you, overworked sometimes working 6 hours and others working 10 or more when scheduled for 8 hour shifts. Not worth the 2% raise every year either because it's only like $0.25 unless you're a salaried manager."
bad,Walmart is going downhill fast. This whole High Performance Culture doesn't help when you're constantly understaffed. Home office doesn't care. Customers are frusterated.
bad,It's not for everybody. great benefits no personal life. respect is out of the question. Peak as far as money goes it was great but you will hate the job and everyone by the end
bad,Managers are horrid they expect to much for what you get paid and never listen to the workers they treat everyone in there like slaves and whenever you offer a better way of doing things you’re told that the old way works too if you wasn’t standing here talking
bad,"Long days some are better than others, if your quick an have amazing accuracy in organizing and stocking then good job for you, also customer service is big ."
bad,Working in the deli at Walmart can be a very stressful experience at times due to the often overlooked issue of never having enough staff or resources to complete the job successfully and efficiently.
bad,"poor management"
bad,"My typical day at work begins either in the morning or evening when I clock in, when I head back to the Deli, our department manager is always ducking out when we need her and our work place is a mess because either the floors aren't swept, dishes aren't clean, bakery hasn't finished their tasks when it comes to making or breaking out the bread or putting them out on the floor, there is no communication when it comes to the morning shift passing on the rest of the work onto the night shift. When I'm out on the floor and working from 7-8 hours a day, I expect two 15 minute break within my time working; I'll be lucky to get one break plus my lunch break, because it's required by law that if a person is working more than 8 or 7 hours they have to get two 15 minute breaks, but our department manager doesn't allow it."
bad,Been with the company for years(5) and they pay me like I just walked in the door yesterday. Some people transfer to your area and they start them off with a higher pay then you.  When u call the HR to address the problem they tell you to speak to your store manager which is the same person who says that Home office is in control of raise and stuff. Not only that every manager is quick to try to ride you even if they just seen you do all your work. They treat lower co-workers like peonies unless your a kiss up. Not to mention no overtime.... dropped down part time after 3years of full time so I could get second job but as part time still work on more cars then full time workers. This place is crazy
bad,"The compensation is only halfway decent. When I left they were implementing a new scheduling system that was screwing everyone over on their hours. The attendance policy/points system could use more leniency for emergencies such as hospital visits, car wrecks, etc. Overworked and underpaid. Nepotism is a key factor in getting promotions. "
bad,"Not enough over sight of department managers making sure the jobs are done right. never really their, to busy doing other things..Team leads are not trained in their duties well enough.Everyone runs a muck."
bad,Working unknown hours every week and at very little hourly pay.  I shouldn't have to work a 6 day week just to make 40 hours.  Also too may over worked employees for little pay.
bad,"This job was ehh, I was hired on as a cashier and not once did I actually be a cashier, I only shadowed and then they never gave me my cashier numbers and I was stuck folding clothes and putting away makeup the entire time I was working there, I wouldn’t really recommend"
bad,"No room really to advance. Depending on what department you work for, the work load and scheduling does not meet the rquirement. Also the management teams we not very well put together in my opinion. Good place to go for a steady paycheck...not worth the aggrivation"
bad,"If you wanna hop through the store and learn everything there's room for that. But the people who work here are full of themselves for the most part unfortunately and they can't seem to stop forming high school clicks. Being at work normally means; go to work, do what you're paid to do, and clock out. Nothing more and nothing less. But sadly it was so caught up in drama I had to leave."
bad,The culture of Walmart is so boring and demeaning. It's like nobody is even alive at work. They are just walking zombies trying to find something wrong with a shelf so they can somehow look busy.
bad,"It was an okay job for the first couple of months but I started to feel myself deteriorating. I've had a good amount of work experience, so I know when a company is overworking their employees and I definitely felt that at Walmart. It's a shame that such a huge company takes advantage of their employees by making them work so hard for little pay."
bad,Manager needs to be more approachable. It is a high demand job. They expect more than most people are capable of. Attendance policies are very strict.
bad,"Fast paced, good workers. Poor management. No support from upper management for lower staff. Good chances for moving up within the company. Reasonable pay for the work."
bad,"Walmart was a great place to work. My job working there was different everyday most days I walked into unworked freight other days I could focus on my dept and making it better. Management could be on the same page a little better. Working at Walmart I learned to deal with difficult customers in a happy fashion, I learned how to use equipment I never thought I’d use. I left Walmart with a sense of how to run a business and how to listen to other people’s opinion."
bad,"Poor management. Good coworkers but upper management treated their employees undignified, unappreciative. They just wanted bodies- didn’t care if it was the right somebody or not. Did not care or arrange to help you arrange for a Drs appointment or sick child."
bad,"This is my side of the story for this particular Walmart, So this does not apply for others. I think that it is a decent job for you in high school. Walmart distribution centers are the way to go."
bad,Don't get me wrong this is not a complete horrible place but I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone who really wants to earn good money. This job is more for college students and retirees. And the workplace environment sucks.
bad,"I worked for a big box retailer for many years. The pay raises were not very high. The management did not use the open door policy effectively, in a way that would benefit their employees."
bad,"I worked in a variety of jobs in two different stores. The lack of care for the associates in astounding. There were some great managers, but there were also some not so great."
bad,"Poor management. Poor work environment. However I did enjoy the actual job. I really made a point to be warm and caring toward our customers, as well as to perform the proper security measures necessary to keep the store safe."
bad,"I get along well with co-workers, management and customers. I have learned to change and adapt very quickly and have always done so well. I have learned to work fast in a time crunch situation."
bad,"Managers do not make sure slackers actually work and blame those who actually do their work. Expected to do 8 hours worth of work within a 4-6 hour shift, which is unrealistic and impossible.  I would do someone else' work as well as my own. Managers are awful. And when you address your concerns, they do nothing but make it worse and treat you like you're stupid, so the 'open door' policy is nothing but an absolute joke and waste of time. Department managers are lazy and think they can make their own rules. Store is always a mess and unorganized and they're continuing to cut hours. It has to be the worst store I have ever seen. I'm usually if not always by myself."
bad,"i hated working here, every member of management was a joke, good luck trying to get the hours you want, asset protection treats every employee like a crack head their. pay rate was beyond low."
bad,"This is not an ideal place to work, but it is a place to work. I made it through for 4 years until I found other employment. The management is not great and it stems down and ends up effecting workers and customers."
bad,I have worked in several Walmarts and they are all the same. Management is HORRID. they promote people that never work. Constantly want you to do other people's jobs and then wonder why your work doesnt get done. I loved what I did (Dairy Manager) but couldn't stand store management.
bad,"The employees are easy to get along with, The work moves at a relatively fast pace but is easy enough to deal with. Customer Service is better than i originally thought."
bad,It's just a low paying job.  Don't read much into it or expect much of it.  Don't expect much of management.  Typical dead end low pay go nowhere...….
bad,"Extremely poor management!!! Everything gets blamed on third shift, even though it is a ripple effect from first shift on. Impossible work expectations on third shift employees, that runs with a skeleton crew every night. Can only speak for third shift, but know employees on all shifts are unhappy. Turnover rate extremely high, speaks volumes."
bad,"I went to work to work.  I was let go because I didn't have ""enough enthusiasm.""  That is the most ridiculous reason to terminate anybody.  Being task focused, I'm not gonna jump up and down clapping my hands. Maintenance and quality of work was good, but I lacked enthusiasm. Every time someone screws up, they create another rule.  They're gonna create so many rules they're not gonna get anything done."
bad,"Awful place to work, management is AWFUL, too little pay for the amount of work. No credit for anything you do. just overall a bad environment.  10/10 would NOT recomend"
bad,"Managers and company policies suck. They pressure you for higher production regardless of safety. They could care less what you have going on in your life, i.e. family issues, sickness. They will still hold you accountable. You really can't advance in the company unless you know someone higher up."
bad,The main problem with the walmart management is the lack of employees and incompetent management they expect you to finish everything knowing we are severly understaffed
bad,"aprendí a socializar mejor con la gente y a ser mas responsable, aprendí el manejo de tarjetas de crédito y débito, cierres de caja etc."
bad,"Long hours and hard work,sometime we have to work 6 days to 7 days a week. Upper managements can be quit petty and make the job twice a hard for no reason, other than the fact they don't like you. The stress level out weigh the pay and they can treat you like trash if they choose to."
bad,"My manager continually lies to the associates he oversees, and demands a workload that is greater 115% of the performance rate. He has harassed his employees with no repercussion because ""He was under stress"" making his actions acceptable."
bad,"It was an okay job to have. The management was kind of awful. It could have been better, but the lawn and garden department was a very peaceful, relaxing place to work."
bad,Unfortunately Walmart tends to treat their employees like just a number.  The environment is stressful on a regular basis.  I did learn more about overseeing employees but there seemed to be no room for advancement.  Hardest part was trying to reason with upper management.  Best part was the employees I supervised.
bad,"I worked at Walmart for years and never recieved a single raise, despite being told by management many times that I was considered the best associate in my position."
bad,Walmart constantly hiring and cutting regular employees hours. also if you're not able to work anytime then your hours will be cut. manager don't know how to talk to employee or customer.
bad,Never enough help. People that are there are overworked. Management poor- left hand doesn't know what right hand is doing. Nobody cares. Bad morale. Always changing something.
bad,"every day is completely different and you don't know what kind of day it's going to be until you get there. Don't rely on managers who have no experience in that department or for scheduling. Management is only there to make corporate happy they don't do as much for the associates as they could. The workplace culture is very fend for your self. You can find some associates and Team leads that you can count on but they are sparse. Not knowing who you are working with for the day is hard especially if the person you are stuck with is lazy and doesn't do their share of work but, I like having a semi-stable good paying job."
bad,"Worked as an assistant manager and averaged about 55 hours a week. Store manager and my team of associates did not appreciate my dedication. As an assistant the store manager would try to micro-manage his assistants, and openly talked bad about assistant managers to other assistant managers.  The company has made great strides with technology. Could be a great job in the right location working for a store manager that cares about the people that work for him."
bad,It used to not be so bad. But new management stepped in and had us doing things that we don’t really do on a daily basis. I have very else left to say. I love most of my co-workers but there are some members of management that need to see that things are not working out the way that they think they are.
bad,"Stressful conditions, low pay and no appreciation. Long hours, no set schedules. Sudden schedule changes, indifference to employees and their needs. I'd only recommend this job to a single young person without children."
bad,I learned a lot from Walmart especially on how a company should treat their employees. A typical day at Walmart is chaotic and fast passed. definitely makes your day go by so much faster
bad,Very nice diverse staff. Unloading trucks were a little difficult everyone moving at different paces. Stocking was very easy. I felt a little uncomfortable around 1 manager. I felt like I was being pushed over my limits with some tasks. They threatened to write all of us up for not finishing things by a certain time which made me feel uncomfortable.
bad,"I took this job because it was close to home and my wife was ill.  It was the worst job I have ever had.  The atmosphere was morally and ethically devoid, and the pay was not nearly enough."
bad,If your looking for a first job and/or part time job; one should apply here. The hours are flexible and it commits to any schedule. The most difficult thing here is staying till 11pm if one were to close.
bad,Walmart is a good work place at first but after a couple month you start to notice how unorganized the organization is. The managers do not care about there employees. The hours are poor making it almost impossible to afford living cost.
bad,typical day at work was stocking the shelves and keeping the aisles in my department clean. Also help customers with questions on certain items. I learned that you have to be yourself and don't try to be someone that you are not to impress management. Management was ok but not the best to work with. The culture there was tense and stressful. Hardest part of the job was at times working 2 departments at the same time. Most fun part of the job was going home at the end of the day.
bad,"All of the stereotypes are true, and there is little good to say here."
bad,nothing to say about me working at Walmart this is just a stressful job to some people customers can really be amazing on how the are being treated during the proccess of che
bad,If you need cash now its good but don't take it seriously. you cannot live off walmart money and if you are in a high position you get yelled at by superiors consitently. its a revolving door of people constantly quiting or being fired
bad,"was able to change roles and job titles as I saw fit. room to grow and be promoted, looking to transfer to another store to gain more experience. made many new friends"
bad,The hours range from 12 to 35 hours a week. If you need a full time job and a decent check this isn’t the place to work. Management is unorganized and shows no leadership. No common goal. They allow several employee to over  stay their breaks or clock in then leave. They do not keep up with their employees much less know who is working what shift.
bad,Working for Walmart has been great up until recently . There are certain supervisors who have favorites and treat others unfairly .  Some managers seem to expect so much from associates and there is no appreciation just more pressure to add more tasks. The company needs more incentives or to show more appreciation to hardworking and loyal employees .
bad,"decent first job."
bad,I loved my job. Only problem was i never got to do it. I was all over the store and i got told i HAD to do manager work without the pay. Everyone there loves drama and most of the managers will not do anything to help you despite giving you a job you could not possibly finish in the time frame they have given you. Hour vary as well. One week you get about 39 hours (they won't give you 40 because they don't want you to be full time) then the next few weeks you only get 19 hours.
bad,"if you are pregnant do not work here. i was hired on with them knowing i was pregnant, they then denied me maternity leave, and then fired me while still on maternity leave. they are unethical and mistreat/overwork the employees they have."
bad,"i only intended to work for this company temporarily and was happy with my decision to leave , the pay was too low and management was never available to speak to about furthering yourself with said company."
bad,"I’m replaceable. Basically nothing matters as long as the company is still making profit. All in all, it was a great experience, but it’s not my forever career."
bad,You know Walmart great place to start off and save money but the management of any area (literally) can be either good or bad. There’s never an in between. The bad managements are the ones that are mostly founded in walmart and not bright ones. Honestly walmart needs to improve on that. Stop hiring lazy people for management. Honestly I have nothing else to say. The good management are always the ones that get the short end of the stick and suffer more than the bad management. But yeah good luck!
bad,"A typical day of work involves stocking merchandise, helping customers in ways such as running register, unlocking merchandise, or leading customers to items.  I learned that there are a lot of good people that work there, and the local managers do have good intentions, but their hands are unfortunately tied by what goes on at the corporate level.  The work place culture is ""okay, but not great"", because in a big store, the communication between employees is not where it needs to be.  The hardest part of the job is trying to juggle so many tasks at the same time, and also trying to balance work and life.  Another hard part of the job is trying to be trained on new things, because there are some things (such as phone contracts or photo maintenance) that only one or two people in the entire store know how to do correctly 100%.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and co-workers.  I think the CEO is okay, but some of the overall ideas of trying to stock in the middle of the day when there are tons of customers doesn't lead to great overall productivity."
bad,The managers talk to you like you're nothing when they are under pressure to get things done because of corporate expectations. Working the day shift is truly stressful.
bad,"My job pays well and gives quarterly bonuses, but I feel like I haven't been given an advancement opportunity in the nearly 3 years I've worked there, not one opportunity. After asking multiple times for help finding a better fitting job, asking for more to do around the store, my schedule is the same. Down stack, stock, pick items, scan bins, zone area, go home. Nothing more, nothing less day after day."
bad,Not all managers knew what they were doing. They didn't necessarily treat the associates the best. They would be incredibly inconsistent with scheduling people.
bad,"The managers rarely knew what was going on and the pay was not great and you worked really hard for little pay, The people I worked with were really great."
bad,"Walmart used to be a great place to work.  Unfortunately, Walmart home office has been changing policies to make it a great place to work if you do not want to make a career at Walmart.  The management varies.  You have good managers but they are eventually moved and you have managers that have no clue how to manage."
bad,"Doesn’t treat all associates fair, and management loves to retaliate against associates if they go about their heads. At the end of the day it’s not really worth the money to work for this company. I’m only here because I can’t find anything else."
bad,"I expected more out of my time working for this chain, hopefully more people will take initiative to change the company culture and get things on track."
bad,"Wal-Mart used to be a great place to work. Management began to dig in hard these past two years, eliminating hours, implementing poorly thought out rules, and ignoring employee opinions. I used to be able have a steady income, with a decent wage, but my hours began to dwindle to nothing. I hope that my store is the outlier, but unfortunately these recent events have done nothing but destroy my faith in the Wal-mart brand."
bad,the customers are rude and that makes people not care about their jobs they are just there for the paycheck no one like working for Walmart cause pep;e get away with being lazy
bad,I enjoyed working with the customers. Depending on the store the atmosphere could be miserable. The employees that worked the hardest was always expected to take the slack up for the ones that didnt want to do their job. and expected to work twice as hard so that the work got done.
bad,I would not recommend someone work here as the management are so incompetent it hurts the associates. Every manager puts their word into something instead of allowing the supervisors to just do their jobs.
bad,Walmart is not a bad place to work at. Is a very fast going place to work at. Some customers are awesome and so some you really have to have people skills. If you dont have people skills Walmart is not a good place for you to work at. Customers service is very important in any company.
bad,I would not recommend working here more then you have to. There's too many favoritism and even tho i was a high position I didn't get full time but my other part time associates would get 40 hours (walmart full time) and in palm harbor it seems like if your a female then one of the mangers (female btw) will like you more. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you clock out. and what I learned is that you need to work for yourself and that's it.
bad,The management is very unfair and unreasonable me the company is very unappreciative. So I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone because Walmart isn’t a positive work environment.
bad,Walmart is an okay job at first but the managers are not the greatest. They really don't care about their employees as they should. They do not make the best decisions.
bad,"It's the typical corporate ideologies that make your life miserable; 8-10 hour days with no meal breaks, 9 consecutive days on, no pharmacist overlap in a high volume dispensary (15+ prescriptions per hour)......  and they want more! Thank God walmart doesn't own an ER ward."
bad,"Cold in winter and hot in summer. Fast passed and stressful. Working with expensive freight. Drove forklift, clamp and slip.worked closely witg other associates."
bad,MGMT at Neighborhood Walmart is horrible. They yell at their employees. This mistreatment needs to be reported to headquarters. If your employee is not performing to your standards assist them but instead you fire them after 21months working there you find everything wrong and then OH YOU ARE FIRED and told to come back next day to ask for job only to be humiliated and told no you need to learn a life lesson. NOT TO MENTION BOTH PARENTS AREGOVT AND FURLOUGH. THANKS WALMART I was only trying to step up and help on top of watching my grandma dying in front of me and being brought back to life twice. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON IN SOMONE'S LIFE. Thanks to the gentlemen that seen how upset I was and decided to mentor and encourage me for the last 1 1/2 year. As he stated I could be on the streets slanging drugs.
bad,Productive and fun you meet interesting people and the management wasn't up to par as far as being professional. The managers on night shift are somewhat ok depending on who it is.
bad,"Working at Walmart at first was alright.  It was my first job so I considered the pay to be good. Once my school started I spoke with MANY MANAGERS, about a schedule change and the amount of days I can take off. My schedule was changed once and the rest seemed to be ignored. I was fired for attendance as well.  I was told by like I said MANY MANAGERS that I could miss 9 days. I missed 8 and was fired for attendance."
bad,It's always good to met new people get to learn about them what they new or what you can learn from them. the hardest park of my job when I have to working  buy myself every Sunday which is a busy day..
bad,"The job itself wasn't the problem. Unload pallets, stock shelves that kind of stuff. The pay was fair and they had decent benefits. It came to the point where I just couldn't deal with it anymore. I had to get all the pallets done every night, label overstock, stock eggs and milk, and have it zoned by the time I left. I hardly had any help with the job, and when I couldn't keep up, they threatened to fire me. Management was rude and disrespectful to the employees and customers alike."
bad,"When i first started at walmart, it was an amazing place to work. I had come from working fast food and one thing I learned working fast food was it was fast paced and stressful with less pay. Walmart can be a great place to work. However, management makes it very difficult to enjoy your job. You make a decent amount when compared to other jobs but sometimes the stress management puts on you is not worth the pay. The morale at my store is terrible because alot of people are overworked and not getting the hours they deserve. Walmart likes to cut corners. I work as a maintenance associate and they like to use us to do alot of things that are out of our job discription because they dont want to hire people to do that specific job. Typically, we end up having to do our maintenance duties as well as other jobs such as stocking a particular department or helping in the backroom etc... Work orders for equipment as well as basic equipment we need to clean the store are limited, leaving us to sometimes have to adapt and find a way to get certain job duties accomplished. In my opinion, this is a good job to have if you're looking for easy money, but if you're looking to advance here at walmart, i would look to advance at another company that actually cares about their employees because walmart does not."
bad,I was training other associates within a short time of me being hired.  I would work in departments that I was not hired for. I did not have much direction during my time there
bad,"Walmart only needs people that will devote their whole life to them. They are a very greedy company and they do not care about their employees nor their families. They just want you there, doing a very routine job, and then leaving."
bad,I don't like the 4 AM start time however I am fine with the physical demands and like most of my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is having to pick up the slack for other associates who don't pull their own weight.
bad,Respeito ao individuo enquanto pretencente ao grupo Walmart
bad,worked in maintenance dept odd jobs and such four day work week no over time good pay hourly wage good benefit package with 401 k plan and medical plan
bad,"I've been working at Walmart for almost three years, vie been wanting to move my job inside but they have denied me career advancement because my position has a hard time finding others to fill it. I feel it is time to move on to a new company where I can advance with them and grow as a person."
bad,needs better management they dont recognize the talent or put great talent were it needs to be place they dont work with ppl who have familys they dont acccept doctors notes
bad,The company is obsessed with making a buck on the backs of their constantly understaffed employees. Micro-management of stores from corporate headquarters in Arkansas.
bad,"Walmart was a good job starting out. When it came to moving up and getting raises, management would not let us go do the things we had to do on the computer.  Other than that, it was a good job."
bad,"Enjoyed the people I worked with at Walmart, however my salaried manager was inconsistent and ungrateful to my abilities, the staff there agree that my direct supervisor was against me due to other managers wanted me to work their departments due to my success, my direct manger declined my transfers and advancement because she felt that since she had been there for years before me she was entitled to the position."
bad,"A typical work day will consist of you at your area, unless a manager feels they need else where, so they will simply pluck you out and take you to another area to do something yu might be unfamiliar with."
bad,"Walmart has poor management not only for associates but for managers as well. Not a place I would recommend working in. They don’t allow overtime anymore so they had to cut everyone’s hours, also when you have a problem and you go to the store manager; nothing was never done."
bad,"Go in at nights, unload trucks sometimes, pull freight out to floor and stock shelves in a predetermined about of time. I've learned that it is hard for me to work in a negative  environment. "
bad,"Walmart is a hostile and very cold place where employee retention is not a goal, but an obstacle the management has to try and work around. In the almost year I had worked there I had seen entire teams be let go and not given new positions even though they had restructured the store to require less employees."
bad,Walmart is always hiring and there are opportunities for advancement.  I feel the pay structure needs to be revamped.  A strong customer service culture is sorely needed but is lacking.
bad,"good relax working environment,  good employees that are fun to work with. hardest part of the job is limited advancement in ones career. getting to know people  was enjoyable."
bad,"Salary's not great, management doesn't know what one hand is doing from the other, no hope for promotions unless you sucker a lot of people into buying the walmart master card."
bad,"It’s a good place to work if you need a job, but not to stay for a long amount of time."
bad,"Walmart is an awesome place to gain knowledge in the field. However, not exactly the greatest place to consider for retirement.  Lots of mess, no job security, even for hard workers."
bad,The way they treat their employees is shameful. In the time I was there I saw them fire a 15-year veteran from the service department for attending a funeral without permission. I am honestly surprised that Walmart hasn't been sued more for the way they treat their employees and the disgraceful manner the so-called management runs things.
bad,"After 2.5 years of exemplary work as a Stockman, I wasn't able to move inside. Instead, they chose a guy with 4 months of experience. Was never given a good reason for why I wasn't moved inside."
bad,"This job is really fast paced. There’s a lot of moving, bending, and pulling. You may sometimes have quite a few tasks per shifts. You get an hour vacation time per 12 hours you work."
bad,"The actual job was easy enough but the management made doing the job at a good pace difficult. Got forced ""scheduled-in"" on days normally scheduled off."
bad,"You are judged by how many hours you work rather than the quality of work you do. Layoffs are common and do not target low performers, rather sometimes target high performers. The pyramid of jobs is very flat, therefore vertical mobility past a certain point is nearly impossible."
bad,It was a good job to start off at. My work day start off with rounding up all the carts and ended with rounding up all the carts so know real different
bad,"If you do not work close to management you will be relatively okay. Just get in, do your job, and get out. Not the type of ""career"" you want unless your retired."
bad,"Most jobs require heavy lifting 10 to 12 hrs per day.  15 and 20 minute break for 10 hrs, added 30 minute unpaid lunch break for 12hrs. Moral is sub par."
bad,"Upper management has been driving away good managers and good people through unrealistic production demands.  Managers constantly trying counterproductive new ideas in an effort to improve production.  For every one change that makes things better, there are five to ten changes for the worse that are usually abandoned after enough people quit, get fired or get hurt."
bad,"I worked at Walmart for about 6 months. I worked as a cashier, and I loved my job. But my entire job was ruined by my assistant manager. I’m currently going to school, and it took me 4 times to get them to cut down my hours so I could focus on school. If you want to work at Walmart, just remember that they don’t really care about anything except you working tons of hours."
bad,You work most of time but yourself throwing trucks and working freight taking care of consumer's after that done you work other departments I'll it's time to go home
bad,"Walmart by far is the worst place ive ever worked, and i spent 12 hours working at a corndog stand on a farm, SO I THINK I KNOW WHAT BAD IS WHEN I SEE IT."
bad,The typical day you will be doing the job of at least 3 people including yourself.  The managers never fully staff any positions.  They like to call anyone and everyone from their scheduled tasks for backup cashier or backup cart pusher or even to work in another department. I was even called to help unload a truck when I was supposed to be doing my task.
bad,"Poor management, untrustworthy, very physical and fast paced. Cameras watching your every move and would get wrote up for anything and everything. Once you top out in pay and benefits they try to push you out the door to bring in cheaper help"
bad,The Walmart I work at has an excellent store manger but our customer service managers are underpaid and unqualified. Breaks are sometimes never given or are most of the time late. Managers are disrespectful towards employees and sometimes customers.
bad,"Some market teams are better than others, unfortunately I was not in a good one. Any issues that may have occurred in the time of working there were not resolved professionally. I have worked there for the ten years and wanted to move up with the company but was held back from my store manager for selfish reasoning. (He told me I was the best one he’s got and he can’t take the loss)"
bad,"Every one of Walmart's thousands of stores operates differently based on their management team.  In every store I worked at, the hourly associate base (hundreds of employess) were either uplifted or downtrodden by their management team.  At my most recent store, the new Store Manager was positive and hardworking but allowed his Assistant Manager team to be lazy and inefficient, and this reflected directly upon the morale and work ethic of the rest of the associates.  Furthermore, as the Assistant Manager on the overnight shift, it constantly fell to me and my team to fix those Assistant Managers' mistakes."
bad,Walmart has changed over the years. It is no longer about the associates to get the dollars. . It is now only about the dollars.  It has gone from a company everyone liked to work at to one everyone is wondering when there job will be eliminated.
bad,Working for Wal-Mart is not hard but it's the management that make the job harder than it needs to be. Not a place I would suggest to anyone for a long period of time
bad,"I feel its a great place to work if you are a cashier, they make $11 an hour starting out, which the rate you start at is pretty much the rate you stay at, you only get a 2% raise if you qualify a yr. which means it does not matter how good or bad of a performer you are, everyone gets the same raise, which stinks, if you are hard working, dedicated employee.  Great if you are not.  The job is very fast paced and requires a lot of moving and lifting and multiple tasks.  Their is never enough help and tons of call ins that require constant helping of other departments and areas, which always seems to leave your own area abandoned.  There is never enough time or help to do what is actually required of the department managers.  We have too many  meetings that take our time up and  we are always pulled away from our own areas to help in other areas they feel are more important.  I feel like I cant do a good job because I'm not given the time or the people  or the programs in our tools that work fast enough or efficiently to get the jobs done in a timely manner.  I love the job but just don't feel like my hard work and dedication gets any recognition or more pay.  The upper management seems to play favoritism and only certain areas and managers seem to get the help they need or the credit they deserve.  Nothing is hard at the job it is just takes so much time to do most tasks and management does not seem to acknowledge or understand that for some reason.  They seem to be out of touch with the facts.  Customers are suppose to come first, but they come last as there is never enough"
bad,I enjoy the work I do every day but there are plenty of areas that need improving with management and cap team 2. Certain managers want things done their way but when another manager is around they switch the process. We have employees that hide in the bathroom during their shift and nothing is done about it. One of these individuals received the Employee of the month award the same week they got in trouble for not working.
bad,"management were not understanding, messed up on all employee schedule for about month, assistant department manger complain about his/her position since they where given the position. made it uncomfortable to work."
bad,"This is a company where management looks y out for themselves. There are too few good leaders and too many bad ones. Everyone looks out for themselves only. Management often works against the associates and are too willing to put the blame on someone else. They expect your 105% at all times and ofter 10x more punishment than reward. If you make the mistake of joining the Cap 2 Team expect to work until you are miserable either bc of the monotony, tedium, strain, or from unrealistic standards. The rules change almost weekly, and different managers often contradict each other."
bad,Need more customer serving managers. Most of them just sit and in the office and refuse to work or solve daily staffing problems. It pays good but its too stressful you hit the floor running everyday trying to cover the gaps with no help from the store.
bad,"The associates are great. They always make the day better. Management on the other hand are disrespectful. They treat and talk to you poorly. The pay is awful, so is scheduling. Walmart can never keep their associates which is why they are constantly hiring people. The other only good thing about working at Walmart is the hour lunch they give us."
bad,"If you are not very close to mangers or popular coworkers, they can make you an outcast and bully you. The management team can be very unprofessional and can overlook policies and rules for their friends who work in the company. They also put heavy work loads on the hard workers if they know that no one else will do the work without proper gratitude or equal work distribution."
bad,"A typical day is high paced and many different directions at once. At times, the direction is changed on the same thing 3 to 4 times."
bad,"A typical work day includes doing things that are not in your job description"
bad,Overworked underpaid. Management was horrible. Will not work there ever again. I never received my raise but was expected to do department managers job
bad,"Good comany to work for, but hard store location and managment to work for."
bad,it had its ups and downs money was poor and you could be layed off at any time job security was very bad.and they would almost make stuff up to fire you
bad,"In a university town, jobs that can accommodate a class schedule are a hot commodity. Ones that pay more than $9 are rare and only occasionally open. Walmart has a starting wage of $11, and a turnover of over 50%, so it's fairly easy to see there's something amiss. Retail is a special environment, and not everybody can handle it."
bad,"Typical day at work; consisted of customer service 100% of the day. Had to meet every managers expectations at the cost of your own work. I learned to be very versatile and adaptable to change. The hardest part of the job was being so short staffed that we had to cover other areas of the store, at the expense of your own job duties. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with other happy people, who understand what its like to work so hard for a corporation."
bad,"The work is not difficult. While there will always be dissatisfied customers in retail, the real negative aspect at Walmart for this individual was management. There is a severe lack of respect in communication between management and the associates. Associates were preoccupied with others actions rather than completing their work so the whole was not punished by management for one individual's failings. Management pushed unrealistic expectations on associates and punished accordingly when the expectations were not met. When problems were brought to management for discussion associates were talked down as if the error was solely our part and associates needed to try harder. "
bad,I am rating the one on hope mills road. Other stores may have better management and look out for their employees this one did not. There wasn’t enough communication between higher management and lower management.
bad,"Training to be an assistant manager was great; however, when you actually got back to your store, it doesn't work the way they tell you in training.  A manager is pretty much on their own.  The front end manager position actually needs two due to the heavy cash office work and scheduling; as well as coaching opportunities."
bad,"The work environment was friendly, and the immediate management was always helpful to both employee and customer needs. The overall policies of the company at large lead to poor morale for workers closer to the bottom line."
bad,Management is horrible. They do not show concern about employees just about getting the job done! Best part of job was going home. No benefits because you are considered part time but work 40hrs. Only can start on 3rd shift. After one year they may consider you for day shift but then it will be part time hours.
bad,"Management will promise you the world, they will never give it to you."
bad,Walmart offers plenty of room for advancement I worked my way up from a cashier to a salaried manager.  However once you hit the salaried level you are expected to work an unlimited number of hours.  The starting salary for assistant store manager is good however if you take into account the number of hours worked its not worth it.  If you have a family and enjoy seeing them this position isn't for you however if your single no family and want to climb the ladder quickly then this position will offer your that opportunity.
bad,Place was amess. Sherry was a horrible manager and started a lot of work place drama. The bakery and deli were never cleaned right at night and left a mess in the morning because of poor management.
bad,"Bad place to work, bad management poor working conditions,bad pay not organized at all, too many chiefs not enough Indians,overall a bad place to work due to the way management treats you on a daily basis"
bad,"As I am unable to write what I wish to in this review because of this being public; I will answer these questions as simple as possible. "
bad,A good place to gain customer service experience. Poor management and no work/life balance. Very stressful when working in management. Pay is poor compared to the amount of work you have to do. Very high-turnover rates. Hard to get time off even though you earn it. Drastic schedule change happens very often and lack of coverage due to cut back on wages.
bad,"Great people , everyone very sweet and helpful great customer service i don’t know i  just love everything and everyone . Walmart is a great place to at"
bad,If you are a really hard worker and your job skills are based around heavy lifting and fast paced then DON’T work here if your lazy and are satisfied with bad work ethic then best place for you .
bad,"No matter how hard you work, it is never enough. The people that work the hardest get treated poorly. The ones that do, nothing get treated like gold."
bad,"Managers were never there. When they were they were not organized were expected to be in one place all day long"
bad,the management team will take advantage of you inorder for them too look good and they do not care about you at all! you clock in the morning and you will be told wkhat your job is for the day and then you get the necessary equipment of you will need to your job. they try to get most work out of you and a lot of times it is very unrealistic. i would not work here ever again
bad,"Its sort of a dead-end job. Pay (for most positions here) is low. Loss prevention pay is slightly below average. Benefits are lousy! Employee discount was O.K. but be careful using it as Walmart monitors your shopping selections and purchasing habits then shots you an email (usually around payday) ""encouraging"" you to shop/buy more or chastising you for not buying enough. Nevertheless, there were a lot of cool people working here, and that made my time here fun/pleasant and, at times, even memorable."
bad,I did not enjoy it there as s manager and it wasn’t the job it was the store managers and the assistant managers. You tell them you need something and they let you tread water until you make a seen
bad,"If you don't mind working in extremely hot and cold environments, working in a fast paced environment and working 50 plus hours a week, this would be a good job for you."
bad,"I did not like it at Walmart, they do NOT care about their ""associates"" at all. The only management that was awesome were the CSM's ! I would recommend this job to my worst enemy, but not my bestfriend."
bad,I learned how to work alone and not depend on anyone to do their jobs.  in my personal experience it was not a good one. the work was reliable and had a stable schedule
bad,"I work with the company for more than 15 years and had a good time. I have experience a lot in working in the company,   until the last few years when the company started changing it's strategy and try to compete with Amazon on line. I was terminated from my position as accounting associate because my position was eliminated by the recycler (atm) machine and store is converted to self check out registers. Walmart innovation is totally changing and eliminating a lot of positions in the store."
bad,"It is a typical large retail company but it did not feel as fun and friendly as others that I have worked for.  High expectations that often feel unrealistic.  No set schedules and little consideration for when you got off the night before versus when you have to be in the next day.  Once you have worked for them for several years things do seem to improve as far schedules and benefits, but the first year or two can be very hard.  It often felt like no matter how hard I tried it wasn't good enough.  Often out of stock on popular items or common sizes of clothes which frequently irritated customers."
bad,"They schedule you an 38 hours so they don't have to give full time benifits, but is a good job for the time been. It is a flexible work environment with a  friendly and open atmosphere."
bad,"You bust your butt just to get crapped on. The phrase “fair and consistent“ gets thrown around often without that actually being the case. Yes everyone is different so you might have to do some different things for different people. But up holding rules and policy per person is different. No one is held accountable for their actions. It’s all a joke. The younger, prettier and skinnier you are the more likely you are to get your way."
bad,"At the surface level everything seems fine, but did just a little and you see a culture of managers forcing associates to overwork, and are very much penny-pinching style."
bad,Walmart has a point system. After 4 points you are no longer employed there. No matter if you are sick or in the hospital you will get fired because of their point system. Employees are reminded daily how replaceable they are.
bad,"the dc""s management is horrible, the pit the workers against each other. the give the same time to drive 10 yards as the whole length of the building.   they also want you to get the same production per hour no matter the size of the freight. completely unrealistic in a real world setting,and if you try to turn in a manager for a infraction the tell you that the will be allowed to investigate themselves."
bad,I would have loved the experience more if it had had better management. I liked the stock option. I hated not being able to go home after my department was finished and having to clock out at end of shift but remain working to help other departments finish their tasks. I hated not being able to take regular breaks. I could go on but this gives a good picture of the working conditions at Walmart.
bad,A typical day at Walmart is busy. There's a lot of opportunities that's available. I learned how to manage and train. I love training new associates that's willing to learn. The workplace culture is mostly Hispanic and it caters to Hispanics because of the area it's located in. The hardest part of the job is coaching for production. I feel that everyone should pull their own weight. The most enjoyable part about working at Walmart is the customers. Making the customers happy by stocking the home everyday so that the  product is always available. Customers first always.
bad,"Sadly watched the company-wide morale decline significantly over the last 10 years. Great salary and compensation, but little work/life balance. No longer a viable long term employment option. Still really good people that work there, and have significant relationships that I will cary with me to any subsequent workplaces."
bad,Structural/operational changes make future career advancements uncertain. Hours/shifts fluctuate widely compared to my initial 15 years with the company.
bad,I just didn't like the way they fired me and I feel as though if I had taken them to court I would have won. but I didn't because they have a team of advicers
bad,The culture depends on the store.  It is a good company to get management experience from but very little work life balance.  Be prepared to work 12 hour days if in management.
bad,"Working at walmart was unorganized to begin with. You are given 3 days to complete company training modules and if you dont finish or are unsure about anything, there is no further instruction. Environment is depressing. Managers are unprofessional and do not follow their own guidelines. Pay was competitive, but not worth it when all things are considered."
bad,Depending on the position every day was the same. The environment was stressful and chaotic even on a slow day. Management team was inconsistent with decision making and hard to find at times. Learned good customer service skills and some management skills while working their. The associates themselves and the benefits were the highlights of working there.
bad,i like the people and the hands-on work but the pay so pure and manager aren't that nice they have a mask on for a month or two and the training is all on the computer
bad,The management there no that great at all very unprofessional and I hate to give this job a bad review but I would hate to lie I'd rather speak the truth.
bad,"Different changes, only to the extent of using the staffing available."
bad,I didn't care for managers. They were an okay company to work for. They could do a lot better as far as respect for associates and following protocol.
bad,The request more than what's reasonable from an associate. They call you in to work when you're off. The expect you to give your life to the company. As an associate you will work 2-3 times harder than the Salaried Managers.
bad,"They say its teamwork,  but its the fact that you just get to know what you are doing when they switch you somewhere else, that I believe cuts productivity.  you may come in tomorrow and find your manager has been switched to another department,  and no one knows who to ask for a day off."
bad,"they show favoritism and they are not fair ...there is a lot of racist there ..and certain people get away with some bad stuff.... they have nasty attitudes and they cuss at you !!! they have no compassion ... and they treat you  and talk to you like your stupid...they give you tasks that you physically can't do then they say we will have to let you go !!! one lady who was on SSD she could only work a few hours a week she was limited as to what she could do physically so she was a greeter  ..the manager told her to open her availability to more hours and more places in the store and she explained her situation and the manger told her well then i have to let you go!!"
bad,"Amazing coworkers, rude and demanding management. They have zero sympathy for the strenuous and neverending workload and constantly expect more and more from you and all your coworkers. That in turn, created an extremely stressful and unhappy environment."
bad,"Walmart's management put more focus on retaining numbers than hiring long term workers. Though some individuals remained in a position for an extended period of time, many times they had little to no advancement, and miniscule pay raise to compensate loyalty. Individuals with high work ethic and consistency were not rewarded, but individuals failing to meet quotas were only minorly punished, and their extra work inevitably foisted onto another team member that was more capable."
bad,Working for Walmart is very stressful and at times lacks in proper leadership. Very casual atmosphere. Unprofessional and no accountability held for work not done.
bad,The job is not hard its the management team! You meet different people each and every day and some are very nice and respectful. Working with the public is a task by itself.
bad,They really know how to tak to their employees or give them repect. They will harass you they will flat out lie and the favouritism is rediculs. They will try to treat you like a child. What you do is never enough
bad,"The work enviornment is okay. The management wasn't horrible if you're having a good day, but sometimes if you were coming in and your day was already horrible, they made it worst. So for example, if you were having a bad day already don't go to management because they weren't doing their job. That's just in my opinion, but sometimes I don't feel like some people need to be a manager, just simply because if you can't do your job step down and let someone else worthy do it, don't just hand the problem to another ""higher up"" management who still won't solve the initial problem. That's why I left, not because I'm stupid, etc. But because you should let business be business, and that job was too stressful, so here I am online! (: Hope this helps Walmart, it's not you, it's not even me, just fix some of the management."
bad,Only if desperate would I recommend working here. The pay is good for teens or young adults but not for supporting a family. Career advancement was there but there were very few available most of the time. Overall I wouldn't recommend trying to provide for a family on this job alone.
bad,"I was hospitalized for two weeks and I told them afterwards.  I was let go for not appearing at work.   I told them I was in the hospital, but they would not hire me back."
bad,"Managers are never around. They will tell you how to do things when they havent done them and when you explain common sense things they get mad and find more tasks for you that they are supposed to do. Almost no one on the team and the supervisers go smoke, talk to other managers or, find the easiest job and stay there all day even with 1 person working a department that needs at least 3 people then they tell you to just work faster and then they walk to the back to talk."
bad,"I had a lot of bad managers, but some good ones. They usually always have favorites, and if you aren't easily liked then you always end up having to do what no one wants to do. They don't care about you when you're stressed. Working at Walmart might have been better if I wasnt a cashier, everyone other than the cashiers always seemed so much more calm."
bad,"For my position at Walmart, I am asked to do multiple things throughout the shift due to a severe lack of employees. The customers is very difficult to work with at times, the co-workers can be lazy and try to slack off as much, and the managers is typically angry and not very well liked, especially the co-managers at the store I work at. In fact, just this moment when I wanted to talk to the Personnel Manager to confirm my leave from the company, the Co-Manager answered my question with an angry tone. It is hard to be happy working on the retail level of Walmart. So many things goes wrong, not enough goes right, and the pay is not worth the headache."
bad,"Typical workday has me constantly moving for the full 8 hours of work.  Most days I end up skipping my last 15 minute break without compensation for the time.  Given tasks outside of my job description including but not limited to training new hires where supervisors or managers are required to train them in order to ensure they follow procedures and tasks assigned.  Process through break packs, boxes that contain a mixture of products from various departments, ensuring that they get split into their corresponding department locations and make their way to the proper area to be worked.  Unload a truck daily making sure that products are split onto pallets that will make it to the corresponding department.  Stock freight onto the shelves while maintaining a visual accuaty to our surroundings so we can assist customers in finding products.  Pull pallets weighing up to 2000 pounds out to the sales floor using a pallet jack.  Pulling the back room of pallets to their corresponding departments to be worked by coworkers."
bad,"Productive work flow unloaded truck trailers and placing merchandise on pallets. Poor compensation. Food was catered often which was a nice gesture. Poor communication between departments management and associates. Huge building, customers are mostly trash. Too many associates. Hardest part of job was working swing shift. Had fun with the people I worked with."
bad,In the field I was in there was no in rule and to put my Optician Licence in Jepordy was not worth working for. Would never work or recommend anybody else to work for them.
bad,"Job overall is fine and was for quite sometime, I came in pick carts were ready and I filled up everything and zoned then took care of claims."
bad,A formerly great company that entirely changed into a rigid corporate structure. All family value is completely gone and this regime is cut throat. Sad.
bad,"A very disturbing company to work for; not common sense or organization in regards to operations or handling of stocking of freight. Everything is crammed into the daytime, which makes it extremely difficult to stock while trying to navigate around customer traffic. Hours are constantly cut for employees. I left at the right time..."
bad,If your not like by your managment than your not going to make it at walmart. If your liked by the managment than youll be fine. There is alot of favoritism
bad,"Could be an easy and fun job if it weren't for incompetent managers. Always poor coverage and they promote based on favoritism, not hard work. Poor management leads to the hourly associates doing work that is definitely not their job. (However, if you want to move up its a great way to get experience if you want a career with Walmart)."
bad,Always busy and hectic but made lifelong friends. While it isn't the best place to work because the pay is low it was a nice place to work for the people.
bad,"Walmart jobs aren't usually too stressful by themselves, its just that you're expected to do the job of at least five other departments at any given time.  It isn't too bad when just one other department needs help (but they don't actually train you on what you're supposed to do in any department), but it is pretty stressful when you're the only associate in half the store, and multiple departments need help at the same time."
bad,"management  shows alot of favoritism, no place for advancement. this company has a high turn over due to lack of management. attendance policy is not great and the benefits not great for the accomplishment that the associates does."
bad,Horrible management who grout there way to make your job hard. Changes schedules without asking and expect you to jump at whatever time they give you. Allows customers to mistreat staff
bad,Need to have friendly manger.. work unfriendly people to work with  need people to not get in people business or stay to them self at work not a family work place
bad,Almost all member of management including the store manager had a bad attitude. Most of them show their manner as the highest person on earth so they will ignore a person or customer to follow the 10 foot rule.
bad,I have great co workers. I have managers that will listen to you and your concerns. Walmart has a starting pay of 11 dollars per hour but they don't give you enough hours to earn a decent living.  This place is for someone living at home with their parents. If you have bills and rent to pay then this is not the place to work.
bad,"Enjoyed the start at Walmart but, was having problems with associates because where I live and what I drove and my over all work habits. False Allegations was always looked in to never the truth."
bad,"I found that the higher I got up int he company, the more they expected me to dedicate my life to the company.  I found that I had no work life balance, and while the salary, on paper looks great when breaking it down by how many hours I was actually working, it was a joke. To me, time with my family was more important so after two years of being a co-manager I decided to leave the company to pursue other opportunities."
bad,I was to stock home good though no one could agree on if I was to help unstock items on pallets or leave them alone. No I was also told that I needed to be faster at my job on my second day.
bad,at wal mart i learned to greet people and do customer service while doing my job as a sales associate. i often helped with other departments besides mine. i often handled keys for other sales associates while they were on break to handle change rooms.
bad,"Cook and prep food at the deli ."
bad,"Management very demanding, Over work and under paid. Not appreciated for the amount of work done and always expects more. Coworkers are friendly. No more to add."
bad,I did not enjoy my time i was just there to get a paycheck. The customers were rude a lot and there were never enough people working with me to actually run properly. They cared more about saving money then being fully staffed.
bad,"It was fun and great at first. Everything was amazing, the work, the customers, just everything. Then my department manager just treated her employees poorly. To be honest she talked smack about everybody who worked in electronics about how no one knows how to do their job even if you’re doing your very best."
bad,fast pace. Everything is micromanaged and timed to the second. never know how long your day will be. they can keep you there for up to 16 hours(happens often) and some of the guys i worked with live a hour away so they end up getting two or three hours of sleep and have to come back and do it again. this is very DANGEROUS! If they want to keep us there for that long on consecutive days they should offer a place to sleep.
bad,"Working at Walmart is a soul-crushing experience"
bad,The store manager don’t care about her associate and the automotive mangers is a jerk and a  socialpath. Thy need new management and care more about people
bad,I won't advice considering Walmart for a long term career choice. Its only bearable as a temporary job. The management have no idea what they're doing and the associates are overworked and underpaid.
bad,"After working here for 2 years I was lucky enough to work with a few good managers. However, as for most of the members of management, they could get more involved in helping hourly supervisors correct the improper behavior of employees."
bad,"Management had a lot of expectations for our staff but not"
bad,Very little to no communication. There is a sharp divide between management and hourly. Hiring promises for fulltime and benefits not followed through. Answers and problem solving between personnel are not congruent.
bad,"Each year of employment in this company has only shown me the greed at higher levels. Associates are constantly thinned out, and work loads on those who are kept are constantly rising. An example would be me working over my three departments, and only having two associates per week. I have six hours of my shift by myself, and I cover two register areas as well as having to deal with incomplete freight, bin scans, outs scans, orders, audits, etc. It is a weekly event to be berated by management for not being done on time when we do not have the personnel to complete the task in a reasonable manner."
bad,"Typical day at work: "
bad,"company turned against the vertan employees who are the backbone of each stores operations.  They bring in new management crews whose jobs seemingly is to eliminate the jobs of experienced and professional employees, in order to make way for new employees of limited or no experience, and also with no chance of gaining benefit packages unlike that of the veteran employees who have well over a decade or more of service to the company.  In fact, in many locations senior management is very hostile towards those who are able to carry the loads of several junior employees.  This in turn has made the environment of morale in stores very foreboding and noncondusive to proper networking and utilization of all the necessary skill levels to achieve daily satisfactory sales objectives."
bad,"This specific job is more based as a warehouse job. You are constantly on a time crunch and must have orders and picks finished on a timely manner. This however would be no problem if management ran it accordingly or if the proper amount of people were given for the job. Long hours, expected to stay from 5 or 6am to late into evening, you stay till picks are done. Then you are expected to cut overtime instead of being paid for it. Some schedules you will work 7 or 8 days in a row. Know your rights as an employee as management will try to tell you otherwise how things are done. Especially when it comes to full time be aware how to be awarded benefits. The stress and pay are not worth it for the job at hand."
bad,"N/A There is guaranteed employment, just whats available at the time. Poor management, lack of proper training, lack of proper equipment  necessary to do the job correctly. Communication problems between staff and management, etc. etc."
bad,"I would come in and get my till and count my drawer, then I would organize my area and keep it clean. I would ring the customers as they came through my line."
bad,"Walmart is great for you if you want high stress, your job constantly threatened, and no work life benefits in exchange for decent pay. You can put it twenty hard years to be forced to retire when your job suddenly doesn’t exist."
bad,Walmart was not a great experience for me. Maybe it just was the work environment. I really would never go back to work for any Walmart ever. But that's just my opinion.
bad,"There is too much drama, and no one was there to work they all wanted to start something with some one, csms got attitudes when you would ask for help, and they tend to ignore you needing their help"
bad,"I had worked for them for over 15 years. It got worse each year. Too many chiefs....too much favoritism. Not enough communication. They show little regard for the customer or the employee. "
bad,"I feel that Walmart has begun prioritizing profit for the company over their employees. They are emphasizing self-check machines over cashiers and their new automatic scheduling system usually ends with giving employees less hours than better ones. Most stores now are large and constantly changing, and the customers do not always make life easy on you. Most stores are trying their best to adjust to newer changes in their management requirements, but this does not always work out."
bad,The Associates at Walmart are great there are specific managers that are extremely lousy and that is why I left they like to play mental games and it is a undesirable work environment with those particular managers on the floor other managers are great but there are specifics managers completely lousy I wouldn't work under them again or any amount of money
bad,"the job is trash, the managers are idiots and have anger issues, the pay was bad, working there was a pain and these reviews are killing me its a waste of time"
bad,"Walmart has plenty of opportunities to advance your career. However, for me it came at the price of extremely long hours, no set schedule, constant overnight shifts to complete special projects, and (from my perspective) frequently poor leadership above me."
bad,"I did not like working at Walmart. My managers weren’t very helpful, and most of the people I worked with were very rude and competitive. I barley got any hours."
bad,I enjoy working with the people and the customers but management It is always so confusing. I have a good schedule but sometimes there’s a lot of other work that we are expected to do and the pay is not really good for this area
bad,Management does not care if you possibly have a really bad health condition and you are not supposed to work. You get 2 paid 15 minute breaks. 30-60 minute meal break depending on how long your shift is. Some areas of the store do not get fair pay for how much work they have to do.
bad,"Heavily timed oriented but without the people necessary to complete the task on time. 2% of current pay, raise every year not even enough to pay for cost of living increase. Bad management choices and choices of management."
bad,i felt working at working increase my customer service skills. i enjoyed my co workers but the management was unfair to the employees needs   i just wish i had one set schedule.  My attendance was excellent.  Enjoyed going to work for the most part
bad,"I recently transferred to one of the Jacksonville stores at the beginning of August.  Here it is at the end of August and Walmart has already started sucking the life out of me.  No one smiles, If you're lucky you MIGHT get a grunt out of someone when you say good morning, the associates are annoyed when a customer asks for assistance.  Management doesn't follow the Walmart's 'one best way' so that things are consistent through out the store.  And I was sickened watching the store manager and co-manager throw out thousands and thousands of dollars worth of meat.  All cuts - chicken, beef, pork, sea food.  filled up 4 large trash cans."
bad,"Really fast paced and customer oriented and deadline driven."
bad,"If you like being treated poorly and required to take abuse of customers, then this is the place for you."
bad,"WalMart is not a great company to work for if you are looking for a place to make a career this is definitely a summer vacation, High School teen part-time job kind of a place"
bad,"I greet the customer, help customer checking out at self checkout register, keeping the merchandise stocked,and keeping  area clean. keeping customer happy."
bad,Overall work week is well due to the many different shifts and the numerous amounts of employees. The work is very laid back and is tailored to your own needs and wants.
bad,In order to get hours you have to plead with management for them. The job itself is a fun work environment. Management just needs more training on their job.
bad,"Poorly managed for a Walmart store. Earning is based on the power of Canadian Currency at this location. Good working culture that promotes a family like environment however Mismanaged, lack of communication between management, lack of accountability, ""pass the buck"" culture, and no real advancement opportunities since it is a small community and they have been filled by the same people for many years."
bad,"The culture is very bad, management largely makes decisions based on whether they like you or not. The only good thing I can say is they offered the most hours I've ever received for a part time position. They treat vendors even worse than associates."
bad,"Walmart was a good open place to learn alot about the company. Doing your job well like a real mature positive retail employee. I've been having my integrity self with Walmart since day 1 I follow through well mostly with their policy but here was my main issue the lack of giving notice communication from the managers. Not a lot care enough to help out or are good with scheduling days with a two way street communication they seem to care more about their own lives and job descriptions on self.. My best advice if you plan to work here work at job that you know you can maintain well for a long period of time instead of taking the risk for something. The Employees there are friendly, nice, and decent but the customers that come in you'll find are eagerly stubborn especially when they are in a hurry , they are close minded, and some express their hate toward Walmart by littering a lot of trash or looking for sueing."
bad,"Store manager was horrible, did not treat employees well. Was retaliating because their prior partner was fired and had to move back home. Overall didn’t quite Walmart. Quit the lack of a manager assigned to store."
bad,"J'ai travailler 8 ans avec le même patron, sa allais bien, et ensuite il y à eu les changements internes qui ne m'ont pas plu du tout, finir plus tard, courir d'un bord et l'autre du magasin car les associés de l'air de vente doivent être partout, mais pas assez d'employer sur le plancher ( en moyenne 3) pour tout couvrir cette grande surface."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart, stressful"
bad,Assist customers with any needs in the electronic area of the store. Clean & maintain a safe working environment.  Be the first line of defense against theft.
bad,"Walmart does not provide a helping or happy environment to work in. Favoritism plays a major role in day to day operations. Lack of training for new employees of new skills necessary for carrying out daily tasks. Lack of communications between management, always on different pages.Good starter job, wouldn't recommend staying with the company for longer than 2 years due to lack of career advancement."
bad,"Il y a quelques années, les associés étaient importants pour la compagnie et la direction, maintenant, ce sont les profits qui comptent, point. Les associés sont des numéros. Ils ont tellement coupé de postes et d'heures, que maintenant le bateau coule..."
bad,"My experience with Wal-Mart. Lets put it this way. I was a produce stocker moving upwards of 15,000 pounds of product everyday. The work is not difficult it's labor intensive and for me, I don't mind that. What I mind is that it's me and one other co-worker trying to process 15,000 lbs. of freight in the 4 hours that they want it done. It's not even humanly possible to scan label and organize a massive cooler that your night staff destroys everyday. On top of that you have to stock a near empty floor. Wal-Mart is severely understaffed and my store manager didn't understand that more people usually means more work can be done in a shorter amount of time. Really all the management is like that. You try to communicate to come up with a solution so you don't run into the same problem anymore and they say ""OK."" Walk away and absolutely nothing changes. In my opinion its a great high school job or right out of high school. Other than that if you have the capacity and work ethic to move forward defiantly leave Wal-Mart. There is a small possibility to make Wal-Mart a career but in my opinion you will get short change and used and get pawned off to the next individual that just follows mindless orders and doesn't want to fix problems. For Wal-Mart was temporary and will never be anything more. The benefits and pay could be way better. Especially with the sheer size and economic strong hold Wal-Mart has. Just remember its not about the employee or the ""customer"" it's about the guy in charge and the surplus of millions they make. I'm not saying the bottom of the totem poll worker should"
bad,Walmart was making me work three jobs and stressing me out and weren’t nice to me. They expected too much from their employees when you showed you work hard!
bad,If you have a personal relationship with those in management positions there is a lot of room for growth. The part f the job i liked the least was being in the freezer for 3 hrs a day and having to maintain my position while doing tasks of other positions.
bad,Overnight manager is very stressful. Most nights I don't get breaks or meals. Most mornings I'm still there at least 2 hours after my scheduled time to leave the store. I enjoy my associates and customers but the job is more negative than positive.
bad,"This division of Walmart could use some work, it might work in other states but Texas is a big HEB food store and a lot of people that walk in are a little upset it isn't a regular Walmart. In my time there I moved up quickly because the supervisor I had had left the location. Upon hiring me into the supervisor role I was very disappointed in the lack of training for that role. I learned what I needed to do by falling behind on what needed to be done then that portion of the job explained afterwards. I left because of the lack of training and I did not see the store doing very well, and in fact it was such a slow location it has been closed down."
bad,It was an experience that was sometimes overwhelming with the climate conditions.It was a very fast pace day to day and when you finish your numbers or goal you could go home.
bad,"Walmart is a fast paced work environment. They have some great associates. The company has forgotten about it Core Values, which Mr. Sam started his company."
bad,Non-flexible scheduling once you reach management. Little to no growth is certain areas of the country. Good experience for high school or entry level out of college candidates looking for a start job.
bad,"This is often the bottom-rung job experience. You are expected to cover a variety of areas not included within your scheduled areas, and expectations well exceed what is prudent or possible. They skim around OSHA requirements, focusing only when it's necessary, and the culture is often toxic due to low satisfaction with life and workplace."
bad,"The management team at Walmart is what made me leave. They will constantly tell you to move faster, you're never fast enough though, always belittling you and talking you down to other managers, etc."
bad,they don't work with your schedule if you are going to school. They do not care if you have strep throat and will try to make you come in anyway and infect people
bad,What can I say it’s Walmart basically this job is nothing but a circus you won’t or can’t advance unless you’re related or kissing you know what all the older people hates on the younger people that’s coming in because they know they’ll lose their job. Managers sleeping with employees and all type of bs going on the pay sucks and the hours are okay when you work nights cuz you don’t have managers hovering over you. Please stay to yourself and do your and leave that way you don’t have to worry bout snitches and ppl lying on you
bad,"Some days were better than others at Walmart, I dreaded going to work just because I was always expected to do more than my own job. They were very cruel to the employees, especially getting hours, they said they would work with your schedule but they do not."
bad,This company is  ridiculous  They give raises and bonuses then cut your hours for a whole month. The managers are  unprofessional. It’s a uncomfortable work environment.
bad,"Empresa multinacional,tendo alguns prós e contra ,como benéficos ao funcionários ."
bad,Started out great loved the Hourly team. Over years it declined most salary managers there are not qualified for there position and play favoritism and don’t follow through with complaints from hourly staff. They ask how can we help you to improve and grow in the company then never speak about it again. Even with the downs if you’re interested in learning about customer service it’s a good starter but long term it can be a struggle.
bad,Its fine as a job but I feel bad for people who are stuck working for them. The company doesn't care about its employees and it shows. It's a multi billion dollar company but can't afford to replace broken machinery?
bad,"I would come into work clock in and get my things ready. I would go to my station which would have been hardware. I would make sure all the paint mixtures were full in the machine before i would start work. Then I would start my zoning to make sure there would be no garbage or stolen items. help customers as they needed. Fix merchandise on the shelves, mix paint as needed, clean. If they needed me in other departments I would do my best to help since i was 7 months pregnant at the time. I would stock shelves."
bad,"That store changed hands in management like 4 times. I liked working there, but some people were lazy!! I got sick and when you work in the deli area you're not suppose to be behind the counter. They fired me while I was home sick!!! Then I had to fight them for unemployment.,"
bad,"I had medical issues that caused massive migraines, was told by my manager "" Keep your personal and medical issues at home"""
bad,It was quick paced it was stressful. Being stepped on wasn't pleasant elbowing they had hurtful things to say. Didn't feel as if I were an associate earlier this year
bad,Tried to transfer 12 times and got turned down you give your manager 150 percent and it's not enough to please them there never satisfied.and my job was taken away with no severance package
bad,It was not a good experience at all. Management was terrible because they didn’t really teach you. They overwork you to death and expect you to be at work even if you have a personal crisis you are dealing with.
bad,Walmart used to be a company that cared about it’s employees and took care of and rewarded long term associates now it’s just a big money well that cares more about the bottom line than the people who help get it there
bad,When I first started working there it was great but then something happened. There was no feelings there anymore. The employees started being treated like we were unappreciated for all the things that we do for walmart. We started getting treated with no respect and started being treated like slaves.
bad,"It's a job.  That's it.  Only advance if your with the ""in"" crowd.  Very hostile at times.  Employees aren't valued."
bad,They don’t except doctors notes. If your children are sick and you have to take them to a hospital or doctor gets held against you it is never approved. The only way and attendance is approved is if you or an I mediate family member has been admitted to the hospital for at least three days. People who have been there a long time do not get pay increases. New people start out making more than people who have been there for years. No Benefits for part-time associates. They got a big tax break give us a bonus that we had to pay taxes on and then they took away our yearly raise this year. They also took away our holiday pay. If we want to get extra pay for a holiday we have to use our own PTO time that we have earned. So we have no paid holidays.
bad,"I quit this job without warning because I was tired of being treated unfair. I was hired as part-time and given full-time hours leaving me with little to no time for myself. CSMs hardly respond when you need things such as a BATHROOM BREAK, PRICE CHECK or even MONEY IN YOUR DRAWER!! I have had to give customers money out of my own pockets because of the laziness of most of the CSMs."
bad,How are you going to hire a remodel crew and tell them that the will be hired on after they finish and since we have finished we have been told nothing. People cant live their life waiting on a phone call they need to have better communications
bad,"Lots of work not enough pay"
bad,The time I was there there was up and downs I must say if you get hurt on the job they made sure you got the help you needed and your health was taken care of.
bad,"the work is very easy but its also incredibly boring. most of the work is just organizing the shelves over and over again, also helping customers. if you like being a cashier than this is a great job but i didn't like working retail"
bad,"I've dealt with about thirty salaried managers in the last four years, and there was one consistent thread that ran through them all: inconsistency. From the top down, they can't seem to stick to their own orders, contradicting themselves and each other on almost an hour by hour basis. Regardless of what you do, you'll be threatened with coachings, whether you follow the direction of a supervisor, or the head office's ""One Best Way."" The stress, lack of appreciation, and complete lack of resoect cultivates an environment that I wouldn't wish on anybody."
bad,"The day to day work at Walmart is okay, its anytime you had to have any involvement with the management is when the problems arise."
bad,"Very friendly place to work, it has to be a very customer oriented place and very fast paced. Pay is not that good but as a part time or extra money job it is fine."
bad,"Easy part of job, bagging items and talking to customers. Hardest part is getting along with people that just talk about you negatively. Some members of management are untrustworthy, and rude. They either work you until you can’t anymore or not at all, really."
bad,Many employees who I worked with either hated working at Walmart or hated working with people. They weren't shy to share their opinions with their coworkers and it felt like you were pulling teeth just to get some help from them. If you were able to find your supervisor then you might be able to talk to them about any issues you might have. Your coworkers will be acting unprofessional in front of customers and your supervisors will discipline you in front of both customers and coworkers alike. It is hard to work somewhere when you feel as though you have nowhere to turn when you have an issue.
bad,"its a horriably ran company, most upper management are jusst plain ols ppl with power and they suck at it"
bad,"Management knows everything, but can't actually do it.  Expectations are high, for the little pay, and you're treated as an outcast on days you don't live up to said expectations."
bad,A terrible place to work with terrible management and a hostile work environment. Nepotism plays the key role in all promotions. Easy to deal with customers. Hard to deal with management.
bad,"The job itself was fast paced.  In retail managers come and go so that was a drag when a good one left & some had their ""own agenda' when they took over.  I worked graveyard so that in itself was a challenge."
bad,I was constantly stressed at this job. Managers aren't willing to work with you. The front end was always left to fend for themselves and constantly didnt have enough help or cashiers.
bad,"When you get there to work its already a mess in general as far as not enough associates for the day. Customers standing around looking for help when you know managers are their but they don't try to help. Schedules are never prepared for the days going forward. It is always a lack of unprofessionalism with Walmart and how we treat our customers before even getting to them. Which what i mean by that is how long they wait for help, which is around 35 to 50 minutes in areas we just don't schedule people in regardless if management is told about it. When it comes to leaving on time you never and i mean never leave on time. Its fine to get overtime if your getting paid for it but at Walmart you don't get overtime hours. So you practically working for free, while they tell you to stay but then tell you the next day to cut the time you stayed over. The only great parts about Walmart is the 10% discount you get there and the sales associates but manager wise they need a lot of help."
bad,Ever since the store got new management the store has been going downhill ever since. There is lack in communication. The store manager is mainly focused on money and not the fact that every new employee that is hired quits within a month.
bad,It’s an extremely physically hard job. The hours are long. The environment is really hot or really cold. It’s a dangerous job. The pay is good per hour but there is no garuntee you will get hours
bad,Walmart is a very stressful business.Goals change from day to day. There is little communication. The managers only care about there own area and not the building as a whole.
bad,"Walmart when I worked there had poor management, very high turnover rate, pay scale was horrible for what they expected you to do. "
bad,"demands on a dpt. manager are entirely way to high and there is not enough help and support given to dept. managers."
bad,"Walmart.com does not care about it's employees on the large scale. They will tell you one thing and once you're in it's completely different. The upper management is laughable, they wouldn't know how to be on the phones/email/chat if they're life depended on it. They hire supervisors from the outside, so they really don't know the business. Team Leads are sought out by supervisors since they don't know how to do anything. Upper management will tell you think outside the box to ensure an amicable resolution but then when you do that, they come to tell you it's not the right way. You can't win at Walmart.com."
bad,It's your typical low level job. Breaks were hard to get due to spontaneous busy times and customers lack of understanding. I often had to wait until the end of my shift to get my break. Customers were sometimes rude while others were super helpful and nice. Managers often didn't want to have to interact with difficult customers leaving you there to stall until they arrived. If you had time restrictions on when you could work due to school or child care they would work with you at first and then cut your hours forcing you to find another job or open your hours.I helped with back-up Customer Service Supervisor and was turned down multiple times for the position for others who had much less experience in the role than I did.
bad,Un lugar donde se meten en tu vida privada y no respetan tu opinión donde puedes subir de puesto solo por adulación
bad,"Very fast paced, lots of heavy lifting. The importance of time management in a production based environment, while assuring quality & accuracy was a bit of a struggle. Management needed improvement, too much favoritism. "
bad,"I wouldn't go back to Walmart, after being promised and lied too, for several months, they would not give me more hours or make me full time. I couldn't afford to keep working there."
bad,a lot f hourly associates are like a big family but management is all about favoritism and theyll do whatever they can to kick you out  if they dont like you
bad,"very long shifts, they do not allow you to have shorter shifts."
bad,Even though I had a great position the culture and morale of the location was not good at all. Have nothing good to say about this organization. Should be better ran to help people in general not take from them.
bad,I was a great employee I was in a car accident and was hospitalized and my boss didn’t take me off the schedule  while I was laid up in the hospital . So as a result of this I had so many unexcused absences that they fired me because of it even tho my Husband called and told them I was in this accident and that I was badly injured and I wasn’t going to be in ! They didn’t care !
bad,"typical day- coming stock milk and eggs, move on to creamer and box milk."
bad,"It was a very paced environment. It goes by how many products you make per day, week, and month. There is absolutely no fun by working up there. Very hot on the summer. Very cold on the winter. Not clean. Not safe at all. If you get injured, it's always, always your fault. No matter how it happened, what happened, or because of what it happened. Supervision is good, but management is bad."
bad,The place has alot of potential but the leads and managemhad very rude months due to their lack of experience  . But i managed to be able to bring my all to the table.
bad,the upper  management is not up to the jobs they are in. they give orders that he or she will not do then slaves. I was told to put my people in place and walk around and check on them and not give my safe a task.
bad,"Walmart is a very crazy place to work. Imagine black friday every weekend. If you don't have ""tough skin"" you will get fired or quit. If you don't want to be cursed out or blamed for literally any and everything don't apply. They are one of the highest paying retail but it's not worth the work drama. Employees are very problematic and don't even try to talk to management about a concern or anything. Their open door policy is a lie and you'll most likely get fired if you complain too much. Say goodbye to trying to live your life you'll always be at work."
bad,first part of the day before I opened my register I would clean my area. I would on a typical day help customer answer any question if any to the best of my ability. Keep my area cleaned up around the check stand. I learned quite a bit there mainly is patience with other co worker and management. I loved working upfront cause that is where you make an impression and they remember u. The hardest part I have to say is standing all day on the hard floor and dealing with the management not be so nice or very helpful there were a few out there who was helpful not many though. My favorite part of the day is meeting new faces and seeing smile on the kids face and even sad ones
bad,"The work environment is very stressful, you are required to finish assignments that are nearly impossible to accomplish and while this is occurring you have upper management breathing on your neck."
bad,Walmart laid off people with no reason and rehired people at a lower pay scale to offset budgets. The large layoffs affected all even with good performance evals. The right thing to do is let people who want to take a severance package and then move out the people with low evals.
bad,"I enjoyed working Non-Con, my manager was fair and I made production with ease. DA-receiving was a different story, my Managers played favorites and I was barley making production or just under every day."
bad,The department I was in was a perfect fit for me. Hard work but in a cooler environment. Usually one but sometimes two people in a department at once. The job itself was appealing the only downside working for the richest company in the world were NO good benefits.
bad,Management is unreliable in most cases. Weak training program. Very selfish with giving full time. Expected to do several jobs at once. Not very understanding of time time off for personal issues.
bad,Terrible management...very gossipy..favouritism...awful hours...no respect for myself as an associate. Constant scheduling problems. Breaks are never on time....
bad,"The new leaders within the company are convinced that the only way to compete against Lidhl and Aldi's is to be unrealistically efficient. By the way, Walmart no longer fears Target or Amazon as much as they do Lidhl and Aldi's. "
bad,I started out working in the bakery before going to cashier because it was too much work for one person to do. Collect baked breads and donut products and have all on the shelf by 8am with outdated ovens and instructions that were not clear very stressful.
bad,"Typical day: finishing all of my tasks early, then helping people who don't care if the task at hand gets finished or not. Management doesn't help in anyway even if we are severly short staffed for the day. "
bad,i will never again work at Walmart it's UN organized the managers don't care and the lines are always long and then the customers get mad at you because that think your being slow on purpose when there's an error
bad,"The day usually started with clocking in. Almost Immediately there was always a CSM harping on about something needing done. At times the CSM's would get into yelling matches with cashiers as though it were a pin to wear proudly on their vest. Most management in the Clinton location could not care any less about their employees. Save for one or two. The current store manager has allowed employees to threaten to cut one another, leading to a firearm being allowed on the premise by a new employee whilst on the clock with little to no repercussions. This place is a joke."
bad,"There is no consistency in anything in Walmart, at least not the one I've worked at. "
bad,In four years I moved up from a stocker to a salary manager and gained the experience to move on. Great place to build a resume but not a career in my opinion.
bad,"Compensation was low compared to competitors, high turnover made building a repertoire with team members very difficult. Duties could change from day to day depending on management. Multiple members of various management teams would often assign you tasks on the same day without any indication of what took priority over the others."
bad,"I always felt my direct supervisors trusted me, but upper management was completely out of touch and were concerned about their (very sizable) bonuses before actual improvement of the business"
bad,I love Walmart because of the customer service the way the manager treated all employees like family Walmart was my first job after high school it was great the reason for me leaving I didn’t have transportation to get there
bad,"With Walmart, I felt like we did not have any support from managment. Very rarely did we have one-one, I didn’t know if they ever approved of what I was doing."
bad,"Zoning, cleaning, answering the phone, picking up drops, providing good customer service, customer satisfaction, checking out back for customers, answering customers questions, helping them find what they need,and working on my department. I learned good customer service skills, good organazation skills, and good advocation skills. Most enjoyable being productive and busy, and working with customers. Hardest part was trying to work with customers while completing responsibilities at the same time."
bad,Confusion. Complete and utter confusion. Departments overlapping and orders stacked on top of one another. Favoritism and simony permeate the entire store.
bad,"Inconsistent hours, inconsistent management, inconsistent policies, inconsistent coverage, inconsistent expectations, full time is almost unachievable."
bad,"New rules are added that make the job harder. First I wasnt allowed to use a cart in order to grab customer returns to return restock. Im lucky if i can even get a cart to help a customer load heavy products (pools, trampolines, furniture) to their car. Next im not even allowed to use a box to put returns in to carry to its area."
bad,"Stressful enviroment with crude customers and gruff managment. They want you to move a mountain and give you a plastic kiddie shovel to do it. Management, for the most part, is unthankful and mean."
bad,They say they set you up for success but it's the opposite and they don't care about their employees it's just not worth it you break your back working for them and nothing is ever good enough
bad,"It was alright, I loved the actual job, but I didn't like many of the people that I was working with. I was treated unfairly, many times was forgotten for breaks and the cashier manager never even bothered to learn my name. He most likely had no clue I was even a cashier, except that my nametag said it."
bad,What can be said about Wal-Mart that you don't already know I think everyone should get a job here for at least a little while so you can see what it feels like on the other side of the counter as with most jobs it's not the policies or management or even the pay that will make someone stay here it's the friends you make on the way and the fear that you won't find something better
bad,"Walmart offered health care, an annual bonus, room to promote etc, The issue with the company was poor management. Managers were very unprofessional and were unethical."
bad,"I show up every night at Wal-Mart to give it my 100%, I currently  stock frozen foods.. the reason I'm leaving is when every night I wrk, there's times frozen gets large amounts of freight, and when I'm talking about large amounts, it's average hours of freight is 10 hours or more per night... Basically I wrk 10 plus hours of freight by myself every night, when you get large amount of freight especially 10 plus hours, that requires two people in a 8 hour shift that I attend to wrk every night... But that's half the reason I'm leaving, the other reason is management.. When I do a two person job by myself every night in 8 hours I don't get no respect or compliments from them.. so to me that tells me they are just using my skill for there benefits and not me..."
bad,I am either too proactive or too lazy. They don't want me to show them up so once I back off they say I am too lazy. I don't get paid enough for what they have me do.
bad,"Poderia valorizar mais o funcionário, e oferecer cursos de caqpacitação."
bad,busy busy busy. Management is only out for their selves.the people are the best part of the job while some of the managers are the worst. the hardest part of the job is making production when they expect you to make 100% every day all the time without any errors.
bad,Poor management but good benefits . Not enough help always stayed stresses to the max . Never had a routine that could be followed but expected to finish without having enough time or help.
bad,"Full shift- to part time. Requires a lot of physical "
bad,"Alternate management, and issues with scheduling by computer, with many changes. When you have no idea what your hours will be, and managers change all the time, it makes for a very confusing work environment"
bad,"I was hired to work as an associate.  I had no idea I would help build a new Walmart store.  I hung shelves in dairy, the meat department, and performed many other tasks.  What a great learning experience.  Retail is extremely demanding both physically and mentally.  I am thankful for the experience."
bad,Extremely difficult working situation in that managers were often uneducated and ill-informed of their roles and responsibilities.  Worked for 23 years and the company has changed drastically away from the corporate culture.  Most associates are treated as  a number and not everyone is given the same opportunities.  Would not recommend to work here - EVER!
bad,"I worked 5 different departments most nights, and was running all over most of the night. I dont feel like I made enough for everything I did. I work an easier job now and get paid way more"
bad,"Overall Wal-Mart is a great company to work for, you work with other individuals that all seem to have great personalities. However a lack of communications in management can quickly turn any day into a rough one. Along with poor training regarding special needs and disabilities can add to the troubles of work."
bad,i belive wal mart is a terrible place to work i have had to work there 3 times in 2 different stores and mgt is the same terrible as many people are coming to look for a job 2 times as many are getting fired the money is good that why i have worked there but every sec you wonder if it is your turn to get let go
bad,"I learned everything there is to retail at the front-end of any store.Loads of pressure to ask customers many questions for promotions (mastercards, fundraisers)."
bad,I worked the overnight shift stocking shelves.  There were supposed to be two people working the area that I had to work.  I watched as the managers favored the guys working while the women were subject to being written up for absolutely nothing.  The job itself could have been very enjoyable if not for this favoritism.
bad,"the management wasn't always nice. being in located in a questionable part of the city, there was a lot of thief, violence, yelling, police patrolled the store while closing while security walked around in casual clothes. they played favorites and customers are rude or sassy. hours were long and schedule was made for two weeks in advance. if you needed a day off or something came up, you HAD to switch with someone or call in and get a point counted. and often times, they dont send you on breaks/lunch. it was normal to work 3-5 hours straight before getting the last couple hours of your shift full of all your breaks, if they remembered or you said something and they were not rude."
bad,"The job was not what I expected. You are expected to over work yourself to please your employer. But, yet the employer don't want to paid what its worth."
bad,"I have no review to include, The possibilities of retaliation is too high. I dont recommend working for this company. It was great at the beginning but all the reorganization they are doing is not right for the associate"
bad,"At the evergreen wamart, they paid me 11.50 an hour, which was great, although the work was tedious and unrewarding. The culture was slow and sloppy, and few people actually cared about the work they did."
bad,"During my employment the store manager was changed three times, the co-managers and assistant managers have been switched out more frequently than that. The managers bulldoze associates and expect associated to do more than what they are qualified or paid to do so."
bad,"When the right managers were working it was a fun and easygoing day, but some managers expected one person to do the job of 5 and it was overwhelming. Most days were good."
bad,Your treated as another soulless worker who always needs to do more. I did enjoy the pay and the stable schedule but there is a way you need to treat others that you won’t get at Walmart.
bad,"Walmart was my first retail job, I started at part time at one store. Came back to another, and was hired for full time. At first my hours were horrid, bad assistant manager (didn't care, let the computer do scheduling), finally have a manager who does care, but corporate decided to change things, and now THEY do the scheduling."
bad,worst company you will ever work for.  you apply for one position they spend three days doing computer training and then after one day with another employee you get thrown on the other side of the store where your not trained for at all.
bad,"Your fellow workers here are some of the nicest people you will ever meet, but management on the other hand cause constant stress.The job involves attempting to perform tasks at an unreasonable pace and management watching over your shoulder constantly. Creates a lot of stress and generally have to stay late."
bad,"Bien que les mérites de l'entreprise soient vantés lors de l'embauche, y travailler est complètement différent. La plupart des gérants ne s'inquiètent pas de la charge de travail portée par leurs employés. Notamment, des dimanches soirs à fermer tout seul dans le rayon, seul à partir de 15h, trancher de la viande aux clients pendant 2h30 sans arrêt, se faire sermonner parce qu'il n'y a plus de poulets cuits, et ce, devant les clients, pauses souvent sautées en raison d'un manque de personnel vis-à-vis la charge de travail, devoir répéter souvent le nombre d'heures que nous désirons pendant nos études, car elles ne sont jamais respectées, engagée à temps partiel mais obligé de travailler bcp plus d'heures, autant que les temps plein, malgré les demandes répétées de respect des heures demandées. De plus, ils aiment mieux jeter des quantités astronomiques de poulet que de perdre des ventes, donc énormément de gaspillage."
bad,"A typical work day is stressful but also very fun you are interacting with people and on the move but sometimes you get the difficult customers, but what makes the job stressful is management they do not work with you and do everything on their own time."
bad,"Wal-mart lacks respect for their employees."
bad,"The schedule is the worst I’ve ever had. There is no work life balance once you get into management. The job requires so much time, and there is an expectation you will stay to get it done... period!"
bad,"I worked at Walmart for a year and it took them way longer than three months to get hired in, which means giving me a raise and my discount card. After finally getting hired in we were perpetually short staffed and unable to receive the time that we requested off due to it. Their insurance was lack luster and their call service was terrible for said insurance. Higher up management made it clear that they don't care about you as an individual and only cared about the numbers. The people that you work with are amazing and make the job worth working. Decent wages for the work that you do."
bad,"Walmart Dufferin Mall Toronto, ON"
bad,"I love my specific position because of the interaction with customers etc, if I could work for a different company (like Costco) and do the same job I would in a heart beat. "
bad,"Had to deal with rude dustomers 24/7 , reshop was a disaster , overtime was not allowed whatsoever ; or we would get in trouble . It was just too much for just little pay"
bad,"As an Assistant Store Manager the training was great, the job was great, but the company eliminated a level of management and dumped the responsibilities of the ASM position. This became burdensome and stressful. The Store Manager decided she didn't care for me and everything turned sour from then on."
bad,You have to keep everyone in management happy or your going to get into trouble along the line. Management (mostly the main manager) Is harder to please and only is nice when shes being watched by corporate.
bad,"Working at Walmart is about as fun as it sounds, but the people who are working beside you make it all worth it. You get attached to everyone and almost become friend. I just handed in my two week notice and although im beyond excited to begin my new job, I'll miss everyone very much :)"
bad,"The majority of managers always denies associates days off even if its for an emergency. They have favoritism, and give more hours to the associates that are always lacking on the job."
bad,no one ever cleaned after doing a job so when you would go to use the equipment you would get really dirty and nasty and they play the same ten songs all day. shoppers don't notice but it drove me nuts. do me a favor next time you are in walmart and they are playing Breakfast At Tiffanys song tell them to turn it off NOW.
bad,"No hay oportunidad de crecer, el salario es menos del mínimo"
bad,"Fast paced, nice enough people but they will not let you go full time. Low pay. Things can get pretty haphazard with inventory coming in at odd times, complicating helping customers."
bad,while walmart  is a typical retailer they have unreal exceptions of the shifts and hours they want you to work. No regard for  your home life.  There is not enough management that care or have the knowledge to do a good job of supporting the lowly associate they are trying to keep there job too.
bad,Management needs to be better and have better communicatiin skills.  When scheduled in one area i was moved around alot and felt like i was never able to complete a job.
bad,I will not recommend anyone to work for walmart they do not take medical issues seriously and they give u points for being sick even if in a hospital they dont offer u very many hours not even over time when i applied i was hoping for full time they said they dont offer that to cashiers so it isnt a company for people that want to have things in life
bad,"Avoid if possible, money is decent but the work environment was incredibly negative due to employees as management. They cared more about selling Walmart mastercards, than providing satisfactory customer service."
bad,The most enjoyable part of working is the culture of inclusiveness in the company. The least enjoyable is the pay. You get way too much work piled on you and are not payed to reflect the amount of work you actually have to do.
bad,Long work days seemed exhausting and repetative. not very much room for growth or department change. work hours are flexible and management is helful.
bad,Nice coworkers.  Management seems to think that staff are to be treated with little respect regardless of how hard they are working at the job.  I didn't like working there.
bad,"This job was stressful from the beginning to the end. I learned a lot about sales but management was very demanding, degrading, uncaring, self consumed and  competitive. The work culture among employees was good, but management made it hard to maintain good relationships because of the competiveness. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with price changes each month, processing new merchandise daily and management placing undue stress. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find items that they needed and knowing that they were happy."
bad,Overnights get stuck cleaning up messes.  Everything is blamed on overnights.  Get stuck working longer then scheduled while other managers leave early or when they are scheduled to be done.
bad,You spend most of the day helping customers find products while working on stocking and organization of products.  Your manager will likely give you something to work on then disappear for the rest of the day.  Great way to plan and execute tasks on your own but can be discouraging when need assistance or managerial input.  The hardest part of the job is making customers happy but it can also be the most rewarding part depending on your own attitude.
bad,"i have worked both in walmart store and in walmart warehouse."
bad,The day I turned in my two weeks notice after almost 10 years I could not stop smiling.  Total cut throat environment where you are expected to be at work all the time and guilted into overtime.
bad,The management didn’t care for anyone but them selves they were to worried about the wrong departments in the store didn’t care how the spoke to there workers and were quick to fire.
bad,"One of the worst parts of working at Walmart was all the thieves returning things that they never paid for to begin with. You learn real quick that no one could be trusted. Most of the management are lazy and didn't care about a whole lot. The hardest part of the job was filling in for two or three people because they just didn't want to work that day and they just decided to call in, and then the customers complaining because they couldn't find anyone to help them. "
bad,Every coworker here was nice and polite. We all had to work on this hard warehouse floors so just getting by everyday was stressful as is. The managers were often busy so it was crucial for them to work in a team work setting with you to get things done.
bad,When working at Walmart I started to get very stressed. And due to the stress form work I started having serious panic and anxiety attacks. I would not recommend working for them unless you can take a little stress.
bad,"Asking for specific days off is a waste of time. I was moved to another department so someone could transfer from another store. I was moved to one department on paper so I could keep my 7.50 an hour. In reality, I was working in a department that I was not trained for. After a few days of being moved to my new department, I was working in multiple departments a day. Often times, I was yelled at because one manager forget to tell the other manager that they had moved me. The work is not worth the pay. The stress of doing so much work while going to college full time caused me to have a mental breakdown and vow to never step into another Walmart again."
bad,"I have worked for Walmart about 13 years.  It used to be a truly great company to work for, but in recent years I have found it to be a truly stressful place to work.  I like the aspect of the company where it seems pretty solid and it is stable income.  I do not like the management team collectively and how things are so competitive and retaliation, although against policy, runs rampant with the management team as a whole.  The store I work in does not like to train people.  What I know I've had to learn on my own.  A typical work day is attempting to follow company policies and the routine, but nothing is ever routine there.  Things change moment to moment.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the management team. Often the management team is not trained and each one has a different agenda.  Everyday you have to deal with a different set of rules."
bad,go to work do the job if the equipment is available. I learn to stay focused on the job at hand and get out as much freight as possible the management team is very helpful.
bad,Stressful job with new scheduling changes.  The schedule is made by a computer and regularly schedules employees with only 5 hours between shifts.  There is no hands on training only computer classes.
bad,"This is the highest million dollar corporation yet it pays there employees so little. They're benefits are not great either, and they pick and choose who they want to be fair with!"
bad,Do not recommend working outside in cart pushing because most of them leave and you are left short handed and then management doesn’t care about you if ur short handed they just want the job done and done well
bad,not the place it once was totally regimented no free thought lots of stress and no solutions to problems often told to just figure it out then disciplined if deadlines not met customer service is out the window
bad,"Es buena empresa, únicamente el ambiente laboral es demasiado pesado, ya que, tienen muy poco interés por capital humano, sólo saben pedir números al costo que sea, quitándote totalmente tu vida personal."
bad,Very stressful hard to please management. In getting all jobs completed in the time given to employees. lack of respect for family and employees. Management was not very helpful or understanding.
bad,"Poorly run front end. No consistency, dirty store. I have worked at other Walmarts, Metairie, LA is nothing to write home about. They need to reorganize the whole front end."
bad,"Not the best place to work, the people were nice, but management wasn’t good. The store was always ver chaotic. Nothing was being done right and a lot of customers were leaving unsatified."
bad,"I found the Sapulpa Wal-Mart to be easier than the Sand Springs Wal-Mart. Though the atmosphere was better at the Sand Springs Wal-Mart (Work there was harder). I liked my job, it's sad that it ended on a sour note. I was written up long after I was gone from the company and barred from coming back to work for them. I'm not sure how that works, if I no longer work there how do I get a write up? Other than that it was an alright overall experience."
bad,The business and management are horrible but the work is easy. Other workers are so bored they create drama among themselves for exitement. And they often snitch to management because they have nothing better to do than work at the local walmart for 30 years straight getting $10 an hour
bad,"I liked working at Walmart for a first job. The management was absolutely bad, and it was the worst management I've had by far. My assistant manager often times would take requests from you and rip them up when requesting time off. The front End management was poorly managed by not having enough workers out on the floor at times. The Store manager was often taking many vacations, and didn't show that she cared about anyone. Management was the biggest concern from many of the associates perspectives."
bad,"Walamart is a very high paced, stressful place to work, management never get along with associates very well, but the company trys to work with you and understand whats going on in both your home life and your work life."
bad,They have a very strict policy about attendance. Their raises are great something it 10 to 25 cents. It takes along time to make it to the next dollar amount. When they pass a bill for raises only employees that get those raises are the employees that don't already make that amount.
bad,There was little to no on hands safety or job training. The management let a lot of safety violations go. The management was never around to train or regulate employees
bad,After 8 years was not worth 3% so i could keep the my income safe.... lied to about moving up giving impossible tasks and told i would get a promotion if i could pull it off.
bad,My duties consist of ensuring customer satisfaction with online orders.  I have learned how to be patient and learn from each working situation that I am in.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the lack of leadership in management. They have a system in place that doesn't acknowledge the achievement of associates when it comes to advancement within the company.
bad,"The associates are friendly and are far more tolerable than the management team. The management team itself has a couple good apples, but the basket reeks of a majority of bad ones."
bad,"Though I thoroughly enjoyed the compensation, the management and CSMs at Walmart are unhelpful and take unnecessarily long amounts of time to help its other employees. Dealing with rude customers is one thing, but long wait times to receive help with a transaction is tiresome. Most of the other employees are nice, but some get irritated for no reason. The breaks are short and having to wait for other cashiers to get back from their breaks is frustrating when they extend their break by 5-10 minutes."
bad,"I have never known a company to have the same sort of turnover that WalMart does. Our store saw new employees almost weekly. At times, it felt that management didn't care about the work or the employees. But management was prone to massive turnover as well. In the year that I was there, my department went through 4 managers and none of them stuck. That lack of stability did not lead to effective team building or a friendly work environment."
bad,I really didn't care for this job. Its Walmart do i need to say more? I like my store manger. They were great! Besides that I don't have much to say on this topic.
bad,"The place is a dump and should be shut down, working conditions deplorable. Homeless people come in and take dumps on the salesfloor. Tweakers constantly overdose on the bathrooms."
bad,The job was way more work than the amount I got paid.  The store manager was a tyrant.  I did learn that for myself I could do things that I previously thought I couldn't
bad,"rude management and customers, long hours, short breaks. unwelcoming environment. Lack of communication between management leads to associates getting blamed by customers."
bad,"working for the Walmart distribution center was very difficult, the work environment was very draining at times because no one really seemed as if they wanted to be there, the pay was great but working the night shift on weekends meant that we always had the bad freight."
bad,"A stressful place to work with horrible management, awful staffing, friendly colleges and great benefits. While sometimes fun work environment staffing is a major problem and coverage for breaks and lunches are inconsistent and sometimes hours late."
bad,A typical day at Walmart included greeting the customers and checking out their items quickly but efficiently. Management would have us probe the customers to get them to sign up for a Walmart credit card and gave us a glare if we didn't meet the daily quota. The culture of Walmart is being one big team and working together. The hardest part of the job is management getting mad about the cashiers not getting the daily quota of Walmart credit cards. The most enjoyable part of the job is you make new friends and have someone you can vent to if your having a bad day.
bad,No response to this job. Job was lacking in management and supervisors and managers. The management team need to talk to people with respect. I had a nice time being employed.
bad,"The work at WalMart wasn't necessarily hard (though I did sustain a back injury from having worked there that bothers me till this day), but it was the management and work culture that eventually drove me away. Some people were nice, but the vast majority of them didn't seem to care about their job and management ran around like chickens with their heads cut off. I have nothing against them, and they tried to do their very best, but I would never willingly want to work at WalMart ever again."
bad,"Wal-Mart is always hiring, if you need a place to work almost immediately. You get paid lunches and breaks and the work can range from tolerable to mildly irritating. Wal-Mart would make a great stepping stone until you move on to something better."
bad,"A typical day at work is very stressful. If you love a fast paced environment then its a great place to work. Lots of room for advancement usually promote within. I learned how to delegate, supervise, handle stressful situations. The workplace culture is wonderful. All the associates were very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was knowing the management team does not care about you or your family. My daughter got sick last year and they knew i would be missing more time then i normally would. But because i was missing so much time they decided that they would let me go. Even though i did everything i was told to do by them."
bad,"I worked as an hourly associate and worked hard to get to assistant Manager. When in the store I had terrible co-management team, and store manager. They always gave you impossible work loads for the two years I was there. I had teams of people trying to complete the work and we never got it done. Then they wrote you up. When I tried to transfer they would of block me. Three times they did. I worked 2 years at that management position 12-14 hour day 6 days a week. I was salary so no over time. I even had a manager come to my house on my one day off to tell me to come to work. I only stayed as long as I did because I just had a baby and the insurance is what I needed. But I missed the first two years of my daughters life. Then I found a better job with more work life balance."
bad,"you work hard and they dont give raises and nothing is positive.  You has a manager wear headset and its always negative never good job."
bad,"Depending on where you work in the store, working here can be extremely demanding. Your schedule will vary. Depending on the current needs of the individual store, you may be sent to another department to fulfill other duties. Just like any other job, some managers are excellent leaders who want to see you thrive, but others are the complete opposite."
bad,"nice place to work and shop just management doesn't treat people right and generally favor some employees over others, harass you for walking around the store while on break or days off"
bad,"Extremely stressful for salaried upper management.  Lack of work/life balance.  Overall salary is competitive, but work hours exceed 50 hours per week."
bad,Walmart Capilano was a good place to work through highschool but upon graduating it was not as great. They do have flexible hours and the management were generally good about scheduling you during preferred times however they did schedule me on time booked off more than once which was a hassle. 
bad,customers deal their angers on the cashiers and the managers tend to not care about their employees. just the whole environment is not a good place to work at.
bad,"Your experience with the company largely depends on the store and leadership you work for. My experience was more positive in Arizona than in Washington. The company offers a very competitive 401k "
bad,Walmart is a pretty good company to work for as long as you are on top of knowing your employee rights and aware of all the management situations and constant gossip that goes on.
bad,"Out of high school Walmart was a very family and friend oriented place to work. Over the years, it just became a job. Each day you had to show up and do your job just like in any other work place."
bad,Working in Pharmacy does not pay as well as other Retail Companies. Expect high turn over rates and trying to advance is very slow and painful. Great healthcare benefits and discounts on items in store.
bad,"This was a place that was only concerned about the bottom line. I can't speak for all centers, but the one I was working at was so focused on the numbers that we often felt unappreciated. Too often were those of us who came to work every day given unfair treatment and the unreliable workers weren't forced to answer for their actions."
bad,Having a rough day while working a Wal-Mart was unacceptable. They will hold you accountable for any small reason and make you work in any section of the store that was convenient for them and not what was best for you and your performance.
bad,"you work a lot of hours just to be skimped on pay. You don't get promoted based off work ethic, but on favoritism. Even with your discount,which doesn't include food, you cant even get your basic essentials without spending a good portion of your paycheck."
bad,The management had unrealistic expectations and time tables. The other staff did not care about their job or how well it was done. It made work difficult
bad,management would ask you to work off the clock . Then when you would ask them for different shifts I was told to deal with it or quit . I am a single parent trying to care for my 2 children it was very unfair of them to do this to me when they were told up front that I was a single parent . Management does not care about there people .
bad,"I learned to treat people with respect, and be considerate of others. I learned hoe to manage a team of 5 of more people in a 8 hour shift. I learned the importance of being on time."
bad,the job it self was easy except management either got in the way or didnt help when need then expected half the crew working to do just as good even though almost half would be missing
bad,it was fun working there. Just sometimes it be hard getting work done. I learned a lot about myself I grew as the company they showed me things and push me to do things I didn't know I could do.
bad,"The learning curve at Walmart can vary greatly with what department you are hired for but the level of training you receive is always inadequate. You are expected to always keep up with a demanding work pace no matter the conditions and if you manage to, there is almost never any real recognition. It seems that the entire management team changes yearly leaving very little room for personal acquaintance with your superiors. The one major positive reason to work here is a forgiving attendance policy along with adjustable scheduling to work around school or other needs. But as with most retail jobs, there are very few full time positions to be found at the store. Part time work does not cover any form of insurance or consistent benefits, the most financial assistance you will receive is the 10% discount card after working there for longer than 3 months."
bad,"I worked there for about five months, and it started off good. Until I realized they didn't cover everything in the orientation process. I had no idea that calling in would be a point  (their attendance policy), and I had gotten a terrible cold, and couldn't work for a few days. When I found out more about the point system, I stopped calling in. Than I had properly requested a day off in advance, due to a family medical emergency, and they counted it as a call in. Got fired for it."
bad,I needed a job while in school it paid the best so I chose to work there. The company is like any other major company that has a large presence. I did not enjoy the job only because I have a passion for medicine and the company had nothing to do with my dreams and aspirations.
bad,"A day at work includes balancing cooking and keeping food fresh, serving customers what they order, and cleaning everything by the end of the night. I learned how to use new equipment and manage my time. All members of management have varying amounts of knowledge and experience in each department. This means that some of the assistant managers and/or store managers may have no idea what a regular day in your department looks like. Communication between each of them is severely lacking and you can be told multiple different answers to the same question. There are days, sometimes even weeks when you wont see a manager all day until an even higher member of management visits the store. Once this happens you may have managers watching your every move demanding you do things they not only wouldn't do themselves, but don't understand entirely. The other employees are generally very accepting and make you feel at home. The hardest part of the job is dealing with clueless management, trying to keep the food case full, cleaning, keeping the floor stocked, training new associates, and helping customers all at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the bonuses and decent hours depending on how hard you work."
bad,My typical day at work was pretty busy since I would bounce from person to person and wasn't trained very well for the on-floor tasks that they assigned me.
bad,it does not matter what skills you have to offer this place its who you know that matters here and i got tired of this not ever being able to move up it got frustrating
bad,Walmart was a safe and productive workplace. We always put our customers first and get the job done in time to help other departments. I’ll recommend anyone to work for the company.
bad,"typical work day was busy backed up lots to do"
bad,"was a good place to work, until restructuring started. Company seems to be going in the wrong direction. Leaving is a very hard decision. Hoping to see it turn around soon, as it can be an excellent place to work."
bad,el problema es cuando el manager o supervisores no son aptos para desempeñar los empleos
bad,"too much to do in a day"
bad,The management team at the time was horrible. They have since overhauled it to make a better work environment. The company itself was good to the employee
bad,A typical day while working at Walmart was mostly staying outside retrieving cart for the customers till my lunch break. Then i would repeat the same thing till I clocked out for the day.
bad,"the hours are bad. there is no schedules. pay is poor. the good thing is that managers let you do your job, good training, and the manager is great to discuss any issues that you have"
bad,management not committed
bad,Horrid management. Would tell you do do one thing just to be told that that's not what they want and constantly run you back and forth. Wasn't allowed my service dog either... Which is Illegal.
bad,"-little to no communication between management and associates "
bad,"Management were very unprofessional in handling the associates and their issues. I would be happy going to work , then would be told by one manager to do something and then another manager would come and say no I need you to do this. They never communicated with each other at all."
bad,It was fun with my coworkers and knowing I was eligible to satisfy my customers with everything they possibly needed. I loved being able to see new faces.
bad,Their training process was quick and would have you shadow for only about an hour before tossing  you on a register. The hardest part of the job was the amount of customers one would get in the lane.
bad,"I loved my job at walmart.  When I came to the gainesville Walmart they had no clue how to prepare bread.  I taught most of the employees how to bake bread and make for a beautiful loaf of bread including the present bakery manager."
bad,Look at the summary. The managers there on 280 really don’t care about you! They only care about their customers but act like they don’t need employees to help the customers. I can go on and on about Wal Mart
bad,It is a stressful job if you let it be. You have to find anything positive and motivate yourself to go to work every single day. The ttaining is terrible they just through you into something and say get it done. How is anyone suppose to learn what they have to do in their job because if not nothing will be done right.
bad,"Management is horrible. I've never felt so disrespected as I do when I walk through those doors. They let co-workers and managers disrespect customers, but they coach someone over one false bad review. They only enforce the dress code with certain associates. It's an extremely unfair environment, but it's a good place for temporary work. They expect you to learn several job positions, but only get paid for the lowest one."
bad,"The management just seemed not to care about their employees. Didnt matter how hard i worked, they never listened to my concerns bout my co-worker who did absolutely nothing but waste time and company money."
bad,"Hours vary wildly for pharmacy technicians. It can completely cut into one's personal life and weekends. Strange situations can create a later day than is necessary. Extremely busy locations, short staff. Pharmacy clerks, when they don't show up, throw pharmacy techs into the register position, making the work less slow. Cashier experience may be limited, and pharmacy tech is left fumbling with issues at the register instead of doing primary job requirements. Pharmacy Manager was helpful, amazing, wonderful, intelligent, patient. The are was chaotic, completely chaotic."
bad,"Previous manager was a great teacher and had patience to let us learn without fear of repercussion.  He managed by doing with us and following up.  New Store Manager was condescending and patronizing.  With her immediate supervisor she took all good credit and shifted blame out to others if a process was not executed.  I had several associates who wanted me to approach her with ideas, questions or requests. I was already on the outs with her so another 'dumb request or question was just another day for me."
bad,For the money you can't complain but they could use better management....upper management was a nightmare. They need to actually need to listen to some of the employees and actually all be one one page when they go to tackle a problem. Give some opportunities to advance and highlight the things people do for the company
bad,"The harder you work and the better you are at your job, management uses you to do everyone's job with no appreciation. It's super fast paced dealing with customers, and having to stock shelves."
bad,"very stressful days at work, you as a front end manager where responsible for keeps lines done and if the lines are long finding people to go on register, I've learned that after working at Walmart that I can handle any stress that comes at me, management isn't that best, they WILL NOT stand behind you if you are handling an irrated customer and they will make sure that they down grade you in front of the customer just to show that the customer is right and we are wrong. the hardest part of the job is just dealing with clients that are very angry and no matter what you do to make them happy it isn't enough. the most enjoyable part of being a Walmart girl is that you meet and become friends for life with so many different people, and to me that is what matters."
bad,es un trabajo rutinario y  facil de realizar   aprendi a usar cajas registradoras hacer cobros de tarjatas bancaria a usar telson para hacer ventas
bad,"I'm working at Wal-Mart right now and, in my personal opinion, most of the Wal-Mart management is two-faced and is always changing their minds on what we're aloud to do and not do. At least, in my store. It's very stressful sometimes. The pay is decent though."
bad,the hardest part of my job was being one person and having to handle 20 other different situations at once it could become stressful but it was handled in a timely manner. A typical day at work included getting ready for the pull while assisting the cashiers with issues that would arise.
bad,Walmart is a horrible place to work they have no respect for their employees. they have no compassion. I will never work for that company or any of it affiliates
bad,I learned how to become a good manager.  Constantly moving and zoning.  Always shorthanded and some employees had really bad attitudes.  I got to meet a lot of different people.
bad,"I am not one to bash my previous employers but the managers showed favoritism to certain associates and new positions were only offered to those that were ""friends"" of management or bought lunch for the managers. I was there for 3 years and finally could not take it anymore and looked for employment else where."
bad,I worked a Walmart as a cashier and it was okay. Pretty straight forward job. Walmart was quite accommodating when it came to taking days off for personal reasons.
bad,"Abusive management team, would call you out of work area to pick up trash at their feet. I worked with a lot of good people working hard for lazy managers that abuse their position and use threat tactics to get things done. Not all managers were bad but most were building own credit from others labor."
bad,"The management is by far really bad they don't know how to talk to you. They treat you like your gum on the bottom of their shoe. If you suck up then you get points off , more hours and praise."
bad,"The manager of accounting was probably the worst manager I have ever met in my life. She gave me little to no training, and basically threw a book on my desk and said read that, that's your training. But the book was way off when it came down to actually doing the job. It was ridiculous. They never checked on you to see how you were doing, nor did they offer help. I failed in that position, because I did not have proper training. It's sad to have said that, but it was ridiculous."
bad,"Some of the Mangers were decent, but I had problems with 3 of them. Poor training, most people who worked there also wanted to leave and seemed either depressed or upset."
bad,do not recommend working for walmart. poor management. force open availability or basically lose hours. hard to advance if you do not make friends with the management.
bad,"Forced to stand for hours only talking to customers that complain"
bad,"I applied for a part time cashier job which is what I wanted at the time. I was placed in jewelry and working part time-some days some nights. I was asked to take a department and promotion. I decided I was up for the challenge and accepted. I was intrigued with the idea of a set daily schedule. I loved the work I did but I was seldom allowed time to do my daily work. I was required to ignore the schedule, work either overnights or 5 to 2 shifts to straighten up every department and cover for other managers on vacation. I had at least 5 supervisors telling me to do 5 different things at the same time and the constraints of the schedule and time clock prevented me from ever getting projects completed on time which frustrated me.  The atmosphere of backstabbing, complaining and lying that prevailed made it difficult to know who to trust or even speak to. My part time job turned into my life style as I was spending more of my waking hours at work than at home. For a person just starting out, this would be a great job-plenty of room for advancement if you can take the pressures. I was not looking for a full time career change so the job ended up being more frustration than I needed in my life. I prefer an office/computer setting and this is where my best skills are useful."
bad,After 11 years with the company there are now people fresh out of high school with no work experience that are making as much as i do. My yearly raise barely covers the cost of the heath insurance increase
bad,Had a temporary assignment. Showed up everyday to work. Did all the things I needed to but I was let go claiming the assignment was done but others still worked there.
bad,the typical work day starts off slow but speeds up quickly. i learned money services as well as being a cashier. management was slow and had no time for employees. great work culture youll meet a lot of new people and make friends.
bad,In past was a good place to work.Company does offer benefits to full time employees. Looking for another job to learn new skills as I have worked in all areas now.
bad,"Unreasonable time frames for completing tasks, low pay, and they expect everyone to be able to do everything without any cross training. Management was weak, and didn't lead. More of a ""do as I say"" mentality. The best part of the day was the hour long lunch."
bad,Basically your a tool. You do what management says regardless of policies or laws. you can't get overtime unless it;s christmas due to them not wanting to hire enough to cover areas. The store is to big to be taken out of your area to help another and they leave your area understaffed a lot.  They try to work with less and less so management can get a better bonus. Most of the employees will stab you in the back to get a better position and rarely use good work ethics or teamwork to accomplish anything. they don't care about your health or well being for the most part and will find any excuse to fire an employee over health issues.
bad,"My position is a repetitive one, which includes a set of parameters that need to be done daily. It is a easy job as far as knowledge, but it requires a lot of lifting and walking. On average I take around 20,000 steps per day."
bad,"Low Pay"
bad,"If you want to work somewhere where half the employees don't care and the other half somewhat care, then walmart is the place to be. Being in a management position you expect to have hardworking people that can match what you do. It was so stressful having to pick up the slack of people you shouldn't have to. I did it too long that I decided to move somewhere where my management and skills would be appreciated."
bad,my managers were extremely racist and mean. that alone made me not want to work there anymore. the work days were okay. the pay was decent. my coworkers were also pleasant.
bad,"Horrible management, managers dont know all needed information so them helping you is highly unlikely. Pay is decent for the work done but if you cant figure things out on your own i wouldnt recommend it."
bad,the most enjoyable part of that job was meeting new people and getting to know the customers that came into the store on a regular basic location good
bad,Other employees will do anything to cover for themselves even if it means accusing others of their actions. the management will fly off the handle for the littlest  mistakes.
bad,If was ok to work with coworkers and I worked with money and deposit money and run the front end and took care of customers and cashiers and help make decision and did customer service desk and money center and help with carts
bad,"good benefits, but terrible management and h.r. people didn't listen to problems, can't get people at home office, always hard to talk with people about issues"
bad,"Great for a school kid or a retired person."
bad,"The work was repetitive. I came in, unloaded the truck, put the product out of the floor that was stored overnight, arranged the cooler, stocked up carts for when the other associates came in, culled the sales floor, and helped with customers. Was sent all over other departments to help out."
bad,"Walmart pays there store managers well.  Benefits are great, stock options, 401k.  If you're a workaholic then you will be fine.  Typical day starts at 7 and ends between 5 and 6 if you choose to leave then but you are encouraged to work more, and if your store isn't right don't take a day off. You are in charge of every aspect of the store, and it falls on your shoulders when its crunch time.  You need to have managerial courage when it comes to your salary members of management.  You must be fair, firm and consistent.  Workplace culture is ""put the time in.""  "
bad,"I'm sure some people would like working here, but it was just not for me. I'm not terribly good with people and the work was draining as I needed to be on the floor for at least 2 hours at a time interacting with people constantly. "
bad,"Terrible place to work"
bad,I was working on moving up the ladder when my position was eliminated along with my hope of progression.  Was basically offered my previous position.  Over 6 years of effort resulting in going back to the start.
bad,"Very fast paced environment, sink or swim very little training.  Low staffing and high expectations. I am an Assistant Manager and can say that I would leave Wal-Mart without hesitation if I found something to pay the same.  I have never been in trouble with my job, and do a great job... i just can not stand wal-marts attitude with their associates and their salary managers.  The market managers and above need to work in stores for a month or two to remember what its like.  Things have changed!"
bad,The store always was a challenge when you came to work. But I managed 2 stores and a outside warehouse. Hired the associates put new stores together and created the department into special orders. Dealing with OSHA and assistant managers and department managers.
bad,"Older staff either treat you like a chid or like you are suppose to know every thing already. Everyone gossips about each other and management is inconsistent. They tried ""team building"" but it was forced and not fun. No one monitored you or your breaks and it was up to you to figure it out with other associates. In the deli you would get in trouble if there were too many left-overs at night but yelled at if there was not enough food out on the hot counter."
bad,"I worked here for about five months. I was fine with the overnight stocking position. The only downside in the beginning was constantly being short-staffed. This was every single day that we had deliveries. Managers expect everything done regardless of call outs. Most nights, we were missing 2-3 stockers and a manager. "
bad,"The managers had there pick of favorite, so that was hard for others with experience to advance, When you know you are right about a situation and they listen to there favorites before you then it becomes an issue"
bad,Walmart was basically just a job until i could find something better. The managers gave you no reason to even wanna be there. I wouldn't recommend the highland village Walmart to anyone.
bad,"The culture was really diverse and nice atmosphere. At the time, really great Store Manager. Really organized and it was opportunity to learn a new job. Just not an chance to be grow."
bad,I really liked working here. Until it was close to me being there 6 months then they started cutting my hours and they end up laying me off. I couldn't afford it.
bad,Walmart is not a company I recommend working for long term. They do not treat their employees well and don't care about personal things that go on with them. The building manager only wants to save money at the expense of the little things the employees received such as the bonuses received quarterly for associates who have been there longer than two and a half years.
bad,First began as a great job. After a year manager moved to a new store and new manager killed morale of the employees in front end. She constantly made excuses for why the schedule was so short handed. Cashiers quit left and right because they weren't getting enough hours and often had to get other managers to schedule them as cashiers because the front end manager would not. Also the store manager was corrupt and swept things under the rug.
bad,"This place is best described as, largely unenjoyable. The co-workers during the time I was there where delightful the problem however was the customers and the job itself."
bad,"Walmart is a interesting place to work for. It starts off great but then you start getting less hours an before you know it you have a week off. Some managers look into it and are willing to help, while others just stare at you blankly. The associates who aren't managers help you the most and have your back through thick and thin."
bad,When you start off at this company they are definitely willing to give you hours but as time goes on they try to hire too many people in a department to save money. Another big issue is that there are too many managers and not enough employees. Most managers were a bit lazy and if you had questions or concerns you would be passed through manager after manager because none of them wanted to do anything and your issues would never be solved.
bad,"Don't bother working as an Order Filler for this company as you'd be completely expendable and replaceable at a moment's notice if god forbid something inconvenient happens in your personal life. Also I was told it was a 5-5 position and realistically it was more like 5-Whenever it was good for your managers to let you go, which is incredibly dishonest."
bad,"It's Walmart. If you have the stomach for it, you can go as far as you want to. But that isn't an appealing choice when you consider the work environment and management issues."
bad,"Walmarts number one rule is, respect for the individual. The store manager did not adhere to that policy when speaking with his associates. Therefore it made your job more difficult because it was hard to give store manager respect, when you were not shown respect from him."
bad,"Get there at 4 in the morning, work until 7:30, get my first break, take lunch at 8:50, work until I go home at 1.i learned stocking, labeling product, binning product, checking inventory, mod section work, price changes."
bad,Un environnement stressant manque d'effectif les gérants ne sont pas compréhensifs et demandent toujours plus. Trop d'exigences.
bad,"Work environment was not safe, associates were expected to work extra hours but when sick were limited in the time they could take off without being terminated."
bad,"get to work, get the job done ,learn  how to put a stone back in the ring. i have to manage the new employee    . has to be friendly and professional       trying to help a customer but having any luck   . helping customer and keeping them happy ."
bad,"Job was very stressful and unorganized, hours were not set to fix time outside of work. Management was poor, pay was not decent, no care shown for veteran employees"
bad,"Poor management. "
bad,"I went in informing them I had conditions that needed to be accommodated. The store I was at treated it like it was a burden, and those to did genuinely try to help were washed out by the higher ups. I felt very disposable and not at all cared about. It felt as though my achievements were nothing compared to my mistakes."
bad,"Walmart has changed management since I was employed there and I would say that is a great thing. The manager that was there when I was , was not helpful or friendly to associates."
bad,I like the company but the one store I was at was the worst store I worked in all the years I work for this company. I would never recommend the East Point store for you Walmart start
bad,"Walmart was the worst job I've ever had."
bad,Let me explain Walmart very quickly. Basically if you are not a assistant manager or higher on the food chain the company screws you over. You do not get full time if you are an hourly associate so that means zero benefits. Not a good place to work for unless you are very educated.
bad,"Walmart is unorganized. The supervisors are unprofessional. The store manager favor the supervisors, so she never want to hear your side of the story."
bad,"For the two years I worked at Walmart I learnt how to be positive even if everything around you is horrible. I also discovered that they boast that everything they do is not run by favoritism, well that's a lie."
bad,Work for Walmart twice!! Pay was good(for me) however job stability was not there and the work life balance was horrible...in saying that I know they have changed how they operate so I can not speak for their current structure
bad,"Spectrum believes that by providing our employees with a complete array of benefits, we can help them take care of the people who matter the most, both at work and at home. You will receive a total compensation package that includes monthly variable pay opportunities, generous benefits, discount pricing on our residential products (so long as you live within our service area) and more. You’ll also discover ample resources and encouragement that inspire career progression and help you grow at your own pace."
bad,"It wasn't a place u hated however it was constantly stressful, I was always tired, customers were rude on a daily basis. Management never seemed to be around when you needed them, and I had put everything into the company yet they fired me for leaving early too many times and I had only left early once."
bad,"While working for Walmart, I held multiple positions including, sales associate, department manager, zone merchandising supervisor, and asset protection.  The location that I worked at was extremely high stress and provided little to no leeway in hours that are desired be employees.  There were too many managers and not enough employees to finish all the tasks that seemed like busy work on top of priority work.  Even though I managed to be successful in this high stress environment, not everyone can."
bad,Unfortunately I was telephone operator dressing room assistant and any department close by needing help. Many times I was verbally abused by customers calling in needing assistance or a manager and no one to take the calls. Leaving me in a bad position to be blamed for customers dissatisfaction.
bad,I didn't like this job because I wanted to move up or at least change positions but they made it really difficult to do that no matter how hard I worked or how many times I asked.
bad,"Its very easy to do your job at Wal~Mart. However there are so many roadblocks to advancing in the company, its very difficult to move up. It isn't worth it. This is not an equal opportunity workplace for everyone. It's about who you know, which is extremely unfair. No matter how much they spout that everyone has a chance to advance in the company is an utter lie, I've seen it with my own two eyes. "
bad,"I found the job to be very disorganized.  They wanted you to do a million things at once and were not given the proper tools or time to do the job.  We were always short staffed and the attitude of the not only the customers, but also the employees, was poor."
bad,"too much favoritism towards management and associate that preform or do their share of work task well but kiss a** Very Well, and no appreciation to management and workers that actually perform well and over work them to pick up the slack of the ones that kiss a**!!"
bad,If you are planning to become a department manager I suggest you change your mind and run as far away as you can. More and more and more work will be piled onto your lap that you will never be able to get out from under and they expect you to get it all done in one day. Management above you is over worked and stressed so they take it out on you. Which will make your day even worse. Customers are non stop stupid. Children running all over the place by themselves. Walmart is were I would send my enemy to work. To torture that person until they have a break down. That's exactly what will happen to you if you work there. Terrible place to work. Absolutely terrible.
bad,I worked as an overnight stock associate for 9.50 a hour which could have been more for it being overnight but the employees always have attitudes and you can never ask a question because they never help you
bad,"They let me go because I started having leg problems and they may have though I would pin it on working with them since they looked like at first chemical burns and I worked as a Maintenance/mostly cleaner. So when I could not work their 100% any longer, they decided to pin it on me not calling them for calling in sick. And decided a doctors note was not enough to take some days off or make working there easier."
bad,"Here at Walmart, I learned a great deal of how to have great customer service. It taught me to talk to people in a way to converse but also get the job done well."
bad,"Working in Lawn and Garden, I expected to learn much about plants and the products my dept sold. I learned nothing. Most of my time was spent on the cash register. There were no CBLs for my dept except for a 20 minute snooze fest on how to patch a bag of mulch."
bad,"Management will only advance the people that they want to, doesn't matter your skills or how great you are with people. The only thing that is nice about wal-mart is having personal relationships with some customers"
bad,I enjoyed some of the people I worked with. The hours were all over the place lucky to get 8 hours off between shifts. At the time I worked at Walmart the pay was very low. When I put in my two weeks notice an Assistant Manager asked me to do something illegal at the service desk and I refused. I decide to end my time then.
bad,"Little flexibility with hours"
bad,It didn't take me long to move up. It used to be a good company to work for but now they aren't allowing scheduled consecutive days off. The medical insurance also is not very good at all. It has not changed for the better
bad,"The work at Walmart is simply and fun. However since the Walton family is no longer in control of the company the culture has shifted from what Sam Walton created and is now an atmosphere in which management looks down on their employees and treats them as disposable and beneath them. Money, the making of for the company and the saving of for the company is all that matters even if that means taking from the employees."
bad,My job at Walmart was as I expected it would be. I left because I was consistently scheduled outside of my availability and during my college classes.
bad,"Working as a freight crew worker at Walmart was okay. The job itself was fine, but the people and environment of the store was terrible. There were a few nice people but all in all I wouldn't recommend doing any freight work in the location I worked."
bad,"It did have an employees lounge which was good.  But Ii was just a basic job and nothing special about it.  I did meet some very nice people there.  Most all of the associates were very good people.  The management there was not good at all.  I would say it was not a great place to work but just an okay place.  Good place for retirees to work. "
bad,It was an ok job being a cart pusher is to me was kinda boring and very stressful to keep the cart full for customers I’ve been working there for about 6 month i like all of my co worker I would say Walmart would be a great way to get stared if you are looking for a first job
bad,Never had a manager while working there work 40 hours a week cause i didnt have no coworkers. Worked 8 hour shifts almost everyday only 2 breaks when knowing i was the only one working
bad,This was a part-time job for me and the only reason I kept working there is because I needed to help pay for school/living essentials. I had a lot of family things going on and I got really sick and they are not understanding at all. Everyone is replaceable and you do not count.
bad,"A typical day at Walmart start at 4AM. Management won't give you time to clock in before they start giving you assignments to do. The management  in LA is horrible they have no respect for there workers, They don't communicate with each other which is bad cause one manager will tell you direction then another one will tell you something else then your lost not knowing really what to do."
bad,The company doesn't care about its employees the benefits are good but needs better management and better reviews on discipline actions need more of a discount
bad,"llegar y esperar una caja disponible, aveces, tenias que ganarte una sin esperar antes porque la organización no era el fuerte de  este lugar."
bad,"I loved the people i worked with and my supervisor was awesome. The work was steady and competitive. The managers were incompetent, and rude. Wouldn't give you benefits or recognition."
bad,"In 20 years the culture that Sam Walton had created among the associates was iron clad. Take care of the people and they will give you  and our customer their best no matter what. The three basic beliefs and 5 customer beliefs were the foundation of a company that could not be stopped."
bad,"Learned much about all aspects of large retail operations.  Each store environment is different depending on the managers, some great, some not so much, like most places."
bad,This is an easy to obtain job. It does not require much by ways of experience. It's Walmart. I think the reputation of the company speaks for itself. Low paying job.
bad,"At the beginning working at Walmart was a pleasant experience but then after a month or two things changed drastically. Co workers were rude and talking about each other, running to management lying on other employees. They cut my hours for two weeks. Hours became ridiculous. Worked every single weekend for 6 months straight, 4 & 9 hour shifts turned strictly into 9 hour shifts so I had no personal life outside of Walmart because I wasn’t getting off until 10 or 11 at night. Management was always in there own little bubbles and never got stuff done when it came to schedules or anything else for that matter. I would say make this a part time job because if you do full time it will drive you crazy and tired, to much stress and repetitive work."
bad,"over worked"
bad,Most other managers were bad at their jobs. Ruled by fear to keep lower employees in place. Saw many people who were told they were getting promoted have the position given to someone else for seemingly no reason.
bad,"As a CAP 2 associate, we were expected to unload freight trucks and stock all consumable area's in our eight hour shift. In concept it sounds okay. We were supposed to have eleven, or more, associates scheduled per day and we're supposed to have our duties rotated."
bad,"Poor job advancement opportunities, little to no extra skill training such as management or leadership training, poor management, ""trickle down economics"" philosophy based company"
bad,"I hated working at walmart, the bosses had anger problems, lunch breaks was not on time, bosses fighting with customers, store was a mess. pay was even worse. I HATED IT."
bad,Good place to work if you don't have kids or if you're a student pay is low and they're no benefits however if you work nights you will have a set schedule with the same 2 days off each week
bad,"when I first started at Walmart it was an awesome place to work. Then Management changed and it went down hill. people started getting fired, employees were forced to pick up the slack. Now employees are leaving and its getting worse, but yet we are still not getting the hours  because a computer does the schedule."
bad,High stress job where the preferred action is always to coach the associates. Most stores have poor moral as associates work not to get fired instead of our of pride.
bad,"management staff not up to par when it comes to dealing with employees and situations that arise, they need more training on how to manage employees of different races and backgrounds"
bad,"un dia tipico en el trabajo  es  el desayuno muy delicioso."
bad,"This is not my idea of a career; it's just a paycheck.  While most of the hourly associates are okay in my department, there is a rampant cynicism about the place.  I don't blame people."
bad,Didn't like job while I was there. Managers we're all over the place and coworks didn't do there jobs. And mangers will have favorite employees and would single out people to do others job
bad,"Empresa que tem seus benefícios mas por outro lado tem um cultura totalmente exploradora, cheia de segundas intenções com os funcionários que se dedicam ao máximo, buscando sempre o lucro excessivo, e uma cobrança excessiva para cargos com muito pouca remuneração."
bad,Long hours and a lot of pressure to deliver results.  In my position I dealt with issues and compliance for the Company.  Shrink and Safety are major concerns that change daily.
bad,"The pay is actually pretty good for a job that doesn't require experience, but after working there for a more than a few months, it gets really depressing. The customers and most of the management treat you like garbage. Working there makes you feel like your life just isn't going anywhere."
bad,"Some of the management was never happy with you no matter what you did. Overall the job was just way too stressful to be worth it. The hours were too irregular as part time, you would receive no notice that they are about to cut back on hours, you are just told ""it will pick up in a few weeks""."
bad,Working for walmart is a good paying job but the extra stuff you have to put up with makes it not worth it in my opinion the building is ran down they GLS System is always down no carts to do ur job the list goes on and on
bad,I worked here long ago and from what I remember it was okay. Customers were nice and management let you work and trusted you were doing your job.  I would recommend Walmart to students
bad,"Show up, waste 15 + min on a meeting that was pointless."
bad,management is poor /unprofessional/retaliation ...Hispanics morning shifts ...black night shift ..unperfesiional department managers and co monagers ..no overtime..36hrs a week
bad,"Management doesn't care, will ignore when you call or page for them. The company doesn't care about you, if you even get one minute of overtime you get written up, but management ignores you when you need them so you get off on time."
bad,"I would say that working for Wal-Mart is like Forrest Gump's classic line. ""Life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get."" That explains Wal-Mart to the fullest. In most jobs, you typically get out what you put into it. Hard to agree with that logic in the case of the big retailer. Sam Walton's ideals and appreciativeness of his employees and customers is now just a fading memory. He would be proud of its' success, but very disturbed by the processes that go on to make it so."
bad,"You can learn a lot there , since you will be asked to do everything...it was hard to receive support ,poor recognition for management team. Over all I like it my hours and felt that I could grow there if I desire"
bad,"I am a Customer Service Rep at  Walmart, for the amount of things that I do, on a daily basis the Hourly rate should be more then what they are paying any Customer Service Rep. As for me I go above and beyond my job title.( I do Maintenance when we are short staffed, or they don't schedule anyone, I also do other positions so that we can continue to have a steady flow.) "
bad,"Walmart is a good place to work! No overtime,management never in the same pagetha is one of the worse part, to many direction from diferent manager that's not good"
bad,"Slow paced, sit there most of the day then get yelled at by managers for not doing anything, when you have the slowest part of the store. Good pay, but super stressful."
bad,"The management was a joke. They would ask you what makes you unhappy and how they could fix it but would never do anything about it. They tried to say me quitting was a surprise and that I should give them more time to find a replacement, but in the 3 months I expressed leaving they hired 3 people who all could not work my shift."
bad,"I worked at the Walmart Distribution Center from February to September 2017. The 3 months of training were ok, but after about 4 months I along with others began to figure out that the culture there was very misleading. They have all of these quotes from the founder Sam Walton all over the place, but management failed to truly live by them which in turn made for a terrible work environment. It's corporate all the way. I've heard that working there used to be great, but those 7 months were anything but. Ironically, I feel as though working at the actual store is probably better, but I could be wrong."
bad,"A typical day was very busy. Direct Management was very temperamental and vindictive. Hardest part of the job was being on your feet all day. Workplace culture tended to be cutthroat to some degree. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all the customers, some became very good friends over the year and a half that I worked there."
bad,"Management team is weak at best. There is a severe lack of direction and care with the majority of management, and the sales floor can easily show that at times."
bad,"Unrealistic expectations are made of the associates.  Retail so evenings, weekends and of course holidays are expected to be worked. Not a lot of support from management."
bad,Low pay. I worked there for 6 years and all of the new employees started either making more than me or starting out at about what I was making after six years.
bad,"The job is good considering the amount of hours they provide, but managment tends to find it difficult to work with a students schedule given time off that is needed during exam time."
bad,Although I do not think Walmart is a great place to work I can not deny that it is a very good starter job because they teach a lot of basic jobs like how to handle money.
bad,"Its not the worse place to work, not the best either. Schedule in inconsistent. Does not like to work with you on the schedule. Especially when you school schedule changes. Have to request off and beg just to have a specific date off."
bad,"Poor management.  Employees tend not to care about how well, or if they do their job.Very short staffed so policies, including safety and training policies were below company standards."
bad,Great starter job decent benefits fast paced decent environment flexible no fixed schedule easy to learn great opportunities to move up decent pay decent overall
bad,"Although given a specific task, the job requires an associate to place customer service as the priority; requiring a pause in on-going work activities to assist customers in findings an item or directing the customer to where an item may be located within the store."
bad,"Face-Pace, High pressure work place with poor work life balance and not enough compensation. Long hours and odd work hours with work on most weekends and all holidays. The compensation for the work require is insufficient."
bad,"When I first started working at Walmart I loved my job. Now we have a new store manager that is unfair and very rude. Associates cant speak with him without him having an attitude or embarrassing us in front of whoever is around. When head people are around he attitude gets better but the second they leave he's back to being rude and disrespectful. I work at Walmart in "
bad,This Walmart was just a big Patton place. We were grown people and needed to be treated like one. Pay was extremely low for what they wanted you to do and didn't like to work on Christmas evening.
bad,The company was taking our vacation pay. Werent able to use sick time unless we used it for short term disability. The people I worked with were like family. The company was supposed to be family friendly but they we not.
bad,Salario bajo en promedio con otras empresas con puestos acordes
bad,"Don't set your expectations too high, but the job isn't absolutely awful. Underpaid and unable to qualify for benefits unless you work 6 months FULL TIME, which is only available 3rd shift."
bad,"60% of hourly Wal Mart employees receive food stamps and SNAP benefits, the management treats you as inhuman. If you are good at your job, they WILL NOT PROMOTE YOU, for fear of losing your work. Employees purposely kept at part time hours to avoid having to pay benefits. All weekends/holidays on."
bad,"My immediate supervisor was impossible, but the evening store manager was very fair and fun to work for.  I worked during the holiday season.  Black Friday was an amazing experience, that I would not want to experience again.  I was initially told I would have a job, after Christmas.  Two days later, I was called into the office and told, that was my last day, get my things, and leave."
bad,"I would not work there again, the management was out of line on a lot of things and not properly trained. My direct manager had to ask me for help a lot."
bad,It can be a great place to work if the managers would do  there job and stop waiting on the cashiers and floor workers to do it. Everyone wants to me boss and the store is going unattended.
bad,"Suggestions or safety issues over looked after we bring it to their attention. No matter how many floor managers want an employee at a position, supervisors ignore the request."
bad,Management is always rotating that you never get to fully adjust to or trust them. Pay is low and the discount is ridiculous for such a big company 10%. You can meet some good workers/friends.
bad,I had a tough go at Walmart. My manager of several years was incompetent and got the job because she married one of the higher ups. She kept promoting inexperienced people to run my department and the place was constantly a mess.
bad,Go in there do your job and go home . The only thing that they care about is sales .Most of the good managers have left .Poor training so ask questions
bad,My work place was very stressful because there was always to much work with little help what so ever because the store did not have enough associate to work with.
bad,"If you're not a favorite, you can't go anywhere in this company. Management tosses responsibility to one another constantly, no solid communication. Benefits almost worth putting up with every obstacle."
bad,management is unfair and hostile. pay is decent in electronics dept starting me at $12 but after one year of service I'm ready to leave! friendly environment with sales floor associates. Culebra and tezel location has a high internal and external shrink rate.
bad,"Worked for walmart for 5 years. At the first store I worked at things were prety great honestly. Management was pretty cool. What I did was solid but when I transferred and became a dept. manager things went to the birds. Management was poor, store was poor, it was all just terrible after the transfer"
bad,Management is ineffective and incompetent. They institute policies & rules they don't follow. Instead of fixing the underlying issues they just don't.
bad,"Okay place to work for a year or two. Not a good career choice."
bad,A typical day is filled with updating of reports and interaction with senior management. I have learned that I can't trust everyone with confidential information. Management doesn't seem to care and is checked out. The culture of Walmart is great if you can get over the politics. The hardest part of the job is being walked all over. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to assist associates in moving their careers.
bad,"A typical day included customers in a rush, rude customers, happy customers, customers that didn't want you to talk to them. I learned where things are in walmart and how everything works in walmart."
bad,"Worst job i have ever had. I would have to open and close sometimes because people always would quit, the deli is most hard work in the whole entire store the only up side was getting to eat food  all day."
bad,Horrible management support. You will work your butt off and management will set you up for failure. As long as they look good they don't care what happens to their employees
bad,No advancement unless you don't need work/life balance. Be available 24/7/365. Or know the right people. Low hours and non competitive pay. No benefits for part timers who get under 30 hours a week. Benefits that are given are not good.
bad,It was a strange job to go to after fast-food and took me off guard. First they sit you in a room for  training on computers then boot you to the floor for hands on training and some people leave you by yourself even if you aren't finished training.
bad,"Upper management does not communicate any decisions to lower level managers and this makes lower managers decision making process harder."
bad,no overtime allowed. the pay is not good. the people are friendly for the most part. all management cares about is hitting their metrics. the schedule each week is filled with random work hours. no consistency what-so-ever.
bad,"Management. Management. Management is my biggest complaint, they are outrageously disrespectful, and do not listen to their employees complaints, concerns, or ideas. They have something called an open door policy meaning you are suppose to be able to openly voice your thoughts of how the store is running and how it can be improved, and management is ignorant and completely disregards that policy. And the amount of pay that you receive for the unnecessary stress management places on you is unjustified. Wal-Mart employees are treated like garbage, an item you can throw away after its used."
bad,Unloading trucks and placing items that were on the pallets in the correct area of Walmart for someone to place them on the shelves.   Organizing product as it come off the truck
bad,"It was nice cause nights goes by fast, some of the people were just to rude for me to want to stay there any longer. It wasnt a bad place to work, just not the best."
bad,"management is unorganized, management does listen to employees concerns, does not make a very customer friendly schedules when it comes to sales floor employee, but they do pay well but only get one annual raise"
bad,"It was a very backstabbing environment."
bad,"If you don't mind working hard and long then the job is ok. In times of crises (Natural disasters) you are expected to be available for work up until the last minute and as soon the issue is over you are expected to come back to work. Walmart doesn't care about you or your family now matter how much they say they do. Walmart cares about their numbers and their dollars. That is also why management is bad, they don't care about you they acre about their numbers."
bad,"I enjoyed helping the customers find just the right gift, but the company as a whole was not very organized and very stressful.  However, given the chance, I might work there again if the salary was right."
bad,"We would arrive at work and plan out which loads were imperative to get stocked, make out a priority list. I would then assign different employees to different task. Although supervising, I had a task as well. The most enjoyable part of the job was the end of the work night."
bad,"After working at my local Walmart Distribution Center for 3 years, staying late and receiving commendations for my work performance going above and beyond - I was terminated without warning for a commonplace offense that was complained against me some 8 months previous. "
bad,"The store manager shows favorites to certain employees.  People always quiting, lack of staff,  have to work on Christmas, and we work for little pay."
bad,A lot of rules and regulations that change all the time .......if you can't handle change then this is not the place for you......this goes for any Walmart job.......... Do something they don't agree with & it turns into a write up or termination........simple
bad,i had a good time with my co-workers but the management was not very good unfair work schedules and rude management other then that i had a great supervisor..
bad,"The management underwent 3 changes in the short time that I was employed there, each one worse than the previous. The work itself was not terrible, in fact it was rather dull at times."
bad,"Very steady"
bad,Many dedicated associates.  It is not what Sam Walton originally set out for his company and associates.  Associates are just a number and are always replaceable.
bad,"great management. hours were poor, pay was worse and no room for advancement. barely able to pay the bilss. when asked for more money or hours was handed a pamphlet for my local wellfare office."
bad,"The management is horrible.Depending on the store manager overtime might be offered,but eventually they will cut your hours. i have to say the benefits are not so bad."
bad,"They don't know what they're doing as a corporate business. The benefits are great and they pay decently enough, but the people on top are just making money and  not caring how the stores are run. They do the absolute least and worse work they can and expect the poo to run downhill and get picked up by the store workers, causing confusion, stress, and the inability to properly and safely complete tasks throughout the stores work forces. They dont order materials half the time and they hire less then as many ppl as they need and workers oick up multiple work loads as a result. OSHA needs to run through the stores and fine them and get them in gear. They need a whole makeover from the way they're run to the way they present themselves."
bad,wlamart is a good company with poor management team.  they over work you and under pay you. the management team take advantage of the staff and only recognize their friends in their circls
bad,"I was disappointed with this employer.  The scheduling was not employee friendly.  They would schedule to work late one night and early the next day.  Management was downright hateful.  Employee moral was low.  When customers, employees and management all complain  something is very wrong!"
bad,Management is the reason this place is failing. I know most places have bad managers but Walmart tops the cake. They don't care about their employees. They treat you like a kid and only promote friends and family. So much favoritism.
bad,"Walmart is a high stress job, that doesn't appreciate the work put forth by it's workers. They take things for granted. Put unfair quota demands on employees and put more emphasis on volume rather than quality and customer service, although they claim the opposite."
bad,Hours always vary.  No set schedule.  Low pay. Management doesn't communicate together.  Its almost like working with adults who act like elementary or high school kids.  Too much drama.
bad,I enjoyed my job untill it snowed and management refused to deice the side walks resulting in a fall. I was injured and put on light duty. My light duty was not followed and when i told my supervisor thwy took me off the schedule and said i quit. Then tried to say that i was never injured at walmart. Awful company!
bad,"Walmart is....well, Walmart. They treat you like garbage, all the while maintaining a façade of altruism. Bad pay, tedious work, nothing is ever good enough. Give them good work and they keep raising the bar, without raising the compensation. They play around with your hours, put you in positions you aren't hired for. Not a pleasant company to work for. Best as an in-between job or entry level. Not career material."
bad,"I only stayed with this company for as long as i have because I was trying to buy a house and was told that the longer I held that job, the better my chances are to buy a house but I was too hopeful in thinking I could save up with the lousy salary they gave me. Some Wal-Mart stores aren't as bad as others, but it is a very shady company still."
bad,"The management has there favorites and they do not pay you enough for the work you do.  Its about who you know not about your work ethics.  The people who gets promoted and the ones who is liked the most, not better work ethics."
bad,"From my years with the company I have been able to see a large number of changes. It has been a mix of good and bad, but it is human nature to focus on the negative points so start with the good. Hours are fairly consistent, a large number of coworkers are good and nice people. Now the bad, large numbers of managers trained to micro manage, the ones who try and work side by side with the associates are the ones who tend not to last sadly. In the last few years we have seen a reduction in full-time new hires, and staffing per shift has dropped, with that comes a larger work load per person and timed completion via a task list. Culture will differ per state and per market, as such no way to judge off of the views of one individual."
bad,"I enjoyed working with some of my co-workers, but the management is not competent when it comes to scheduling and daily tasks. There are many nights that I close the deli department (which is my regular shift) by myself because management fails to schedule you with another co worker when one calls out, they just don't care. Some co workers that kiss up to management get promoted but I would not care to get promoted at this particular store. The pay is also low compared to all the work and cleaning you have to do. The managers can be very disrespectful and condensing by how they talk to you. The most enjoyable part of the job were some of my coworkers who are nice and fun to work with. It is also cool that these coworkers understand the job culture at this store."
bad,"Workers get treated like slaves by management, while they do nothing. Customers treat employees like they are less than them. Wouldn't recommend employment here unless absolutely necessary."
bad,"At Walmart I'd spend 10 hour days labeling and tossing boxes at an extremely fast pace weighing anywhere from 5 to 70lbs. I enjoyed the benefits and year long stable work. Not my ideal job but I considered it a stepping stone to where I want to be. I believe my skills are better utilized when using my mind and communication with others are integral. I injured my back sixth months in and had trouble hitting production after returning from my leave of absence. Management wasn't the best, the work environment wasn't the best but I understood not to expect much in those areas considering where I was working."
bad,"Not the family friendly company I started with 189 yrs ago.   The compensation is better than anybody else, but not worth it for work life balance.   Better to make less somewhere else."
bad,"Managers are unforgiving, if they like you you'll have an easy time if they don't they will work you til you are fired or quit. Other employees are nice and try to help each other."
bad,I currently work for walmart and have for almost 9 years and have a lot of retail experience from there. I just want to get a better career change and new experience.
bad,"Being a sales associate, you deal with people more often than not, as well as keep everything organized and ready to go. You have to be able to talk to people in this role. As well as get along with the people you work with, for there is no set role for an individual. If you make enemies, then you may very well get left hanging on the floor by yourself."
bad,"Fast paced work areas all over the store. "
bad,Walmart is modern day slavery they want you to do 50 things for the same pay they do not want u to move up in the company unless you are a suck up then they do not believe in family they want you to put your family last and them first
bad,Upper management make it hard to coach and hold staff accountable and will find a way to progress you if you don't do things their way even if they are wrong or drowning the business.
bad,"The system was good at first but then they changed associates to customer sales experience. Instead of 1-3 associates per department, it is now 1-4 departments per associate. Also, we weren't given training in each department so when customers ask for help, they get frustrated because we cannot find the item(s) and we get embarrassed. Lastly, they barely give 15 hours a week to most associates then they call us everyday to come in when really they should learn how to schedule in people. This is why everyone from Walmart is quitting."
bad,not customer driven as they claim. Cares more about profit margins than customer service and the treatment of hourly associates. management doesn't respect hourly associates. Salaried manangers forced to work 12 to 14 hour days.
bad,If you do your job and go home you will always have a job. The rules are mapped out with not much gray area. Follow the rules and there is also room for expanding.
bad,"J'ai aimé le travail de pose de pneus, service aux clients changement huile, caissier et autres départements. Ce que j'ai le moins aimé est que notre supérieur est partie en maladie peu de temps après mon embauche et remplacé par une personne qui ne connaissait rien dans le domaine du garage. Il ne se rappelait jamais de notre prénom. J'avais toujours mon horaire dernière minute. J'ai demandé le cours manquant pour travailler Walmart de Chicoutimi à la demande du supérieur du Garage à Jonquière lors de ma visite et mon supérieur de Rimouski ne savait pas c'était quoi. Il  me donnait "
bad,"I learned how to deal with a stressful, fast-paced work environment. I learned how to deal with rude customers, a low salary, no benefits, and no chance for advancement because of ""coverage""."
bad,There was no room for error within the company. Any mistakes were grounds for immediate termination. Stressful work environment. There was no encouragement .
bad,"Not equal too much  favoritism going on in this company. They tell you one thing but it is another, for an example I was hired to work the morning shift which was five in morning to two in the evening.  After they hired me a couple of weeks later they  decided they no longer needed that shift after  inventory was over. I feel it wasn't  fair to the associates that was hired for that shift which they did not want to place the reminding associates on another shelf that was convenient for them, which I was one of those associated so I decided to resign."
bad,"Not exactly the kind of company to work for. I am just saying it because the management of the company believes that they can always hire a newbie and train that individual to become a pro, which isn't possible."
bad,"Wal-Mart is a large company that could treat employees with more respect. Unfortunately the organization is very hard to work for and due to changing schedules and lack of proper staffing, the organization constantly changes schedules and requires multiple days of mandatory overtime. This not only lowers team moral, but causes a large number of employees to quit due to job dissatisfaction. Last, but most important, managers are not very well trained and this causes managers to not listen to employee concerns and has actually caused employees to be scared to express issues or concerns. The most enjoyable parts of the job are when overtime is not required, that an employee knows when they will be working, the pay is very reasonable for the work, and the benefits offered are well above standards."
bad,Walmart would be a good place to work if the upper management was more organized and helpful. Cap team 2 is the hardest working crew and get paid the least in the store.
bad,"I started my day with meeting with more than 50 employee in the morning to give them previuous day sale and the outline of the day.  I emphasized on merchandises to focus on and provide great customer service. worked too long hours, however, i've learned how to manage all the different department in the store as the Operation Manager.  I enjoyed the smile on customers face at the end of their shpoping which motivate me to want to be there everyday."
bad,the job itself isn't to bad and it can be a fun place to work however the pay is not enough the workload and the expectation placed upon employees is to high for such a low wage
bad,"Poorly managed. The store and fellow workers were great to be around, but I could not see myself there long term due to the management being so sub-par."
bad,"This job was easily the most stressful job I have ever worked at. Management was poor, there was a huge lack of communication and the expectations were set almost too high to reach."
bad,"Management can turn a good staff into the worst, and that is exactly what happened at my location. Over crowding of other store employees sank the ship further."
bad,i worked my butt off during my short time here basically as a janitor and was let go the week after Christmas along with several other staff  witch i see as cruel and not work friendly..
bad,"If you NEED a job, short-term or temporary then go for it. But, you are very disposable to the company so don't buy into their talk about workplace culture. Their rules change and they have selective enforcement. They will work you to death if you let them, and if even you are a hard worker, while you may receive short-term praise, it won't last- the first time you slack or say no to something- they will be looking to replace you. Between the workplace drama among the associates and the impossible to meet expectations of management its not worth the toll to your physical health and sanity. If you have to work here, go to work, do your job, and leave! Don't make friends, don't gossip, don't chit-chat in the breakroom, and DON'T complain! do what you have to do to get your paycheck and leave! The pay could also be so much better."
bad,Management is not considerate of your health nor personal life. The pay is horrible. There was no good benefits. There was never enough coverage in order to complete your daily task.
bad,"Job Security as long as you show up and dont be late. You'll be fine. "
bad,"Too much expectations, hard to get morning shift, when you do good they expect more,  unless you are morning shift you don't get much recognition for hard work"
bad,"Job Was great the first few years, Now very stressful. Management Talks to the Employees any kind of way. My co-workers are great people that help make the time fly by. I would not spend Much time at walmart Unless your looking to Advance into management."
bad,"walmart was a nice place to work for, and they could be again if they  were more intune to what they are doing to there good employees. They are making the work harder not smarter. For an example most of the time the managers aren't on the same page, they are unorganized when it comes to handling there assoicates; they give us something to do that they think is ready and waiting on us, but the fact is valueable time is wasted because nothing is as they thought it was. I am an old school person I want to earn my money by working not standing around and not have something to do for there is always something I can do, so instead of me standing around and doing nothing I make a suggestion about what and where I could be until they are ready for me to do the job they wanted me to do. Most of the time they go along with it. Walmart over looks the people that have been there for years and are looking to move up."
bad,"If you like a lot of undue stress, then work for Wal-Mart.  You have to put Wal-Mart first or you won't make it. Good benefits and decent money for managers, but your trade-off is no home life."
bad,"Management at the Walmart building I work at is very poorly oriented, seems to lie to associates on the daily basis about anything asked. Only good part would be other associates."
bad,Only things I had a problem with was the management. When I first started I was thrown into things without properly being trained. The benefits are nice to have and the pay is decent. The work area and amount of stress that comes with it just was not worth it.
bad,They never have enough cashiers. You can never find a manager or a CSM around when you need one. Half of the items either have the wrong price or a missing the price.
bad,"I would work multiple positions in this company and the pay was horrible. I worked as a cahier, cake decorator and in the deli. I was always busy and I didn't feel appreciated."
bad,Any given day you may take on more work load than originally planned for.  Which is fine provided the essentials for work are their at your store with reason to not.
bad,"My experience with working at WalMart is mixed. The people I work with are mostly good. the management is just the opposite. They are not trained to be good leaders so they try bullying. Their mantra is ""lead by intimidation"". They don't get the best out of people by using these techniques, but that doesn't seem to make a difference."
bad,Manage treated associates poorly and out to much pressure on them without proper coverage. The store constantly changed hours without asking and pulled associates to other departments when the departments they were hired for had little to no coverage on a daily basis.
bad,"Everyone already knows about Walmart. They don't pay the staff enough and want them to work hard and fast. They need a better incentive program and when it comes to being sick, they could careless. I appreciated the job when I needed it but I wouldn't never want to return."
bad,"Walmart is a very unorganized business,very uncaring  of  they're associates. Walmart is a very fast paced business. Walmart is under staffed. Walmart is under wages. Walmart management is known to belittle there associates. The walmart store manager will also belittle her management team in front of one another. Walmart only allows the management team an hour lumch,no breaks."
bad,"You were promised training and never received it.  I enjoyed the assignment and workplace atmosphere.  People very friendly."
bad,"Expect way too much, but never want to give proper help to get the tasks done. They never give compliments, they only break you down for what you're not able to complete. The management team is rude and lazy."
bad,If you are a Millenial. The culture will be very slow and very little opportunity for career growth. There is a lot of reorganization and management is too busy to develop associates. Lacks diversity in Home Office setting.
bad,"It's not a hard job, its not the worst job, but there could be improvements on how management treats their employees at times and how they deal with customer complaints."
bad,"When i started Walmart pharmacy it was great , learning new things , opening a new store was awesome cause you started from the beginning , but once we opened and business wasnt great they started cutting everyones hours in half , I did work with a great group of people"
bad,"Great workplace "
bad,"Good company to work for , we begin our day with emails, stocking, customer service and working with the policies provided . The culture is vibrant with different scenarios and understanding. Team involvement and recognition is a part of our lives. The hardest part is dealing with skids overload and the enjoyable part of the job is working towards attaining profit so definitely increasing sales."
bad,"But not great to stay for years. Management does not treat you fairly, let alone great. You get a raise once a year, and its % based. So its not very much. The attendance policy has changed and you have to be there everyday even if you're deathly sick. They don't accept doctors notes. And its like high school all over again."
bad,"Walmart is like any other retail workplace. Customers always right when they're wrong, managers cut hours when you need them most, and supervisors don't care about your work. Not a job where you want to work in the long term."
bad,"As long as you can do your job at the minimum your will keep it. If you are not a brown noser, then fear for your job. make sure to follow the attendance policy to the letter. if  not you will be terminated right away."
bad,"I really thought Wal-mart would be a great place to work.  Veteran friendly, they were the first company to reach their hand out and said ""come on in"". The only thing about Wal-mart is that each store is ran differently, so my experience at store A is completely different than somebody who works at store K. There was (is) a high turnover of managers in the store.  The most consistent part of working here is its inconsistencies. Store A; everybody was treated as if they were expendable, so there is no family type atmosphere."
bad,"Working with Walmart is most likely how you can imagine it to be. Being as large as it is, the compensation isn't going to blow your mind, and insurance premiums are ridiculously high. It's a good job to have if your just needing a job, and in some instances, you can build a career here, but most of the time there are better opportunities out there, especially if you look for them."
bad,"Stock Shelves, Unload stock from trailers, Organize stock, Decorate events. Assist customers, Work cash register, make sure that everything is in order"
bad,Rutherford Blvd Walmart was unprofessional and rude. I was half way trained to do my job properly. I worked a little less than other college kids because of my rigorous school  schedule so I forgot how to perform certain actions on the register and supervision acted as if me asking for help was the worst hint in the world. I was getting on their nerves.
bad,Checking in with management to see if there is some were ells that they might need for me to do. If not then I will report to the register where I am need. There are some managers that you talk to about any thing at work or about your work schedule if there is a problem and then there are some that you can not even talk to them about a problem about any thing there at work. Everybody gets along with all of the works. It would have to be trying to get the customers to  get are credit cards. It would have that I get to talk with all of my customer.
bad,I learned customer service in different areas of the store. It was just ok job. What I like most was my fellow coworkers. You have to deal with severl different types of personalities.
bad,"I think this company does not meet the standards for a ""great"" place to work . A company that makes the amount they do should pay better and then our pay is biweekly😭😭"
bad,"It started out good, but when people left my department, they did not hire replacements and the stress level is high to do the job that several people did at the beginning when I started working there.  "
bad,Very difficult to work for. They do not appreciate your work ethics or opinions. All they seem to care about us how much work they can get out during your shift. No consideration for age or physical abilities.
bad,Management doesn't listen to the associates that work under their supervision. Any suggestion that is made to improve the quality of work falls at WM4129.
bad,I stock milk and eggs and that is most of what I do. Usually unload frozen truck. Haven't really learned much of anything the job is quite repetitive and decently boring. Hardest part of the day is when it is busiest in the afternoon. Most people are friendly. Most enjoyable part of the day is lunch break.
bad,Move on. The small discount you get is nice but it doesn't apply to everything. They work you hard and with little training. I worked here while i finished my degree and then got out.
bad,"10 hour work days on my shift with only two 15 minute breaks offered. "
bad,"Agradável de trabalhar, funcionários amigáveis e dispostos a ajudar quem está começando, você não se sente constrangido de forma alguma. Existem supervisores melhor preparados e alguns menos preparados. A gerência de algumas áreas deixa um pouco a desejar. Equipamentos de trabalho, principalmente na área dos caixas quando dão algum defeito, leva uma eternidade para arrumar e isso prejudica o desempenho e velocidade de atendimento. A empresa serve uma excelente alimentação no local, cozinha muito higienizada "
bad,"easy job, but poor pay, and conditions. Scheduling is somewhat difficult, and not all that easy to fit needs. Care more about their needs than the needs of their employees."
bad,This is an okay part time job. Frustrating when we don't always have the tools we need to do the job. Ask managers for help and often don't get a response depending on who is on duty at the time. I do enjoy working with the public and helping people when they need assistance.Salary is actually fairly competitive and a discount on most items after 90 days.
bad,Competitive Salary and Benefits yet no work life balance or job security. Constant Layoffs especially affecting long term associates. Can not make a life long career due to round after round of Layoff's
bad,"Working for Walmart has its days like any other job. I worked in the Outdoor/Garden area and what all they asked of you out there, I don't think it was worth the pay."
bad,"Never a consistent schedule, schedule changes without your knowledge, yet you are penalized if you miss a shift. Management is incompetent. Store managers have no control, corporate controls all based on store numbers without ever visiting the store"
bad,Walmart is a great place to work at if you have good management. If a proper amount of employees are in their designated areas are doing their jobs then things go smoothly
bad,Over use associates and treat them like numbers. You have to know someone to advance. It is a good job while going to school. ................................
bad,"to many good people are getting let go because of errors by management. at first its very pleasant. they try to make you feel like they care and appreciate you. but if you make one mistake you can loss your job. things change at the drop of a dime and the company doesn't communicate well to let employees well enough so that you can perform task without error. if you dont like to be micro-managed, this job is not for you."
bad,They do NOT take doctors notes and punish you for being sick. The managers are rude and unfriendly.....................................................
bad,"This company has poor management system, they just look out for "
bad,I worked after college on the sales floor and assembly.  I did my job and went home.  I worked my way up to be in charge of the safety team.  Managers were ok and days went by fast.
bad,To focused on just customer's & not the employee's that have to help the customer's. They need a better policy put into play.. Help the employee's help them with customer service
bad,I was a front end manager and it was a very stressful job.  It was hard to get support from the management team due to the customer is always right even when they are wrong.
bad,Good secure job that eventually grinds you into a pulp. Advancement is all but guaranteed as long as you are diligent in your work. Expect to do anything and everything
bad,"If you are looking for a career I would not recommend Walmart retail locations. Hours come and go based on the stores sales, as for those in a salaried position, the work life balance is not great."
bad,Treats workers poorly.  Assumes workers can do the work of several people if one person calls off when the amount of work is already causing most of them to have a hard time even accomplishing the task.  Management is unaware of what the work entails when giving directions which also leads to a lot of confusion and delays in work.
bad,The upper management loves to dictate to managers what they should make associates do in job performance. They expect department managers to get 12 hours of work done in 8 hours and do the work of 3 people. Some district managers like to flirt with people they shouldn't and bribe management jobs if he doesn't get information he wants to hear when one of flirtees makes poor complaints. Very unethical company.
bad,Walmart managers weren't the best at first it was welcoming. The job became worst and worst the managers treat you like you are not human. The job did not make me feel as though I was welcomed or going to hair a good day.
bad,Great place to work  and management is pretty to cool to work with . If I didn't have to relocate I would still be there. The environment is always loud.
bad,Very customer oriented in any role. Gained vast amount of leadership skills. Managers are very negative and can be belittling. Work environment is supposed to be friendly but most are ignorant to customers. Handling inbound freight daily and nightly. Meet some great people and working as a team. Bonus incentives to promote best possible results and pushing Walmart products
bad,This is a decent job to work at for the pay but the management team is very poor. Hardly any hours. No chance to get full time. Management picks favorites.
bad,some customers were hard to deal with and some were great most days it could be a good place to work for others it was not most managers were friendly and would work with you where some would not I would recommend Wal-Mart to a friend
bad,"I understand that Walmart is a huge company, but I had worked there for almost 3 months before I ever even met the store manager. I was only ever introduced to 5 people: two ladies in hr, the lady I stood beside while training, and two csrs at the front end."
bad,é uma empresa que não deu muita oportunidade de crescimento aonde a chefia não é qualificada para o cargo.
bad,"Much talent within the organization but ceremony triumphs over substance, especially within marketing. Bloated because nobody is spending their own money."
bad,"Great pay, but they cut hours and took away our holiday pay. They ask you to do multiple jobs and do not pay you extra. The benefits are not good and they do not tell you when the policies change."
bad,"Our store was a great place to work and shop. Management changed and allot of assistant and co- management left, got sick todie to overwhelming stress. Hours were cut and promotion was almost impossible. Due to lack of hours associates that has been with Wal-Mart went elsewhere."
bad,"Too demanding on work"
bad,"being hourly was great got lots of overtime pay....made bank.But making a big mistake like going salary was the worse thing that could have been done...was used and abused.Always sleep deprived,But you cant be a door map unless u lay down"
bad,I enjoyed working there. Its a very good company to work for. some of the managers just had very nasty attitudes they didnt know how to talk to their peers
bad,"The people at walmart were all good peeps when I was working there, but management made things very cut-throat. I think this was by design however, as I was employed for a very short time, before let go due to the expiration of the Winter Season Hire Fest. Sure Walmart was slow to hire me, and quick to fire. Despite this the people I worked with for the most part people ahead. This has also changed I noticed since I was laid off."
bad,"No holiday pay, $10 hr starting pay, pto, full-time insurance, quarterly bonus, part-time/Tempory starting out... Almost impossible to get full-time unless hired in management. Not very family oriented. Management/associate communication poor. Training poor and very high turn over rate"
bad,"Companies want double & triple the production, with no help & no over time.... it was a really good place to work but the turn overs are really high & you can never get your work accomplished, because there isn't enough time in the day to get it all done.... training is a joke, they want to throw people in there with no training & bark orders...."
bad,"Trabalhei como jovem aprendiz na empresa. Os funcionários são maravilhosos, porém a gerência e, principalmente, a área de recursos humanos tem muito a desejar."
bad,I would not recommend it. Walmart needs a union to get rid of all the the bull that goes along with working there. I would run away I wouldn't work here it is terrible
bad,I worked there for 6 months never had a day off that was paid i did not like it. For the job of unloading 2 some times 3 trucks a day pay was not good at all
bad,I am working hard in Walmart and ABM hard with them because that's my jobs!  When I work there sometimes they was ask me for over time and then I'm gonna work over time to!
bad,Walmart is a great place to work for basic associates but the higher you go the less they treat you less like a person and the more they treat you like a slave
bad,"I actually enjoyed working for Walmart at the tarpon springs location, However when I transferred to another store it was all downhill. Depending on who manages the store really makes a difference."
bad,It was a job that paid the bills. Great for start up career. But keep pushing forward to find something better to improve your self worth. It is a good stable job.
bad,"did not like the way that they teach you."
bad,The job has it's challenges for older adults and hard working employees looking to move up in the company. They have quarterly bonuses that are based on specific criteria.
bad,Great Benefits if the stores satisfies sales and profit goals. The work culture keeps you on your toes and the job constantly changes. You have to be on top of your game to satisfy your personal and professional goals.
bad,"Not much to say, really. The pay is low, advancement opportunities are scarce, favoritism is shown. Don't make this a life choice, but if you need a job to get you through school or until you can find a better one, it will do the trick."
bad,They dont hire people full time anymore. There so many rules like meal vialation that keeps employees wrote up.  It just not a fun place to work.  They dont allow you to help cutomers while on break and it makes you look rude. They schedule you for 4 hours shifts at a time not worth the drive.
bad,I like working at Walmart and helping our customers by making them happy and getting along with all my co workers. But I decided I wanted to better myself and get a better job so I can take care of me and my daughter
bad,"They only offer benefits to those who are there after 90 days. They will make complete use of your physical capabilities. Only two managers were decent. Did a lot of truck work/stocking. Hardest part of the job was dealing with managers in my area and finishing truck."
bad,Es un poco pesado ya que en ocaciones no cuentas con el apoyi de los gerentes de tienda y eso ocaciona conflictos
bad,While working here I was very stressed. I would have to pick up the slack from other employees calling in but then I'd get reprimanded if something wasnt done fast enough while i was trying to make up for the people that had called in. VERY STRESSFULL
bad,"Walmart is a great company to work for. The benefits arent that good, but the pay is decent. plus you get profit share annually if you are with the company for over a year. When it comes to life/work balance its fairly poor and they dont really care what you have going on outside of work. The company hires a diversity of people which is nice to see. The hours are overly long BUT the break times are very generous. Its a great job to get your foot in the door but not if you want to stay there for a long time, it drains your energy and enthusiasm towards others."
bad,"A typical day at work includes coming in a figuring out if you have enough staff to run smoothly that day. Then it includes multiple managers to give you a list of things to do and each one says that their task is priority or more important. "
bad,"There was rarely ever a time where I was happy being at work. It was as if the associates did all the work while the managers sat back and watched and only stepped in if their job was in jeaprody. Regardless of why you missed work, even with a doctor's note, would still count against you."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to wk there because the job is stressful and management has no respect for the individual..there is no holiday pay only PTO if yu accumulate any!!
bad,"I was placed at a Walmart almost an hour away from my home, and denied a hardship transfer. The manager actually laughed at me when I asked for one. I wasn't making enough to pay bills or eat; my paycheck barely covered my transportation costs."
bad,"Treats employees, as well as customers like they're disposable. Corporation only cares about money, not employee concerns. Management goes through ""Academy Training"" which effectively brainwashes the person."
bad,"Starting out its okay, but dealing with customers who think they can treat you less then other people because its Walmart is terrible. Its not worth the stress..."
bad,"My experience at Walmart was for the most part was enjoyable the first year and then they had an overhaul of the upper management. From there the turnover rate went through the roof. They began harping on the associates,and degrading them daily. I would not recommend working for Walmart unless you can start out high in the ranks because of the cut-throat environment with little care for the people but just the numbers. Hours worked over schedule would be made to be taken off through extended lunches,after they ask you to work over."
bad,"The only good thing about this company is that you might get to work with people that you like. However, the chance is slim considering that management don't know how to hire properly, and upper management don't seem to care. Most of the pharmacists are lazy and don't know how to do their job, and Walmart in general doesn't have a good training program so the other technicians don't know how to do their job either."
bad,"To provide great customer service to customers as well as employees.  Assist customers with shopping or questions. Wire transfer , handle large amounts of cash. Over 20 plus cashiers and shut store down at night."
bad,"Coworkers are good"
bad,"will look for a reason to fire you if they do not like you. Show favoritism, CSMs have favorite associates which allow them to let most get away with things. Employees steal, CSMs make accusations instead of handling things in a professional order and they gossip."
bad,"Packaging equipment, unloading equipment, using a forklift, using the cash register, and pleasing the customer. Get ready to have a difficult time with communicating with management."
bad,"Stressful  usually when given too many different directions, lack of staff for certain departments, managers don't show much respect when given tasks to associates and the most enjoyable part of the job is clocking out and going home."
bad,Very entertaining place to work at times. I learned patience and self control. Management could be better and more friendly. This is a pretty good amount of diversity at my site. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people.
bad,"You have good and bad parts of working at Walmart tire shop, some of the good are the work is easy anyone can do it.  The bad are the culture, benefits and advancement."
bad,The management for this company at the store i worked at wasn't really willing to work with you. As well as it seems they don't know what it means to be a manager. Many times I would end up doing a job I was not trained to do and get yelled at for it not being done properly.
bad,It depends on the store as to how you will be treated. Some are very good and some I'd rather be jobless. I have been in 3 different stores and all are suppose to have the same rules but none of them follow the same rules and they defently have favorites and if your not part of those your slowly shoved out the door by lowering your hours or the way you are treated on a daily basis.
bad,"Never enough employees to finish a job, the employees that are there are either unprofessional or just stupid because the smart and professional mannered people leave."
bad,"Working at Walmart was a good foot in the door for me, personally. It was my first job and the work experience helped me come out of my shell. Good work hours!"
bad,"Most of the assistant managers or higher don't have a college degree until you get to the corporate level. Its very hard to work for a company where they treat the hardworking employees just like the incompetent employees. Micro managing is a big issue. plus it is infuriating to to work for people and know your getting a fraction of there pay but yet they still come to you asking how to fix something or set up something that is beyond them. I would not recommend working for this company if you have a above average intelligence or even a normal intelligence. the staff will infuriate you with their stupidity, lack of effort and poor communication skills. If it wasn't for corporate working so hard and able to undercut everyone this company would have gone out of business years ago."
bad,The managers suck and expect you to do their work and yours they have favoritism to employees and they never do what their supposed to do. They also have no respect for your personal life such as working with you on your schedule so that you could go to college
bad,Walmarts typical work day includes your everyday training for your position you filled for but there are days you have to go above and beyond without even having a say in anything and i respect that because it has to be done. Management does not always accept everybody's availability for the job like days and time frames. Overall walmart is a great place to start your 1st job training. I almost have been there 3 years and i am ready to flee and move on to bigger and better things.
bad,"Management team is self centered, Their culture of ""listening to the people their your best idea generators"" is not followed. They are not a family oriented company"
bad,A typical day would include too many things to do without enough time to do it. You are viewed as easily replaceable. Unprofessionalism runs rampant. Walmart is where dreams die
bad,"The point system, culture is very conflicting , lack of diversity of thoughts and managment is not reliable , job takes advantages of the schedule and changes unexpected and not reported."
bad,"I needed a job and they needed some one with common sense. and able to motivate people. if I really needed I would go back, but it is not something I am trying to do."
bad,"This is a ideal job for a college student, not so much for a person supplying for a family. Theres not much more salary advancement after you reach 10 an hour."
bad,The work is steady but not that hard. The opertunity for advancement seems a little biased. They say it is not but thats how it feels. Unless you know someone its hard to advance.
bad,"The store I worked at, I loved management. They were nice and friendly and had realistic expectations of their employees. The customers weren't always the nicest. The cashier got blamed for the cost of the item, out of stocks, or if an item didn't scan. Many people don't realize that those issues are all out of the cashier's hands. Cashiers were generally understaffed, which caused the customers to get mad."
bad,"I have been with Walmart for 5 years. I had 1 great year in the pharmacy, the last 4 years I was on the floor I was treated like a slave by the managers and customers."
bad,"Un día de trabajo es como cualquier otro, siempre había gente que te reportaba, no toman en cuenta tu crecimiento en ninguno de los sentidos, la capacitación no es tan favorable, la parte mas dificil es que los fines de semana trabajas de ocho a doce horas."
bad,This was a great job. I stared out as a hourly associate in the tire and lube. I quickly advanced to a salaried manager. I got to travel all over the country
bad,Walmart is not the best place to work for. The pay is fantastic but the management at most locations suck. They do not accommodate for school schedules and management will not listen to you. Will never work their again if I can prevent it.
bad,Lots of customer interactions. In general a lot of work but not a hard job to do. Definitely more work than what you get paid to do. Overall people are nice but some management needs improvement.
bad,"I am a full-time student, and I applied to this WalMart as a part-time associate so I could have some money in my pocket during the school year. However, I was scheduled for full-time work as a full-time student. Management didn't seem to care about me from the start, and working here was the worst time in my life. Don't work here unless you want your soul sucked out of you."
bad,"Deberían haber cursos ,mayor pago,compañerismo,dinamismo"
bad,Provide excellent customer support. Zoning the electronics department. Take the registrar if no other associates are on the floor. Restock all of the electronics department products when needed.
bad,"Walmart's biggest issue is they do not value u their people. If you work hard you get to work even harder to pick up the slack of those around you, inconsistent expectations and standards from each manager and they vary from person to person. It seems more times than not they promote the least qualified person to higher positions in store. Pay is low, if you do make anything over minmum wage they expect you to work yourself to the bone for that small amount. Doing anything above and beyond your job title will lead to you doing that item always. My time at Walmart I found myself doing the job of many department managers and even assistant managers when I was merely a sales associate. I was naive enough to believe they were gonna promote me even tho I saw plenty of persons hired after me that were far less qualified in terms of experience or performance move up I continued to do such extra work until I left Walmart still only a sales associate after 5 yrs. My advice if you are a worker with strong work ethic stay away Walmart will exploit you to the fullest extent."
bad,the work place at my job is horrible because u have mangers talk to u any kind of a way and don't care about your family when it comes to work. i could call in for a family emergncy and stil get called to the office the next day and its no excued at all.
bad,Nobody has a sense of teamwork. Policies arent written out so that it is easy to work with one another or get things done efficiently. You backtrack a million times a day before you get things right. And then the policy will change. The only positive thing i have to say is that the managers support all employees.
bad,It was a good place to work but the production quotas are way to high. I enjoyed the job but the way they require so much in so little time was unbelievable.
bad,As a student it was helpful having this job to get through college.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with management who treated you like just a number.  Most enjoyable was customers and co workers.
bad,the people there are nice loved meeting costumers but the management are very hard to deal with often brought personal issues to the jobs had tendency to pick on people they didn't like was miserable for the most part
bad,"Not challenging or rewarding. There are opportunities to advance, but that's not saying much. They're short people. Any average joe could be a manager"
bad,the job i did i enjoyed a great deal. I worked in accounting office with some wonderful staff. The management of the store however and the company itself was left to be desired.
bad,It's not so far the job it's the managers there attitude's and lack of communication makes it hard to work for wal-mart. When I first started I was glad to come to work now it's like I just wanna get in and get out.
bad,"There are a few benefits of working at Walmart, mainly flexible scheduling (they never schedule you outside of your availability which you can change at any time), and they pay more than most hourly jobs.The management doesn't usually fix problems, they ignore them until they can't anymore. For example if an item is not ringing up as the sale price, they don't fix it for a few days. We also don't always have the supplies to do our job, when we need change some managers ignore our requests until we turn off our register and tell them in person that we are out of change. Over all, management takes a long time to do or fix anything, we have gone months with no working hand scanners, making our job much more stressful than it should be."
bad,Convenient part time job while in school although managers give a hard time with your availability. Management isn't great since they know you are easily replaceable since many Canadians need jobs.
bad,"Managers are the worst, if you aren't a suckup you won't go far. I loved working with people and being busy. Managers bend rules to make you look bad."
bad,Under paid and worked weird hours and multiple shifts that throw off your schedule all the time. Management is poorly trained and they jank you around everywhere
bad,Not much room for advancement within this company. they will give part time employees full time hours (30-36) and drop back down to part time hours (9-20) in order to keep them at a part time status
bad,"they do not train employees for anything, the department managers dont do thier job and the cap team gets blamed for it. Perry walmart is the worst place to work for. anything they say is a lie"
bad,"Very disappointing in ALL of management from not being taken seriously or them reluctantly not showing up at all. More effort when told to do everything the managers say outside of your own department and basically doing the upkeep in the whole store when the managers mess up employee hours to the point that there are 10 employees in the whole store in the afternoon (heavy hours) and like 140 in the morning. Man, give me a break.."
bad,"I did not liking at Walmart , management was horrible there was no balance between work life and personal life. the manager did not care about the worker neither was they helpful to the workers"
bad,"Stable yet very,very cutthroat and competitive but if you need work and you need the money it's a decent place to get started. The benefits are Great, However for the pay that was given for the amount of work that was to be done wasn't adequate enough."
bad,"es bueno trabajar para walmart cumplen con todo lo convenido y estipulado, siguen al pie de la letra todas las normas legales. algunas falencias con respecto a seguir las políticas culturales de la compania."
bad,"Walmart is an exacting employer who wants to make sure everything is done right. This is not always accomplished however. The store is usually understaffed with myself pulling double duty as a cart pusher for an hour because the only one on staff that day has to go to lunch. This happens on a weekly basis. I am one of only two maintenance associates on the entirety of the day shift. Two days a week I am on my own entirely. We are also under supplied constantly running out of paper towels to stock the store restrooms. My hours and days vary from week to week with no one seeming to check which days you worked the week before which at one point had me working six days straight. Despite all this the pay is good and the employees (or associates as we're called) are open and friendly, often going out of their way to help."
bad,"A typical day at work, you  would get there and start to work immediately which is done at any usual job. I have learned to build customer relations and to use their computers. There is really poor management, every time there is help management takes extremely long to respond and most of the time doesn't even seem to care."
bad,"Even for those not seeking anything in life beyond a job at walmart, I can't recommend working there. Boss, upon boss, upon boss does not care. Every time you express concern and confide, the one higher up squashes the one below, hence bottom level stays squashed. "
bad,"The communication in the store is really poor. The supervisors are not on the same page when it come to Price Match. Some say certain stores can't be Priced Match while others say it is okay. Training was really bad too. I felt ill prepared and I was pretty certain that everyone else thought I was really incompetent, and I was just a cashier..."
bad,I was always threatened to be fired by new management for things other associates where doing.They do not look kindly about being late even if it is school related.
bad,Walmart has had it's ups and downs over the years. The management team could use more training on how to communicate with each other as well as how to communicate with their associates. Walmart is a good place to start when entering the work force
bad,"Daily expectations for department managers only work if everything is perfect, and in retail it never is, so be prepared to feel overwhelmed a lot of the time. Overall not a hard job to have, just stressful."
bad,"Every day was more or less the same. The customers you interacted with were just about what you would expect; some where nice and some were quite irritated."
bad,"There are plenty of nice people to work with and there are opportunities for promotion, if you want.  However, there is a price to pay for a successful Walmart career."
bad,"Would be a better place if they treat they associates, like they treat the customers. Pay rate is very poorly. Over work associates, Never want associates to have life outside of walmart."
bad,"There are so many other retailers our there that are better to work for. The people are great, but the managers are stressful to work with. I hate to say it, but when Sam Walton died, the company became a cash cow for his kids. They have led the way in poor wages, lousy benefits, and a general lack of caring for their employees. Sadly, other big box retailers are following this model."
bad,Overnight team was mean to me. when i worked there the managers were rude and hateful. They treated you like a dog. And the co-workers that have been there a while think they over rule you.
bad,The job isn't bad. The management at this store is awful. They are aware we are grossly understaffed but refuse to hire anyone. They expect one person to do the work of 4 at all times.
bad,I worked in 2 different departments at Walmart and there was never a down time. You have to have thick skin to deal with angry customers as well as be willing to help customers that have questions outside your department.
bad,not good place to work. The management is burned out. They do not appreciate their employees. You can get fired for the slightest thing. Walmart does not value their employees at all.
bad,"No AC available. Hard job, specially for women. Lots of accountability poinst to STEPs. Filthy work enviroment. Not for everybody. Production, quality, numbers, numbers and numbers. It's all that counts."
bad,The hours are pretty good. I was a definite full time. You are allowed to leave the premises on lunch. Management needs improvement. Too much of a pessimistic mentality and overall lack of moral with workers in general. Learned a lot about customer service and warehouse work from this place though.
bad,"There was no real work ethic amongst the associates, managers favoritized a lot and would single out associates. Hard working associates weren't appreciated and would often take most of the hard work while slackers were free to do as they please."
bad,Management for the majority is only looking torward their advancement within company and not the best interest of there employees and store overall. Even at the lower level under-qualified employees are badgering each other in hopes of advancement.
bad,learn alot about cars management waas very helpfull and and had a good enviroment  the worst part of the job was the veried hours and lack of hours the team i worked with made it very enjoyable
bad,"As a cashier, I worked with people (the public) on a daily basis.  I offered assistance, talked with the customers, and did whatever it took to make their time and my time with them more pleasant."
bad,Senior management is lazy and plays favorites.  Only hands out positions to those he likes without them being posted.  Does not help staff with freight
bad,Management at the walmart facility where I worked was very disconnected. There were negligent ones and ones who saw themselves as completely divine to the sales associates and cashiers.
bad,"Pushed carts in the NY snow for, at the time, minimum wage. Short breaks, understaffed, (probably because of the job difficulty/pay ratio.) Usually did more than my share of work."
bad,"Walmart is nbot a bad place to work but there is no balance between work and home., I was always on call and always had to work late. Management was uncaring and did not work with you"
bad,"At the Walmart I worked at: it wasn't the best experience. Managers were very reactive and didn't think about the consequences of anything until after the consequences have happened already, or when corporate came and told them to fix it. They don't listen to there associates like they claim they do, would not recommend working there to anyone."
bad,"Walmart believes in change and that is a good thing.  They change before you learn the last change. They are adding more on and taking hours away. They are finding they can save money on less qualified people. If you are happy where you are, they are not. Move up, Move up, Move up. I didn't need there benefits but feel sorry for anyone who does.  They are very expensive and cover very little. Hardest part is ""Mom against Dad"", one say's one thing and the other say's something else. You run from one thing to the next hoping to please at least one of them."
bad,Mangement had a thing with playing favourites and over working without being flexible at all. They would often delay days off even if put in advance. The pay was good though
bad,"You work hard and nobody cares if you are the only person on shift when there is normally three. Management is poor , they favour certain employees that don't do their job properly, maybe it is their relative or something like that. I can't stand how they hoot and holler about the sales at the morning meetings and clapping, the pay is not good and your hours are cut in January , part time that were working 20-25 hours will only get 12 hours and full time employees go from 37 hours to 28 hours. The only people that don't take less are all the assistant managers and the department managers and they actually don't do the work that keeps the store stocked. They don't tell you when you are hired that you will get less hours after Christmas. Most of the employees are immigrants and they are afraid to stand up for themselves and speak up about how they can't afford this loss of hours. The manager says this is all the budget allows,but she is trying to make the store look good for the home office and too bad if you don't like it. It is a very frustrating place to work and I hope my time will be short there."
bad,"No room to grow, no fmla towards the workers who show up and ask for more responsibility, if you are a favorite or been there a certain time then you honestly dont matter"
bad,"The most enjoyable thing about working here was the other associates and customers I worked with daily. The hardest part would be asking for help and never getting any. In any customer service department it is very important to be fully staffed,which never was the case."
bad,"Management at all Walmart's are horrible. It's a feeling of being back in high school. Too much drama starting with the store manager on down to the associates. Store managers are to set an example instead all they're worried about is the money they receive and paid trips for example the yearly management meeting this year will be at Disney World. That's all my store manager bragged about during our STORE meetings. I would never work there again. I tried it three times seeing how good the money was, but the things you have to go through to stay on top at Walmart is definitely not worth it. I rather work at McDonald's or something before ever considering working there again. Ps I was a department manager."
bad,"My typical work day depending on the shift I work, morning shift 7-4 I start off opening the store pre- slicing meat for the meat case, putting pans in the hot case and turning the hot case on. Putting rotisserie chicken in the oven. I also put the cold salads in new containers and make new salads that we ran out of the night before. Then if I work the 9-6 I start frying the food for the hot case, and taking the rotisserie chickens out to put in the lower hot case. And put more in about an hour later. I help our customers get whatever they desire from what we have. If I work the closing shift 2-11, I would help customers and fry food as needed. At 6 pm I would shut the fryers down for the night and clean them, and once a week we clean our fryers. I would then start taking expired foods and salads out of the salad case and hot case. I would also take the pre sliced meat out of meat case. Do dishes and clean slicers and get ready to close. Then call for a manager and get inspected. What I have learned from working here, if you have a problem don't go to your manager you need to go way above there heads because nothing is ever done when going through them. A few manager could care less about their job so they are very rude to their employees. What I have learned is to keep on your toes and do just your job and if you see something wrong write down day, time, and what had happened and show your higher management. There are a bunch of Managers that are AMAZING and would do anything to make their employees happy which is very nice. Workplace Culture co-workers are amazing just s few"
bad,The 80 questions required are ambiguous.  It does not give you a true picture of the person applying for the position.  I worked at Walmart at 2 different stores and the third store didn't hire me.  The questions want answers to situations that you may not have come across.  They don't even interview the candidate in person.  It is not a professional way to hire people
bad,"Fellow sales associates were great to work with, But management made no effort to keep a positive environment; Your schedule is constantly being changed which effects your family life. And since I am putting myself thru college those changes make study time very difficult."
bad,"Always moving."
bad,"I don't like the managements there bec there basically no communications there even they knew I'm deaf and would like for them to have patience with me if I need for them to write what they were saying especially during meeting, but they failed me. So I wouldn't suggesting for most of the deafs to work there in Metairie, La."
bad,"its an learning experience. I worked at Walmart for 8 yrs "
bad,"The job position I had was not a terrible position, it was more of  management than anything. There is no respect extended to new hire. Even assistant managers take a back seat."
bad,Good simple easy work. Training is constantly on-going and well detailed. Trainers and managers are a good team and well organized. Pay isn't great but appropriate for work expected.
bad,"Walmart is a good place to work.Hours are great, management not so much. This is a company i would recommend. More ideal for an older adult and a student."
bad,I almost passed out at my register and they wouldn't let me move.  They don't know how to treat their employees. They don't apprciate their employees. They expect people to drop everything and do there jobs.
bad,If I leave Walmart it would be with the plans of not returning. I been in to many situations where I was told that it became mandatory to come in on an off day that I made plans to do things with my family or even payed for as well as unexpected over time long days where I lose money do to picking up kids late from daycare and it coast more the what I made
bad,"operating cash registers and greeting customers as they enter in a Walmart store. Since Walmart has a reputation to uphold, it is important for cashiers to portray a professional image by dealing with customers well. They may work during the mornings or the evenings, depending on their individual work hours and may also work on an occasional holiday."
bad,"A typical day at work would start off slow with little customers than around noon it starts to pick up and you get really busy scanning items than when it died down you would either do go backs, clean your work station or cover other places such as the door or self checkout for someones break at the beginning working at walmart I used to get my breaks and lunches on time but after a few months of working there I would get my breaks late and would have to wait or sometimes didn't have time to take my last break. I felt like certain csms would do their job really well and I liked working with them but when other csms came in who don't know what their doing and aren't very organized work felt hecktic. And it was really annoying seeing csms pass you by when you need help and act like they didn't hear you, The hardest part of working here was the unorganization and lack of management helping. The best part was helping and making customers happy."
bad,"My training experience at Walmart consisted of watching about 20 hours of videos and nothing else. The pay is terrible, the benefits are terrible. Culture is non existent."
bad,Only video training No full time position not told at interview. So no benifiit  this is a don't ask questions just due as your told work environment policy.
bad,"A typical day at work includes, prepping meat slicer and oven. also making display. Ive learned how to slice meat carefully and how to manage working alone creating an effective and timely way to get my job done. Management at this store was fair although i felt like my work was not appreciated and could not work enough hours a week. Workplace culture is good everyone does there part to insure to have a successful work day. the hardest part about doing this job is need more hours, its hard to work a job when you are only getting 20-25 hours a week. i really enjoyed talking to the customers it made me feel good when a customer let me know how well ive done and that the were satisfied"
bad,"No help from your team members. You better look out for your self. Management is for it's self and if not liked, you will be stuck their for the rest of time"
bad,"O trabalho assim como o aprendizado era contínuo, a comunicação com a gerência tinha algumas dificuldades, os meus colegas eram diferentes, o mais difícil era a falta de ajuda e a mais agradável ,quando tudo dava certo."
bad,"there is so many things that I could say about this place I don't know where to start management is terrible, unorganized, selfish, you can tell they don't care about their workers."
bad,"It is very difficult to move up in the company, based solely on hard work. There is a lot of favoritism among employees. Management is very chaotic. There is little to no communication between managers."
bad,Limited advancement opportunities.They give the people who will work more to do than others. They will cut your hours whenever you get a raise or when it suits them but you are expected to do the same amount of work or more in less time. If you miss time because of illness or injury you are subject to termination at their whim yet if you show up and do nothing all night you have job security.
bad,"A day at work was putting up the freight zoning our areas and helping other when needed making sure the customers were satisfied "
bad,"High volume retail sales.  Few opportunities for full time employment.  Low wages and no/poor insurance benefits for cashiers and sales clerks.  Opportunity for overtime during busy holiday season offset by sever reduction in hours at seasons end.  Poor work and home life balance.  Opportunities for training and promotion, if willing to move frequently.  Enjoyed assisting customers."
bad,I enjoy working at Walmart love meeting new people.The experience over all is a alright. I believe that Walmart is good opportunity for a high school or college student.
bad,They don't care about their employees at all. They don't take doctors notes and get in trouble even if you have one explaining what is going on. I would never recommend working for this company.
bad,"managers lie to save there jobs, know real support, doesn't answer phone calls, doesn't give you clear answers as far as the states on your work. cant even find out if I'm an employee or not"
bad,Not a long term solution due to many inconsistencies within the management structure and procedures. There are good benefits but the pay isn't good enough to warrant this being a full time career move.
bad,"fun workplace, have a team cheer in morning meeting to get staff going.   Fun store to work at. I work in a small store so we have great customer service"
bad,They had some very wonderful customers. I just had a problem with the disrespectful co-workers and the childish supervisors. I prefer to work somewhere with more respect and worth.
bad,You can only imagine what working at wal-mart is like it is worst than you could imagine but has its perks. Just think about high school that is your job here
bad,My day would start with price changes. Then I was told to do what they call picks. We would scan all the outs an if it said we had it in the back. Well then you tell the system you need that. Which then it tells the men in the back room that the products is needed on the floor. As an department manger I would have to give out daily task to the people I over saw.
bad,Get to meet some different people throughout a workday and each day is something new. Each Walmart cheer is different. Being a full time student I am unable to work weekdays and Walmart is able to allow me to only work weekends.
bad,The Walmart I worked for wasn't the best. Not many managers would communicate with there associates or take the time out to explain the task and assist in further direction.
bad,It's all about Walmart and their time they do not care for associates. You can't balance your life and Walmart it takes up a lot of your time. They say it's easy to advance but I don't think so and the policy and regulation change is not expressed to all employees.
bad,"typical work day would be coming in, and basically grab  a cart from the back room, bring it to the floor and start stalking. While stocking you may have customers come ask you where different thinks were. Normally wouldn't have a problem until after i would take the customer, walking back if a manager seen me they usually would want me to start in another area that we fell behind in. but that would really be your whole day. The only thing i can truly say i learned from there was that i never want to work there again. But something I did enjoy while working there was all the new people you would met working."
bad,"Although the pay was good and the scheduling gave you 3 days off every week, the management team there was horrendous.  No matter how little work some people did, they never got into trouble or fired for it.  The ones like myself who actually worked hard everyday would get in trouble if we didn't hit insane production numbers every single day.  Horrible company and place to work"
bad,Not interested at the moment to write reviews about this employer. I will write about this after some time like May/June.
bad,No respect from management. Company policies restrict growth and customer service.  Not flexible with schedules and personal lives of associates. No recognition for work/duties performed.
bad,"Walmart is horrendous company to work for. It is a soul sucking, never ending nightmare of boredom and failure. Every night is an uphill battle. You roll the stone up the mountain, only for it to roll back down at the end of the night. Its not a bad job for a teenager, as it will teach them what to avoid, but I would not advise anyone work at Walmart unless they had no other options."
bad,I personally can say Walmart has great pay but I didn't like how I was being treated and the environment wasn't something I was pleased to work in but you have to do what you have do. I stopped working there because if those reasons and because my hours were getting shortened because of new hires so I just saved them the trouble.
bad,You find yourself working with a skeleton crew. Most of the time you're covering three or four departments. There's never enough associates to keep the store neat and orderly or to run the registers.
bad,"This company's reputation is true.  As the least expensive pharmacy in their field, customer demand is very high.  Long lines and long wait times were commonplace.  The pharmacy was too small for the work load.  The number of technicians working at one time was not able to keep up with business."
bad,I liked my job most of the time. Walmart really doesnt take very good care of their employees though. You get to know some of your regular customers and they do brighten your day. The management isnt always the most considerate of the employees. Needs more improvement.
bad,"I wish I could have stayed longer, I work very hard and I was loyal and faithful to the company I always showed up early I was never absent and I put in an honest day's work for an honest day's pay"
bad,"Nearly all of my training from Walmart was done on a computer for the first week. After I had completed the very boring and unhelpful training program I was thrust into the work with very little explanation of what exactly it was that I was supposed to do. The typical day consisted of unloading stock from a truck off a line and onto the pallets organized by the departments. After that I moved onto stocking shelves. If any products were damaged or spilled I would clean the mess and take the product to the back and claim it out. I learned a lot about how a big retail store functions and what it takes to keep one moving, but I felt I meant little to the company and was considered expendable. Despite that, though, almost all the employees were friendly and my managers and supervisors always helped me if I had any question. My coworkers were friendly, and I got along well with them all. Occasionally a customer would need help when I was working on the floor, and it surprised me that I enjoyed helping them more than anything else on the job."
bad,The management skills were very unprofessional. Had a lot of things that could be fixed but was an okay work enviormemt for the most part.
bad,"I hated every thing about working here. all of management played favorites with associates. Hard working associates hardly ever praised or promoted, while people who slacked off and kisses butt got promoted without knowing how to do the job correctly."
bad,"A typical day at work: Busy or very slow depending on the day and time of the day. "
bad,"working there for the most part wasnt to bad, job had its fun points. although managment made life harder then it had to be. they offen controdicted eachother and there seemed to be a lack of communication  amung them."
bad,"I had a terrible manager who belittled people, and made it a terrible place to work. I enjoyed the work itself, but not the management. This has been my experience at several Walmart stores."
bad,Honestly it's easy work but I felt invisible. Like I didn't even exist unless I was being told to do something. I wasn't put in the position I applied for. I was pretty miserable toward the end bc I was standing for so long doing a bunch of nothing. This company is too big and successful to have its facilities look so trash and have low wages for employees.
bad,".I love cashiering. "
bad,"This company may be the one to give you job experince in the very beginning. You only get 3 days off (3 credits) every 6 months no matter what illness, weather, or emergency. Management may show you little respect if you are at a busy Walmart. However, there are Walmarts with pleasant worker and customers. Is it a terrible down town Walmart or a peaceful one in the country? When food gets close to expiration then you have free food in the break room. Pay started at $7.40 for me per hour then $8.40 but it's $10.00 for the lowest workers now."
bad,I enjoyed working with the team. Stay to yourself. Sometimes mangers get missing when you need them the most. You will get hours and your checks will look nice .
bad,Buen equipo de trabajo con tus asociados y promotores y jefes directos todos dispuestos a ayudarte herramientas de trabajo las necesarias
bad,I liked being a sales accosiate but becoming a department manager while having a kid was a little much. I'm also needing something closer to home and more flexible hours
bad,management from all the departments steal employees from other department to do their tasks. understaffed in many areas and places blame for everything on the unloaders.
bad,"You will rarely find someone who receives full time, it's high demand/high stress job and there is never enough employees to cover the load of work there is to do."
bad,I worked in lawn and garden and grocery. I could never find my bosses or co-workers when I needed help. I didn't get a list of things to do for the day which would be fine if I had the same tasks every single day. co workers were okay. my managers were rude and lazy though. The hardest part is working your butt off and not feeling appreciated. benefits suck and a computer makes the schedule so its all over the place and they usually cant change it. hardly any hours
bad,"Your typical day was not a bad day, unless if anyone in management is having a bad day, then they bring it down on everybody. The coworkers are fun and friendly. The most enjoyable part is having a fun conversation with the customer, and the hardest is respectfully dealing with disrespectful employers."
bad,"My time there had its ups and downs, but the most monumental con I can say is, you will always, always, be either overstaffed, or understaffed, no balance. You either have the longest lines ever imaginable because they didn't get enough people to come in that day, or there is too many people, and you stand around doing nothing. There needs to be better management, organization, CSM's whoever, need to all work together and make things flow better."
bad,"Walmart's employees are for the most part supportive and helpful when you need it, although they may look at you like you should know everything by your first day. Management is not very understanding at all, and don't like to help you if you are not sure of something. If you had a family emergency such as death it is not ok to call in at all, even if its your first time calling in, unless you want to go the rest of the week with dirty looks from all the management and rude comments to you about it even though you explained to them the situation. NEVER call in they will make your job ten times more difficult."
bad,"Management at Walmart is something I had heard was bad, but until I experienced it myself I truly had no idea. the amount of potential appreciation is drowned out by the constant disappointment of management. When you do something wrong and management knows about it, instead of bringing it up to prevent similar problems in the future, they will wait for you to do it again so they can bring it up as an ""on-going"" problems. The supervisors are used only to tell management when the associates have done something wrong, and even can get in trouble when talking about how everything is going well. I would not recommend anyone work at walmart."
bad,"Employees where awesome, will always find a friend there.  Very disorganized management and nobody was on the same page.  Changed policies more than once without making sure whole team is aware of new policy changes."
bad,it wasnt a good job. management was unprofessional. Took advantage of associates. Not a pleasant environment.  not given enough hours. Promoted people who did less based on who they knew
bad,"During my time at walmart, I was expected to do everything in a small amount of time. I was a bakery associate, so working with food takes time. Management did not care about that and constantly wanted everything out at an unreasonable time with little staff. As a result, the turnover rate was high. I didn't personally get yelled at about it but my manager did and that was always sad to know because she was a hard worker who loved her staff. We were all a family. I learned baking and decorating skills"
bad,"For the amount of labor the pay wasn't enough. The people were great people but some didn't work to hard. It wasn't a hard job, just didn't pay enough."
bad,My schedule had to be constantly checked because they would change or cut my hours with little notification and managers from other departments would treat me like i was supposed to be security
bad,the employees and managers are very disrespectful to me. They do not know the meaning of respect and honesty. I do not know how many times my food and drinks was stolen from the fridge in the breaking and nothing was done. The reason i left is because the amount of disrespect that is being delt around i could not take it.
bad,". Is depends on the mood."
bad,Typical day was full of mindless and meaningless tasks outside your department preventing you from doing what needs to be done in your department. The coworkers were the only good thing about the place. The majority of managers were almost inhuman.
bad,All right place to work. Workers don't make enough to live in times this day in age. Especially ones with kids and family.raises per year you could say you didn't get anything to help in living money wise
bad,"I was a Case Slot orderfiller. it is the grunt job of the building, but throwing 5,000-10,000 boxes in the same module gets old quick. "
bad,"As with most billion dollar companies, the higher your position, the less you think of your subordinates as people and the more you consider them disposable, dime-a-dozen slaves that can either work harder and longer for the same pay or get replaced by someone who will.  A typical day usually starts with managers telling you to do more work than is feasibly possible to maintain a constant state of inferiority because, remember, if employees do well you may have to reward them, and you can't have that.  I learned that you are only worth the money you can make a company and you will be squeezed for every last penny of that money.  Co-workers were fine really.  They can sympathize with the Sisyphean existence of a bottom-rung worker and generally made work more bearable.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to call management out on their mistreatment of their employees lest I face unemployment.  The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving and getting a short break from soul-crushing corporate indifference while I went to College."
bad,"Pay was good but, they like to go through employees pretty fast. They have little loyalty to there employees, and terminate people without any chances, regardless of how long or how good your record is with them."
bad,when i first started at walmart it was great. the last year i worked there it all went down hill all they care about anymore is making money. they dont care if you are sick or if you see your family at all it all about the upper staff making money.
bad,"Not a bad place to work but if we had better management it would be a better place to work. They change up their minds a lot and have very high standards for the folks on cap 1 which is what I do. Stock, downstock the risers, and work the bins in the back"
bad,"Had fun in one store, did not like the other at all.  All depends on who you are working for, but most stores seem to have people and managers that are unhappy by the sounds of it."
bad,"The Company has made changes in the past year or so that encourage a ""More work with less people"" Mentality. Do not seek employment from here especially if you wish to be a unloader or Dept. Manager.  The Managers will treat you like your disposable and it will seem like your at constant odds with your fellow associates."
bad,"But the management is rude and doesn't work with you. "
bad,Walmart was a great job i loved it there the coworkers was excellent they showed me working with alot of people was easy and i got along wit the constomers bery good they loved to come in and see me smiling and having a great day walmart needed to work on a few things but over all ot was a great experience
bad,"Walmart as a whole is not a great place to work for in my opinion. Being that they have so many job positions open at all times and the turnover ratio is quite high, this should state it for itself."
bad,this job is really strict it is annoying. security is annoying management is annoying everyone takes there job to seriously they treat us like prison at this job.
bad,"Working as a People Greeter was great.  I loved the customers and worked hard to make them feel welcome. "
bad,it was fun to work here. a lot of different people you see everyday. there is so much to learn about the company. you will really learn something new everyday.
bad,La empresa ha sufrido grandes transformaciones que no la han ayudado a mantenerse estable ademas de que las personas que la dirigen son elegidas por compadrazgo
bad,"It took six months until I could get any sort of healthcare benefits. I worked late nights with overtime and management never seemed to care how stressed/overworked we were. We hardly ever had the necessary equipment to do our job, and a lot of times when we did, it was broken. Didn't have enough people. Organizing lunches was a nightmare. Many coworkers didn't speak much English, which isn't entirely their fault, but a lot of times the fluent English speakers had to come and help."
bad,"unorganized work flow environment unclean work space, not enough break time. i have seen alot of people advance quickly and in my preference they were not qualified"
bad,Working at Walmart was pretty good!  Made good money working part time! They just didn't work with me. Coworkers there didn't hardly do there job. As a cashier you just stood in one place for 4 plus hours.
bad,I liked working at Walmart for a while but after a few months it became clear they didn't care to much about the employee. I twisted my ankle and had to use my personal days as injured days and eventually got fired for that.
bad,As a part of management I had the opportunity to see the corruption of Walmart from a very close perspective.  There was a great amount of dishonesty and lack of integrity.  Management is definitely out to use up it's employees then spit them out.  The environment I was in was very sexist and discriminating toward women.
bad,"My typical work day was fast-paced."
bad,Typical work week was 50-60 hours and there was totally no professionalism. Littered with managers sleeping with employees and nothing ever happens to them. Managers looking and trying to fire any body for anything.
bad,"Decent job to start with, but wouldn't recommend working here for an extended period of time. The pay is basically minimum wage, maybe you'll get lucky and have good coworkers?"
bad,"Lack of stimulation and sense of accomplishment in everyday activities. A bachelors is likely needed for any kind of managerial role, but growing from the bottom is not the key to success. The job environment seems transitory in nature, which is a clue to the dissatisfaction employees face if Wal-mart is their chosen career."
bad,Usually just go to our assigned department and stock the shelves or make the shelves look neat. But its not easy when there are customers with kids around messing up the shelves and you have to get it done at a certain time.
bad,"wasn't too busy."
bad,"El ambiente empieza desde la gerencia y personal de rh , te intimidan y piden mas del tiempo que debes laborar."
bad,"A typical day at work involves serving customers, unloading trucks, stocking shelves, or cleaning. There was never time to not be busy."
bad,"People like Walmart because they pay more than other retail stores slightly. As a sales associate I started off at 11.00. When you work here prepare to work all over the store and do tasks that you didn't see on your job application. While they tell you to do things all over despite in addition to your own department I feel they should increase the pay. I didn't know I needed a lawyer to come with me to look over my employment paper work at Walmart as most of it is in fine print. This location made us do photo lab, online pickups, layaway, push carts, phone activation which takes a long time and time away from helping other customers in your department, put away returns, zones, and restock in other departments EVERY DAY in addition to your department, and were supposed to ring in the front end when the lines get long, alongside the duties in electronics. Management does NOT know anything about any of Walmarts products or services they just know how to walk around the store with each other, flap their gums, and boss people around. This company does not have a good open door policy as management does not care about your concerns because they won't get resolved. They don't greet you or give recognition. They only know you when corporate comes rolling through. They do not respect their employees. The only way to move up is if you suck up to management or they like you it has nothing to do with how hard you work or how long you've been there."
bad,"Equipment Consistently breaking down causing an unstable schedule. Little support from management. High employee turn around. Employee website is not user friendly and difficult to maneuver. No interview process, so they'll hire just about anyone."
bad,Hay mucha comunicación en el área de trabajo. El ambiente es muy divertido para trabajar mucha confianza entre todos
bad,"Very high turnover in staff from the top down.  I had four store managers in less than 18 months and, as an associate, I was second in seniority in my department with less than 18 months experience. Management style is poor, overall.  Managers often are demeaning and offer little if any training.  The hourly compensation and benefits are good, however the performance demands are high and the atmosphere is chaotic."
bad,Es un ambiente de trabajo agradable ya que la mayoria de los trabajadores teniamos la misma edad y era optimo trabajar ahi
bad,"Working at Walmart is an adventure, every single day.  I can count ""easy"" work days on one hand within the past 4 years.  A typical day is planned out on the fly and notes are completed daily with plenty of support to delegate and follow up to."
bad,"This position did not work out right, maybe it is the location but a lot of the management is horrible. Lots of favoritism, hard work does not get you far here! I recommend finding a different location if you choose to work at Walmart"
bad,Lo que me ha gustado del trabajo es el monitoreo con equipo de cctv
bad,"good stater job for young person, they have lost focus on the people they hire and are about profits and gains, lost value in customer service and lines at check out"
bad,I started out as a cashier and stayed with that for a few months then I had the opportunity to become a asset protection associate so I took the job because they offered me full time with benefits.
bad,"I have learned the hard way that Walmart does not treat it's employees as well as they should. They let harassment go unnoticed. If you are not a manager or supervisor, you are just a piece of the corporate machine to them. One of my two supervisors has no respect for anyone, especially the people he is over. He injures people and breaks merchandise. I was injured on the job and received no compensation for the time I missed from work.They waited four days to send me to a doctor, and they are barely covering my medical expenses."
bad,"Employees that work hard are constantly expected to do jobs of others that are slacking. Poor benefit package, minimum wage with only a yearly raise of just a few cents. No recognition for good job."
bad,"Typical warehouse job, heavy hours during peak season, then laying people off once Christmas season is over..Over worked and under payed with no benefits."
bad,"was not a friendly place with management but loved my co-workerrs  "
bad,"It was helpful in times of need. I met lots of good people and new faces. Felt good to help others meet their satisfactory. Good team members, hard workers and friendly employees"
bad,It's an okay place but scheduling is terrible can't get off on holidays and it's mildly disorganized. It is bare able for the moment but not for a long term job or career
bad,"It isn't the most luxurious, but the co-workers get their jobs done. Well kept up place, nice managers that are willing to work with you, etc."
bad,"As an overnight cashier, we would strive to provide great customer service to our peeps between the hours of 10 pm-7 am. In between that time we would send back over stock items that were left in the front, back to the right department's."
bad,"You meet great people who become friends with. I hate the hours since they are cheap to give out more hours, instead, they hire more people to give 12 to 14 hours a week which is awful!"
bad,"If you need a job on the side this is a good job"
bad,"ITS AN OK WORK PLACE..I LOVE WORKING WITH PEOPLE SO THAT MADE IT FUN.I  like the staff...and hours.I love to work with my hands,which makes over night stocking a breeze"
bad,"When they come in with new senior/regional management they like to change the old management. The will threaten you, harass you until you quit or they terminate you"
bad,"walmart is a terrible company! they treat the employees like numbers, the management is very incompetent and they are not understanding when it comes to an associates personal life"
bad,I enjoy working with people. Walmart is a big company and has gotten to big for their britches. They don't pay enough for a single mother to live. Their management is not up with their departments as far as working their departments that their over. They don't understandost of what goes on in their departments.
bad,"I thought going in it would be fun to work there, I'm not happy with management nor my work environment. They aren't very family orinated or friendly like they say the company is all about."
bad,The typical day begins if you work overnight with a meeting where you learn where you are going to work within the store. Management does not communicate between shifts and some times provides false information. The associates work as if being robots and are down trodden and penalized for calling in sick and moving to different cities. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the lack of communication and being shunned by management. The typical management team makes one feel stupid. The enjoyable part of the job is clocking out and going home.
bad,"it paid the bills, management was obnoxious and rude trucks would come in late and still be expected to be finished immediately"
bad,Since working here I realized this job is slavery all over again. You work your aas off but will never advance in the company. The managers and csm's play favoritism and they tall about you a lot behind your back! Shifts are given based on how many MasterCard you have sold. Where I work is mostly immigrants and instead of speaking English they speak their language all day talking and laughing right in your face! Their is no open door policy because if you dear complain about how rude and unprofessional management are they will cut your shifts are you will become an outcast.
bad,"It was very disorganized, also had no room for family issues to arise or be worked around. My co-workers were the second best part of the job, the best part were the customers. It just was not a supportive work environment when I really needed the extra."
bad,"Todas  as  empresas citadas  que trabalhei foram ótimas  melhor impossível, tive os melhores gerentes diretores e muito amigos, um ambiente maravilhoso  de se trabalhar."
bad,"Typical day consisted of managing the cashiers by making sure they had the amount of change they needed in their register, making sure they received their breaks and lunches.  "
bad,"A typical day at Walmart is always fast-paced. Unfortunately my experience at Walmart wasn't as I expected it to be. The managers expected too much from associates in departments that were always short staffed. The hardest part of my job was trying to get all of my assignments done in a day while helping customers. Generally it is fairly easy to do both and I don't have a problem doing so but the management at my store were very strict about assignments so it put a lot of extra stress on all of the associates. The most enjoyable part of my job was most of my coworkers and several of the customers that came through, especially the regulars. I do enjoy Walmart as a cooperation but unfortunately management at the store I worked at, I don't believe were a good fit."
bad,"Walmart is productive, as most employees will take initiative with what they are doing but this company lacks in culture as some standards are not met by the consumers"
bad,"The higher up managers do not know how to do there job. I lost my job at Walmart due to being blamed for an accident that wasn't my fault at all. Not only that but they gave me an illegal drug screening that I had every right to refuse due to it being specifically for the accident. When an accident happens your suppose to drug test everyone involved the day it happens. They didn't do it to me till 3 days after. I thought everything was fine and they knew I had nothing to do with it but no, they surprise me with that not telling me what it was for  and end up terminating me in the end saying it was my fault the employee got hurt and had to go to the hospital when it was his own fault for not paying attention to where his feet were."
bad,"Para ser walmart una empresa con demasiado renombre, no sabe tratar a sus empleados, ya que prefieren darlos de baja con cualquier pretexto, las liquidaciones están prohibidas para los empleados, pero  los gerentes apartan la mercancía y se las quedan ellos, rotan al personal de departamento a departamento sin ninguna razón, y esa es la manera en dar de baja a los empleados, y contratar a gente nueva para hacerle lo mismo..."
bad,"Pues estuve en farmacia, me agrado ese lugar, aprendí, de hecho tenia evaluaciones diario, pero  lo que no me agrada es que abusan mucho de los asociados, pues piden siempre que cuando lo necesitan se quedará uno y no pagan horas extras y el seguro social lo dan de alta con el mínimo."
bad,"learnt Presentation skills."
bad,"I don't recommend Walmart unless you simply need spare income. They pay terribly, the hours are often horrid (not the amount, but the scheduling, they would regularly have me close one day and then open the next), and there isn't much in the way of advancement. I worked there for a year without receiving a pay raise, and when I looked about to advance the management was of basically no help. "
bad,"My day at work persists of culling the wet wall. Clean the trays and bottom of the area. Then mark down the bad products with a telezone or mc40. Then work the backstock to the sales floor where needed. Then work freight off the pallets we receive off the truck. Then we clean the backroom ,throw trash , clean sinks, sweep and mop."
bad,"I would just dread going into work everyday. Management was rude and awful, co-workers also hated their jobs so no body was ever in a good mood. Good deeds went unrecognized and way too much stress for what the job actually was."
bad,"I'll keep it simple. To many managers and they do not communicate with each other. Things get lost in translation and the associates pay for it. There are some great managers, but because of the bad ones they ruin it for the rest."
bad,"The work place was a great environment, but the management team at the end got very poor with fixing proper equipment, and scheduling."
bad,"used to like the company. When I moved to Springfield and transfer"
bad,"Being a door greeter at Wal-Mart is a  very boring, useless job. I was placed in this role because i am disabled and i'm guessing they figured i couldn't do much more than welcome people to Wal-Mart."
bad,"normal, siempre se aprende,pésima administración, atentos,los primeros días, aprender todos los días."
bad,"Even though Wal-Mart is supposed to be family oriented , it was anything but enjoyable being an associate of theirs. A typical day would include cashing checks or money orders, sending off customer money, providing customers with money orders, running the Site To Store location , returning items, replacing items, and answering any where between 100-150 calls a day on a 4 or 5 lined phone. I would also have to deal with extremely irate customers and threats on a daily bases. My scheduled breaks barely existed and my co-workers were not always fun to be around and management did everything but help solve your problems. The most enjoyable part of the job would be when I'd get one of the few customers who would understand that my job was extremely stressful and would offer encouraging advice"
bad,"Wal-mart culture is challenging.  The compensation is excellent."
bad,"horrible experience while I worked here, management lie to you and give broken promises and when you face them about their lies they try to bully you and demote you."
bad,"I originally joined the Wal-Mart remodeling crew in September of 2013. It was a physically demanding position as shelves were disassembled and moved and new merchandise was displayed. The hours were regular at 6:00 a.m. to 3:00. I worked with a good group and enjoyed the job. At the end of the 6 week remodel job, I was asked by an assistant manager to join on permanently as a cashier. I enjoyed the job and relations with customers. My problem was that I could not have any type of regular hours and had no way to plan on an income when I never knew how many hours I would be working. Also, I worked many weekends and missed time with my children, who were in school, and my husband, who worked a Monday through Friday job."
bad,"Unpredictable days, work load varies from day to day, hard on your body. Difficult to manage school, other jobs, social life etc. with the overnight shift. Benefits are ok, Bonuses every 3 months depending on profits. Used to get yearly raises and holiday pay that was taken away this year."
bad,"learning something new everyday, management willing to teach, writing up associates, meeting new people everyday, setting up displays through out the store"
bad,good job if you are wanting to lose weight or if your in school but not a career friendly job seen a lot of good men get fired from this super sized company that uses people to make these guys in corporate a lot of money.
bad,"your life had to revolve around wal mart. only brown nosers would get moved up in the company ! took away all holiday pay and sunday pay.Management was never on the same page always giving contradicting orders. Always very understaffed during season. Most management could not perform everday duties and couldnt answer typical questions like where an item was located. the hardest part of the job was trying to be in multiple places at once LITERALLY ! the best part of the job was actually helping the customers, some of them are actually appreciciative."
bad,I've learned quite a bit of customer service skills while in this job. I enjoyed some of my coworkers and for the most part they were pretty fun people to be around. The hardest part of my job was trying to manage the photo lab while other departments needed help. The most enjoyable part of my job was the smile on people's faces when you helped them print off a picture that meant a lot to them.
bad,"The rules change at a moments notice. I only worked week-ends. I would leave on Sunday and when I returned on Saturday there were new rules and procedures.  I started a practice to ask what had changed or what was new sense Sunday. I could not get an answer from anyone not even the supervisor. I was the one who would find a new program on the register and told everyone else. "
bad,"Working at Wal-mart had its moments. It was a struggle for a high school student, who is in activities and has family. A typical day at work, was working on a register checking people out. I learned may skills, such as being a live, upbeat person. Some of the management is very nice and willing to help you, but I only got that one time in the 2 years i was there. The hardest part of my job is being able to get days off of work, for sports and family events."
bad,"Corporate did not make you feel as if the job was secure."
bad,"My typical day at work is cleaning restrooms, taking out trash, and cleaning up spills.  My opinion about  Wal-Mart is it could be a good place to work for, but having the wrong people as managers can make a huge difference. I wish I can tell you good things about Wal-Mart and most enjoyable part of my job, but unfortunately is none. If there is anything good for working at Wal-Mart believe me I would tell you, but there is nothing good to tell."
bad,"basicly working in all clothes departments"
bad,"its okay and all i dont mind it, just very busy all the time and messy. as a first job it was a little overwhelming. interviewing process was long."
bad,"it was walmart, you did exactly what you think you'd do at a walmart and did everything you figure a walmart employee does no surprises here"
bad,Advancement depends on who you know management gives multiple directives without being certain of anything. Some management have inappropriate relationships with associates in order for them to advance in management positions without qualifications. Minimal training is provided by management and is forced on hourly employees to help others whom are not being paid well and could care less.
bad,Sam Walton would be disappointed in the direction his store is headed. Seems the harder you work the harder they are on you while the not so good workers skate through on others good work.
bad,"I enjoy most of what I do, and working with many of my customers and coworkers, but it does not pay very well. I usually work 5-6 days a week, just to make ends meet, and still have a hard time making ends meet"
bad,"Its really is a fabulously way to die slowly, full of incompetence served at its finest. I just can't recommend anything better id want to do in life then wear a blue vest and be a slave to a demanding society of processed food and sweat shop clothing!"
bad,te trataban mal y la paga era bien poca y tenias que hacerlo a pura presion
bad,started at 5am two to three people working with only one doing most of the work no one held accountable for not doing their share of the work it was fast passed and good but just wished others would of been made to help talking to management did no good the person in question was taking lunch with the department head
bad,"At Walmart everything you do is with a routine which is fine,  I do like having a routine and being busy all the time,  there I have learned to manage big quantities of employees and work under a lot of pressure, also to focus on goals and merchandize in order to improve sales. Management is very good if you want to learn how to delegate and be productive, however they do not care about your life balance and they will work you until you get burned out. The hardest part of the job is to work long shifts every day and knowing there is no over time since you are a salaried member of management, this would actually be ok if the salary was enough, but  for the amount of hours you work is like having a wage of $10 to $12 dlls an hour, that I believe is the only reason why I am starting to look somewhere else."
bad,"I started off working here when I was still in school, I liked it because they worked with your school schedule and it was decent pay for a college student. I ended up becoming a department manager for a higher pay and for a better resume. After I became a department manager I began to realize how much the management didn't care about you, your health or your family. Recently had a manager tell an employee that she had to work late shift even though she didn't have transportation after a certain time. He told her she better take a taxi to work which cost her over $20 to get home per day."
bad,"Your day consists of "
bad,"The management is horrible. There is three managers who I have respect for, the rest do not. I have seen a lot of unethical things happen. Like favoritism, selling items under the table to associates, and etc. The hardest part of the job is just dreading to be there because of management and the associates you work with. A few associates are enjoyable to work with. But I plan on looking for something that is more on my level instead of down. I deserve better."
bad,I liked it but they didn't help you when you were new and it was not worth it. The pay was good but it was hard because sometimes I didn't get enough sleep before shifts.
bad,"Not the worst job I had. Company has been going down hill for the last few years. its a tough job, and you have to deal with very rude customers."
bad,Invest within the culture and take initiative and success will follow.  Work/Life Balance is in your hands with the amount of training and development you put into it.
bad,"Tive conhecimentos em outras areas,podendo me destacar e assim ganhar uma nova oportunidade"
bad,you had better get a good afternoon's sleep because they are on your butt to get your section done and then more. and then you are penalized.
bad,"I have been here for 2 years. Made amazing, unforgettable, life-long friends. Too many leaders, not enough followers. Filed a harrassment case based upon disability, nothing ever came from it. Every time I made a mistake, it was shoved in my face, harshly. Hard work, good pay, harsh treatment, worse management, good associates, decent hours, decent vacation time, work every holiday except christmas, 9 absences over 6 months and you're fired. I could probably go on for hours about how the bad outweighs the good here. But you don't see the real treatment until you walk through those doors every day, trying to put a smile on your face and faking it. It's a hard job and I don't know how some of them have made it as long as they have."
bad,"I loved working for walmart because of the vast number of poeple you got to call family and the unlimited number of things to do and learn from the company, however the way my facility was managed and the individuals that were put in charge had no respect for the employees or the work they did."
bad,"Working for working was a decent start to job life, but the overall experience was not that great, and they are right when they say Walmart has people work for 90 days and then let you go, because that's exactly what happened to me."
bad,i love to meet new people   to have a good day help people that need help  and how to learn now thing and to get along with all co worker   the mose good thing about work is it injoy your job and the people u work with   .
bad,"-same routine daily"
bad,Management puts a lot of stress on the department managers and are not very nice. I get yelled at for things that other dm's do on a regular basis.
bad,"Management doesn't communicate with each other on my shift. The typical day at work is ""ok"" at best since the work is more tedious than anything else. I learned how to work with a team, even be in the leadership position on some tasks. I learned also how to pace myself throughout the night so I'm not dragging behind on schedule at the end of the night or out of breath ready for a break near lunch time. Management can be nice but doesn't like bad news or concerns(specially store manager). Co-workers are the best thing about the company, they are funny, hardworking, and caring. The hardest part of the job is getting all the work completed at the times Management wants but the times requested at unmanageable due to staffing. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the hour long lunches and my co-workers."
bad,"The work environment is stressful, and the company has high turnover and further diminishing benefits system. The company has gone in a downward direction in the last five years."
bad,"good training on registers, management could be a little nicer, learned a great deal for it being my first job. organization is good when it comes to restocking items"
bad,Horrible managers who did not care about employees or our need to make a schedual thet had any regularity. any time i asked for a regualr schedual of needing a day of they denied to help.
bad,"Always advancement but never time for family. Management positions will loose their holiday pay, and sick pay. They do keep their vacation pay. Wal-Mart will work management more than 60 hours a week and only pay them for 40."
bad,"Had many jobs, wore many hats, wasn't paid jack. Other than that, life at walmart was great. seriously the people working there were the salt of the earth. too bad walmart doesn't value them enough."
bad,"had to check out customers keep area clean and neat"
bad,its a cool little gig however the true value of employment with walmart can be found in the managerial positions a typical day at work will be spent in the back room doing cbls until the required assessment are completed after clocking in at the back of the store head to the front to the csm kiosk   retrieve your shift detail that will explain your register # and times for breaks and you will also be notified as  to who you will relief
bad,"I loved my job as a Photolab Manager/Technician. It used to be very fun and enjoyable."
bad,Walmart doesn't value hard working people and praises the slow and dime witted. I would not recommend this place for anyone.
bad,The day usually begins by assessing what was or wasn't accomplished by the previous shift.  Then attempting to finish what needs to be done in order to provide a good shopping experience for the costumers.  Much of the management style is reactive instead of proactive.  This is often due to staffing challenges and changing customer demands.  Work isn't difficult but can be stressful due to pressures from managers and customers. Often times can be asked to perform different tasks from different managers at the same time.
bad,Working at Walmart overall was a terrible mistake. The only thing good working at Walmart was the work experience and some of the employees.
bad,"A typical day at work Wal-Mart  leaves one harried due to constant micromanaging because the group of managers does not understand how to communicate effectively with themselves or associates."
bad,"I gave them almost 17 years of hard Work. To be fired and listed as misconduct when I did nothing wrong. I had 3 to 4 managers all demanding that I do this or that for them, about time I would get started on one job another manager would pull me off to do something else. With me winding up getting into trouble because I was unable to keep up with all the demands. I am now having a had time relocating a new Job because of their bad review."
bad,A typical day at work would be cleaning up what was left behind by the shift that worked before me before I can start my task and still was expected to finish our tasks even if understaffed. Management didn't understand the time it took to gather needed tools to complete tasks and it sometimes effected either quality/quanity of work. Some co-workers were hard workers but felt not appreciated while the workers who did just enough to get by everyday seemed to get rewarded. Hardest part of the job was having to sometimes unload trucks and unload stock when the unloaders didn't get it done. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the job done having your department looking nice towards the end of the shift.
bad,learned team work and how to function in face pace work  environments. Hardest part of the job was hot summer days under hot cars changing hot oil.
bad,i don't have to much to say about this job it was in my opinion harder then what it needed to be but that was because of poor management.
bad,"Wal Mart is evil and does not care at all about it's employees. They want to act like the are such a wholesome company who cares about families, but they don't. Wal Mart was founded by Sam Walton, a man who actually cared about his employees. Once he and his wife died, their greed children took it over.....and they are only driven by money and power."
bad,worked overnight. managers barely helped and always had their nose tooted up at you. customers always had a problem with wanting to buy liquor late
bad,Stocking shelves also providing help to customers all the time and also up selling tourist customers for credit cards. Very hands on and only thing that tough is dealing with impatient customers at times
bad,You wouldnt like my opinion  so Im going to just type  a min of twenty words and not go any further withn this  there is nothing else to say  poor store to work in
bad,"O dia de trabalho era simples, não aprendi nada e não consegui transmitir meus vastos conhecimentos em SEGURANÇA DO TRABALHO para os funcionários da empresa, sendo que a direção e gerencia não atendiam as especificações que por ventura solicitávamos. Quanto aos meus colegas estavam embuídos nos seus afazeres mas também não tinham voz ativa. Convencimento por parte da gerencia a necessidade da segurança do trabalho. Quando conseguíamos completar os treinamentos, com as devidas certificações e as avaliações mensais estavam dentro do padrão pré estabelecido por minha pessoa."
bad,"the pay sucks, no hours, don't know what schedule your going to be working, managers don't communicate. Working at Walmart is not the rout you wont to take."
bad,"I loved the cashiers I supervised. great ambiance and mutual respect"
bad,"Prior authorizations, filling, billing. The hardest part of my job was handling radical customers. My manager was always professional, encouraging,and friendly."
bad,"It was ok working there. You just mind your business and try to get as much of  your work done there as possible. You're never truly appreciated for the work you actually do, even when you go above and beyond. They expect so much more from you and you're left completely spent. I liked my co-workers and only some of the managers. Sometimes, they have a way of talking to you that's unprofessional and right in front of other customers and other associates and they don't care. It's really demeaning. I do want to thank the other associates for teaching me what to do at my job, seeing as we were never trained to do our jobs in the first place. Yet you're expected to do your jobs quickly and efficiently. Still, it was a job and it paid the bills."
bad,"5196 management is very unprofessional. Favoritism and messy. It's like working with a bunch of middle schoolers,ugh. The job is what you make of it. The customers can be rude at times but overall they're ok. The company can be OK to work for."
bad,"walmart was okay for the first year, but moving forward i was left to unload trucks by myself, maintain the backroom by myself and was expected to do the store wide maintenance when nobody was scheduled, and assist on cash and customer service, in which i i complete my actual job and was unable to assit other departments due to my own workload, i was usually told i need to do more"
bad,I would work from 10:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M. I enjoying the people who I worked with besides the managers. I worked stocking shelves and cleaning up my trash. I would put products up to the maximum quantity and return the products to the back so I could count my overstock. And a few of our managers would take the product back out and cram the products into the surrounding places where other products would go talk to the store manager and tell him I was not putting the products on the shelf.
bad,"I was hired in February of 2015 as part-time. When I had graduated, they offered me a full-time position, which I took. "
bad,"A lot of the time I find myself questioning it working st Wal-Mart worth it? Don't get me wrong the pay is o.k the bonuses are always nice and not to mention the people I work with are like family to me, but the insane amount of work and lack of cashiers in mind bowing. That's when t you really have to question yourself and ask is it worth it ?"
bad,"Very little opportunities for advancement, Promotions are not based on work ethic. No work life balance, coworkers are not team players."
bad,"Je ne peux dénier le fait que la présence de collègues dynamiques motive tout associé de se dépasser et de revenir la journée suivante."
bad,Working here wasnt a very good experience. The wage was small and the accrued benefits wasnt much to look forward to. The working environment wasnt ideal either.
bad,"I learned how to stock and do everything right with the time limits we have. co- workers never really talked, I worked with my twin sister that's who all talked to. management okay but they put favorites and it was okay for some people to not come to work half the time but my grandmother was sick in the hospital and got a coach. I enjoy working by myself for the most part."
bad,Not a diverse and tolorant environment for minorities with diverse backgrounds and thoughts as diverse thoughts are often deliberately suppressed. Advancement opportunities are made rarely available for minorities unless you are willing to mortgage your integrity and kiss the ring and most importantly have zero opinion or thoughts of your own.
bad,I learned about using their equipment and their way of doing things.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get to learn new things and make a customer's day.  There is a continuous change in management with changing expectations.
bad,wal mart cares only about there bottom line. they are making some changes to help with the turn over rate but it not enough
bad,"Greeting the customers. Working crazy hours and not a set schedule."
bad,"If you like customer service, you will enjoy working here. Bouncing around from department to department was something I did not enjoy. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers."
bad,I would not recommend working for this company if you are a hard working individual. This company will take advantage of that and offer no rewards for that hard work. They expect you to go above and beyond for them but care very little when your having problems with your work environment. They seem to intentionally hire managers who are unfriendly who don't know or bother to learn the jobs that they are managing. Very often the management team will conflict with themselves leaving you in the middle to figure out which manager to follow orders from.
bad,For walmart to be as big as it is you would think they'd take care of their employees. Its one thing to tell me I'm on the clock for so long but is another thing to ask me to stay and help clean up the slack of someone else. At times we didn't have enough people to cover every department and we would have at the most 2-3 departments per person which needed to be completed within an 8 hour shift
bad,Usually the day goes by faster depending on your job title and how busy the store is. It is busier towards the front of the store.
bad,"Now I worked at Walmart for about 5 days, most of the staff are friendly and are good people, but some of them are just drama and if you were to do something that they didn't like, even if you just start. As i did, they won't care... Some won't but some will drag it on and complain about it all day, and at the end of the day... That's what got me fired, cause I was checking a time that someone was in, and one co worker thought I shouldn't have bin there, but i have every right to, tried to explain that to her... She thought I was trying to skip my duties at work or something, But i was just checking in and she dragged it on and start saying things behind my back to other co workers... In my opinion, the managers were rude, co workers are drama, and just and overall not a good work environment."
bad,"É uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, boas evoluções, porém, o trabalho toma totalmente conta de tudo que você faz, e outra coisa ruim é que a chance de crescer na empresa é mínima."
bad,"Low pay, high demands, inconsiderate and careless management. Company states that there is no favoritism but it seems like there are certain butts you have to kiss in order to be in the ""in crowd"". Holidays are terrible and very stressful."
bad,"The typical day is full of stress, being given unmeet able tasks, and being under appreciated all day everyday. I didn't learn anything other than Walmart is a bad place to work. The management there doesn't care about their associates as much as they claim. Most of the co-workers are nice and friendly but some they just slide through and don't do much but complain. The hardest part is putting up with all the short staffing and having to compensate the missing places. In my point of view there is no enjoyable part of the job but leaving for the day"
bad,Handling sales on the electronics sales floor was a good experience to get back into retail. I learned I wanted to get into management if I got the chance.
bad,"Every single day I left work with a new bump or scratch, I worked 35 hours a week while trying to balance school and had unrealistic goals set for me every day I was in."
bad,"The thing I like most is the people I work with,it was a fun place at one time.I have learned alot of dirrerent jobs during my time here ."
bad,"The schedules are doable with decent pay. Advancement is only possible if you're related to, friends with higher-ups. There is no recognition or rewards for hard workers. There were situations where hard, experienced workers were skipped over for management position for new employees with friends in HR."
bad,We had two guys on the docks unloading and we were both young and hardworking. We could unload trucks in a better than average time frame. One mngr would say good job another would say speed it up! There are so many Managers and dept. heads at Wal Mart that its surprising that everything gets done. I learned to go directly to the night manager with questions to ensure that I was doing things in the way that he wanted.
bad,"Walmart workers are some of the hardest working people in retail and don't get paid nearly enough for all the abuse they handle from their customers, and more especially management, daily. Nearly every manager is related to another manager in the store somehow, or are their best friend outside of work. It's impossible to promote. If you have 2 written warnings, you are literally ""un-promotable"". Once you are at the next level of write-up, your write-up count doesn't drop to the lower level when one drops off, it doesn't change until they are ALL gone (say you get a 3rd written warning on March 3rd, but your first 2 write-ups drop off in May and June, you still have ""3"" write-ups until the following March, unless you get a 4th one, in which case you're fired). They just announced a new pay-scale for people and people that are getting hired after Feb 20th will be making at least $10/hr. They are switching from 7 pay grades to 4 (A, B, C and D) and if you already make more than the minimum for that position (no matter how long you've been with the company) you will only be getting a 2% pay raise. For example, my position is going from a current minimum of $9.90/hr to $10.50/hr, but I make more than that, so instead of getting a .60 cent raise to match the minimum raise, I'm only getting a 2% raise, which is .21 cents."
bad,"I would answer phone and fill meds for customers."
bad,Pals was my first job. I loved everything about Pals except for the drama. There was so much drama between co-workers that it drove me away. It was a very good company to work for otherwise. I loved most the people that worked there and got a long with most as well. The most enjoyable part of the job was providing great customer satisfaction to our customers and seeing a smile on their faces. The worse and hardest part of the job was dealing with drama from co-workers and management.
bad,"normalmente o dia-a-dia se rodava a receber os fornecedores de acordo com os padrões impostos pela empresa. Aprendi a como ser mais responsável e dinâmico. A direção no inicio ajudava ao máximo para colaborar com o bem-estar do associado para com o fornecedor. Os colegas eram todos receptivos e de bom convívio, ajudando no passar do dia-a-dia. O mais difícil era a demanda de mercadorias que deveríamos receber todos os dias mas o horário e a época onde eu me encontrava pessoalmente ajudavam com  as dificuldades impostas."
bad,its a game of politics i would like to be judged on my work not who i know . i normally come in get the truck ready make sure all is correct make sure the store gets zoned and and solve any issues my associates have .
bad,When working for Walmart they do not want employees to have any overtime and are always shorthanded.  Management can be hard to get a hold of and if there is a problem you get to deal with it with little or no help.  Even department managers are treated badly and feel stressed all the time.
bad,"I begin my shift by answering phones and directing customers to the appropriate person or Department.  The company's communication goes directly though me.  I also must make all overhead pages during my shift.  I am also responsible to put away returned items and provide store security that I must report to a manager.  The hardest part of my job is that since I am a fast worker, I find that people from the shift before me leave a lot of work for me because they know I will get it all done.  I enjoy the fact that I am entrusted to be the only employee on my shift.  I am able to work with a manager on duty or not."
bad,go in go to work find out where and what you are to be doing sometimes it isnt what your job title says i guess mostly what i learned is how to do 20 different jobs at the same time and somehow manage to get them all done on my task time(youare only given certain time frame to complete tasks and it has to be logged into computr) the coworkers are can go either way some are a team player others are for themself a lot of hard working people though i think the hardest part of the job is being coached because you cant complete a task in a certain amount of time when it says on the intructions takes 2 people to complete but youre by yourself the most enjoyable part was when it was time for vacation
bad,"When going into the fitting room, the first thing usually seen is about two or three shopping carts full of merchandise that had been returned to the fitting room. It is Our job to sort, repair and place back all of the items to be sold as they were originally placed. Co-Workers have been helping to teach Me how to do everything that is included in running the fitting room. Management counts on the fitting room to make everything run smoothly. We are the ""heart"" of Wal-Mart. We have to take all customer calls, transfer them to the various departments they need assistance with. We need to take orders from Management to relay messages to those same departments when customers need help or when something goes wrong for any reason. If there is a shipment or an order that has come in, We have to let Management know, so they may quickly take it in and stock it into the store. We have to assist customers into the fitting room slots so they may try on clothing and put back the ones they don't desire."
bad,"managers is awful they work you like slaves dont work around your sheducle, cut your hours without yuou knowing, bounes get cut"
bad,I went straight to my manager about how i would have to be absent two days for a medical condition and i had a doctors note but they would not accept it.
bad,"being an assistant manager for wal mart was very stressful due to the fact that we were responsible for every aspect of running the store. Upper Management rarely left their office to help during busy periods of the day, but never hesitated to utilize their walkie talkies to add on additional tasks for the day. Walmart boasted that it was all about family, yet was open every holiday but one. Salaried members of management were treated differently then hourly. We were not shown the respect that non-exempt employees were. Home office micromanaged through their WIRE system.  I would not work for Wal Mart again."
bad,Based on my three years working there alongside with my ex. I would never step foot back in that place ever again.. Thats the reason why we are divorced now..
bad,Challenges abound due to few associates and low wages.  Management required to fill in the gaps through long work days and few days off.
bad,While working as a cashier I was not allowed to take my breaks at my scheduled times. I had to take bathroom breaks instead. This happened on a regular basis. Co-Workers were unhappy and some were afraid to express there concerns. While in a meeting with the Store Management I was told not to ask questions. The employee lockers are so small that I was not able to fit my belonging's in it. It was a 12x12 locker. I worked Part-Time for a year and a half and had to quit because they would not allow me time off to be with my mother who was gravely ill in the hospital. There is no FMLA for part time employees.
bad,"I worked for Wal-Mart for about 5 years as a jewelry sales associate and most recently a cashier at the Wal-Mart in Kennewick. For some reason, every co-worker that came and went were AMAZING down-to-earth people, and remain my friends even after quitting. Management, however, was terrible. There were maybe 1-2 upper managers that i felt comfortable talking to at all. Most wouldnt even give me the time a day and treat the staff like garbage. The environment was terrible because of all the riff-raff customers that come through. I was sexually harrassed by many of them, and because of the management, never reported any of said customers. We got small raises yearly, but werent all that much. Hours were pretty good for part-time.There was one manager who denied everyones time-requests for apparently no reason, which was a big push for me leaving the store forever. The front end managers were awesome for the most part. Only about 1-2 of them were disagreeable. "
bad,"As pessoas são boas, grades amigos, mas a gerencia é falha, sem direção clara dos objetivos, promoções equivocadas por amizades, salario muito baixo."
bad,"The only problem I got is was trying to do too much at one time when I was by myself.  Was not used to working by myself because of my previous jobs, but I am better prepped for it now."
bad,"the job itself is not hard at all. you unload pallets and put stuff on shelves. The downfall is management. Youre hired and thrown to the wolves with VERY little training. Your best bet is working with someone nice enough to show you the ropes. If not then youre pretty much on your own. Despite not actually training anyone management still felt the need to hassle everyone when freight didnt get done. Now not all managers were bad. There were 2 that worked on my shift. One just didnt care, didnt assign tasks or give anyone any direction. The other gave too much direction, felt the need to actually scream at  people, make them cry and at least once a week gave a speech about how slow everyone was."
bad,"Walmart is NOT THAT bad of a place to work nor shop at, but it's still Walmart and it still manages to hold up to it's poor reputation. Most co-workers were easy to get along with and some supervisors were down to Earth people. Times got fun every now and then, however- due to the ""down to earth"" atmosphere the store had, many consequences developed. Sometimes it was TOO relaxing, therefore, that led to lack of communication, poor management and overall lack of proper training. When new updates came out for registers or when employees were required to ask customers certain things, most of us were rarely informed, yet alone given a small, quick rundown of what's going on and what is expected. It was each man (woman) for their own, and that really turned away many associates, especially newer ones, due to sudden change without warning nor explanation. I don't those that were upset or those that left for times could get overwhelming in a high volume, high traffic store like Walmart. So when sudden, unexpected change with no help came plowing through, it only stressed a good deal of employees and alienated them. It drove them away. Working there was alright, but the huge lack of communication between managers, supervisors, and lower level employees was disgusting and worked for no one there."
bad,"I ran the cash register that I was assigned to, I learned there was a lot of negativity in the employees, that was not what I'm about, there really was not a good line of management. Co-workers were nice but didn't have a lot of nice things to say about the company. It was hard to come in everyday nd keep a smile when even management was negative. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you helped  customer nd they walked away satisfied."
bad,Not willing to hire more employees to meet the store needs and management treated associates very poorly because they simply outranked them.
bad,working at Wa-Mart you will have lots of work to do . At Wal-Mart you will run into friendly staff and customers . You will work every holiday the only holiday you get off is Christmas
bad,"Although Walmart is great for gaining job experience, management is never on the same page. One manager will tell you to do one thing and the other will suddenly come by and tell you to do the opposite."
bad,Management plays favoritism with their employees.Some employees may work their butts off and receive no recognition while some do hardly nothing and get away with it.They are flexible with college schedules but sometimes give too many people Sundays off making the workload too much for those who work on Sundays.Sundays are super busy.
bad,its a job nothing more nothing less. management plays lip service to career advancement and is only looking for themselves
bad,very busy company. large workload required to be done by the end of the day with no help. no room for advancements. managers were not very professional.
bad,"Sales targeted industry with a development attitude in growing it's employees, must need in meeting trading standards as well as company policies. Lots of variety each day with challenging objectives, must need in meeting customer requirements. Most enjoyable part of the job is working in a totally new industry and learning new skills, but at the same time being able to utilise and share my experience with other colleagues."
bad,Not the best place to work in my opinion. Not much room for advancement. Pay and benefits aren't great. The pay is low considering what they require you to do everyday.
bad,"Not enough hours. Really no way to advance unless you are in with managers. CSS never come half the time when needed and don't do too Much. I loved a lot of the regular customers, but other than I did not enjoy my 8 months there. I wanted to get a second job but they said if I put in certain hours I can work then i would lose hours (I was only working 25-30 hours). So I quit and now have a full time job I enjoy"
bad,Felt like a lot of the employees that had been there a while felt entitled to longer breaks and just walking around with friends.
bad,"The environment on a daily basis is filled with customers who will treat you like you are a slave, which is understandable because the world is filled with douchebags, the main issue is that you have to have some guts to handle that while your managers favor other associates that many others believe are fairly inadequate and then dispel all of the discomfort you get from having to rely on managers for many things that you have no control over and face the consequences daily. If you can tough it out, it's great."
bad,"it was an ok place to work, awesome team members but no so great management. super chaotic at times and unorganized, along with not enough man power to run the store efficiently."
bad,my day contained of staying at the register scanning produce or other items at the store. customer service and reliable.
bad,"I thank them for giving me management work experience but the way they work there and the poor communication kills the work environment. Upper management rarely relays things that even lower members of management, such as myself, could benefit from before it becomes a problem. On a daily bases I am scolded by customers because i have o send my cashiers to cover anther area because the other depart fail to see the need to schedule for potentially busy times."
bad,When I first started working at Walmart it was pretty decent then changes started to happen and that's when everything went down hill especially with management. managers were showing favoritism towards certain associates and were very rude and unprofessional at times.
bad,Walmart is for teens and retired personnel. You really can not make it a career unless your in a management position or higher. I love the customers service and the co-workers also.
bad,your night goes by pretty fast doing overnight work restocking shelves in various departments. but the work was alright and interesting at times
bad,Wal-Mart I received some of the best coworkers anyone could have at any job they were sweet loving caring and understanding you don't find it much in your work environment and I thought that was a great experience.
bad,"Not good managements, no team work, and not good work ethic"
bad,enjoyable place to work at from time to time. Employees need more respect from management. fun environment within employees.
bad,"stocking your area, helping in other areas put over stock in backroom "
bad,"The management staff is inexperienced,unprofessional,and not staff friendly. Whether it be from off day requests or minor issues,the bulk of management are inept or just do not care. It is partially due to Walmart's progression routes. After six months,you can apply and be hired for positions that you are not qualified for with minimum training."
bad,Lack of employees so when busy management was always slamming you with more and more cars. If call in they write you up for your family coming into the store. They have other employees find out what you do on your days off.
bad,The management is horrible. I would not recommend anyone to work here unless it is an absolute last option. The management treats employees very poorly and do not treat them well.
bad,Large corp. Low wages. Hours are what are available until you gain time there to manipulate to your scheduled liking. Wish the pay were a little higher beginning.
bad,"I started working at walmart as an instock associate after high school, but like many other people still trying to find something better I was there for 5+ years. While store to store may vary, my experience which started off great only worsened. The rules and procedures are constantly changing , sometimes so that the associates/ anyone under management aren't made aware. After the company restructure recently many people had left or started to, or were let go because they love to clean house and get rid of people that have been too long. They will keep you part-time with full time hours just so they can avoid giving you benefits, or you won't even get the hours, a person can't afford to live on 8-10 dollars an hour and that is after they increased the minimum. No matter how hard I work or how fast I moved it was never good enough. Management did not care what you had to say and never give you a chance to discuss things or change their mind on poor decisions. Never got a thank you for anything I did including things that were above my paygrade. Extremely stressful and favoritism is a big issue as well as a multitude of integrity and ethical issues both for people as well as health/safety"
bad,"Easy Job, you have a list of objectives to complete throughout the night and the managers walk around ensuring the objectives get completed. Timed job, a lot of work in a short amount of time, but work keeps you busy so time flies."
bad,"you  clock in have your morning meeting go to your work area see what needs to be done if  theres a customer there ask them if they needs help with something  i always remember to be friendly no matter if there a little off keep a possitive attuid .i have learned to be polite and to be friendly to people we dont know whats going on in other people s lives as for managment i show respect and try to do everything i can to please them co-workers i get along with everyone just fine never had a problum in the pass the hardest  part of my job is learning the telepone at customer service  dont like being on the intercom the most enjoyable part of my will theres a few ,customer service  making sure my department is in order help out when or where ever i can"
bad,I come in and go to the meeting and go to  work I learned how to stock the sleves and make the store look better when done with my shift
bad,Wal-mart is great at providing low prices for customers but does not support associates. Company recently raised minimum wage for associates then followed it up with cutting associates hours.
bad,"Secure job. Poor work life balance. Not appreciated for work. Corporate office not concerned with ethics in the work place. Overall, terrible place to work if you have a college degree and/or care for customers"
bad,"Some people would love the job, its just not the job I'm looking for. My goal is to be a coach and that's what I have my mind set to. I just needed a job to help with bills while in college"
bad,"Walmart is the place where most people go to shop. A lot of the time customers are rude. Some people enjoy working at Walmart, I did not."
bad,responsible for stacking and down stacking pallets.. unloading trucks that come and go all hours of night.used telezon to confirm orders and instock orders.
bad,"While working for Walmart my experience was terrible. Benefits and compensation are horrible, and much lack of management. Poor communications when problems arise. Nevertheless, the job itself is easy to keep, but not many employees stay for long."
bad,"With the New raise that only the new associates get and not the old ones has me looking for other employment, because people just starting are making more then me and i am a certified tech and they are not."
bad,"I believed I would retire from Walmart. The work was fine. To many managers not willing to help. The turn around was very high, so constantly training new associates."
bad,I loved working there and enjoyed the customers and my immediate coworkers and management. Upper management tended to be oblivious to the way they treated lower emplyees however. It was not the Wlalmart I expected when I started there. I applied for full time but was never officially considered full time. It was fun  as cashier but when I was asked to be a customer service supervisor I wish I had never accepted the   position. It added many responsibilities and I received no pay raise for it and basically feel I was railroaded out when I iintended  to apply for customer service management for the pay increase.
bad,"Walmart is a good entry level job. If you want to advance in the company prepare to become personal friends with management. On Facebook. In real life. Know their wives' and their kids' names. If you're not on friendly terms with the management, prepare to get the worst hours and the worst treatment. Their managers are often times pedantic and prone to absolute nepotism. I've never seen such a vast company have such an ill prepared management team in my life. If you can avoid the managers, then you have to deal with the other associates that are trying to throw you under the bus for their own betterment."
bad,walmart was a okay place to work at.i learned about customer service.i worked with some awesome and helpful coworkers.
bad,"Good company to work for if your willing to give up family time."
bad,"Walmart's backwards policies and treatment of employees are no secret to the world, but if I can give over three years of my life to a corporation like that, I can work and excel anywhere."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with others who make a difference in others daily lives and make it fun at the same time. You learn about yourself and how much of a difference you also make in others daily lives. The hardest part of the job is realizing that the bottom line seems to be more important than the customers or the associates. All associates seem to have different importance to  management. (Favoritism and prejudice according to how well they like/tolerate you)  As well as, the lack of communication from management to staff and proper training."
bad,"The only thing that was really good about the company where the benefits that they offered to their employees, but as far was wage, hours and how management treated their staff was aweful"
bad,"Arrive at 1:00 p.m. work until 10:00 p.m. How to be tolerable of other people and their issues. Management at Walmart is insufferable, most of the CSM's are a great group of people and some of the managers are okay as well, but their are a few of the managers that feel that they are better than everyone else.  My co-workers are a group of wonderful people who are like me and just trying to make ends meet. The hardest part of my job is standing on my feet for 8 hours a day and only being able to sit down when I go on breaks. The most enjoyable part of the day is when I get off work."
bad,The pay is not good and the nights were quite long. i unloaded trucks and only got paid at that time 6.25 in aout 3 months i received 60 cent raise. If it wasnt for the unloaders how would the product reach the floor.
bad,Good networking environment. need to value employers more offer more benefits and full time positions. need to value holidays.
bad,"the jobs themselves are not hard, however; management shows little interest in the employees themselves.The work load is never distributed evenly and no one follows any of the no retaliation policies."
bad,"I liked doing the work and helping people find things. But I never felt that management ever appreciated what we did. I learned a lot about how not to run a business. I think the hardest part of the job was that it was overnight, it stopped me from being able to spend time with my family as had to be asleep in the day time."
bad,A job not for someone who cannot keep up and who cannot work with a team. Requires you to work multiple departments and to be reliable.
bad,"I worked at walmart for 5 years. The first two years were great, good hours and plenty of workers to cover the floors and provide customer service.  And then, it just changed. They started cutting hours and pretty much forcing people to quit and they did not replace them."
bad,My fellow co workers were the joy of working for Walmart. It was very difficult working under management that would not back up decisions and situations that had to be enforced.
bad,I'm a single mother and they always had me closing. Therefore I only saw my kids getting them ready for school. A lot of do as I say and not as I do.
bad,The workforce could be better. Needs lots of improvements. You can grow with the company and the work is easy to learn. I enjoy meeting new people and learning somuch about customer service.
bad,Walmart is a place that try to motivating you and show you that they have a lot to offer. Management helps you from any department as well as co worker. Everyone is very helpful and friendly.
bad,"On first look, Wal-mart is a wonderful place to work. The processes are designed to keep work flow & inventory flow running smoothly. We stock shelves based on capacities, make display pretty, & work occasionally with customers in the night shift. In reality, management doesn't enforce the processes set in place, so it's a never-ending cycle of overstuffing shelves resulting in tricking automated re-order processes into re-ordering, setting up a snowball effect of automatic over-stock while management pushes us to get the stock any way we can onto the shelves to sell. This resulted in mountains of ""feature items"", stressful workplace, & a whole lot of unnecessarily harder work. The hardest part of this job, besides physical, is knowing there's great automated processes in place, & that by working against it, it has created a monstrous & stressful cycle of putting out fires, & learning I'm not allowed to do a thing to bring things back in line. Some management expressed same frustration. I did enjoy working with customers & some of my co-workers. It was nice seeing Wal-mart does give some people down of their luck, a chance at a new start. Don't know if CEO has any idea impact work-practices vs automated processes has on the lower efficiency of the whole business, or just won't see it to make appropriate changes."
bad,They pay below living wage and treat you with little respect. Sam Walton would be ashamed of what his legacy has become. They do very little to make you feel welcome and don't really train you to do much. They toss you in an area after hours of computer training and you'll be lucky to get someone who has done the work long enough to actually learn something. In short they are hypocrites at what they tell you in person or interviews. I would not be recommending anyone to work here.
bad,The workers made the job go smoother. The pay was subpar and management was incompetent and prioritized issues unevenly and questionably.
bad,they will work like dogs .... co workers were the best however there is a disconnect between management and coworkers. this scans per second is ridiculous what happen to customer service.
bad,"If the job is temporary its fine but anything long term will feel like its sucking the life out of you. Out of the entire store there was only one manager that i had the upmost respect for who happened to be my supervisor for most of my carrier there, everyone else carried on as if they were a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off. I personally witnessed other managers attempting to collaborate firing employees that they didn't care for on a personal level. The hardest part is being evaluated by a supervisor who knows nothing about your department or even what you do on a day to day and they're able to determine what kind of raise you get. Gossip is really bad in this company amongst the co workers even some managers, there is a no tolerance policy but that has yet to be effective.  The most enjoyable part is really being able to help your customer and answer any questions they may have."
bad,"us that have been there a long time used to love coming to work.walmart was really like our extended family,but since several years ago things have really changed. in my department alone we are down 13 associates.the company keeps laying people off and not replacing them.we are working twice as hard with half the help and the customer service is really bad because of this.there is basically no communication between management and the regular associates.management is always threatening-work harder,or else."
bad,"To many overnight manager's giving different orders to the same person ,  Tight time tables with to many people to muck it up. If they trimmed out the extra manager's it would have been a very easy job with growth"
bad,taught children with disabilities general living skills taught them to cook potty train and did physical therapy activities and read to them did reading activities and also made sure that they were safe and got along with the other children
bad,"clock in. cash duty. clock out. break. boring boring boring and so not worth 11.75 an hour with all of the disgusting things you see in a day, just as a cashier alone."
bad,go to work and pull freight and clean isle and open boxes and stock the shelves. the easiest part is the actual stocking. Management has no idea on how to balance the needs of the company versus the employees skills. hardest part is the lack of people. I learned that retail is not for me.
bad,"I enjoyed the cashiering duties, but was often over-tired when released from unloading trucks, (titled inventory associate) from the back of the store."
bad,I worked here for 8 months then they said I had to be let go because my coworker was moving too slow. I liked the job at first and everyone was nice to me except management. Management changes from time to time and the current managers are very nice. Was confused as to why I was let go but other workers said that's just how they are.
bad,The pay was not enough to survive. They cut hours and if you were to work they would give you hours like 6:30p-11p. Then you had to deal with the customer's attuieudes and the pay wasn't enough.
bad,management has to listen to corporate which is a bunch of people that never worked a day in there life in the retail setting but they get to make all rules that cause more issues then prevent.
bad,"Too many chiefs; not enough indians.  Never enought help scheduled.  Most mgrs. lack interpersonal skills.  I was hired as a sales associate for the paint/hardware dept but was never taught how to use an RFD scanner.  The more I did and the harder I tried, the less it was appreciated.  I'll never understand why a company would not want their employees to have the best training.  I did learn how to mix paint.  Mostly I was a gopher putting returns back on the shelf.  Most younger employees would have accepted other jobs at other businesses if there were any available.  The only positive thing I can say about them is that they will hire old people."
bad,This job was very beneficial to me. With this Job I was able to complete a 4 year degree and further pursue my schooling. This job had taught me a lot about customer service skills and how customers should be served and treated. The hardest part about the job is knowing to relate and treat the customer and knowing that customers come first. The most enjoyable part about the job is me knowing that the customer is satisfied and taken care of.
bad,When you work at Walmart in Marion you can't really have fun unless you are on break or lunchtime but in your department you might get to work with people that aren't really good but some of them can be really funny and make you laugh when your in a bad mood or if you don't want to smile when there are nobody around that are customers.
bad,"Servant Leadership, Accountability, Open Communication with other Associates and Customers.  Team Work, Aggressive Hospitality, Listening, Diversity, Trust, and Humility.  I strive each day for excellence.  The most enjoyable part of my job is customer service.  There is no hard part to my job."
bad,"Walmart was a great job, not much to complain about. Nice people, nice customers, nice management (mostly). Training was a little over the top and very lengthy"
bad,"Management is not helpful or knowledgeable. When a customer is upset, they offer a gift card or a discount, and never actually fix the problem. There are never enough people to do the work that needs to be done. They only have the bare minimum amount of employees in order for the store to function."
bad,"Get the equipment you need to check lows and outs"
bad,"I had worked at Walmart temporarily for the holiday season. I was hired on as a sales associate to tackle putting merchandise on shelves and organizing the grocery department. The things that I learned were mechanical. I didn't use a PDA or anything fancy. I generally stocked merchandise and reordered shelves and put new merchandise on empty shelves. The management and co-workers there seemed like they despised their jobs. Even at team meetings they looked cheerful, but when they went back to doing their daily jobs they looked miserable. No one looked happy there and employees and even managers looked uptight. The mood was unsettling and the people I had worked with were reserved and hardly ever spoke. Their wasn't any hardships with the job I was positioned for and the only enjoyable task that I was doing was thinking creatively on how I could stock shelves."
bad,I don't really like working for this company. I feel as if they can be more understanding when it comes to the needs of their employees.
bad,"I worked at Walmart briefly during the summer and quit for school. I did not feel that the management really cared about the staff, or anything really."
bad,Hardest part of the job is the physical labor. The money is good but the lack of job security is tough on ones mental state. its all about the production which is sad cause people are people and not machines. One bad weekend and your production average will fall and you will be coached.
bad,you will meet different people  from all over. So if you love working with people and in retail this would be the job for you.
bad,Wal-Mart is not a good place to work every manger I worked for only cared about themselves. If my boss's would have been nice I was told that I could of been a manager there.
bad,"A typical day would include being responsible for your own job and others as well. Forced to cashier without pay etc"
bad,Walmart is ok to start your working career.  But after working there for any lengthy period of time you realize the hardest part of the job is the lack of communication. And my personal opinion on what was enjoyable on the job is the fact that most of the time your in-doors.
bad,"This company would of been beyond better if the management cared about how the store was, they only cared about them self. Other then that i enjoyed being a cashier and interacting with the wide variety of customers that came into the store."
bad,Wal-Mart is an ok place to work if you are a high school student just needing a job for some extra cash. Wal-Mart does not care about their employees. They only care about how much money they are making. They over work their employees and expect one person to do the job of five.
bad,A typical day working at Wal-Mart was not as expected I learned how to stock shelves and prep for distribution the management to me seemed as if they played favorites and would basically do things for show my co- workers were excellent which made the job worth going to the hardest part of the job was the he say she say environment the most enjoyable part of my job was being around my co workers and helping customers
bad,I wasn't really all that trilled there management didn't help with work load just walked around most of the time or stood up.
bad,"Totally overworked, low pay, and abuse of authority from management. No one there is equal. Favoritism is shown from management."
bad,"a typical day of work at Wal-Mart- get to work, clock in and go to the loading bay, have a team meeting designate roles for the day and begin unloading and sorting freight from the truck onto pallets according to departments. I learned how to use telzons for binning and picking merchandise, good time management skills, as well as good customer service. the management at Walmart is very easy going. the hardest part of the job was being short staffed. most enjoyable part of the job was finishing up at the end of the night knowing you've completed everything properly and on time."
bad,"Walmart was a test job for me to see if I could handle the workplace after a hospital stay. I enjoyed the fact that I was always busy, the day seemed to go fast. The people I worked with were awesome for the most part. management seemed not to really care about us, I am not sure if this was the case but it sure seemed that way."
bad,Very stressful work environment. Rarely had positive days. Management was not very helpful in solving problems. Customers often angry due to lack of product or customer service provided by other employees.
bad,"A typical day at work was very busy.    The hardest part of the job was the inability to do your daily requirements due to being pulled to do other things.    You were expected to get your work done, but it is very difficult if you are doing other things for your whole shift.   I enjoyed my fellow associates and do miss working with them."
bad,"The direct management above me was good but anyone beyond that wasn't very friendly. I tried to get a schedule change, but I wasn't given any help. I was reprehended for a misunderstanding in public in front of customers and other coworkers."
bad,It was an okay job. I had a good time learning all new things with walmart. I enjoyed making the customers feel special.The hardest part was standing for so long. most enjoyable was clocking out to go home to my children.
bad,"At the beginning of my shift i generally attend the meeting where management goes over information with employees. After that i task in to assigned job area and perform normal duties such as stocking, keeping work area clean, helping customers, and zoning. Management is a different kind of animal so to speak but they are there to help and run the store efficently. the hardest part of the day is picking up after other shifts and keeping up with daily curveballs, such as floor crew waxing certain areas, being assigned multiple areas, having an abundance of work, etc. the most enjoyable part of the day for me is just being able to work and make a paycheck going home feeling like i accomplished something no matter what it was."
bad,"Aprendi bastante lá, e adquiri muita experiencia na área comercial e de fiscalização."
bad,"Working outside pushing carts all day was ok, the co-worker was good we all become friends, the hardest part was working outside pushing carts all day by myself"
bad,A great place to work when you are young.Always busy so days go by really fast.Not always sure who to go to for supervision.
bad,"would not advise any one to make a career out of it,the people are hard to get along with.its a bad place to work.the people have cicles they keep with"
bad,"I avoided Wal-mart for years, and after my brief experience I know why.  It's a great place to get job advancement and benefits, but the culture is work hard for little pay and poorly-maintained equipment.  There was a lot of gossip and head-butting with management, at which point I had enough and quit.  If you can get use to the job, this is ok, but if not stay away."
bad,"Everyday I would clock in and organize my station before I open my register. Taking customers into my line and making them feel like they matter was really important to me. Mostly I would do this by a start of ""hello, how are you?"" I am a firm believer that smiles are one of the keys to leaving a positive lasting impression. Working there at walmart I learned much about how customers view you as an employee. I learned that sometimes to have a better management system, you have to aspire to be that system. The management was terrible when I worked there. As far as the company's goal to make money, they were on point with it but as far as caring and compassion for their employees, well thats a different story. My daughter was being delivered at the hospital not even a block away from walmart where I was nearing the end of my shift. I begged to be let off for the rest of the night to be there for my daughter and my wife but the manager on duty told me if I left then I would be fired. I found a better job after that. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with ignorant angry customers who look at you like your a piece of garbage just because your a cashier. The most enjoyable part of the job was the way I could make the customers forget how long they are spending in my line by giving them a smile and great communication by conversation."
bad,Management are not understanding and did not help me grow and succeed but instead made a hostile environment for me. Did not really care about their employees and made it hard for many employees to approach management with personal problems.
bad,you would help stock shelves and help customers look for what they wanted and help set up displays for the upcoming seasons
bad,"Walmart had good pay and benefits, but the long commute took a toll on me every week. "
bad,"Typical night at work is getting in trucks of merchandise every night and stocking shelves. In the event that there is no new truck freight for the night, the backroom area has plenty of merchandise that can be worked to the shelves. I've learned valuable time management skills, and where to position people to have the best overall group success for the night so the team can meet the projected goal for the evening. We have several different managers that supervise overnight, I did not directly work with them unless inquiring about a special assignment. My coworkers are mostly helpful, but you are tasked with taking care of your assignments mostly by yourself. The hardest part of my job was just a lack of reliable equipment to use night in and night out. It can be challenging moving 3,000lbs pallets with poor and faulty pallet jacks. The most enjoyable part of the job would be that all of my coworkers get along which makes any job that much easier."
bad,It is an OK corporation. Just low pay compared to the profit the place makes. I think as well that it in many ways hurts several other businesses and sends manufacturing to other nations.
bad,"Dont work for them....rude people. I hate the managment I hated every day there, the manager was rude  towards employees, pay checks always late, bad envirnoment"
bad,The managers showed favoritism to the co workers whom were women and colored.I worked my hardest and never got promoted nor recognized.
bad,"On paper wal-mart is an amazing company. However, in real life the management teams at various stores are terrible and run them into the ground. There is rampant and obvious favoritism and nepotism.  To the punish the workers that do their jobs and let the people who don't do their job run wild."
bad,"It started out as okay. But you should be a friendly and people person before applying to be a cashier. I got fed up quickly with my job position."
bad,"i work to get my bills paid, that being said i dont like a stiff, unorganized, place that dosent know when to take things seriously or not. i worked for Walmart for 5 years, they had me do everyone elses job, and get mad because mine wasn't done. management was unorganized and never had my back. i worked well with my team and got things done when we could, the hardest part was having to watch my back everyday because when management is viewing you as a threat to there job, because you do there job and hold there hand, the most enjoyable part  was my co-workers."
bad,Management was real unorganized. Felt that I was not going to move up in the company. I learned how to make pallets and use the pallet jack.
bad,Management does not respect for or stand up for their employees. They expect employees to do more work than what it is possible. The customers are usually polite. The co-workers work well together.
bad,"Recent years have developed a situation of low staffing, low skills and a very unappreciative working environment. Many days and most weeks come down to a you will as many hours and days as it requires to make up for the situation. Results in many 60+ hour weeks and 15+ hour days, most of which are no planned an last minute you have to stay type situations."
bad,Typical retail long hours on your feet. Personal life is not allowed when you are owned by the largest retailer in the world.
bad,"Sales Serving the customer I learned how to be a team player how to stock merchandise. Not professional or friendly inappropriate workplace language. Pleanst willing to help if needed, working with unprofessional supervisor's. My customer being satisfied with the service i provided"
bad,"I did not like my experience at Walmart, not so fun to work there. you working hard and not getting good pay for your effort"
bad,"Walmart turns a lot of merchandise on a daily bases. This necessitates the continuous restocking of the shelves. There is always plenty of opportunity for customer service."
bad,"I worked at walmart 8 years total,was never offered a promotion. They work you hard like slaves and cut your hours without notice,sometimes months at a time. Co workers doesnt try to work together, its like everyone looks out for themselves. Management treats you like your not even human,your problems is solely your own and not the companys."
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of clocking in, then finding my manager to get my tasks for the shift. While working on my project, I would say probably 80 percent of the time, a manager from a different department would instruct me to go perform a different task."
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart isn't bad work load wise. The managers is the one thing that makes the job bad. With my experience I experienced favortism, talking to employee's about others, and mistreatment."
bad,"Cashiering was not a difficult job but the management made working there difficult."
bad,"Walmart started off badly by hiring me for one job (overnight stocker) and training me for another (overnight backroom inventory), which made starting extremely confusing. Their lack of communication was so lackluster that I was not even aware that I'd landed the job until I was already there (thinking it'd be for an interview) and being told I'd be there for eight hours to do some basic training."
bad,"i worked in the backroom doing inventory related things, i had to work closely with the sales floor associates and some of them seemed like they didn't have a clue about what was going on. some of my managers were compatant but around my last few months at Walmart we had management changes, these newer managers did not seem to know how to run a store, they would not enforce company policies until it was enforced on them. they also did not seem to be on the same page as each other and would often give you conflicting instructions. overall it made the job very mentally stressfull"
bad,"If Walmart was a decent employer at one time, they are no longer. If you find a decent store, hang on to it like nothing else, because it is a gem in a sea of filth."
bad,"at Wal-Mart we have very little down time throughout the day, I like that because there's always something to keep me busy."
bad,"My typical day is to cut and decorate cakes for special orders. I also answer the phone and take orders from customers. In my spare time, I prepare cakes for back-up, clean equipment, rotate stock, etc. I am often pulled to stock the floor for the bakery, as well as produce. I sometimes work to bake and decorate donuts as well. I have baked, bagged and stocked fresh bread too."
bad,"My experience at Walmart was horrible to say the least. A typical day consisted of constantly covering for other employees who would go on frequent breaks exceeding one hour in length. The hardest part of the job was trying to find another employee to cover my position so that I could go on mandatory breaks at the times I was scheduled to take them. Aside from the difficulties finding someone to cover me on my breaks, I had been given several warnings about taking breaks on time, however could not go on break until the other employees returned from their breaks. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer service, which gave me the ability to leave my post at the fitting room and walk around. My experience with the co-workers varied; some co-workers were very pleasant and taught me how to do my job, while others would simply expect me to pick up their slack. Some of the managers were very good to the employees, as they would explain things clearly and help when needed. Other managers would expect associates to exceed their physical limits in heavy lifting without a team as well as covering for department managers that decided to call in, expecting them to automatically know how to do a job that they are clearly not qualified or educated on how to do."
bad,"Walmart was the first big job I was hired into straight out of high school. At the time, it was the worst. The amount of disgruntled customers was ridiculous, which turned into being lashed at daily for things out of my control, no matter where I worked. Since it was my first main job, it taught me how to run a cash register, how to read UPC codes, being comfortable with the general public, and where items were located. What I was NOT taught or warned was the amount of ridicule I would receive from not only customers, but the occasional manager for 'not working hard enough'. I was placed in the Pharmacy by accident as a cashier, and discovered that the amount of disgruntled customers were located there. I was constantly lashed at for insurance or medicine issues out of my control, despite me attempting to calm the customer and explain that it was not my doing. I switched to the midnight shift to leave that, but it was no better: I became sick and was not able to work to my standards, but one of the managers constantly was on my case about it, threatening to fire me weekly for not working hard enough. I was expected to put away 8-hours' worth of work in 2 hours by myself (at least 4 pallets with 16 large boxes each of unsorted merchandise), and was scolded when I would ask for help from someone who was mostly finished with their work. At one point, my illness left me in incredible pain where I could not move, and my manager at the time still didn't believe be even when I was on the floor crying from the pain. Even once I was checked out for my medical issue (which was a type"
bad,"Strongly disliked the hierarchy. It seemed that the longer a technician worked there, the less work they have to do. The technicians that were buddies with the manager always got treated well and got the shifts they wanted, regardless of their performance."
bad,Management was always micro-managing departments and placing a burden on the workers who took their job seriously. Was definitely a high stress job on everyone (staff and management). Customer service was decent but still had those customers who couldn't be pleased so employees have to keep courteous to others.
bad,"My typical day at Walmart, is surrounded by the best people. Hard workers ready to get the job done. Frist clock in to clock out, nothing but work. Stocking, helping customers, helping your co workers. Its fast past and you work to a dead line. I loved it but didn't see a future."
bad,Es una empresa que da muchos beneficios pero al mismo tiempo te quita
bad,"The overnight position is really struggling to find any workers and get all the freight on the shelves. The management is clueless, and every time a truck arrives to unload the fright, the backroom is a mess. It seems to no matter how much work we do nightly, we never get praised for the work we do, and the advancement is pretty much non-existent. We also don't get any overtime. As for the enjoyable part of my job, they pretty much leave me be to do my job. The worst parts, besides the ones mentioned about is the lack of organization from the top to the bottom. It's a job that no one really wants to do."
bad,a typical day at work at walmart u would run register get people in and out as soon as possible and if they needed you to put items on the shelf you had to do that and you had to smile at everybody that came through the doors.
bad,"Working at Walmart is a very challenging job. I had learned so much working here on dealing with different kinds of people customers and associates as well. On the benefits part you really need to be patient on waiting for it. On personal growth I don't really found it during my stay because still there is such things they need to improve. For me there is no hard part of the job because every trials I encounter I do my best to surpass it and make a better way of improving it. The enjoyable part of the job is meeting different kinds of people, people you will learn to appreciate because they appreciate what you did for them."
bad,"I had a stable full time schedule, at the same times every day. However, the workload for me and my co-workers was far too much to get done in 8 hours, so we had to stay for overtime on many occasions, while management tried to keep it from us. The work itself wasn't too bad though, for what I experienced, and I enjoyed the company of my co-workers."
bad,"My days at work were usually long and filled with unappreciative coworkers and management. Management was very rude, and never around."
bad,"The place has no real leadership, different managers , each one not knowing what the other is doing or saying. you go into work and before you get to the backroom to get your things ready for your shift , you have 5 or 6 things the overnight crew did not do on their shift and you have to do it for them,"
bad,A typical day at work is not enough people to do the jobs that are required to keep things running and managment sometimes I think they don't care. My co-workers are nice and great to be with. The hardest part of my job is trying to clean up after other people when they don't do their job. I do like most of my co-works
bad,There is no training at this company. Expectations are through the roof and you constantly have to pull the knife out of your back. Upper management walks all over middle management and gives very poor direction. The associates overall are amazing individuals.
bad,I did cashiering and worked in managing layaway accounts. Was an OK Job. Not that exciting. worked while going to school.
bad,"It is very interesting to learn a different side of retailing, also to see how a very large corporation makes money on top of money, along with the set backs"
bad,"company typically hired people with no experience or knowledge,and allowed untrained individuals to work on customers cars unsupervised,creating potential break downs and inconvenience  to the customer."
bad,"I was a Customer service Manager in charge of cashiers."
bad,"This job is ideal for someone enrolled in school. However, it would be best to make sure your school schedule is set, as they aren't very flexible when it comes to changing shift."
bad,"Horrible management, they do not respect the employees, even the employees who are dedicated."
bad,"Num dia normal, se carregava muito peso, realizava atendimento/vendas, organizava estoque, recebia mercadoria, colocava etiqueta. "
bad,"working at Wal-Mart deli was cutting meats, cooking food, serving customers. I enjoyed working in customer service it was fast paced sometimes hard to please customers. One thing i learned is its always better to smile and acknowledge the customer it make their day and makes life easier for everyone around you ."
bad,walmart was i good place to work when i first started.  just over the your they did not care any more about the worker its all about the money and that's it.  You do more work then you can handle.
bad,Nothing about this job was enjoyable to me it's a job for someone whom does have a responsiblilty like high school students and college kids not for someone raising a family plus the pay is ovful
bad,"Each day we come in find out what the work load for the day is, then are assigned an area to work EX. some associates will pull orders for sams club others will pull orders for Wal-Mart. Management staff is all friendly and approachable. The hardest part of the job would be the constant heavy lifting. All of my co-workers get along and work together to get the job done, the most enjoyable part of my job would be learning different areas of the business."
bad,"I worked grocery stock, unloaded trucks, rotated stocks on the shelves and stocked product from the inventory in storage rooms to the shelves."
bad,"Not too much to say about Walmart, I was there for a short period of time, It was hard manual labor work at odd hours of the evening. I left because it was interrupting my focus in school and couldnt' stay awake during classes. I learned how to stock items and where they would be located for customers assistance. Management wasn't very pleasant, every 15 minutes someone would come down the isle to ask if you were done yet to hurry you up to the next row, not very encouraging. Co-workers were very polite but competitive as well. The hardest part was getting used to working overnight on the floor. The most enjoyable part of this job would be my co-workers personalities"
bad,The inventory system is not well implemented. There are products that are missing from the shelves and are not stocked. Many products are also overstocked. Employees are required to empty stacks of products to see if products can be put on shelves. Then products that can not be put out are inventoried and placed in the back storage. This is the first inventory of products delivered to the store. To me all products should be inventoried when entering the store to check for theft in transit and them theft from stock.
bad,"overloaded with other peoples work"
bad,"Depending upon the store you are hired at, you will have different experiences. Some may be better than others, and some may be worse. The overall company has it's normal ups and downs, but my current location had more downs than ups. Mostly due to management."
bad,"This is just a job. I went there, I worked, I went home. Little opportunity to advance from this location. Management is not engaged with employees. You fear for your job on any given day, always looking over your shoulder. "
bad,"I only worked here for a few months, but it was one of the most brutal experiences of my life."
bad,My overall review of this company is not a shinning review. I worked a straight midnight shift and it was very difficult. If you are a student they work with you and accommodate you more than if you are a full time employee. I found the work environment very much full of favoritism.
bad,"I have to do the impossible with limited staffing.  I have learned to be more organized and consistent.  Management does not care whether you have enough personnel to get the job done, they just want to see that what they told you to do gets done.  My co-workers have no sense of teamwork and take no pride in their work.  The hardest part of my job is to manage the people that don't have a sense of teamwork.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when I can leave on time."
bad,"You get to meet and greet everyone that lives around you. "
bad,"Working for a large corporation such as WalMart is surely not going to be all easy and you'll no doubt get some issues with management, but my problem isn't what I expected. "
bad,"A typical day started with stocking furniture, would take about 2 hours- stocking candles, then the heavy furniture, then luggage. then sporting goods, it would take an hour at max. then automotive, depending on the day it would take 1-5 hours to stock, mostly motor oil. After I was done with my work I usually went to grocery side and helped there, or helped anyone that needed help in the GM Side. id help and ask customers for help when needed. At 11 pm, everyone working in electronics went home so I was also in charge of  helping and keeping an eye electronics so every once in awhile i'd stop what I was doing to take a peek and see if anyone was there or needed help and then either help or return to my work."
bad,"For and overnight stocker, your night begins with a quick meeting where sales figures are discussed as well as the literal song and dance routine to attempt to incorporate you into the Walmart atmosphere. That's where the fun ends."
bad,"Baking, customer service at the deli. Product presentation. Supervisor was good, managers were fair. Co-workers were intelligent, fair and fun to work with. Being there at 4:00 a.m."
bad,"This company has good qualities if you not looking to move up. They under appriciate their employees and stress them to the full extent. I would reccomend a different employer. I learned what kind a manager I would not want to be when I get the chance to be a leader in another corporation. The co-workers are what made it tolerable, you meet great associates that have dreams to be more than what they are."
bad,"I did learn a lot there but management is very disrespectful, They don't care if customers are around or not they will get onto you in front of anyone for anything. The hardest part of my job was learning everything my self. There is no training at all and had to learn how to be a department manager myself and when I did something wrong I would always get into trouble but yet I had no training at all. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I did get to know some good co workers. The ones that weren't in uppermanagement were always willing to do what ever they could to help and were always nice in every aspect."
bad,"I had to work really hard on full-time hours. I didn't have mind that, until I learned that the door greeters made more than the people unloading Walmart trucks all day."
bad,When I first started this job was awesome. Then it turned out to be cut throat and everyone for their self. They started cutting full time hours and hiring me part timers to replace full timers.
bad,"I had some good reviews and a lot of bad ones for Wal-Mart I don't agree with everything they did! I wasn't to pleased that my new department manger didn't like me. She and her friend(department manager) got me fired! I was with them for three years and after that Wal-Mart produce in Oxford, MS started to decline."
bad,"i learned the most of my work knowledge with walmart so i thank them for that. but its so hard to grow in the company with out kissing some serious butt. and if you get in trouble for one little thing, they shun you and put some personal vendeta against you that prevents you from growing in the company"
bad,"Simple work, stocking shelves and building modules.  "
bad,"a typical day can not be determined some days it can be busy and then some days it could be slow. Most management can be great and some can be difficult honestly speaking. As far as co-workers they are wonderful to work with and became future friends. The hardest part of the job would mostly be unable to get off work on time when employees are not able to work past a certain time. Some jobs have some policies that only allow to miss 3 days within a 6 month period. I honestly struggled with this because I had help when my mom lived with me. She would watched my kids when I worked. It wasn't until 2013 that she was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and I had to help her and kids plus work. After she passed there were time I was late for work and days I missed because of either kids getting sick or my health/ injuries. Recently, that is why I decided I needed to quit back in September 2014 to help my kids at home for a while. Now I know that I am stable and comfortable with them at my dads I am ready to get back to work. The best part of the job is making people happy and putting a smile on their face lets me know that I am doing my job."
bad,"learned how to change tires and oil on different vehicles"
bad,"The only nice thing is if you are partially competent then you can get promoted up fast. The downsides are everything else that has to do with the job. I won't go into detail because it will just turn my good day into a bad one by reflecting on the place. Its a good place to work, part time, while you pursue another career. Other than that, keep away, keep very far away. Take it from me, I was mid-level management. I could tell you all the ways I was told to treat employees, but I need to keep profanity out of this review."
bad,good job loaded and unloaded trucks managers are great cool work place
bad,"Job Security is not strong at all. they will let you go for any reason, even for doing your job right."
bad,The managers are doing all they can to make the day sale successful. They willing to introduce new items to customer and sell it for a profit. Also my co-workers are great by team up and get the assignment done for the day.
bad,"Don't expect fair pay or treatment"
bad,"Good about working around school schedule. "
bad,"You have to fight to get your schedule changed for school, and for days off. Supervisors ignored cashier's requests. Co-workers were unfriendly and rude. Supervisors were uncaring to personal needs such as bathroom breaks, and regular breaks."
bad,Now walmart is bad all together. They dont give a  about any of their employees. They dont pay you enough for all the bs they put you through. The associates are understaffed and over worked. Too many manager and not enough workers. Not a good company to go to  but its a job
bad,"As a typical day at work you pretty much assist anyone on the front end with money, overrides, and making good decisions when it comes to the customers and their requests. I enjoyed my co workers and employees very much. "
bad,"Typical day at work was ridiculous, there was no management at all. Nobody knew what they were doing. I learned customer service skills and how customers wanted to be treated. I also learned how to handle difficult situations with customers, such as when a customer got angry and upset. I worked with some good people and some not good people. The hardest part was actually looking forward to going to work, after a couple of months I dreaded going to work. I loved making the customers happy."
bad,would come in and get started unloading the truck which should take up to 1 hour 30 minutes or 2 hours. from their we would process the freight and get it out to the floor before the 3rd shift would come in. the job was fairly easy. my co workers were nice funny people who made the day go by fairly fast and easy.
bad,"I held two different jobs at Walmart Baker, and Over night stocker.  While I was in the bakery I went in at 3 am. I was the only person in my department for four hours. I started the oven, the baking, broke down the delivery and help the other people set up for the day. I have to say the chain of command at Walmart was not something that I have ever understood, even now. The co-workers that I did know I got along with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management. The most enjoyable part of my job was when the management told me what to do and just let me do it."
bad,Decent place to work if you're OK with making less than 10 dollars an hour for functioning as a department manager.
bad,Walmart treats its associates as if they arent human beings often. Their main concern is the money in consumers wallets and doing what ever it takes to get it. There is no consistent policy. Its about 12 pages long but not one member of management defends it. People can really come in the store and act childish and get exactly what they want. Management acts as if they are holier than though and dont offer any support as far as getting the long lines down or helping other supervisors with the daily tasks when staff is short.
bad,A typical day as an assistant manager at Walmart started with our morning meetings. Our store manager gave us our daily notes and what to complete for the work day and what was left from the day before. We then would gather the information and delegate it accordingly. Through out the day follow up make sure everything was going smoothly while taking care of our associates and customers. Of course we would also take care of anything else that came up during the day as well. We would meet up several more times for followup meetings making sure everything was getting done. The hardest part was having enough associates to complete the task or having too much put upon our associates. The job taught me a lot I appreciated my associates so much they worked very hard for me no matter how hard the situation. I loved helping them in return however when I did I was reprimanded for that which I didn't like about the job I feel if they work hard for me im going to go the extra mile for them. But circumstances change and things happen while put under a lot of pressure and stress. All together I take my Walmart experience as a life lesson and will continue in any career from here on out to use it to be the best I can be.
bad,"O dia começava a 7:00,com muitas tarefas de organização do setor a serem feitas e outras a serem pensadas e executadas.Aprendi que estar focado em seu trabalho e ter atitude fazem toda diferença em uma grande organização.Infelizmente a ""amizade"" contou muito ali dentro,por ter vindo de outra loja e nao ter essa ""amizade"" com todos,acabei sendo que prejudicado em algumas execuções de tarefas do meu setor,porque muita gente se achava no direito de dar palpites no meu setor,sendo que mal davam conta do setor deles,confundiam muito meu jeito de ser e atuar com o jeito do outro gerente que tinha saido da loja,acho que porque o outro fazia ou deixava algumas coisas eu tinha de ceder ao mesmo,creioque cada pessoa tem seu modo de ser e pensar e ali no caso era para beneficiar a empresa e nao fazer graça para funcionarios.O bom que minha equipe mesmo com tantas dificuldades e desafios era empenhada e dava o maximo de si,tinhamos um bom grupo e uma grande parceria entre nós."
bad,"Fast-Paced, Busy place. Loved the customers. Hours are sporadic, week by week. But-I loved the way you clocked in and the machine assigned you your job for that shift-never needed to run and find a manager, to tell you what to do."
bad,"I enjoy working with the public, however a typical day of work at Walmart was a very hectic one. I learned to work in various different departments and also how to improve my time management skills. The management team did not work together as a whole, although, there were a select few that would bend over backwards for you. I had the pleasure of working with some incredible co-workers. The hardest part of being there was not being able to spend more quality time with my children. The most enjoyable part was being able to put a smile on my customers face each and everyday."
bad,"In my time there, I have found that the Management team to be very conflicting , as well as it not being a great place to work based on the Assistant Managers are letting the Support managers get away with not doing there duties and having us do them instead. They also give unrealistic time constraints to perform job duties."
bad,"Con el cambio de los dueños, se perdió el ambiente familiar, pasando las personas a ser un numero. Como la misión de la Compañía es ahorrar dinero, se disminuyo la planta nacional para llevar las labores a Costa Rica perjudicando el mercado nacional."
bad,I enjoyed my job helping customers when needed. baking bread and stocking was a big part of the job. I learned the difference in good produce and rejectable ones
bad,"Great place to work. Very diverse. Good hours. Decent money. I enjoyed my co-workers and discounts. Black Friday was always hectic, of course. I would suggest doing your job and just staying out the way. Give it a try!"
bad,"A typical day at work would start with the myself and fellow department managers attempting to follow day to day routines and halfway through completion, being called for a meeting to be told to start new projects. Followed by management constantly coming by to check up on progress only to add more work load to an already stressful and unrealistic task. If at the end of the day we get all tasks and projects completed, we get very little appreciation or gratitude. Most of the department managers and I get along fine with one another but there are groups that we feel get special treatment by certain assistant managers which allows them unfair advantages. The hardest part of the day is the stress that the work load leaves my physical and mental state in. My managers have no problem changing tasks, schedules, and hours at a moments notice, which makes it very difficult to plan any sort of outside schedule. I would honestly say the best part of every day is when I get to leave work and come home to my family."
bad,"they  promised that I would have a steady schedule and a 40 hour week, benefits, and insurance after 90 days. Was there a month and was only scheduled 15 - 30 hours and my schedule varied."
bad,They have good benefits with 401k and stock options.  But they do not care about your personal life and will get rid of you if your family members or kids are sick. They only care about money and management has the mentality to think you are a nobody.  They will pull you in the office over the littlest things.  Not a good company to work for ever!
bad,"When I started working for Wal-Mart back in 2005 I had high hopes of making this my career, with plans in advancement. Now nine years later, I question why I stayed so long instead of bettering myself. I have a lot of passion for any job I do, I have no issue giving it 110 percent of who I am, but after giving for so long and not getting even close to where I want to be, I'm unhappy. Wal-Mart is a good company for someone just starting out, but I wouldn't recommend to make it a lifetime career. "
bad,"This company has gone through major revisions resulting in less benefits for workers. Starting next year all part-time workers will lose their health insurance. Full time workers will have their heath benefits cut in half. Company states in meetings with us that they can,t afford to cover heath insurance and make paychecks. Scary. They don,t like to talk to workers. No one knows when they will be fired. They don,t like to hire new people but do plan on laying off or firing half the people there. Breaks and lunches still are a problem but managers don,t seem to want to know about it. Half all managers have been fired in the last year. Company states they can,t afford the payroll. So cut people in every department and level. They made 3/4 million last year at my old job in grants pass last year. Got to be kidding. There is no stable job in walmart, nor a career future in the company. I would not recomend walmart as a job choice."
bad,"This was my first job I had a blast working there and meeting new people. I was trained in every department and I was also trained in some parts of management. I knew almost all the employees by name, I really enjoyed  working with all the employees. The hardest part of my job would have to be the management, they would come to me and tell me one thing and go and tell another to someone else and I would have to backtrack and do the task that they what me to do all over again. the most enjoyable part would be to meet all the new people and talk to them and getting to know them."
bad,Not all management is qualified to be management at this current location. Some associates are less than friendly and many customers are messy and rude. The maintenance of the store is poor. On the positive side it is easy to move up to management and a wider variety of products are sold at this location compared to others.
bad,"Training for ad matches, wic, and even polices and procedures weren't good. Could never find policy book or get a quick answer from managment. Bad managment."
bad,"Keep your area cleaned and do your job. don't expect to get paid much or good benefits. keep in mind its a means to and end. "
bad,"My first day back on a Monday morning at work first pull the salesfloor do markdowns and throwaways, and donation then start with the freezer pull the palletts out and start working them to the floor fill the floor and work aisle 1 go to lunch and then after lunch a conference call after all the fresh area and whats going on in your department . I have some good co workers and some lazy ones the hardest part of my job is that i work harder than any body in my department the most enjoyable thing about my job is i get some sundays off i love that ,cause i get to spend time with my husband ."
bad,"Management only cares about a check and walk around like they busy... Coworkers make me wanna throw up, everybody wants to know your business to the point that they forget that there is work to be done..2 Much drama and the pay will have you eating mcdonalds on a daily. I cant!"
bad,"A typical work day is up and down with management and customers and issues."
bad,"Overall I enjoy my current position however, after more than a year of employment there is no opportunity to transition to full time."
bad,The job sucked the pay sucked no way to move up unless you kiss butt
bad,"It's a great place of employment if your looking for a fast paced environment to learn and be around all kinds of people, both associates and customers both positive and negative. It's great place to learn and move on to another company with job experience and people skills you've learned. However this isn't a place I'd recommend if your looking for long term employment."
bad,"Les collègues sont précieux chez Walmart, et les clients sont généreux et compréhensifs. Ce n'est ni la clientèle ni les autres associés qui me poussent à rechercher un autre emploi; il s'agit plutôt des opportunités de carrière qui manquent."
bad,I stock shelves in any department I am assigned. It is very physical labor. Co-workers are friendly. I have learned to be more patient than usual.
bad,"A typical day at work starts when you clock-in. If there are no customers yet then start working freight and cleaning up so its not a mess for the customers. As the customers start approaching just stay busy and make sure you help the customers out in a timely fashion."
bad,Did not like working there. managament did not care about you at all. the co workers really did not show respect.
bad,"unload trucks, take merchandise to the the floor, pick merchandise off the shelves. Yes, it sounds easy, however when your unloading a truck and merchandise is stacked so high and there are some heavy packages at the top and you cant see and it comes falling down and hitting you, it's not fun or safe at all. Picking merchandise from the shelves, someone always telling you to pick faster and most of the time it's not your fault, it's because the merchandise isn't on the shelf. there were a few assistant managers there that new what they were doing, they were good people. The only enjoyment I had was taking the merchandise out to the floor, because I was on my own and not having someone following me and telling me to hurry up."
bad,"The company does not always seem to live up to its policies, scarcely provides incentives or benefits, and rarely thanks its employees for a job well done."
bad,"Ejoyed the people I worked with, but pay is low and expectations high."
bad,"management was horrible, you were never able to talk to who you need to at a designated time."
bad,It's no enthusiasm at work they make you do a lot of work outside your department but don't want to give you the pay.
bad,"I've been working for Wal-Mart for 10+ years, since before I graduated. I've seen and heard a lot of things in those years, good and bad. But more bad then good. I'll say this first - if you have a chance to work anywhere else nowadays - take it. This place has gone too far south for its employees to stand. There is no morale to lower any farther. Incentives have been cut down to merely putting your name on a junk plaque and placing your picture on an all-star board in the back with nothing extra on your check. Word also was that if you come onto 3rds, there is no dollar on the hour extra. Anymore, its comes down to getting special colored shirt days or days when they give out food trays in the lounge to all shifts.(3rd shift rarely got anything fresh) The communication is something to be seen between the managers and associates of the various shifts. Sloppy at best. There is ALWAYS contradicting orders and/or stories being given. Many of the rules are and can be changed depending on the mere mood of certain people. Nothing is set in stone. Here - you are a name and number anymore - nothing else. And this can be verified by ALOT of us. Need I say more?"
bad,"Everyone is for themselves, especially management. Not a good place to work for."
bad,"Work sales floor for out of dates and block up and level product. Pull trucks when they arrive and breakdown product in an efficient timely manner and fill product holes on sales floor while tending to customer needs. I learned that working at Publix Supermarkets was much more rewarding and all the experience I gained was a direct result of their superior training in comparison to Wal-Mart. Management has a tendency to overlook employees who work very hard to set up and merchandise product in a professional manner and are consistent in their work. Most co-workers were decent to work with but, many had similar complaints about how they were treated. The hardest part of the job was to consistently produce the highest level of customer service and product maintenance on a daily basis and yet never feel that management was paying any attention to the amount and quality of customer service and floor maintenance you would produce every day. What I liked most about the job was after breaking down a truck and setting up the floor in an efficient and productive manner, I could step back and look at my work and be proud of it. Publix was much better about recognizing quality and hard work."
bad,"Wal-Marts Pharmacy was an average job, it had its up and downs. It unfortunately ended with a down for me I was only employed there 7 months. I would have loved to stay in my position but an incident occurred that was beyond my control and management had to make a decision and let me go which was completely unfair. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unruly customers that could be impatient when it came down to their medication, but we as a team always handled it well. The thing that I enjoyed was that the work was constant which made the day and time fly by."
bad,"i walk in and go to the back to my locker, and grab my name bage and clock in then go up front and see which register i need to sign on to then go to that register and then see if there is any items to put up if not i check to see if there will be a cart pusher so i will see if i have to push carts. then i go back to my register and wait for the csm to come to my register and ask if they need me to go push carts."
bad,"Long hours, even though they were normal work hours. Good lunch, hour long. Boring day. Couldn't EVER find a manager. Management doesn't care about you or the customer."
bad,"Job descriptions are out the window.  So many positions have been eliminated or combined that everybody is doing every job.  When someone leaves, IF they fill the position it's changed from full time to part time."
bad,"I did not enjoy my tenure at Wal-Mart as I was repeatedly asked to work overtime and they had no feelings toward my injuries on the job, and told me to push through and keep working."
bad,"Management does not coordinate its efforts.  They leave you confused about what you should do from one day to the next.  They do not listen to what all your job consists of.  Co-workers are wonderful but they are frustrated on a daily basis.  Work hours are inconsistent time wise and total hours each week.  The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with my associates and trying to make this a little better for them each day.  I don't feel you should have to dread going to work,  This does not make a person productive.  I also enjoy my customers for the most part.  I always go above and beyond for them if I can and they appreciate it.  I have learned a lot in my job,  I have a totally different outlook for people that work in retail.  I have learned patience and how to deliberate.  The hardest part of my job for me is trying to get a routine because of upper management."
bad,"A typical day at work with retail it always changes some good days some bad. I learned time management. I had some good decent co workers,& some that weren't. I think hardest part of any of the positions held at Wal-Mart was all the things they wanted me to do & little time to do them."
bad,"I definitely learned a lot about what it means to get stuff done and completed in a  timely manner.  A typical day at work consists of helping customers with what they need and engaging in friendly conversation. I also complete tasks by management and ring on a register. I keep records of things I have completed. The hardest part about the job is the management doesn't always treat people the friendliest especially for the amount of work they ask of you. A lot of people have this common complaint that they feel like there always asked to do much in a place with not enough help, and still never appreciated. Although it's a good start out job, for someone looking to get by or make money. However,  some good things is that the scheduling at walmart is the best part, you make your own availability and can change it at any time. You won't find that anywhere else."
bad,they will work you hard but will pay you next to nothing. Only thing good about company is health benefits.
bad,The Co-workers That I worked with were good and friendly but the Managers were not pleasant.
bad,Management promises an open door policy but makes no effort improve work conditions or company policy.  Benefits are difficult to get. Schedules are predictable so fortunately don't have to worry about surprises.  No job security. Overall attitude of employees who have been there a month or more is generally low and at times even negative.
bad,When i worked at the walmart in chesapeake i started off loving my job untill my supervisor started showing favortism and gossiping about everyone! she started a huge confusion in the company
bad,I mostly stocked shelves and did organize the stock room. I also had to assist customers when they had a question about any sporting goods. Some of my co-workers were good but the majority of them were only about themselves and would do anything to make themselves look good.
bad,"I have leaned to be more patient,flexibility,better time management,"
bad,Walmart was an ok job. The pay was low for the hours worked. The days that i would work would change and they would be shorter days. I have a wife and kids now and the position was not paying enough for me to support my family.
bad,"Some of the Employees were great, but overall poor morale.Management was not very good at communicating, i think due to poor training."
bad,My typical day at work was spent ringing up customers' groceries
bad,A typical day at the Wal-Mart which I worked at consist of me working a manger's job because typical we were always short handed. I  really like this job because it worked with me going to school and trying to work also. But it has it's cons which I think every job will but I believe other job would put in effort to fix what was wrong and they seemed not to care so much.
bad,serve customer and ensure of good customer service. knowledge productivity and lead customer to where it is that they needed
bad,"My typical day would consist of helping unload the trucks and stock the shelves with groceries. The hardest part of this job was the heavier boxes. Yes, I could lift boxes just not the extremely heavy ones. This position was pretty straight forward and did the same day in and day out."
bad,"work from between 18 to 34 Hours a Week and provide customer service.  "
bad,"Cattle moving cattle is what it was like, we wer not treated like people, but like a machine."
bad,Poor guidance from management and lack of caring about the employees makes for disgruntled employees who careless about the quality of their work. It is a dead end job.
bad,"In my opinion Wal-Mart lacks an over all goal for their employees and managers. Best way to describe it is that ""it"" runs down hill and for those of us ""down"" in an hourly position, it piles on. We are presented with unrealistic expectations regarding time frames to complete assignments because of outside hiring of management; instead of from hiring from within. Other than getting through the shift there is no goal set for our team, the job lacks self satisfaction because of this. This also presents the biggest problem, for me, with the job; because there's no pride you can take away from what you've done after any shift. The most enjoyable part of the job would be that your co-workers feel the same as you, so you're not alone in feeling stuck."
bad,"I came in to work at walmart everyday and dealt with bullying and emotional abuse by the other cashiers, lies about my attendance and rumors spread by a CSM. I was constantly coming home everyday upset from things i heard about myself. I liked the atmosphere the few times i unloaded crate in the back but my experience as a cashier was  not a positive one."
bad,"Teamwork should always be maintain in order to achieve goals. If some associate would be absent, then those who showed up get to finish the job and work processes no matter what."
bad,"I think wal mart stinks, they accuse people of stealing when they have no proof, make false accusations,"
bad,"Walmart Lost their way"
bad,"Serviced, cleaned, or supplied restrooms.  "
bad,They give you too much product to put on the sales floor.  I learned how to keep track of products.  The management was poor.  They did not understand how to get along with the employees.  The co-workers were wonderful.  They would try and help as long as they did not get in trouble with management.  The hardest part was trying to get all the freight out by yourself.  The most enjoyable part would be the co-workers.
bad,A typical day can start very easy then move into very stressful as you realize you have no help for a whole shift. Ive learned the appreciation of working in a team.Management can be either really nice and understanding or act like the job is an army base. The coworkers are nice and friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is knowing to some managers you could be seen lower then dirt and not appreciated. The most enjoyable is having others to work and help you on the job.
bad,Working at walmart is a very interesting environment. Telling people that they cant return an item can be a hassle . The management wasnt very helpful. Some of them would just tell you to go against store policy becasue they dont feel like dealing with the customer. They never had enough people scheduled so I would always go on my break and lunch very late.
bad,They work with you. The only thing that it bad is that they will work your butt off  for not enough money
bad,"Job itself was okay, physically demanding, but okay. Management is super condescending and corrupt. It is always understaffed so every single employee is basically expected to do the work of three people. Way too high expectations for the pay."
bad,great place to work.l wish the pay was a little more for the amount of work that needs to be done daily.
bad,It was very quick pace usually would leave with an head ache. You would quickly learn how to bag and make sure things were in order. The management team was so big it was hard to know them all.
bad,"loved my co-workers, developed great communication, customer service, & cash handling skills"
bad,a typical day would consist of coming in checking the call out list and schedule so i can plan my day accordingly. Walk the backroom to see how much freight came in on the truck. Count the podium. Scan my lows and out. Pick merchandise out of the backroom. Make sure there arent lines on the front  end. Cash checks Transfer money using money gram
bad,Enjoy meeting people and working with my co-workers. Not enough hours and appreciation for the work you do.
bad,"very stressful,no family time..currently overnight    not working out"
bad,"The great thing about Wal-Mart is the people. Love the customer, even if act out of character ,customer service was the top"
bad,"On a typical day I collected carts, in my position we were typically short staffed, management didn't really make the job most easier nor enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management and being under staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hour lunch break."
bad,Never really liked it but the hours and pay were good. If felt like you honestly were in a sweat shop of some sort.
bad,"Working at Wal Mart is definitely for those that need a job or are a student needing a job."
bad,"Esta empresa não é justa como parece ou dizem ser não acho que o salário é compatível com o trabalho que é desenvolvido pelos funcionários ela visa apenas o lucro mas não oferece a seus funcionários segurança alguma,enquanto trabalhava havia escapamento de gás falávamos para a manutenção diretora e ninguém fazia nada só resolveram verificar quando falamos em chamar os bombeiros e muitos outros descasos."
bad,I would show up on a Friday and it would be hot. We would have 5-7 cars outside and 2 workers. Somebody would have left the company today for a better paying and less overbearing job. The supervisors would work with you on most of the work. The assistant manager would walk around and go off on the other employees and managers for no reason. Sometimes the assistant managers would use foul language while addressing the employees which is against company policy. With the money I make I cannot live comfortable on my own and pay my bills. The best part of my job is the interesting people I have met over the last 4 years. The hardest part of my job is putting up with disrespect and low wages.
bad,"Wal-mart will push you to get as much out of you as possible, while rewarding you extremely little for you increasing efforts, and then hold your job over your head to attempt to push you harder. they expect, mandatory 200% effort , while giving  a pittance for compensation. they proclaim great advancement opportunities, but actually provide little or none"
bad,"Working at Walmart was difficult for me.  I am a very educated self-starter with a love of learning, and that is not valued there.  I made it a point to learn every aspect of the job I could, both for self-betterment, and hoping for advancement, but the focus of management was always on negatives, never on positive things employees were doing."
bad,"There are ways to earn money when working for Walmart. If you can make the right connections, you can move up in the company without a whole lot of education under your belt. You are able to receive benefits and quarterly bonuses, even if you are only a part-time employee. However I believe the management style in my district left a lot to be desired."
bad,"Loved the co-workers I worked with and their was a few members of management that understood and helped you. "
bad,Management is not friendly and breaks are given but only if you enforce it.  They don't understand if a child is sick I once had a manager tell me to bring my kid to work so that I could still come in.
bad,"Walmart deli was a good place to work. the hardest part about working there was working the days they wanted you to work, and not being able to get any days off for any reason. Other then that Walmart was a good job."
bad,"good place to start off as a first job"
bad,"I came to Walmart as an external assistant manager, I was treated unfairly, always looked at as the outsider and when you open door to the CEO your store manager doesnt like you nor does your district manager, they say they dont retaliate but here I am almost 2 years later with out a job!! I guess the lord has bigger plans for me and god will be the judge of the people who did me wrong."
bad,"Attend to all the customer's needs promptly. "
bad,"A typical day would include zoning the dapartments, dealing with customers/ their concerns and complaints. Cashiering, inventory, stocking, backroom processing, tire changes, oil changes, operating all the power lifting equipment and communicating with management. I enjoyed the fast paced enviornment everyday a new thing/issue. The worst part of the job was trying to advance in the company I felt that my work load on a daily basis, along with my knowledge in all the departments and areas of the store was enough to become a member of management but it was my biggest flaw was told ""why would I want to pay you as a manager to stay in one department when i can pay you at a level 2 and use you through out the store"""
bad,i enjoyed the job but i did not enjoy the management team.  i enjoyed my co workers and i learned to use a forklift
bad,"Our day generally begins with a manager meeting, facilitated by the shift manager, which identifies and prioritizes tasks. This information is then passed on to the department managers by the assistant manager over that particular area of the store through a brief meeting. Afterwards, there are operational tasks that must be completed, such as verifying cash deposits, departmental tours, associate scheduling, and, of course, customer service. Assigned tasks are followed up on throughout the day by the assistant managers. "
bad,"There is no way to make a career out of working at Walmart, unless you are willing to transfer to different stores. When you begin working there, the policy is that you are a ""temp"" worker so that you can be worked for 40 hours including holidays without reflected pay. The job itself isn't too taxing except that store managers receive hefty bonus checks if they don't allow overtime and so employees are forced to complete more work than is possible in the time allotted. Works as a summer job for a high schooler or a first job to get some money in your pocket, but not a real career starter."
bad,Management made it a very Hostile work environment. Long term employees also. No structured training just jump in and learn by mistakes.
bad,didn't like the way management solved issues within the store at night
bad,"I enjoyed the staff there, enjoyed being a team worker. laid back, customer friendly."
bad,"Busy, with my movie mods, and taking care of customers in the electronics department. I have learned the movies mods and basically I run electronics. my co-workers majority are young and they only come for the pay check, they do not care nor complete task for that department . They are sometimes very un-professional on how they talk around customers. The new manager over in electronics is very incompetent on handling this department. since working with him I wish to be moved to another store or department. the most enjoyable times I had was when it first opened and electronic had a different manager. the hardest part is coming to work and having to deal with the young co-workers and the 2 new mangers who clearly one has a drinking problem."
bad,I loved working for Walmart. The only things I didn't like was the lack of communication between management. Also you worked your butt off and they would treat you like u were just someone they could replace.
bad,The company isn't what it used to be. Every year it seems like they care a little bit less about the people who work for them
bad,"Very unorganized. Changes in enviorment without informing their employers. I will not speak very every walmart, however this walmart in my location was the worst experience ever!!"
bad,"Typical work day began with unloading 1 or two trucks, during which time some of the people on our already undermanned team of unloaders may be pulled away to do jobs that were outside what was listed as requirements on our applications. Nothing New was learned at this job. Management from the shift before often left work from the previous shift for us to complete, as well as having one shift manager tell us to do one thing and another telling us to do something else. Co-workers were all young men stuck in an non-advancing low-paying position because it's better than not being able to pay bills. The hardest part of the job was coming in knowing you were likely going to to be stuck with part of someone else's workload in addition to your own.The most enjoyable part was leaving."
bad,"Empresa simpatica de trabalhar, trabalha-se muito e você não é priorizado"
bad,"Il ne devrait jamais y avoir de Modules d'enseignement sur les heures de travail. Il y en a entre 10 et 20 à suivre et ça prend environ 25 à 45 min par module.. Malheureusement ça prend du temps, ça retarde la productivité et on se sent oppressé. Et à cause de ça je me suis fait agresser psychologiquement plusieurs fois sur la vitesse d'exécution quoique mon travail était toujours bien fait selon certains employés, mais pas le gérant d'entretien de nuit qui était de connivence avec les assistants gérants et le gérant général du magasin. À cause de ça j'ai perdu mon emploi. IL MANQUAIT CONTINUELLEMENT DEUX À QUATRE EMPLOYÉS PAR NUIT dans l'entretien. "
bad,"The work is usually pretty good. Here I learned the basics of security, using cameras, and asset protection skills. The advancement aspect is tricky, it is up to management whether you advance or stay where you at, and their opinions of the employee are definitely a factor in their decisions. A perfectly qualified employee can, and has been, passed over for promotion in favor of not filling the position, as was the case with me. It takes an act of congress to get the simplest things accomplished there. My experience may not be the same as everyone else's, so this really applies to my Wal-Mart. I have enjoyed the experience I have gained, but I would prefer to have a job with considerably less politics."
bad,"Challenging, lots of multitasking, enjoyed work the overnight shift"
bad,"Very low employee morale, and incompetent management. Very low pay, and benefits are only for full time employees."
bad,Run n don't look back. Try your best to but your life as a Wal-Mart employee behind you. Very traumatic stress experience
bad,answered customer checks and provided check cashing service according to exchange policy
bad,"Doing everything and all they ask you to do. It doesn't matter what your job description says, if you didn't do what you were asked, you got fired. By the time you've been there a couple months, you move from doing what you were hired to doing a bigger more tasking job for the same wage you were hired for. "
bad,Store was ran outside corporate guidelines by store managers.  Promotions are given by favoritism not by merit.
bad,my job responsibilities were very inflated. I had to run 3 departments. Although I was greatly compensated I have to work 16 hour days 6 days a week.
bad,"Good job just not enough hours to work, note enough money . Work was fairly pick up what I needed to know fast but not enough opportunity to move up."
bad,working as a sales associate for them was good work experience reason being that you are always meeting different types of people. co-workers normally talk contently on how bad they hate it there and less time actually helping the customer correctly. most of the managers just simply did not care for you at all and i mean what so ever. the hardest part would have to be actually going to work mentally.
bad,I've worked for only 8 months and i loved it when i first started but being a cashier is boring and you don't get paid enough for the crazy stuff you have to put up with. Also they wouldn't work with me when it came to me wanting specific hours so i could go to school. So now I'm looking for a new job.
bad,"I worked there for about 3 months as a over-night stocker and I hated every bit of it. 2 of my supervisors were complete a-holes, and 1 even came up to me and straight up asked me ""so do you even need this job?"" What kind of question is that? I busted my butt every night stocking those shelves as fast as I could only to be harassed by 2 very specific managers. They complained about my speed, which I will admit wasn't fast as some people but I still got the job done. They said I was slow but then proceeded to put me in the Dairy area, which is the most time sensitive place to work since it's gotta be up fast or you know if left warm it'll spoil. They put me there, someone who they said was slow. Where's the bright idea there? They set me up for failure. However the other 5 supervisors I had were awesome and said I was fine."
bad,"Being an overnight stocker at Walmart was definitely one of the worst jobs I've had. Don't get me wrong. When I started there and heard from others about how hard it is. I just figured they were just lazy people who were complaining about having to get off their butts."
bad,"Very repetitive, boring. nice managers and co-workers but job itself wasn't very exciting,"
bad,"It was an ok job nothing special greeted customers to our lanes even though they still got confused which makes no sence.  Hardest was handeling people who thought they deserved the world because of a minor thing when they dont deserve it becasue everyone desereves to be treated fairly not go over and beyond. my co workers were alright cool, i learned im a good sales person but i learned i was more of a better sales person as i got older at other jobs ."
bad,"A typical day at work was very busy and hectic. I learned a lot!! Management was completely awful! I only speak about certain managers because some were exceptionally great but there is some I would think how exactly are they managers because they don't do anything!! Some of the managers wouldn't even care if a customer needed help they would make one of the cashiers do something within the store when the lines at the register were backed up. I felt like some of the managers didn't know how to deal with their employees and some weren't fair with employees. My co-workers were by far the best I have ever worked with!! I loved some of my co-workers and miss them dearly! The hardest part of the job was trying to keep my mouth shut when it came to the rude customers!! The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to visit with my fellow co-workers! I will say on my first evaluation I did get a raise so that was good and the other part I hated about this job was that it felt like the schedule was poorly created because some days we would be over staffed and other days we would be extremely short handed. Overall, this is a good part-time job just not made for a long term career unless you want to be management."
bad,Didn't pay enough for all the work you do. Managers are not respectful to their employees. They don't give you all the training you need before then send you on your own.
bad,Good place to get experience and have as a first sales job. There is a wide inventory of products and services to learn from.  From this job I learned customer service and use a point of sales systems.
bad,This company has become the total opposite of what it was originally when I first started working for them. I advanced quickly from an unloader to management. In a typical day the facility is understaffed and the management is not consistent with the company policies and the execution of them. I was able to advance my management skills but was also held back at the same time. The relationships built were the best part of the company. The insecurity of your job as a member of management is the worst part I had to deal with besides the lack of staff to complete daily tasks. The company is not the family orientated vision that it was when I first hired on with them. I could not enjoy any holidays as a manager due to company restrictions on when you use vacation. I literally had not spent a Christmas with my family in many years because of these unwritten policies.
bad,"The pay is pretty good, but not worth the constantly increasing workload for the same pay.  ""You did good, but not good enough"" should be the company motto."
bad,I found the opportunity to be a very good and enjoyable one with lots of room for change. Unfortunatly the management team is a mess and few know and understand what there role is. Very common to be working hard while others all around within view do not work but stand and talk.
bad,Very busy but rewarding. Being cross trained you can do so many different jobs.
bad,"Assuming an early shift of 7 am to 4 pm, you clock in, get security keys for cases, a mobile terminal and printer, open the sporting goods register, check customer service for any returns, work the returns to the floors, go to the backroom of the store in general merchandise receiving to distribute boxes from palates to the floor. Throughout the day, you help customers. You occasionally check for returns, take breaks, take a lunch (if you have one) and go home."
bad,The only thing that was good about this place was the co-workers.
bad,Walmart was a great opportunity for me to achieve my goals while I was there. They offered me many oppurtunities and I would go back there to work.
bad,Used to be a great company to work for when Mr. Sam was alive but went into corporate greed mode. Put caps on salary for every job so if you didn't go into management (which is really  bad) you never got a raise. Don't care about associates any more. Work load was ridiculous. Customer service terrible. Long checkout lines..Un-realistic goals for bonus program. Did away with profit sharing....need I go on? Don't work for Wal-Mart unless you want to be used and abused!!!!
bad,"early start to open bakery "
bad,Walmart needs to improve their workplace environment. The environment is not enjoyable for its employees.
bad,"Boa opção para quem quer começar no varejo por se tratar de um ""faculdade"",maior empresa varejista de alimentos do mundo."
bad,"This job is ok if you are looking to work part time, but not for those seeking a full time career.  Anybody and everybody can be promoted to a management position, thus resulting in many poorly managed departments."
bad,"A good part time job as a cashier and customer service."
bad,"I worked at Wal-Mart for approximately 6 months, even giving my 2 week leave, I wasn't sure I could make it the extra 2 weeks, but I did it for my direct superior, I respected he, and his direct superior too much to make their lives more frustrating."
bad,Worked there for many years and they change their expectations on a weekly basis.
bad,Very large company that you have to have a very flexible schedule. They don't seem to want anyone to have a set schedule and it was alot of long hours.  Very unorganized company.
bad,"I have worked for Walmart twice in my life, and both times were last resorts that I hated. The managers I had were all cut from the same cloth, the work environment was hostile at best, and both times ended up in me walking away due to their horrible communication. I wouldn't recommend anyone work there unless they absolutely have no other choice."
bad,Walmart is a [oor culture in which to work.  Co-workers are great but the culture of walmart is very poor.
bad,You never new if you where going to have a paycheck worth making plans with.  If you've ever wondered why there isn't any cashiers there at night its because Wal Mart did not want to have alot of employees full time.  Majority of Wal Mart employees were part time.
bad,Everything was out of control and nothing was ever ran smoothly. People stole and did stuff undercover everyday.
bad,"día de trabajo checar desde mercancía hasta precios horarios de los empleados promociones etc, se aprende diario ya que todos los días tienes que exhibir diferente para la compra, la dirección estricta por los resultados, tus colegas bien con puntos diferentes pero hasta llegar a un acuerdo, lo mas difícil llegar a la meta del día, y me gustaba por que diario era pensar diferente, y comunicarte diferente dependiendo la gente que tratabas"
bad,"I enjoyed work, I was busy from the time I got there, until the time I left. I met a lot of interesting people while working there. The management generally speaking was easy to work with."
bad,Very busy work but shouldn't be as hard. Management made job harder than needed be.
bad,there is very bad managers and they stick together even if they dont like each other they are not helpful and they dont pay you enough to survive
bad,boa para trabalhar mas não oferece uma estimativa de vida melhor principalmente para que tem um cargo maior.
bad,"Though advancement may seem rather easy at first, the work load is simply ridiculous and unattainable a majority of the time. I also find management to be very hypocritical and not necessarily always fair though they attempt to project that image to the associates. The company never seems to have enough associates to facilitate all the necessary job duties so management often stretches those that are there quite thin and expect several hours worth of work to be accomplished in an unreal amount of time. The expectations are higher then what is humanly possible and management generally makes the associates feel bad about not being able to complete the deeds requested of them."
bad,Working in shipping and receiving was hard physical work but enjoyable. It was nice just doing what needed done without being directly supervised all the time.
bad,They would work with people when they had issues with there work schedules!!
bad,"loading, off loading trucks and stocking shelves, did not not get along well with management, coworkers were nice and friendly"
bad,"A typical work day, (despite them changing my schedule just about every week without a word to me about it and also a website schedule that isn't even updated sometimes,) would usually consist of me coming into work a half hour early and clocking in 5 minutes early as recommended by the personnel manager and spending 8 hours helping customers find items, retrieving items from cases, wheeling around pallets full of merchandise to stock the shelves and in the case of holiday seasons being told to stock things where they didn't go by my managers. I didn't learn much besides job safety tips, because the actual job was very easy, however the shoddy management and constant overworking and strain made it unbearable for me to keep doing that job. All my co-workers (besides some management) were mostly very lovely people, however they were all much older and had worked there for years so their jobs were not constantly on the line as mine was and they were not worked quite as hard. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management and the overworking I suffered, and the most enjoyable part was when I was FINALLY sent some help after weeks of a massive workload all to myself despite me helping others almost every night. Working with the other overnight stockers and cashiers was enjoyable to an extent, but the management made it an overall bad experience."
bad,its was a good place to work at until i became the customer service manager. not that it was a hard job but because most nights i have only 1 or 2 cashiers working for me. which makes me do work for 2 other cashiers and complete all my duties at the same time.
bad,Era para ser uma otima empresa para se trabalhar mais infelizmente sua politica de trabalho nao é correta
bad,the job is very easy and the co-workers are nice and fun. however they don't give out any hours as I think they should. customers complain because of the long lines and not enough cashiers because they don't give their cashiers any hours.
bad,I had consistant work hours and usually had breaks on time. I found it was easy to move up in the company or change position within.
bad,Fun place to work at but could be better when it comes to certain things and learn a lot more
bad,"This job was one that I fought to enjoy. Every day was a barrage of bad culture from the employees that were too useful to get rid of but not good enough to promote. I did my duty as best I could, often outperforming everyone in my department. Despite this, I was told that advancement was frozen for my pay grade (entry level) and only offered different shifts with the same pay. Breaks were always a scramble and lunch was always too long due to the harried pace keeping me in a constant rushed state. During my off time I attempted to educate myself to push for advancement on my own. I left, frustrated, to join the NAVY."
bad,"Your day is pretty structured, very stressful, hours can be bad, management is constantly changing, large employee turnover, always in a state of madness."
bad,Day starts with the unloading of the first truck. Usually one truck but sometimes 2 or 3. Management seemed a little unorganized most of the time. Co-workers are all fun to work with and good at what they do.
bad,Walmart has too many managers to employees. This leads to a lot of confusion with too many people telling you what to do without talking to each other. I do not mind taking directions at all but when you are getting told by one manager to do something and another manager not to do that and go do something else it tends to make for a very stressful and uncertain work environment
bad,"Hard work all day long, it keeps you motivated, my management team was not the best we changed managers of the store all the time. We had a lot of good workers and worked very hard, maybe to hard. Some was just there for a paycheck and didn't do what they was suppose to do. The hardest part was not enough help. The most enjoyable part was some of the people you meet everyday and the training you learned if you wanted to learn."
bad,"A typical workday at Walmart consisted of providing backup at the registers, answering phones, helping customers, stocking and setting merchandise, and keeping the departments I was responsible for clean and appealing.  Over the six years of my employment there, I learned customer service skills along with the fundamentals of merchandising in a retail environment."
bad,"The pay is horrible, they cut hours weekly, they also make you clock out early if you are close to overtime.Do not get it mistaking I love what I do which is Waxing the floors but I feel disrespected by my pay and they way we are all treated as employees of the biggest retail store in the world."
bad,Unloading daily truck deliveries and stocking shelves and on the sales floor.
bad,"Customer Service/Assist customers with inquiries about digital cameras, digital camera sales, print digital photos, and perform inventory checks."
bad,They are an ok company to work for. The managers were bad and didnt care for employees and would give customers whatever they wanted
bad,I loved working for Wal-Mart before all the changes took affect before I left there.
bad,The management doesn't care about employees. Unfair workload. Short staff all of the time.
bad,Here the company was very relaxed with employees. I felt as if there was not a lot of structure and the management tried to be intimidating. Customers were very difficult to deal with so it was very challenging each day.
bad,"Normal cashier job, it was not a bad job, I was just very bored and needed more challenge."
bad,"Walmart is pretty notorious for their low wages, low hours, heavy exploitation of seniors and recent immigrant workers, and many other things.  However, if you just need somewhere to earn some extra money, especially as a student, then Walmart is not a bad place.  Since they have low hours their pretty flexible with their schedules. If you plan to move up in the company then be careful; the bottom line is pretty much all they care about.  You will usually see the wrong people being promoted and its usually do to office politics.  It makes good working people not want to excel.  Walmart has a lot of power and influence but they don't take care of their own so it crumbles from within, and its the mangers jobs to constantly keep patching it up with new workers instead of taking care of the ones that are already there."
bad,"Besides being under paid for the work assisgned by management. Walmart is a job. The benefits are unhelpful. Management is mean, and they have a careless attitude about family emergency or any emergency for that matter. If you are favored you can advance to better positions."
bad,"I worked for the Wal-Mart home office System Division.  I resigned after two years of misrepresentations, non-advancement,  1-2% pay raises, Dull cubical based work environment.  Career growth through training or professional events are seldom available. The low wages and mandatory 50 hour work week makes this an unacceptable work environment."
bad,Not a good company to work for.  They at one time did care about their associates needs.  The management team are very rude to customers and fellow associates. Meeting new people was an enjoyable part of the job.
bad,"I have gained five years of customer service experience while working at Wal-mart. Most of my experience at Wal-Mart is through cashiering. I was also trained in the key- making, fish licensing, customer service, overnight stocking and backroom inventory departments. Wal-mart is a work place that definitely provides different scenarios pertaining to customer related issues. The biggest problem I encountered was management and lack thereof. Manangers are supposed to be appointed leaders that show diplomacy, respect and support for the employees of the company. In my experience there would be one to two managers to demonstrate these efforts. Wal-Mart is infamously known for catering to ""family needs"". Wal-mart is too big of an establishment to lack management with proper managerial skills.Management does not emphasize the importance of teamwork and support to one another. In instances such as these it results in rapid levels of diminution in success of large projects and especially the morale of their workers. Suggestions were made pertaining to methods of enhancement but the management failed to apply or even take them into consideration.Granted everyone has experienced favoritism at their workplace whether it was through them or a co-workers but if the favoritism degree becomes so extreme it nearly cause the whole operation to implode the clever idea would be to evaluate the virtuous employees from the corrupt employees. I would what I enjoyed most about working at Wal-Mart is the rapid pace it required especially during the first half of the month as well as the holidays. I"
bad,"don't really want to speak about that. Like I said it was a pretty cool place to work while I wasn't in school, and was letting time pass me by."
bad,nothing was to hard just couldn't make ends meet with the pay
bad,"Walmart definitely is a productive workplace and I love that, but some of the employees are not very professionally emotional towards other workers. I have learned so much working for Walmart. I learned a lot of cash handling, Card transactions, Check transactions. Definitely much more one on one with people. I have gained more experience with customer service."
bad,"As with most retail, dealing with customers could be challenging and stressful at times.  I learned patience, how to set mods and cashier.  I worked well with most of my co-workers.  The hardest part was coaching some of the associates.  I liked all the cashiers and cart pushers that worked with me."
bad,"Typical day there was always short staff managemant"
bad,working here is not bad if you dont have a family.the mangers do one thing one day another the next its gets old fast.
bad,You would this by this being a customer friendly store but it not. The managers really don't care bout the customers or the employee.
bad,"Either you work a ten hour shift or a twelve hour shift."
bad,"I make sure customers have a quick friend speedy checkout."
bad,"WalMart is known for how horribly they treat their ""associates"". Absolutely no overtime is allowed. If you get over a half an hour of overtime, you can be terminated on the spot. You can also be targeted for ""stealing time"", and be told that you will be arrested."
bad,Very physical work on 3rd shift. Very little room for advancement. Careless management.
bad,"So far I have worked at Walmart two times in my life, the first time when I was in college and recently for a little over a year. I would have to say the latter experience was the worst of the two due to the management, working EVERY weekend, and the fact that it was a second job. The recent administration that runs this company clearly does not care about its employees as much as it did in earlier years. In saying that I also feel your experience rests on the people at your given location. At my location, I felt like there were two problems that bothered me. Being constantly understaffed and having management that was inconsistent. Most days I felt like I was everywhere but my own department and most shifts I was the only person assigned to my department so it stayed unattended. When I worked nights I would have to cover 2-3 departments because no one had them covered. Also if you worked during a shift change, the incoming managers would often want you to stop what you are currently doing and do something different. On a positive note, my coworkers were pretty nice and most customers were pretty good as well. I would think as much money that Walmart makes, they would could afford to have effective people, great pay, and excellent benefits but what do I know. Walmart did, however, teach me one valuable lesson: Avoid retail unless it's something you really want to do."
bad,"Okay as a stepping stone job, but a horrible place to try and make a career out of."
bad,"it worked for me to take care of my son, but better pay is needed.."
bad,"It seems like a great job but it is not as great as it seems on paper. While yes you can make 20 dollars an hour working at the distribution center you will almost never work a full work week, much like the stores. The 20 dollars is only on weekend shifts that are only scheduled 36 hours and will rarely see that many hours. This is one of the reasons why so many walmart associates are dependent on government assistance, yet the Walton family is worth 100 Billion dollars, but I digress..."
bad,"In the beginning I found Walmart to be a wonderful company to work for.  They put the customer as number one, associates and family second.  As time has gone on, it has moved away from both the customer service on the sales floor and away from believing in a strong family feel.  "
bad,"Expect to go above and beyond and get no recognition. Management isnt always fair, but on the bright side the co workers were awesome."
bad,The managers do not care about there employees.  No one knows whats going on half the time.
bad,"Its to large of a company. I don't like, they are very picky out getting overtime at ALL!!"
bad,I learned that retail was not the kind of work I wanted to do long term.  The worst part of the job was too much to do and not enough time or people to do it effectively.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I met while working there.
bad,"Working at the West Plains Wal-mart is a major pain because there are too many boss to deal with.  They just trickle down the information to who they believe needs it.  You have to deal with most of the rudest customers i have ever had to deal with, and management rarely backs you up when you try to follow the rules."
bad,"Go in to work and make friends with everyone while looking professional. "
bad,"Since the economy  was slow down and sales reduced. However, after the making the store super center the sales improved and life become busy and enjoyable. Keep your self busy with the customers and scan and sweep your area of work regularly."
bad,Managment is very rude and are only looking out for there own selves.
bad,"busy all the time"
bad,the management is okay other then the store having like 10 managers none of them answer the calls and it upsets the customers the job wasnt hard at all iht was actually pretty easy i caught on after the second time of training on the register andd i made my thousand and higher points everyday.
bad,"work environment is horrible, managers are horrible, co-workers were the best part of the job"
bad,"O trabalho era gratificante, pois eu fazia o que gostava. Aprendi a conviver em sociedade, a superar meus limites e respeitar mais o espaço entre pessoas. Dentro  do se pode chamar de "" normal "" era o nosso relacionamento entre líder x funcionário, diferente do relacionamento entre colegas que quase sempre era um contato muito rápido, pois a rotina de trabalho e os horários eram desgastante e era sempre um cobrindo o lugar do outro. A parte mais difícil era ficar muito tempo longe de nossa família, trabalhar todos os feriados e na maioria das vezes os 3 domingos por mes, deixando de lado o lazer entre famílias e receber folgas em lugar das hora extra."
bad,Walmart has changed alot throught the years. When I first started it was a very positive fun place to work. They really cared about the associates and their families. There were oppurtunities for advancement based on your knowledge and abilities. You really felt that they would take into consideration your knowledge and abilities when offering suggestions to improve productivity or better customer service.You had managements support of you and the decisions that were made. Now there is little to no training for new associates.Management is mostly invisible and rarely speak to you.Everyday is an uphill battle to provide good customer service  because of lack of trained helped in all areas of the front end. Its very hard to show a positive attitude when so many associates are so unhappy with their jobs. Oh how I wish it could be like when I started with this company!
bad,A typical day at work in Wal-Mart is VERY different than any other place i have been. My job dealing with cold to sub-zero temperatures everyday takes a huge toll on the body which affected moral. Management in the store was more like boot camp instructors which was quite amusing but none knew the terrible conditions my co-workers and I had to deal with. Having to work in extreme cold temperatures was the toughest part of the whole job because almost everyday my co-workers and I was sick and could barely get our job done but we did without complaining and we could'nt call in because Wal-Mart has a policy that they do not accept a doctors notes and give 3-days a year to call in with consequences for call-in after your 3 days. Through all the bad the things about the company there was a two bright lights in it all and that would have to be my co-workers and the ability to buy stock in the company while working there which they took directly out of your check.
bad,"walmart is not big on keeping their associate safe, and they dont like to reposition the associates."
bad,"I worked at Wal-Mart for two years. I learned very important things while working there.  I learned to hold my tongue and how to deal with difficult personalities among other things. Management was a challenge to say the least.  Some were nice and tried to work with their employees, but others just did not care.  I experience managers lying, yelling, cursing, and being disrespectful to the employees.  "
bad,I learned a lot for being a supervisor for the front end and working as a team with my cashier and other employees and time management. The hardest part of this job was during holidays and trying to find coverage with cashiers calling out and make sure the front end was running smooth with little waiting in register lines.
bad,the best thing about working at Walmart was the friendships that i made with my fellow co-workers.
bad,Walmart night shift stocking is a producton postion each employee is time and held responsible when time are not met.
bad,Wal Mart was what kept many small communities going years ago with it's tax base to the community and jobs provided. The structure and culture of Wal Mart has changed drastically. The store associate was highly valued in it's day but has since taken a back seat. the associates are the back bone of the company and they are a great hard working group of people. There is opportunity for advancement in the company.
bad,"Horrible place to work. Stressful, un realistic expectations, Not good work life balance. You feel more like a slave than an employee. Oh dont get sick they cont every absence against u even with a Dr Note.Always going over on my shift. Management is so harsh and dont give a dam about u all they care about is getting their bonuses."
bad,Very poor communication skills among management team resulting in unnecessary overtime and repeated work load.
bad,It was a great place but I found a better opportunity. Fun coworkers and still friends now.
bad,"Working at Walmart was complete hell, and the money I made working there was not even worth it. I was constantly harassed by my CSS. I went to management many times complaining, and they said that they would work on it. Months went by and I was still being treated horribly, being told to shut up in front customers. Management just didn't seem to care."
bad,"A typical day consisted of stocking products left over from the overnight crew, cashiering , customer service, watering plants in the garden center.  Working with the inventory control management learning proper binning procedures,controlling inventory in the backroom and on the sales floor."
bad,I enjoyed the challenge of learning a new skill (cashier) and working with the public.
bad,I was a cashier at Wal-Mart. I assisted with customer service and cashed customer's out with the items they would buy.
bad,"Work life balance was non existent.  Although, I loved to work and be a team player, the 70 to 80 hour work weeks made the job very unpleasant.  The class room training was very good, but upper management was not supportive of the time necessary to work on the training material."
bad,I didnt like working there AT ALL!  The employees were not professional at all.
bad,It is hard to keep a routine because you are constantly changing it day to day. I have learned that you really need to keep at it and keep trying to improve. Management is not so great. Rude. Have very little respect towards workers under them. My co-workers are amazing. The hardest part of my job is keeping up with the managers constant changing of routines. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with customers and being in sales.
bad,"7 to 7 sometimes more "
bad,I would never work at this particular location. Management comes and goes as pleases and she still works there...
bad,"I have learned alot about dealing with people, and working as a team."
bad,I worked for wal mart for almost sixteen years as an overnight mgr. and for most of the time absolutely loved it.  In recent years wal mart let go of it's core values and management became less educated and more like finger pointers just trying to keep themselves out of trouble.  There has been minimal focus on getting the job done and a greater emphasis on trying to make it look like the right things happened.  Sam's values were lost with the invasion of the share holders.
bad,there are pros and cons to walmart the moral all depends on the management team.
bad,Management sucked and all the bad things you hear on tv about walmart is true no matter what they say it happens they play favorites and all walmart are the same no matter where you go. the benefits are good but extremely high you have to be a store manager or above to afford them 
bad,I learned how to provide excellent customer service while maintaining a clean and organized work space. 
bad,"My experience with Walmart has been a roller coaster, and not the fun ones. The hours are long, the upper management fails to show appreciation. In fact, I was approached by my supervisor to maybe transfer to another store or even quit. I love the mission statement but just wish everyone within the company lived by it. "
bad,"A typical day at work involves dealing with all sorts of customers and meeting new people."
bad,People are too worried about you verses getting the job done.
bad,"I started off as a Pharmacy Technician at Walmart, and thoroughly enjoyed helping people. I learned every aspect of retail pharmacy life in a given day, and learned it quickly. I had mastered typing before at Walgreens, so that was a cinch. Counting, filling, troubleshooting, and insurance issues were all that I needed to learn in the basic job description, but there were worlds of information still to learn. My co-workers were fantastic there. Most of them had great personalities and could offer any assistance that I needed. The hardest part of my job was that there were a lot of people who would get very upset because of the C2 narcotic shortage. The best part of the job was helping people."
bad,"Though the customers had their good and bad days, it always seemed management had a bad day towards someone. Numerous of the employees were not treated fairly or right by management. With the unfair treatment and petty antics it became unbearable to work at this organization creating a stressful and hostile environment. "
bad,Clock in some days I setup receiving area for the day's tasks.  Afterwards unload the flat bed trailers and separate the freight as it comes off the truck.  then move all new merchandise to the floor and separate grocery by it's individual isles.  That often you have to step up to get the job done.  Management wise they use and abuse their power to have folks work above their hired pay grades and never compensate them for it.  My co-workers vary from ones I can count on to finish and complete their jobs to others I have to stand over and watch them to get proper productivity out of them.  Constantly working above my pay as a supervisor and never getting any recognition and job advancements.   Working with a group of guys and try to make the workplace as fun as possible.
bad,"Stocking selves, Customer Service."
bad,The only good thing about working here is the co-workers. Customers always made themselves feel that they were better than you and the majority of them are very rude! Management showed favortism when it came to promoting. If you are a part time associate you don't get dental which is a rip off considering Walmart is a muti-billion company! Management claimed to care about their associates but all they cared about are themselves. Would only work there again if it was my last option in the world 
bad,"At first, it seemed like a great place to work, but I was deceived early on. A typical day at work would consist of getting returns, helping customers, use the register, stock shelves, bin overstock items in backroom, make labels for said binned items, labels for shelf items, rearranging end caps in the department and around it, helping nearby departments like Stationary, Fabrics, Pets, etc., doing projects for the managers, setting mods, zoning, and going through the ""rabbit cage."" The only thing I really like about this job, is the people I work with and helping customers. The most difficult thing about this job is not having enough associates working in the day. I do enjoy helping customers as much as I can, as long as they are not rude. At this job, the hours are not good with the work involved. They say there is always a way to advance in the company. I have tried and it's not as easy as they make it seem. In this job, there is only one day where the store is closed and that is Christmas day. So if looking for employment here, keep in mind that you will work ALL holidays and also are FORBIDDEN to ask off days in November and December because, and I quote, ""That is our busiest time of year."" "
bad, 
bad,"My typical day at Wal-Mart starts with me covering another associate breaks,find out what needs to be done, work on projects, help customers. Learned how to run the register and the forklift."
bad,try to over work you and make a career out of walmart.  just didn't like working for that company 
bad,"A typical day at walmart is me coming in, and stocking the shelfs or helping them in the back doing inventory because I am cross trained at both, and am willing to do whatever they need me to do that night. "
bad,"My night started with the walmart cheer followed by our assignments.   I have learned not to be so judgmental and critical of management.  I have a glimpse into the ""other"" side and I don't envy them at all. The most difficult aspect of the job for me was being told to leave my area to assist somewhere else with the assurance that I wouldn't be held accountable for my incomplete area only to return to work the next night and be questioned about why my area wasn't completed. The managers don't seem to communicate with each other. The most enjoyable part of my job was my great team mates.  "
bad,"Other than the store manager that was fired, management was great, and we were allowed to have fun while completing our duties.  "
bad,"Difficult work environment, lots of advancement opportunities. No regard to family. "
bad,I didn't particularly enjoy working for wal mart. Most people there don't have a good working attitude which reflects in the store. The management didn't seem to take much pride in their workers or in the stores progression. Everything was disorganized and chaotic. Most of the management would ignore staff complaints or requests. The benefits arent where they should be given the size and profits of walmart and neither is the pay.
bad,usually the hardest part of the job is the miscommunication between management to the associates. all the co-workers are all pretty easy to get along with. ive learned to take things as they come and to just do my best.
bad,"all I had to do was stock products overnight, my co workers were awesome, management really didn't do their jobs but I just made sure I did mines right "
bad,"No respect for the individual. ""Find a way to fire that guy"" was a common term while I was there. If you enjoy working 70 hour weeks while watching your crews hours get cut, paying them under living wage, and having their benefits slash, this job will be fine. "
bad,"Too much micromanagement, each level of management wanted the work done their way without any consistency. Training did not keep up with the changes. The new computer programs made work more complication and harder to do. Combining departments to reduce the number of associates made areas to large to maintain. Overall the company is building stores faster than they are training good management. They have cut the hours of the fulltime associates until almost everyone is working part-time or have found other jobs. The louder more demanding associates are treated better than those who come to work and quietly get the work done."
bad,"Everyday I put lots of frieght out on the sales floor and took care of customers. Sometimes if I got my particular area done, I would help other co-workers with their areas. I had respect for all managers, if I was asked to do something different then I did it. The hardest part of my job was the nights we had a lot of frieght, sometimes I would get 20 hours of timed frieght and try to get it done in 8 hours. The most enjoyable was working with all the people at Walmart, including the customers."
bad,"Equipe unida, porem horário de funcionamento nos finais de ano como natal muito desgatante."
bad,4 Complete management changes in 5 ears due to increasing inventory shrinkage
bad,"Walmart is not a place for a person who wants a temporary job, wants to be respected by management, wants to eventually transfer, or wants o lot of spare time off. Management acted as if it would kill them to give a compliment or actually cared about whether the associates were satisfied. Personally, I would call it parallel to prison."
bad,This is a fend for your self place. the hardest part is working under the management.
bad,"Didn't really enjoy my job at the Maui Walmart Store. Although I am no longer employed there, the workers are absurdly rude."
bad,working with the customers was great however the store i worked at had alot of issues with employees and management
bad,"Entro a laborar a las 10:30 de la mañana se des alarma la sucursal antes de la 10:00: a.M. Se dota a cajera antes de la 11:30 a.M. Se revisan los expedientes del día anterior para  que sean enviados a el departamento de mesa de control para su resguardo. Se revisan correos para ver si hay modificaciones en alguna política, manual o instrucción. Se le comunica  a los asociados si hay cambios en lo anterior. Se administran los tiempos de los asociados para las ventas y horarios de comida. Se realizan horarios de la semana de los asociados. Se llevan ya autorizados por el distrital a el departamento de recursos humanos. Para su resguardo. "
bad,The company has horrible cash handling procedures.  Management was okay to work with.  People are allowed to get away with too much slacking off.
bad,"At first Wal-Mart seems like a nice to place to work except when you have got over looked for a promotion. "
bad,"My day at works usually starts off with me at the register, giving people there medicine and asking if they have any questions for the pharmacist. Then i usually take care of insurance problems input and fill prescriptions for the day. The most enjoyed part of my day comes by just talking with the people i have an every day relationship with and who i know on a first name basis,which is the customer. The worst part of my job is the management, it's horrible and they don't understand the needs or concerns of the pharmacy(being that it's retail and the managers for us are the ones for the whole store). But even with that being said I have a passion for pharmacy, I'am eager to learn, hard worker, and have 2 years experience as a certified pharmacy technician."
bad,"I like working there, my co-workers were really friendly. Long hours standing. I enjoy meeting new people and helping people that needed assistance."
bad,Working at Walmart was very life changing. I met people that I have become friends with outside of the workplace. The fast pace environment allowed me to come into contact with a lot of people of different races and ages.
bad,"Me encargo de la mercaderia y la venta, tengo 3 empleadas a cargo, el horario laboral es bueno pero el salario es bajo y al ser encargada soy monotributista."
bad,"If you like to be told what to do for a little amount of money, and never want to be treated like anybody.  This is the place for you."
bad,"If you're not well connected you really don't matter. Supervisors lie and hide. I once came in to clean the bathrooms and there was blood, tissue everywhere, defacation smeared on the walls, & over flowing garbage. I asked the managers who checked behind the last shift and no one knew who was supposed to. The next day I was written up for paper being on the floor even though it was clean. They force you to use defective equipment that is at least 13 years old. I have high blood pressure and need the health insurance but they hire everyone part time to avoid that. They schedule you for short shifts and expect you to finish EVERYTHING in time regardless of how many people are there or how much work it is. You are asked to work overtime and then asked to clock in late or take 30 minute lunches to give them back their time. If you dont you get written up for stealing time. This is modern day slavery. NO ROOM FOR ADVANCEMENT"
bad,"Unload trucks, pull pallets to the floor, stock merchandise, pick merchandise out of bin, bin merchandise, customer service"
bad,"      In my position, I identified and apprehended shoplifters. I also actively gathered information needed to pursue internal theft within the company. I learned book keeping, boundaries of theft laws, and responsibility. "
bad,"Very busy place to work, working part time, low pay and working different shifts. Having to work weekends and holidays.  It was a job that I needed at the time with  the recession. "
bad,"gained a lot of customer service experience, made new friends."
bad,"I enjoyed working in retail, because it was like being independent in that you can express your creative freedom. Merchandising and setting displays. Retail was an enjoyable way to earn a living. Each day was different, filled with new experiences."
bad,"there is not enough money an hour to work here or the hours, young kids could work here and they may stay , but not for older workers"
bad,"I was working 15 hours a week and they would take every weekend I had and they would make me work on it. After I requested every second weekend they still managed to keep me working every weekend. I was only getting paid $9.89 per hour because they refused to pay me more (despite having 1 years experience). Besides the fact they never mentioned how much I would get paid or that I was going to be a cashier tell I was hired. You stand there at your cash register and check people out. They will force you to be there when you're sick. I was sick one day and they made me stay there because the manager ""forgot about me"". My co-workers were awesome to work with and the hardest part of the job was the non stop people you had to check out."
bad,Horrible pay for the work you do and have to put up with 50 managers telling you what to do and none of them communicate with each other! If you lasted for years there it is because you never went into management.
bad,I had a horrible time working here. The managers gave no respect to the regular workers
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart was an interesting case for me. I got a part time job as a cashier while going to school. It was easy work, I got paid. That is all it was for me. I would need to write a book to describe my whole story there in detail, so basically I will get straight to the points."
bad,"A typical day at work would have me working all aspects of a retail pharmacy i.e. drop off/input, production, pick-up, phones, inventory control and customer service. I learned how to juggle several things at one time while remaining calm. We had good management team for our area. The hardest part of the job was being short staffed most of the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was staying busy and meeting new people."
bad,overal it was good experience.
bad,"A typical night at Wal-Mart consists of unloading frozen, dairy, and meat products on pallets from trucks. I am usually paired with another associate or two. We take pallets to the freezer or cooler, sort out the products, and then stock while assisting customers if necessary. After we are done stocking, any overstock is immediately logged into inventory. Our managers are always diligent and very accepting of feedback. Unfortunately, the managers have a habit of not staffing enough people during the night. Working here has broadened my knowledge of both food safety and inventory management. I have established deep friendships with some of my co-workers and we all work together to get our job done. The hardest part of my job is working third shift. I feel that it's not healthy. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting everything done and being praised by my manager."
bad,"A typical day of work at Walmart includes me coming in by 10pm, attending the meeting by 10pm and getting to work by 10:15pm. While being at this job I have learned about how retail companies work, how to work a electric jack and a walkie stacker as well as how to deliver great customer service and how to remain calm while dealing with customers and coworkers. For the most part I enjoy dealing with my coworkers but in all honesty I much rather keep my distance and focus mainly on my work. The hardest part of this job is dealing with unprofessional people. The most enjoyable part of this job is collecting money on pay day."
bad,Wal-Mart is a great company to express your creative talents when it comes to managing. You are hands on with merchandising and sales you get to make the decisons with Corprate guidelines. I love the free ability to be creative.
bad,Great people to work with. Managment doesn't stick up for you at all. Managment throws you under the bus. They have managers that don't know what there doing and they ask you for your help since you know. They don't like to change anythign and threaten to fire you if you have to be out of work for your child. I wouldn't work there again all it is is a big headache that you shouldn't have to deal with. If managment would get off there high horses and do there job the store wouldn't perform the way it does. Nobody likes working there.
bad,"I believed this company a great company when I began, Had benefits, full time positions, should have training programs down to a science. As years went on the company got progressively worse. Training is the worst I've ever seen, which is amazing as large as they are. While they offer annual raises, one must bend over backwards to receive any. an associate is forced to work like a robot, not a person, even down to the time he/she has to stock a case of inventory. Management is known to lie and cheat. Getting bonuses were impossible, there was always one reason or another for us not to earn them, even though the management team always seemed to get theirs. Morale in the associate team is depressing. Its very hard to attend work on a daily basis."
bad,"no comment. it a good company,to worked for i have learn alot."
bad,"umm manegment isnt that great in tle treat you like dogs sit on there butts dont do anything,had fun working on cars"
bad,"A typical day at work starts with cashiering in one department and later being moved around all over the store without adequate compensation for the added tasks one is required to perform in those different departments. I learned a lot about palette jacks, hand held inventory tracking devices, lifts, printers and other electronics. The store manager is a great guy, but the customer service managers are unreliable and often bitter when they have to help customers. A lot of the other cashiers I met while working for Walmart seemed to be dissatisfied with their jobs as well. The hardest part of the job is the holiday rush. Holiday shoppers are a lot more hostile and impatient than any other time of the year. It can be difficult to maintain a clean, fast, and friendly environment while servicing long lines of customers who each have one to two full shopping carts. The most enjoyable part of the job, for me personally, was being able to give customers discounts and having permission to bargain with them in order to make sales."
bad,"pull daily reports ,match and file match invoice request edi for invoices review reports for dicrepancies filedclaims against vendors."
bad,I have never had a great experience. When I worked her I worked my butt off to complete my daily tasks. I worked in multiple departments at multiple times. I did everyones job.
bad,I was fresh to the USA and didn't know anything then I just applied for anything and walmart was in the way and I got the job just to survive.
bad,Everyone is to greet the customers walking by the register you are assigned and then proceed to the register with a gesture. While checking out the customer ask how there visit at wal-mart was and if they found everything they needed ok. Continue with the check out and after giving the reciept to the customer you are to then proceed by saying have a great day and come back to see us.
bad,"A empresa é uma boa opção pra quem quer iniciar no mercado de trabalho mas não busca grandes ambições,como por exemplo fazer uma faculdade,oculpar um cargo de maior destaque,pois oferece sálario baixos e poucas chances de crescimento interno,planos de carreira."
bad,Wages were not to my satisfaction. Co workers did not work as a team in a team environment.
bad,Helped customers on daily basis. The management was so so. The hardest part was trying to become friends with co workers.
bad,It's a retail job. Good days bad days depends on what mood the customer is in. Enforcement of policies and procedures is objective at best. Advancement is based 40% merit 60% whether you're on management's good side or not.
bad,"team meeting everynight to start the night, discussing areas for everyone and times. learned alot about helping customers and being friendly to them. half of management was pretty good. Co-workers were great. Hardest part of job was dealing with unruly customers. Helping nice people was the best."
bad,Walmart would be a better place if they attemped to keep the employees happy by showing some appreciation for the way the employees work hard to keep the customer coming back!
bad,It was friendly enough to work there. I was there as a student while attending a Trades School.
bad,I felt as though Walmart is not a fair company now im just trying to move on in life.
bad,A typical day would be to come in and have nothing set up for us.
bad,"Apesar de oferecer crescimento profissional o salario não é muito bom,e não ha nenhum tipo de benefícios."
bad,Depends on what store you work at Walmart
bad,At Walmart you can learn alot about different areas because your hardley ever in the same department so the work load is alot to handle sometimes if your not use to it.
bad,"The company it self is an ok company to work for as long as you are a full time emplyee being able to receive your benefits. The facility I worked in was disorganized to say the least. The management team did not do a good job employing the right people for the job, instead looked for warm bodies to fill positions. This made for a difficult work environment."
bad,"management is very rude & so are the customers, this is the only job i've ever worked that told me they dont care if you have a medical problem and medical excuses are not excepted."
bad,Management horrible. There is no hard part of the job. Management and employees suck and make it not fun to work there.
bad,"I would refer to this job as a gig. Reason being, it gave you no incentive to stay or even consider it a career choice. It was simply a place you work until you figure out what you wanted to do in life. The pay is offensive to start, and you would have to invest years to make a livable salary. I don't know where they find my co-workers. This is a company known for it's turnover rate, so only apply if you have no other alternatives."
bad,"A minha jornada de trabalho começa às 7h da manhã e termina às 19h; e, duas vezes por semana, começa às 5h30m (plantão de abertura da loja) e termina às 19h. Este ano fará 16 anos que estou na empresa e, durante esse período, aprendi muito. Meu trabalho me ajudou a ter facilidade de comunicação, visão empreendedora, capacidade de liderança, habilidade em planejamento e tomada de decisões, experiência em gestão (adquirida no gerenciamento de departamentos); tenho desafios (metas) constantes e uma significativa experiência em atendimento ao público. A relação com meus colegas de trabalho e meus superiores é muito boa. Busco sempre respeitar a hierarquia da loja e não tomo decisões sem consultar meus superiores (Gerente de Área e o Diretor). A parte difícil do trabalho é administrar a carga horária com a faculdade e a vida pessoal; a parte agradável é trabalhar em uma empresa dinâmica e poder, todos os dias, aprender algo novo, pois sempre há novos desafios a serem cumpridos."
bad,"My day included providing excellent customer service for customers, readiness to help cashiers and customers whenever needed, bring money/produces to registers for cashiers, manage the front end, jewelry counter, electronics area, and garden center to ensure that all areas were running smoothly and productively."
bad,"Walmart is not as good as what it used to be. The foundation of values that Sam Walton found his company on have fallen to the wayside. Long hours, staffing issues, and they do not treat their people as good as they used to. Poor Management in my opinion. Work 12 hour plus days with only 1 day off a week. This is too much.. There is life beyond work. I need balance between work and family."
bad,merchandising and working along side my associates to increase sales is what i enjoyed most. 52 plus hours a week and the lose of the founding values that Mr. Sam Walton built the company have been lost in the race to become the biggest retailer are the down falls of this big retailer
bad,"My experience with wal-mart has been moderate. I have learned that with a management team that cares, a great deal can be accomplished. The direct opposite is also true unfortunately."
bad,"Its a good place to work if,your in school. Or just graduating from school"
bad,"I typicaly do the alerts and the counts in the system if there not done. I put all the returns away when there is some. I make a pick list of what we need on the selfs. I put all the picks that we created on the selfs to make them full. I have learned tons in the year i have been there. I have learned how to do counts, alerts, how to build a stack base and a feature, how to put stuff on feature management and how to do a moduler. The management is okay i recently had a kid and ever since then is seems like there out to get me or something. I do everything they ask me to do and still get talked to. Some of my co-workers are better then others but we need more team work then what we have. I think the hardest part of my job is trying to get everything done mamgment needs done. The thing i enjoy the most is being able to learn new things."
bad,"A empresa é uma das piores empresas para se trabalhar, a cobrança é exagerada, existe muita demanda de trabalho aos fins de semana e madrugada para a área de tecnologia no qual não existe qualquer gerencia de processos de metodologia, o que mais é valorizado nesta empresa é o quanto você consegue abdicar da sua vida pessoal pelo seu trabalho! O equilíbrio não existe! Até tentam fazer algumas medidas que melhorem o ambiente, mas o dia a dia é tão estressante que mesmo a ginástica laboral é algo que você acaba não fazendo pois exigem o máximo da sua produtividade. Não é errado exigir produtiviadade, mas ninguém produz com qualidade se tem até limite de idas ao banheiro (limitada a 3)"
bad,"A typical day included straightening/stocking shelves, running a cash register, restocking returns, and filling out theft slips for empty packages found. I would say I learned what hard work is, and compassion for the retail worker. Each manager had their own agendas and would often give conflicting assignments, all which had to be done before the end of your shift. All of my co-workers were kind and down to earth people. The hardest part of the job was completing all task by the end of my shift, as no overtime was aloud. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting a lot of new people, some of which remain friends today."
bad,falta de apoio e facilidade de trabalho para os vendedores.
bad,"- interacting with customers, zoning, merchandise display, processing mark ups and/or mark downs, pos sales etc...."
bad,"É uma empresa, de alto conceito. É sem duvida a melhor empresa para começar uma carreira."
bad,"Helping to get the store prepared every night for the next morning's and day's customers.Unpacking new merchandise and stocking it.Zone the store, which involves bringing stocked items forward so that shelves appear full and neat."
bad,"Over demanding most nights, and I learned more about stocking. There where two mangers, who I liked out of 16, they where reasonable and understanding. I had really good co-workers and hard workers too. The hardest part of the job was when you had 5 plates and only 3hours to get it done in. The most enjoyable part was working with other hard workers who would get the work done and joke around as well and getting to work with different customer's."
bad,It's a great place to start a career to start a other but the most part was the co worker that makes the day easy and fun to work there and the managemenmt it was okay but what I learn is work togehter as a family as a typical day of work
bad,The job was not bad within itself but the management was horrible
bad,I always seemed to have very nice kind and uplifting customers who could make a not so happy day a great day just by speaking holding a conversation or complimenting me on a job well done and how helpful I was to them.
bad,"Performed fast customer service, assisted customers in problem solving. Operated a register, balance cash sales and maintained a tidy work area. I enjoyed every bit of working for Walmart, the only hard part is that it didnt fit my life style at the time."
bad,"A typical day working in the Walmart pharmacy started by logging onto a computer and processing the prescriptions that had come in over the duration that the pharmacy had been closed. I typed, filled, and sold prescriptions. This involved learning the pharmacy computer program in depth and know the names of both generic and brand medications and also how to manage a cash register."
bad,I thought it was a place that I could grow in the company. But as soon as you start learning new things they push you back.
bad,At the particular store I worked at management was terrible. There were not enough employees working to meet sufficient standards needed to meet the customers needs as well as rules and regulations sometime. Large area stores seems to be better to me.
bad,started day by making sure inventory was staged on floor. learned how to manage the inventory system. management were friendly and most treated me well. lifting excessive weight and compensating for others that did not do there job in timely manner. favorite part was feeling accomplished and working with my co-workers and most of management
bad,"Salary and benefits are low, but good benefits like health and rewards at the end of a successive year."
bad,I didn't mind working at Wal-Mart but the complete lack of family values floor me. They are not a flexible company at all and towards the end of my time there they started to deny everyones vacation time.
bad,"The total store didn't come together as a team. Like if one shift didn't do their part, it affected the other shifts. By working third shift, we had a few managers come and go. Some managers catered to one area instead of all areas. The co-workers didn't come together as a team so it caused the workers who did their part to take on more. The hardest part of the job was having to do more work due to the lack of work done by the co-workers and other shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I was constantly praised for my good work by managers."
bad,The managers think there irreplaceable and like the privileged of being able to hire and fire.
bad,I love meeting people and helping. I loved working with my fellow coworkers that I was in contact with everyday. The benefits were good.
bad,nice co workers but managers can be rude.long lunches which is a plus.hardest part of the job when you real busy andonly have five cashiers
bad,OK place to work if you need the money that badly. I'm still not sure how there are people working there for 5 to 10 years when go through employees like tissue paper.
bad,unload 2 or 3 trucks by putttin merchandise on rollers to roll down to other members of team to sort and stack on pallets on most days that became a problem because we didn't have the space needed to do that sufficiently. management was not really too involved with the unloading process. we were in the back of the store and the part that we played hardly ever was seen by customers so they didn't really focus on our crew that much until we had a problem because of the lack of space. co-workers were fun to be around especially on our crew because we hung out with each other even during non-working times that made working together go smoothly like a team with good chemistry plays better than a bunch of all-stars that don't get along. hardest part of the job was that the crew was understaffed and management would sometimes allow some crew members to leave early no matter how much work was left. working with those guys was the most enjoyable part of the job
bad,gostava muito de trabalhar la mais tiver algum problemas pessoais uma boa empresa
bad,"My work experience at Wal-Mart on Harrison Rd in Macon, GA. was horrible. The store manager is the worst person I have EVER had to work for."
bad,I had horriable experience here. Management did not have good communication at all.. They did not train me properly then i would get in trouble for not knowing how to do something. I had some good coworks would help me when i needed.One manger would talk behind my back to the coworks when i had never said or did anything to him. I enjoyed the customers who were very pleseant and was patients with me all customers were nice.
bad,* Capacitacion a cargo de la empresa
bad,"Typically I would do the duties of a cashier in a normal day, as well as a customer service desk associate. Doing returns, handling cash and credit/debit transactions, answering phone calls. Most enjoyably and thankfully my co-workers are very friendly, unfortunately the amount of rude and ignorant customers that come through our doors is alarming. I've learned that every job has it's perks and let downs, as well as its good days and its bad days. Although management isn't quite what one would hope for in a job, they do still provide a secure workplace environment."
bad,"Iwas a door greeter till another associate and ihad adisagreement.Imoved to stocking which iloved.Thenwas asked to move to janitoral,but had to cover breaks and would get in trouble for going past 5 hr lunch break.But ifd idid go would get introuble for leaving department"
bad,"At Wal-Mart I would ring up the cutomers' groceries, zone areas for misplaced items and spills, ansd train at various parts of the store. The hardest part of the job was not being able to move up a position because of family working there. The best part of my job was learning many different positons in the company."
bad,"swipe in and go help people in their understanding of the electronic products, and help them find what they are looking for, i learned some of thedifferences with tvs and other electonic products, and how to deal with angry people, managers weren't good at all, they were never around when needed, they never scheduled accordingly, they always went back on policies, and they never backed up associates when we tried to explain to a customer why we couldn't do something, the hardest part was getting scheduled alone for 8 hours on a holiday or a busy day with no help, best part was seeing everyone i knew at work and people i know come in while i worked"
bad,I thought it was ok although I am more of good solitary worker.
bad,"I have 4 years of service at walmart, there is about a inch of room for advancement. no matter what department you work for the highest pay raise you can get is about 40 cents. The mangement team is inexperienced and unprofessional. your hours are cut with out notice to point to wich you cant pay your bills."
bad,"A typical day at work stared with , signing in , and getting a lane assigned. Worked the cash register , scanned groceries and bag iteams. When work was slow i worked costumer service. Returned and exchanged iteams and answered phone calls ."
bad,"I was always feeling pressure from management which can be good for effiency but they took it a little to far, the work is definetly not worth the little pay"
bad,"I have worked for WalMart for almost 11 years. In that time I have seen them take away employee incentives right and left. Sometimes it seems they do not care about their employees. The managers seem to coach their associates for things that others have done. A coaching means you cannot move up into managerial positions for 1 year. I wouldn't recommend applying there to anyone, that is why I am looking for another job. If this is given to WalMart---I will be extremely upset. Understand????"
bad,"Went to work. Started on routine of going to a meeting full of the overnight employees to make sure all of us where there because people called in sick or just didn't show constantly. After the meeting also known as an argument between everyone we all went to do what we were told to by the managers. Breaking down pallets, unloading trucks, putting all the items away, throwing the boxes and recycling away, cleaning any spills, and making sure the customers where always satisfied. The hardest part was feeling like i wasn't working for a company but I was working in a circus that was closing down. Most employees wouldn't work and were all on drugs most nights. The best part of the job was getting a pay check and being able to meet some very unique customers in the night."
bad,"A typical day at work would start with clocking in, after clocking in, I would walk to the front of the store and ask my manager which register I would be on for the day or if I would be covering people's breaks that day. I would then go to the register assigned, and put the money the managers had placed in the cash drawer into the correct slots, after that I would turn on my light and ask customers in longer lines if they would like to come into my line. After asking them how their day was I would start to check out their items by running them over the scanner, using the hand scanner for larger items, or typing in the UPC for items such as fruits or items the machine could not read. While having a conversation with my customer I would ask them for any coupons after entering them, the machine would total the amount they owed and I would annouce to them the total due. After receiving their method as payment, such as a debit card transaction, a credit card transaction, Food Stamp payment, or a cash payment. I would give any cash owed to them, and wish that they have a nice day and to come back to Walmart soon. This was what I would do most days, but I also was responsible for maintaining a clean and safe work enviroment and would sometimes stock shelves or arrange displays."
bad,"the company has to much favoritism and it is almost impossible to move up or get a pay that is deserved of unless you are a favorite. they take advantage of who ever they can, and do not expect the asscoiate to stand up for themselves"
bad,"Managers don't like like you unless you are one of their friends. If they do not like you for any reason, they will find a reason to fire you. They are also notorious for not giving you any ""suspensions"" or warnings and just firing you over stupid things."
bad,"I would say if you have thought about working in Wal-Mart, I suggest you might want to think again."
bad,"Standard pharmacy work flow: fill, input, doctor calls, inventory, transfers."
bad,"Serviced Customers,and learned how to communicate with every type of customer. Management had a positive attitude at all times but i never knew who was managing at the time. The job was easy i'm a people person so i had a advantage."
bad,"Very Hot building,never have parts or the right tools to do our jobs."
bad,"I really enjoy my co-workers. The management team is ok, there are two that i feel really care. Sadly the most enjoyable part is clocking out to leave."
bad,"Answering customer inquiries,"
bad,If you view yourself as a positive person then this is not the place for you. Common sence is throw stright out the window.
bad,i had just moved and found this quick but turned out it was to far away for me to continue and i was only making enough to get there and back for 2 weeks till the next check
bad,"I worked very hard to make the best of working this position. I learned more about how to get along with all types of people and I spent part of my day constantly encouraging the new employees because this job was very discouraging. Some of the management were helpful, but mostly they were not. Wal-Mart touts themselves to be a family oriented business, but they are not. I didn't mind the physical aspect of my job, I minded how we were treated as a majority. Mentally, this job created more stress then all of my other jobs combined. I would have stayed there, for the money, but it was taking it's toll on me physically, it did not allow me to leave much of myself for my family."
bad,Wal-Mart was a good socializing job but the pay wasnt all the great.
bad,I enjoyed my job co-workers and customers. It was not a very family oriented place to work. Manage meet was never on the same page threw out the different shifts.
bad,"overall, working in walmart is not bad but the small amount of concern that management shows for the associates is sickening. managers often will not show any concern for an associates needs until it is too late for their actions to make any difference."
bad,"I worked as an setup crew, and was hired in permaiatly. Later after hired in I recieve a few promotions and ended up as a department manager."
bad,"El ambiente en ocasiones es bueno el respeto no se hace esperar, el trato hacia los demas es diferente al area que pertenescas, la culpabilidad es muy presente y la carga de responsabilidades es muy grande para el puesto que labores."
bad,"managers really dont care about you, you're just overworked and underpaid."
bad,If you are a young single person willing to dedicate your life to the company then you may like it. I was there for over 25 years. I loved my job and felt like I was treated fairly until after Sam passed and after that it went downhill. By the year 2005 when the company changed the structure the company was a miserable place to work. They expected you to treat the employees like they were dirt and like they came a dime a dozen. You had to live your life for them. If not you were history. The open door policy may as well be taken out of their vocabulary because they do as they wish. I am so glad I am no longer there.
bad,They don't care about your personal life nor you. But it is what it is.
bad,I started at Walmart as a frontend cashier. I dto the Jewelry Department and enjoyed it. I then moved to the Connection Center and enjoyed working with my customers.
bad,"This place of work is mainly just for people who are either just starting out in the job market or just needs that extra income to save up. You are never secure in your job here, as they fire the best workers for the most ridiculous reasons. Most managers pick and choose their pets and they could be the least, hard working employee in the store."
bad,"I scan merchandise into the IMS system to account for the item, we are suppose to get all our screens cleared on the telexon including the bin exceptions, count request screen, need to counts, and the department picks. It gets crazy when they add to these screens but when you have management that does not know how the system works it makes for a long day, and some times we cannot complete our screens"
bad,good place to work management was ok the co-workers were great
bad,On a typical day you can count on getting in trouble for some rule that they changed yesterday while you were off. If that's not enough the managers do not take your side even when following proper procedure.
bad,"15+ years and 13 were great but as advanced and oversaw more people and took on challenges that no one else would my job security fell with it. My career had highlights of District Manager of year in region for special division, was CoManager of Store of the Year (1 out 3000+ stores) and took over one of the top three worst stores in CA. Once I volunteered and agreed to take over a challenging store and I challenged my superiors on changes and programs outside of company ones to make the store successful i was receiving extreme push back and denied changes needed but when went around current barrier by my supervisor and went higher up was able to implement these and show they would work. Ever since then my supervisor was against me for not following her initial directions. Solution from supervisor was need to run like every other location and since it hasn't been successfully since opened, and as took over and made drastic changes and saw improvements instead of joining with me focused more on cookie cuter operation which doesn't always work. When have store along ocean in San Disgo, CA and a store along the coast near Port of Long Beach they can not carry same merchandise and customers shopping habits are different. One is a beach resort area and one is blue collar working class and beaches are not visited like those in San Diego. As I struggled everyday with supervisor not working on core issues of problems I eventually was forced out after 15 years and 12 evaluations of Above Standard, District Manager of Year for Special Divisions of region and also CoManager of location"
bad,"I have been with this company since 1998. Sam Walton was still alive at the time and a great place to work. I recieved merit raises,good job pins, annual raises,employee of the month several times. When he died all the merit raise,good job pins were stopped as well as my wages were capped a few years ago. There are no incentives to stay at Walmart. I am hoping a company that appreciates and respects their associates will give me the opportunity to work for them."
bad,"worked with everyone every-ware and i have to say 880 was the most horrible experiance i have Ever had at a job, managers are actualy 2 faced bosses who do nothing but the minimum some are racialy bias to the degree that you wont get hired, others cut corners and rush things without thinking, the clientell is impatient unrully and theft/fight/robbery prone. maintenance involved cleaning mostly Blood,Feces,bodly fluids and organic food off the floor unless a criminal commit a injury fraud for there own monatary gain, i would have had a better time if i actualy got switched to another spot in the store but no one actualy is willing to help you here at 880 wal-mart"
bad,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is not busy, but steady. I spend my hours taking bill payments, cashing checks, and wiring money. Although this job has taught me a great deal in regards to cash handling and data entry, it seems to become a bit mundane. Our management team is not the most open and available bunch, but they do what they can for their associates. My co-workers are not much interested in helping their fellow associates, while I, on the other hand, try hard to make sure that all of my co-workers are up to par on their duties. The hardest part of the job is your occasional irate customer, who seems like every solution you offer is of no benefit to them. The most enjoyable part is the employee safety incentives and the overall friendly atmosphere."
bad,Met a lot of great people (customers and associates). Gained tons of people skills and patience.
bad,Very stressful environment to work in and the pay was not good.
bad,when receceiving reviews I was always above the standards! the managemnet was like the 3 stooges.
bad,"This company used to be driven to serve the customer while giving the associates great benefits and a welcoming wholesome work environment. Now, all that is heard is help us make more $ don't miss one day or your fired. Its not like it used to be. I loved the way it was when Sam was still alive though... but its trash now... you will start at about 7.00 an hour and if you are lucky you might get 0.40 cents raise per year.... and that's based on a biased review off the entire work years performance."
bad,"Wal-mart is a company designed to do one thing and one thing only: make money. They talk alot about culture and ethics and being associate centered, but hardly do they ever back it up. Pay is horrible. There are some opportunities to excel and climb however."
bad,"Ugh, if I had it to do over again . . . yeah I'd take the job, I worked with some great guys. But management is a pain; my time clock punches were constantly tampered with, I was written up for working 6.01 hours with out a break, then written up two days later for taking a break during a 5.90 hour shift. I was written up for poor attendance after missing dozens of days for which I was not scheduled to work. If you gotta have a job then wallyworld will work, but it's tough."
bad,"walmart is a non stop on your feet job, it is a fun place to be but not a very flexable job if anything unexpected happns in your life"
bad,"I learned about how managing people has its' pros and cons. You cannot always be friends with people you supervise. I do really like the people I work with. This store is usually very busy and this can make my job stressful, but Iearned handle one situation then move onto the next and remember to breath."
bad,"When I was worked for Wal-Mart, the customers experienced friendly customer service by the employees. Now Wal-Mart has changed from taking care of their customer and employees, to it is all about a dollar with them."
bad,"Pay was terrible, Management sucks, If you are not at least an assistant manager then don't bother because your going to make minimum wage."
bad,Nice environment to work in with good people and good steady schedule
bad,"Lack of pay, with loads of work. Management was just terrible and their dress code policy is horrible."
bad,"Walmart is just a paycheck, Management needs to treat everyone the same. They have to many favorites the lazy ones of course. They preach about values but don't show them."
bad,"I like doing what I do, just to much added on top of what you already have to do."
bad,"The more you do, the more you're expected to do. Good workers get abused, slackers/overnight managers pets get away with bloody murder. When you fill out your application, make sure you tell them you aren't available 2 nights in a row. Otherwise your nights off will be broken up, and rotate."
bad,A few pros of working for Walmart is I like there benefits and you get great hours and they're very flexible for scheduling.You also can get promoted very quickly.Cons training sucks they always have practically a new associate that would only be there 2 weeks training someone.Having an awesome management team can be hard to come by.
bad,The manager expects you to figure out the impossible on a 40 hour work week. I don't want to write this review mainly because I'm still employed by them.
bad,The manager at the Walmart I work for is awful and they don’t seem to know what they’re doing  they don’t even have anyone scheduled but complain about no one being there and they hire more people but still don’t give those people hours  my assistant manager over me will sit there and watch you work and not help so ever just sit there and watch you and criticize you  she also always has to be right even when she’s wrong
bad,"I worked in Meridian, Idaho at store #3093 and it was the best! Great management and very friendly. If you needed to take time for personal life duties they were there for you. Here in Goodyear, Arizona at Estrella Market was terrible! They honestly don’t care about you and are only nice and respectful when they want something from you. On CAP2, they will leave you a whole department to finish yourself and expect you to finish even if you’re not full time."
bad,Management doesn't seem concerned about providing information to all associates. It used to be more fun but now expectations are doing every job there is for the same low pay. Employees are not valued and if someone leaves or is tired it's no big deal because someone else can easily replace them.
bad,This company will fire you for unexplained reasons and stop your unemployment benefits! Loss Prevention will accuse you of shoplifting and fire you without proof/evidence!
bad,"Was a great company, now they only care about money not the associates. Not happy about the changes lately not sure if your even gonna have a job. Want to enjoy my job and not be terrified they are going to change my job over night."
bad,"Management was awful to deal with if a problem occurred, a hard time getting an answer and when I did it wasn't always what the main manager wanted so I would have to start again. Very frustrating"
bad,"sales floor workers work twice as hard as management, who sits in the office and doesn't help accomplish goals for that day, constantly micromanage associates and sometimes degrades them, no appreciation for the hard workers and punishes the hard workers for making a minor mistake or with something that is out of their control."
bad,"It's a good place to work if you like working all over the store. When you are a manager there are tasks you do daily, if they need you in other departments you can't get your work done. So disappointing when you can get you work done. In some departments there is team work others you are on your own which is my department."
bad,"Neste momento a empresa oferece o básico, não existe plano de carreira e suas atividades são pontuadas constantemente."
bad,My fellow co workers and managers where great to me and the job it self was easy but theirs something's within that could be better like the point system.
bad,The management is horrible! They definitely have their favorites and if you’re not one of their favorites it’s basically fu*k you. The whole store gossips like a whole bunch of children. Everyone is always in your business. They don’t even accept doctors notes. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work here
bad,I didn't like their scheduling and managers were constantly rotated so workplace was chaotic. Employee turn around was high. Benefits were not offered to part- timers. But also wouldn't hire full- time.
bad,"The management will try to work you hard without even saying thank you.  If you hire in as part time-beware- you could be given only 6.5 hours of work which almost always happens in Jan. and Feb. However I think the less hours available are due to the new self-check registers.  It used to be enjoyable, yet I cannot afford to work there anymore. Good luck."
bad,Working as a Cart Associate isn't fun work. There is a significant risk of injury while working in a parking lot. You and the cars there have many blind spots. You aren't allowed to take tips from customers when you help them get something in their car no matter how complicated it becomes to do that. It can be very tiring especially when you're by yourself when it is busy.
bad,"Benefits are okay, if you stay long enough to receive them. The job wasn't hard, but the pay sucked. Management was contradicting and over bearing. They take the job way more seriously than they should. (Lenoir City, TN)"
bad,"The particular store I once worked for runs a skeleton crew and expected blood from a turnip. Advancing is not going to happen, there are no real careers at most of these stores."
bad,"A typical day was very busy and fast paced. The management was not very professional and I learned real quick not to step on any toes. Although I advanced in the company very quickly, it didn't last . The most enjoyable was the customer interaction"
bad,"It’s a good paying job with poor insurance coverage for its employees for the money they make and the managers are less than stellar, to be nice. The hours are good thow"
bad,"Between no-shows, terrible scheduling of employees, and managements incompetence, you will likely always be understaffed and find yourself in other departments picking up slack."
bad,"My experience as a Wal-Mart employee has been a mixed bag. On one hand you didn't want to fail your co-workers because your failures become someone else's work but than you have managers and an endless supply of supervisors who are inept. To be fair some of the co-managers knew what they were doing and how to get employees to perform but even they were undermined by other co-managers."
bad,"I mean, it's Walmart what do you expect. Rude customers mediocre management meh pay. I personally didn't enjoy my time there but it definitely wasn't awful. Just not good."
bad,"Management aren't what the company required towards employee's, lot's of favoritism among the one's already working there for some time. ( at least at the store I worked at 5441)"
bad,They are ok to start but as time went on they became more unprofessional. I quit working there due to the racism and lack of respect shown to me in the workplace.
bad,A lot of the management is verbally abusive to lower associate's. I was made to feel belittled when I was swapped to HBA where I worked alone in the department and was not properly trained because the lady who was supposed to train me left for vacation the day before i was moved. I was told my production was low even though my department looked great and customers continued to compliment the great work i did Numerous accounts employees were being cussed by management in front of customers
bad,"This Review is based on a University Student who worked at Walmart Part Time during Summer and into the Fall Term. "
bad,A lot of responsibility little to no reward. Extremely fast paced and lots of favoritism. Extremely difficult to move ahead in the company. You only get a .22 raise a year.
bad,I do not recommend this employer to anyone due to the lack of job security and poor management skills. The work balance was not worth it due the pay and benefits.
bad,Management plays favorites. Considered part time with fulltime hours with no benefits. Hours get cut day after Christmas up to around summer. Most coworkers were friendly.
bad,In my department the managers are nice however the higher managers could care less about anything. I'm pulled from department to department leaving what I'm suppose to do left til I run back and finish it. I dont mind helping but i seem to be the only one running around doing everything
bad,"When I started at walmart it was a pretty decent company but the longer i'm there, the more I realize it's not such a great place. I started at part time but now I am ""full time"", from day one of ""full time status"" I have never worked a consistent 40 hour week. They cut hours so often that even people that have been there for 20 years and are full time employees get their hours cut to almost nothing."
bad,Walmart as a whole has great potential. Management of this local store however is lacking which makes work a less inviting environment to work in. Job duties themselves are fine tho
bad,"No job stability, managers don’t give meaningful feedback until it’s too late to do anything about it, once you rub someone the wrong way they will find a way to get rid of you"
bad,"Walmart is a good company they just don't treat the employees the best. Its fun and easy work. But you're just a number to them, and you defiantly feel like one too."
bad,Management only acts friendly when corporate is in town and they never help or train you on anything. They throw you in an expect you to know it and then they get nasty with you because you don’t know what your soing
bad,The work demand does not or is not equal to the pay. In 2020 the starting pay is 11.00 per hr which is very.weak.i work extremely hard and do my job well. Rate. Of pay is very weak.
bad,Store management can be known to be rather hypocritical. Only looking toward the profits rather than the people unless they are thier friends. Morale can become very low.
bad,"I can honestly say I wouldn't want to work at walmart again. My time there I have met great people, and they have become my family for the most part. I didnt really enjoy working with or around higher up managers. I felt like they really didnt respect anyone under them, and can very difficult to work with."
bad,The company as an abstract place was great to work. But as a person it is self serving and has no regard to the human person. It has taught me to not trust so much as I have done.
bad,They do not stand up for there long term employees . They do not look at what kind of employees they have. Or how they have given 26 years of hard work for them. They will easily give up on there associates .They do not take in to consideration that the associate has never been in trouble in 26 years before they make a decision to let that associate go for a reason that honestly was a mistake.
bad,It was ok but really didn’t like the management. But the coworkers were amazing. I worked in East Dallas Texas at a neighborhood Walmart. It was fun but the managers would quickly turn that around when they were yelling at you for no reason.
bad,Ive learned alot working for this company. There is no perfect company but there was definitely an opportunity to crosstrain and lean in on different projects outside of your normal day to day scope.di
bad,"Un lugar de trabajo adecuado para el que necesite trabajar. Los supervisores estaban pintados, practicamente, y los de recursos humanos eran mejor recepcionistas con trabajitos."
bad,"It was simply a job that was getting me through high school. I had a ""relative"" that was a manager and she wasn't related but they saw conflict of interest. They moved her to the area I was working and then forced me to an area they knew I would fail. In doing this they cut my pay and took the ability to sell guns from me and some of the other options it was the worst out of all of my JOBS"
bad,"Truly i was not there long, I came to work, most of the time, i had to made my own decisions on what needed to be done. There was not guidance in Management. Again, this job was not for me. I did not quit, i found another occupation. Put my 2 week notice in. And moved on."
bad,"Walmarts tend to have a similar pattern. Decent co-workers, not very stressful work overall, but the worst management and upper management. Somehow they treat employees like children and never take them seriously or show any respect."
bad,My store manager was amazing but the hours and most of the assistant managers were horrible really work with employees and made them feel less than them or not important. Did hard work and still wanted it to be more perfect.
bad,Good flexibility with work schedule.  Toxic work environment. High management turnover resulting in inconsistent policy enforcement. High favoritism of certain employees. High disrespect of others.
bad,"The store I'm at doesn't show is employees that they care about them. Management is horrible and most of the staff are rude . Outsiders coming into the store will complain and tell us how they are dissatisfied with how it's being ran. There lacks a huge amount of hospitality and I feel as though, if there were a complete different staff and management, things would actually get done."
bad,"It has been a decent place of employment, although I feel Walmart is not moving in a direction that I feel is beneficial to its employees and their families."
bad,"There are good and bad stores, good and bad managers. The store I was at was all bad. Managers had no idea what they were doing, blamed their workers."
bad,Takes a pretty strong person to work retail. I have really great coworkers and some of the managers are great. Full time has  more benefits of course. The turnover rate is high. Someone not good at customer service is not going to last.
bad,"Honestly the only good thing about this job is the pay. When I was there it was $11 an hour regardless of work experience. Other than that, it’s an awful place to work."
bad,I enjoyed working with co-workers but the management was bad. its a favoritism workplace. After working for them for 7 years I got tired of the managements favoritism and saw quitting as the only option to advance in my carrier.
bad,"Poorly managed with no respect for employees. Benifits are decent but you have to go through many hoops to acquire. I take on many tasks with no help and succeed. "
bad,Supermercado é a última opção de trabalho para alguém. É se a pessoa está nesse tipo de emprego se esforça muito e tem pouco reconhecimento.
bad,I found during my time at Walmart that the management team is only looking out for their own position and their quarterly bonuses. They often tend to increase their bonuses by firing enough people to save money on payroll. There is a lot of fear of retaliation in most of the stores i have seen. There is always a lingering threat of termination regardless of ability and work ethic. There is never the ability to perform to your highest potential or even complete the regular job requirements. The workload is extremely high due to a lack of staffing. I have noticed that they usually operate at about 60% of the minimum recommended staffing per shift. This causes extreme stress on the employees as well as a drastic increase in workload. It almost seems designed to destroy your happiness and keep you from advancing for fear of being unable to balance your life outside with your work.
bad,"Days start supper, but then management arrives your doing side jobs for them and by the end of your shift you're struggling to get your normal work done."
bad,"The job is very simple, don’t expect to change the world or really influence anything. Anyone with a high school education can see you really don’t need one to work at Walmart"
bad,"Most people do not like the job they are performing.  Some people do not care about their job.  Pay raises are yearly and independent of your job performance, if a pay raise is given that year.  Pay raises never exceed minimum wage increases, which results in working for minimum wage for most employees, regardless of time vested with the company.  No longer provide an ESOP package."
bad,"It's an okay place to work, but it really depends on the store you work in, as they are all different. The only real trend I have seen for all the stores I have been in is that only the laziest, suck-up people get to be promoted. No matter how much you work or how hard you work, do NOT expect to be appreciated or promoted. Management is LAZY and they play favourites."
bad,"I've worked at Walmart a bit, and each place is different has different vibes. But usually they suck. The management changes too often and they all dont seem to understand their jobs very well."
bad,"As quickly as the workforce is changing, so is WM. They are demanding more productivity from less people. It compensates fairly well, but makes life at home feel uneasy, at best."
bad,"Worked as CAP 2 sales associate, in short, the management just wants it done on their time and cares too little on what matters such as you. "
bad,"I been working for more than a year and finally got full time after it's been 2 months after the 1 year (that everyone gets a celebration for but not me because my manager ""didnt know"") and a new guy that worked 3 months got instant full time. A worker who is not full time works 42-47 hours a week and I'm a full time that has been begging for hours. Got 32 hours cut. That's 1 day to work."
bad,"Very low pay and bad management, No teamwork. "
bad,Often times we were expected to do things we were not given the proper instructions in order to complete and or given a ludicrous amount of time to perform management is often a joke minus a fee gems.
bad,I wasn't trained at all on the floor aside from the online learning I had to complete before I started. I had better training as a cashier by regular associates and I wasn't even assigned as a cashier. The management have poor dispositions. Some people are assigned to stock freight at unreasonable times. It sometimes feels as if the managers were contempt for the workers.
bad,"With customers walmart is very friendly and helping, but with employees walmart only wants you to slave for them while management sits back and does nothing all day."
bad,"Sweet and simple: It is a depressing place to work for. No matter how well you do, management does not care. They also try to dictate what you can even speak about. Most of the people you work with are cool though. But hey, if you need a job it pays the bills."
bad,"Working at Walmart was an okay job. Very physical, lifting and carrying 50+ lbs. Stocking the shelves and cleaning the dairy cooler were my job requirements."
bad,"As a cart pusher at Wal-mart, I get treated very poorly by management. I get paid pretty well for my age so I put up with it but I look forward to getting an internship so i can leave that job as soon as possible. The employees do not get treated with kindness or respect, and you are not rewarded for going above and beyond."
bad,"I was an associate at Walmart for 9 years. During those years, I had a few different positions. I started off as a part time Driver Coordinator, after a year I became a full time Driver Coordinator. I then took an Assistant Manager position at a Neighborhood Market. After a few months I transferred to a Super Center in Dothan, AL. I was a Grocery Support Manager then became the Fresh Cap 2 Supervisor. "
bad,"There are many long days as a salary manager and you never get holidays off."
bad,I am actually really disappointed in the outcome of this job. I thoroughly enjoyed what Wal-Mart stood for and the companies benefits for it employees were great if you wanted to go to college. Unfortunately my experience was not up to those standards. I am not sure if it was this particular location or what. My management always seemed to busy to help and I was accused of various things. I ended up leaving due to the lack of respect for employees. I am thankful to the company for the time I was given and would come back to Wal-Mart in the future at another location if possible.
bad,Depending on where you are put and if management likes you will depend on how you are treated. Management is selective on what they want to do and who they talk to.
bad,Improvement needed in all areas.   Advocates family publicly not internally.  The system is far from perfect. Need internal investigation at all levels.
bad,I really like working for Walmart. The stress got to much. I got no help from management. I did like the people work with. We had fun time. I am going miss the people the most. management all  had their favorite and so it did't matter what you say or do it's always wrong
bad,"Absolutely stressful and you are always undervalued. Super high workload with shortage of workers. The Walmart I worked at had 1 good manager out of many."
bad,The culture of the biggest of all big box stores is about too many tasks and only enough time and tools to complete one. Your work experience will depend on the type of manager you are under. More upwardly mobile types will micromanage you till you either quit or request a transfer while others will exhibit the more abusive traits of a poorly trained supervisor.
bad,"It would be okay if managment wasn't so insane, hours weren't cut randomly, and if they could keep any employees longer than 3 months. My coworkers are the only thing keeping me there."
bad,Walmart would be a great company to work for if they valued their associates like they value their bottom line. I will always be appreciative for the opportunity to work here but there are definitely some improvements that need to happen
bad,"Was doing very well at first, then they shifted focus and my work life balance disappeared. There were insane expectations and no outlet to create or recieve to help needed."
bad,"workplace culture - generally only the young employees group together either during or after work - older workers much more reliable for attendance, knowledge of customer service"
bad,"This job is stressful because of the very high demand of number packages the management want to be packaged and shipped. The hours are long and take a toll on the body, especially the knees and back."
bad,"Prepare food for customers"
bad,liked some of the people i worked with but over all not the best place to work some people were friendly the supervisor was fair  All and all not so bad
bad,Did not get much family time throughout the duration of my employment here.   Made many close friends here.  The benefits were good during my time here.   Management needs more compassion.
bad,"The scheduling was terrible for example leaving at 11pm and returning at 7am is not ideal. The management was a complete mess, they gossip and walk around more than they assist customers or the cashiers and are often rude."
bad,I liked working for Walmart in the early morning hours.  I loved that you were constantly busy working and time went fast.  I didn't like the lack of training from management.  I was told how to do my job by many different coworkers which was confusing at the most.  I don't like the fact that I am a very hard worker and they took advantage of that and I was doing the job of 2 people.  Everyone worked against each other instead of working together.  Coworkers acting like little children trying to get each other in trouble tattle taling and gossiping.
bad,"The workers at Walmart are all great people, which is why it's a shame to see them treated so poorly by the management. Applied for a specific position but was told that i would have to work any department that the managers wanted me to."
bad,"micromanagement, very great place to learn customer service, employees are very fun to work with, hardest part is customers not understanding policies we have to follow."
bad,"Every day was a fast-paced day, lots of customers, issues, problems with coworkers and management. Over 3 years taught a variety of things like multi-tasking, money handling, customer care, handing a difficult environment. The biggest takeaway is the lack of decent managers. The turn over rate for Assistant Managers was absurdly high and they treated everyone pretty poorly. Genuine lack of compassion for any associate under them. Lack of ethics. Many incidents of ""terminable"" offenses being swept under the rug. Management is the #1 reason any leader or supervisor steps down from their position or quit the company altogether, like I did."
bad,This is a competitive work place that does not always provide the associates with the resources needed to complete daily tasks.  Management uses their position to control associates and give them tasks that should be completed by management.  Management also makes associate schedules that are out of their availability and forces them to take a point against them if they cannot find a replacement.
bad,I didn’t like it at all. It was a miserable experience in maintenance. When I was at the dairy section it was pretty ok. Maintenance was a pain. Honestly your better of working somewhere else.
bad,"It depends on the store, but I feel the company as a whole is not that great anymore."
bad,"While the management are kind people, overall the company doesn't care about the overall wellbeing of its employees. Poor management is the downfall of a good working ecosystem."
bad,Middle management is selfish and terrible. They sweet talk you when they need you but insult you when you don't bend to their unreasonable demands. They are completely spineless when it comes to sticking up for their employees in front of the customer. Don't work at the Reston office. You will regret it. Cultural diversity is also non-existent.
bad,"Wasn't enough hours in a week to make a living. But a good place to start and work. Discount was good, but worked every weekend.  Sucks and not really busy."
bad,"At the management level, everyone was nice and caring, trying to do their best. Below that, the workplace was really competitive and not cooperative at all."
bad,I worked as an order filler there for a little over 3 years. The management is incompetent. People quit faster than they can be replaced so be prepared to be worked to near death.
bad,Walmart expects alot out of their workers for small amount of pay. They treat their long term associates the same as the one that were just hired.  you get no apprectiation at all for nothing!
bad,"I worked at Walmart overnight for a year. I was hired for a specific part of the store and trained for that area and randomly they moved me to a different area I had never worked before that I wasn't trained for. When I brought this up they told me ""It's the same difference"" If it weren't for my friendly co-workers I would have struggled all night not knowing what I was doing. I thought this was a one time thing but multiple times I was thrown into different aisles that worked completely differently without any help or training. "
bad,There management is scattered all over the place just kinda threw me in a spot and just kinda had to lurn from the other workers or a computer not very helpful
bad,The expectations were always changing becoming hard but forced to comply or get out. It was pleasant you were if fear everyday if your being fired for just written up. Store manager put the fear of these things into daily.
bad,"seria una mejor empresa si los encargados y gerentes distritales , apoyaran mas a los asociados , en lo personal como subjefe de tienda tenia hora de entrada y no de salida ,ni siquiera para salir a comer o desayunar , aparte es muy discriminatoria, por eso tanta rotación de personal."
bad,Management was always changing. This made work hard to complete in a way that was excepted by each individual managers. Managers often disagree and or argue with each other thus making it not easy to communicate.
bad,"My experience at Walmart was really good and pretty easy I’m just looking for a higher pay job that will benefit me and my family , and something that will be better"
bad,"Mucha rotación,  jefes tiranos , subgerentes se les trata con los pies,gerentes con muchos años llegan a ser tiranos , escuche decirles a gerentes que prefieren esclavos"
bad,"The Walmart I work at has a problem with respecting employees’ availability; they manipulate the hours given to get employees to stay later or on days they aren’t available. They pay unfairly, and they expect the productivity of three people from one person. I usually have to stay late to finish the work because there weren’t enough people to do it in the time given. My coworkers are good people with good work ethic, but they have become jaded and a little rough until you get to know them. Some of my newest coworkers haven’t been properly trained, so they make many mistakes and aren’t taught how they’re making them. While I still try, I can’t be expected to teach them how to do their job while I’m doing mine; that’s why there are supervisors who can help new employees get acclimated to the job and the tools we use."
bad,"It was terrible working there. Employees are not working just gossiping, managers no better, they don’t give you the"
bad,"- Most breaks are paid"
bad,A lot of managers work massive amounts of overtime doing 12+hr shifts almost daily. As well as going almost mad with power and talking to associates and lower management disrespectfully. Associates get blamed for just about anything. You can earn overtime occasionally but you never know if they'll make you cut it by the next pay period. You have to continually check to see if any of your paperwork or requests actually went through.
bad,The company has gone from a family oriented company to a corporate. In order get hours you need to have an open availability. Advancement is possible though beware some positions are dead end jobs. To climb the ladder you need to be very open to anything and everything they throw at you without resistance. A lot of micro managing goes on.
bad,"its not the best place to work at. its a job. benefits are great, people and customers are good but also can be rude. as for the job personal shopper they say its the easiest maybe it is but the labor is hard"
bad,"I was introduced to Department Management by becoming one. Any training took the form of asking other, longer term Department Managers ""how too"" when it came to inventory tools, processes, etc. "
bad,If they tell you you'll be working full time hours... you probably won't. I was promised by two different people that I'd be working at least 32 hours a week and multiple weeks would go by were they would not give me 32 hours. I was also making less than what I should've been for the area I was working.
bad,"Rollercoaster hours, never the same days off or hours of day. Love most of the customers. Not a great job for a single mom with an autistic kid that has behavior issues"
bad,Typical day at Walmart would be first getting your returns. through out the day help customer and answer questions. after that you spend the rest of the evening making the products on the shelf look neat and straightening up products until it was time to go home
bad,"Very fast past and overwhelming, have to take breaks for 15 mins and get an hour lunch. Over time differs on the seasons. Cannot complain much, just a job."
bad,Walmart is a company where the management loves to reward bad behavior and bullying. The only good managers they have always get punished for something out of their control or are the ones to always blame because they’re good. The store manger always turns a blind eye. He doesn’t agree with younger associates growing up with the company. The young people are his targets especially if they do something good or stick up for someone. The store manager and the bad mangers like to target the strong young workers. It’s hard working for a company they refuses to let one of their worn move up or over. They’ve help some of us back multiple times.
bad,"Even though a work life balance is talked about, it does not happen as a manager. It's preached but not implemented.  Through the years coverage has gotten thinner and thinner to where I don't get proper breaks or lunch breaks because of lack of coverage. Most days there isn't even enough associate coverage due to call ins, days off, or vacation days to cover the store appropriately.  As a manager we are expected to also fill in those gaps to some how keep the store running appropriately.  Lastly, it's also been hard to watch associates being taken advantage of with changes set forth within the company.  I used to be a very dedicated associate, but in the past few years that feeling has been hard to have seeing what I see as well as seeing what others go through."
bad,I didn't enjoy the culture of cutting corners to get the job done faster. And the quantity over quality of managements expectations. My attention to detail was discouraged in favor of speed. Walmart is a quantity over quality employer
bad,Good place to work if you work at the right store! Walmart has gone through some changes just recently and is eliminating certain positions. I have learned a lot along the way but want to further my career in a different path.
bad,Ok for first job to gain work experience.  I wouldn’t recommend because pay and benefits keep decreasing.  Policies depend on which manager you talk to.
bad,"It's okay, a day at Walmart is like any other retail store, it busy, a lot to get done in the day... you have to stay focus on all parts of the store all day long, or it will get out of control as to what the consumer want and is looking for... it hard work in order to make things to run smoothly"
bad,"Working the graveyard shift and neighborhood dogs that continually bark all day and all night long not allowing me to get the necessary rest I need are counterproductive and make for very difficult circumstances making the job more difficult then it really needs to be. Then there is the fact that as many times as I asked them to leave me with the necessary equipment for me to be able to do my job as I needed they would not try and help me out there, I felt like they did not want me to do my job as I thought I was expected to do. They trained me to do the job the wrong way, literally,  and was not what I had learned on the CBL's that was provided for my on the job training respectively. According to what I learned with my Computer based learning that they provided and the job handbook and specific job requirements per corporate policy as it was to my understanding their expectations of me did not comply with current corporate policy. I got the feeling they did not want me to do my job as I had perceived my job to be. I wanted to do more and continually wanted to do something all the time and it was to my understanding they just wanted me to stand there all the time twiddling my thumbs. Due to their restructuring and store changing and updating store features they eliminated that night shift I was working and those particular jobs I was assigned to at the time,..."
bad,"Tienes estabilidad pero trabajas como burro por muy poca paga te presionan por todo los jefes no tienen ni un poco de ética "
bad,"Walmart was not what I expected it to be the staff were always behind on there mission, never had things ready, the managers were very rude to everyone."
bad,"You have to meet all the production goals or you get a occurrence. Very fast paced, long days. No air conditioning in the warehouse during the summer."
bad,"Very friendly workplace, always a helping hand. Very positive environment. Great pay, good hours, decent supervisors/managers. Mostly friendly coworkers."
bad,"Management sucked, was given a promotion and they took it away without telling me then proceeded to give it to another employee and stop talking to me, create opposite schedules so I couldn’t confront them. "
bad,"My department manager is awesome. Store manager chooses what he addresses, not necessarily everything he should. Communication is SEVERELY lacking. Best thing management could do is think outside the box to find a way to communicate with ALL employees, not just those that can go to meetings."
bad,"I have to give them credit for their competitive pay and benefits and advancement opportunities, but it is a TERRIBLE place to work!! Management is mean, bossy and lazy. Everyone is MISERABLE. They are slavedrivers. It isn’t worth the good things they have to offer!"
bad,"Different managers will give you conflicting instructions, pay is poor, customers tend to be exactly how you would expect. However they do tend to be flexible with providing time off."
bad,"great job, learnt to talk to customers and help them out by finding appropriate phone and plan to suit their needs. "
bad,Had health restrictions and still was forced into positions that put me at risk. Was in electronics but was quickly moved to hardware manager with no working equipment and very little help. Walmart was so under staffed that most of the time they would pull employees from around the store to help check people out. Leaving you farther behind on your work. I really would not trust anyone who works there and says walmart is about the customer.  It all comes down to penny pinching.
bad,"It can be a really good place to work. However once you do well, you become enemy number one. And if you do your job really well, you get three peoples jobs."
bad,"Stressful fast paced work environment"
bad,"No sick hours. Takes forever to accumulate paid time off especially if you are a new hire. They do not care about associates, just about making more money."
bad,The worst company ever! Management doesn't care about their associates. I was fired because of my health issues. I had pneumonia and an upper respiratory infection and they still wanted me to work. When I took LOA for the pneumonia the store manager was angry with me. Working here was a huge mistake. It is the worst store in the region with the worst store manager.
bad,"They're a basic large corporation. You are disposable in their eyes, half the managers couldn't care less about you. Three strikes your out system when it comes to days requested off, and/or missed/late days. I was fired for missing 3 days because I was horribly ill and admitted to a hospital."
bad,I was getting bullied and harrassed and management didn't care. The customers were rude and didn't appreciate anything. The main story boss wasn't there to so anything.
bad,Walmart is just about money. Associates do not matter. They fire those who near retirement or actually have an opinion. They say they are equal but it's still a man's company. It's ok for men to do unethical things while women have to continually watch their backs.
bad,You help customers check out return stuff and receive money and be yelled at when they dont thier way then have mgmnt to tell you to do it anyway even if its against policy
bad,"a typical work day is standing on your feet 5hr + in one spot,  because they forgot to relieve you from cashiering for your 15min. breaks. they seem to remember lunches better."
bad,"I would not work for Walmart ever again even if it meant that I either work there or starve.  I would hands down starve myself!!!! They do not follow through on company policy and or rules. It is a lot of ""DO AS I SAY NOT AS I DO"" from certain managers. They are not very accommodating for people who have health or medical issues."
bad,The only thing I would say is it was a job. Was not in the clinch. Wanted to be validated by my work and abilities. Did not see any chances of advancements. Stay only 8 months my mom had a stroke and family was not the most important factor for them. For me it was.
bad,"I would come and clock in then immediately start my shift and get put on a register. I learned many customer service skills. There was no room for personal growth at Walmart, you had your job and management would not let me move positions when there were others available."
bad,"Poor management, no communication. Some days were boring with nothing to do, but other days it blew up. Fitting room had to do customer service's job. Customers were nasty. Annoying Walmart-themed songs on the Walmart radio. A lot of drama and gossip, especially with elderly coworkers, surprisingly. Dreaded every waking minute being there."
bad,"Managment is horrible, there's no communication between managers so employees get in trouble for doing what one manager asked. They care nothing about the well being of their employees."
bad,I have been with Walmart 5 years and they are always changing. They expect the most for the less money or employees to do the job correctly. Very fast paced in some departments others are relaxed I applied for other jobs within the company and was just told to keep doing what I’m doing although I interviewed well they choose candidates they want to promote not the best one!
bad,"The store it’s self has problems, not because of the employees because of the customers that come in and do things that ruins our chances of equality."
bad,Overwhelmed most days. Treated like a kid. Expected to do things prior to being trained or no training at all. Most of the time expected to do the job without the proper training.
bad,It can be a great company to work for if you dont have kids and dont have a life otherwise if you have health issues or have children that do they will not work with you they do not take doctors notes and they do not understand being a single parent
bad,Stocking is strenuous but done well with proper timing. Then they usually ask you to do something else you aren't prepared for. The management team thinks about Walmart only in most cases. You see little regard for the employees.
bad,"Have only interviewed for current position.  "
bad,"It was an OK job. Turnover rate was high which made things even harder on everyone."
bad,"I love to work at Walmart, the paid is little but I like it. The work is hard , I mean it's hard work and not allowed to sit never  during the work. When we back home always have pain from standing."
bad,Typical Retail Job an alright place to work if management is competent and you do not have any work experience. Advancement is pretty common if you are good at your job.
bad,Walmart can be a great place. Attendance is on a point system 5 points and your gone. And they have blackout dates which means you cant request time off in those dates.
bad,"When new hires start out making more than you and you are suppose to be a pay grade higher than they are you dont feel very much appreciated.  All Walmart cares about is making money they dont care about family, employee health or treating employees fairly. I felt 100% better after leaving Walmart!"
bad,Great place to work overall with a fun exciting atmosphere in a fast paced working environment. Enjoyed coworkers and friendly customers and the overall experience I gained.
bad,"Starting out you get paid more than minimum wage, which is nice, but you get overworked so easily. Never have enough people on hand, and expect you to get more done than if you were fully staffed. I’ve had to run 4 departments by myself before and still get expected to get everything done. Management is really lackluster. A lot of times they just sit in the office and do nothing."
bad,"Walmart is an acquired taste. As a salary paid manager there isn't much of a work life/personal life balance, but depending on the store and management team the experience can be controlled and somewhat pleasant. There just aren't many locations that this occurs."
bad,"I started working for walmart just out of highschool, and it was a great place to work; I quickly began to learn a lot of necessary customer experience, and I learned things like inventory counts, texlon gun training, etc. However, management is severely lacking, and I don't feel respected as an associate more than 50% of the time."
bad,The work is not hard to do however hours are not fun and you will be dragged to help other departments. Management does not understand that you can not complete three departments tasks by yourself in an hour.
bad,"I got to meet a lot of different cultures which was one of the things I loved most. Wal Mart is a good place to work if your young, I on the other hand am a single mother of three and needed to progress more in life. I wanted to be more independent and have more stability. I did learn plenty at Wal Mart like how to deal with different cultures and personalities, customer service skills, multi tasking, counting money, frying large orders of chicken, slicing lunch meat, answering the phone for catering orders and so on. The hardest part I would say to me was just being on my feet all day."
bad,I got fired for calling in as my mamaw was being put into a medically induced coma which she never woke up. There was apparently nothing they could do to help.
bad,"I don't know much of what to say here, because I still work there. I don't hate it, but I certainly don't love it. Making $12.75 as an hourly supervisor and think that is way too low for a company as big as Walmart to pay their supervisors that do as much as they do. I don't even get to do the parts of the job I was hired to do most of the time, as we are so short staffed I'm asked to help in any random direction that is needed. I'd stay if pay was higher, because I like the people I work with, my specific management is solid, and I don't mind the work. But at my current pay, and what most people make there overall, I can't recommend it."
bad,It's ok I mean the managers are always rude.they will overwork you & they don't care about the employees.all they care about is sales.i would recommend target over Walmart anybody can get hired at Walmart
bad,Management was not friendly and very nonsupporting  of personal life. Work hours would range from working a ton of hours a week to sometimes receiving no scheduled days for a week.
bad,"Management shows you little to no respect. If you have a bad day, you will be written up. Calling out is easy, and no  Repercussions can come from it."
bad,It felt like there was endless possibilities but you have to devote your whole life to it. Over 65 hours every week with upper management (the market level) offering no support or resolution. Lack of teaching/training. Plenty of belittling.
bad,"I did love my job at first."
bad,I only wish they would have been a little more flexible with there hours and could have worked with me around my family's schedule. The people were great to work with.
bad,Don't work there if you can't deal with a lot of stress. Many of the people I worked with were unhappy and extremely stressed out when it was unneccessary.
bad,"This company is one of the worst companies to work for mainly because of how poor the management is and how they wont reason with you about anything. It's just not fair, they dont make you feel good about yourself, they dont praise you for doing a good job"
bad,If you don’t have open availability you will not get many hours. It is very hard to get a day off. They don’t train many people. It is a very stressful job.
bad,"Pros: Some great co-workers"
bad,I love the hours hate that they don’t train you at all. No communication between the hundreds of managers. They have you do everyone else’s job but you own then complains because your job isn’t done
bad,Hours can be long. Pay roll is limited so Managers end up working long days to finish work load. Team environment is fun and your always busy. advancement is possible but rare. If you have a great Manager that makes a world of difference.
bad,A typical part of my day consisted of coming in and walking the sales floor and backroom to check on hand of the freight! Then meeting with my associates to give them their tasks. I would also scan freight needed to be ordered to shelf. The most enjoyable part of my day was when helping customers.
bad,Working at Walmart was stupid. I had the job for 3 months and basically got fired for having a medical emergency. When I started working there I had worked out with my manager that I would have to miss a week for family matters and she was okay with it. But in between then and the time for the family matters I had to miss a week for medical issues that left me in the hospital. They fired me after getting back from the family matter. They said it was because of the family matters but I know it was for the hospital stay they said they had to work so hard to get me that but they did jack squat.
bad,Don't recommend they don't train just throw you into the work overworking you and putting you down no matter how much you work harder I dont recommend this job
bad,"i just didnt like the people i worked with really, it was a fun job i loved what i did i was always on my feet and always had something to do, i would have loved to keep working with them but sadly not for me"
bad,Im a department manger and I get treated like a dog. The only way to get passed a department manager is to be a Brown noser. They treat the employees really bad.
bad,Very hard place to work for. You are just a body to management. Very fast paced. Employees are not friendly neither management other than a few salary isnt good at all
bad,"A typical day would start off at a slow pace, then speed up as the afternoon progressed. The work load per day would often require more workers and more time, which we unfortunately were rarely given. That made the day difficult. "
bad,If you have health problems never consider a job at walmart on deans bridge rd the managers were not understanding about anything or doctors exscuses your on the computer for training then they say your going to be an a designated area when your really going to be all over the store
bad,The pay is the only good thing about the company. They expect more and more out of employees they can't keep the warehouse staffed everyone is being mandatory for overtime. I would not recommend anyone to apply at Walmart.
bad,"Get hired and work here while looking for another job or go to school."
bad,"The managers at Walmart do not understand or work with you if a  emergency happens and you have to be off. There was this guy I know, was in the hospital.He called in to let them know at the store. The manager told him if he wasn’t in to work the next morning, he would be fired. This guy had to leave the hospital to be at work. He really needed his job."
bad,"You make more than minimum wage when you start, but annual pay raises are a flat 2% no matter how hard you work. A lot of people come in & then do little to no work. & Walmart's process for firing is difficult. So, once a bad worker is hired you're stuck with them. Management is always changing and very few actually care about the associates and only worry about covering themselves for upper management."
bad,"I really love my coworkers, however, management is very poor. It's a bunch of younger kids, with very poor work ethics. Definitely not somewhere I would recommend to work."
bad,Friendly coworkers but will get rid of you in a heartbeat. The work is good and helping customers is good but management is lacking and poor and there is miscommunication.
bad,"There was not a lot of diversity when it came to employees. I was not spoken to cause of the color of my skin. I have mixed children, so it was extremely hard to deal with racism everyday not only with customers but co workers as well."
bad,They don’t test you like a valued member of the company. Was treated poorly by most department and customer service managers. Would not recommend applying.
bad,"This job will wring you dry and then toss you to the side, the management usually have no idea what they are doing and the few associates that do are abused and then when they have outlived their usefulness thrown to the side if not out right fired."
bad,Over all alot of opportunities. In the new roles Walmart is is changing in new positions. Walmart culture and beliefs are not what they where when same Walton was leading the company. Corporate might still implement the Walmart culture and beliefs but not at store lvl. Mgmt is overwhelmed at store lvl with to much.
bad,A typical day at work entails me mainly stocking the milk and eggs. While also making sure the department while also getting ride of damaged goods when ever needed.
bad,You are disposable to Walmart. It doesn’t matter what position you may have or what amount of salary is or how hard you work. You are nothing but a number to the company.
bad,"Communication is key. Which unfortunately lacks here. A very somber and clique culture. However, room for advancement is always promoted and the incentives are good."
bad,"Tratar con la gente no es fácil, tendrían que dar cursos para sobre llevar a ciertas personas."
bad,"Very fast paced as I was a cashier"
bad,They care somewhat but the most about this is the workers themselfs they are rude and don’t care about others all they really do care about is the paycheck
bad,"Working at Walmart felt like painting a target on my back every time I clocked into work. No matter what I did, or how well I did it, it was never good enough."
bad,"low pay for how much work you have to do. not enough people to do job."
bad,"Wal*Mart stores has become a victim of our society, in the 1970’s up until the 90’s, Wal*Mart was a fun and challenging place to work, training and developing their associates to be the future managers and CEO’s of the company. It was hard work but fun and uncomplicated for the most part and you could work your way up in the company as far as your talents would take you. Today with all the corporate pressure from outside influences Wal*Mart has become a cookie cutter company with no culture not to be a unique company anymore."
bad,"Managers don’t care about your health they want work done at any cost."
bad,I like working with the customer that was a very hostile environment But overall the staff was very friendly and everybody went together I want to work with the public
bad,They Do Have Good Maternity Leave (I’ve Known Multiple Co-Workers To Leave For A Good While And Come Back No Problem). If You Have Medical Conditions It’s A Fight Constantly Which You Don’t Have Energy For. It’s Always Push And Pull. They’ll Work You Until They Have To (And I Mean Absolutely Have To) Replace You. Dealt With Corporate Quite A Lot Where I Was Which Should’ve Been A Sign. I Dared Step Into The Place Until I Absolutely Had To A Month Ago.
bad,Working at walmart has a lot going on in itself. You get good hours and can stay as busy as you want with great benefits but pay isnt the greatest and management is poor and lacks real guidance and communication amongst the other managers.
bad,"The most of what I did while I worked for them was checking people out at the registers. Sometimes, they would have to send a door greeter on break, so they would ask me to cover for that person. This only happened a handful of times, however."
bad,"El ambiente laboral día con día se torna regular, aprendí a hacer nuevos procedimientos de ventas y me agrado mucho el trato con el cliente, en esta empresa se vive una mala dirección gerencial  debido a mala planeación en la logística de la empresa"
bad,"Not enough hrs and not enough pay, need better management more organisation they need better benefits than the ones they have and treat employees with respect"
bad,My department manager doesn’t care about the employees or if we have the people or time to get everything done they want us to. If you bring up an issue with her she just says she look at it and it will take weeks and many times asking her to fix is before anything gets done. On top of that if you call off for any reason they treat you bad because they Don’t hire enough people as it is. I also work full time but am not considered full time so I don’t get pto or any of the benefits that full time employees get.
bad,Managers don't manage and nobody takes any accountability. The only way you're ever going to feel good about working there is if management favors you.
bad,Walmart as a company provides no stability for its employees. They are worked endlessly with horrible wages. Walmart continues to offer higher hourly rates but consistently takes away the hours. There is no work/life balance for its management team.
bad,"I worked for the company for about six and a half years and officially in at least five different positions in four different store. I did some fresh area, entertainment, overnight, and front end, so I got to see a lot of different things going on in the general operation of a store. I liked the job(s) itself, even enjoyed the various customers, but I had a real mix of managers. Some good, some poor, and some with very little training. I learned how to adapt to various customer situations, how to  efficiently train and care for teams of people under my supervision, and all the small little details in between. The general culture of the place was a lot of people doing as minimum as possible  because store level managers were usually poor in how they interacted with people, or the store level managers having people work literally four to five different people's jobs and getting upset when all the needed daily work isn't done."
bad,"Ten minute breaks includes walking from the front of the store to the back and back to the front, not leaving you much actual break time. Other employees saw you as competition. Not a fun place to work."
bad,"Management cares more about making that next buck than taking care of their Employees, you'll sooner see them appease a customer who is in the wrong then keeping an eye out for the Techs and their well beings."
bad,A lot of empty promises were made there and I was just sick of it. Leaving notes for me to do this and that where there was no explanation on how to do it. It was stupid.
bad,Managers were great and did there best. But woudnt change my schedule for months. People were bad on the line and pushed it so things fell off. Times werent fair. But i the people I worked work were great. Not a bad job at all. Just people needed to listen to your needs more.
bad,"Typical call center, just remember you are just a number to them. Make sure you have your stats on point or you can get fired without a warning. Also be prepared of the verbal abuse you may have to deal with customers."
bad,"The job itself is not the worst, however it is low skill and low wage. The management at my location were poor, though. They were more concerned with maintaining their job, rather than improving the store's quality. They also did not seem to respect any of their employees."
bad,"Overall, on a typical day you will experience the pressure of existing in an understaffed and highly demanding workplace. As a middle manager you are tossed around from manager to manager. Each member of management different style and often disagree on the ""right way to run"" the store. "
bad,"Working for Walmart is OKAY, depending on the department you work at. If you are put in Sporting Goods or Hardware, then good luck dealing with some of the worst people."
bad,"Most of the managers were great in my location but the training was awful. Hours in my own experience were awful, senior co-workers will always have priority on hours so you may not get your desired shifts. The employee discount is only 10%. Although I only worked here for a couple of months I did not enjoy myself, I constantly went home feeling unfulfilled, there are no areas to grow within your role, which is something that I was told would be possible (I.e. no supervisor position for loss prevention) if you want to grow past loss prevention then there are positions open. You get anual raises however they are between 10-50 cents and very few get 50 cents. Overall it is a good job to have if you are transitioning from jobs. Lastly apps, apps, apps, (apps=apprehension) you are expected to get apprehensions as much as possible for anything, arresting an individual for illegal activity is a good way to learn however depending on your store you may not apprehend as many people as others. My last point is a positive one, you can network well with officers this is for those who want to be any form of law enforcement, it is good way to get to know those in the uniform."
bad,"Lately, management has been more prone to micro-manage it's employees and attempt to get more work out of them than is possible. When Marketing estimates a task should take 3 hours, you get it done in 2 hours, and they want you to work harder to get the task done in 1 hour, it creates a stressful environment."
bad,"Under paid for work being done. Management is never around when needed. Granted I worked in the Vision Center, I called in once in a 6 month period and my manager retaliated against me by making me work 10 days in a row to get back at me. Upper management didnt even a knowledge us in Vision Center until they needed a cashier. Shelves never stocked, registers hardly opened. People leaving weeks after starting because working here was not a great experience."
bad,"Walmart management was not good to me. I put in for a promotion two different times in the department I had worked in for 2 years. I knew this department like the back of my hand and could run it with my eyes closed. I also loved it. I helped this department go from the messy, bare shelved department it was into a thriving part of that Walmart. I truly feel as if that fabric department would not have been in as good of a state had I not stepped in and helped it. I got ignored, stepped on, treated poorly by my management team (due to a disability({my shoulder was injured})) and pushed out the door. I would never work here again."
bad,Walmart needs to let there managers do there job and stay out of the way. Half the time people calling the shots have no idea whats going on because they are too busy makeing the store look good and giving the idea that everything is amazing. When in reality its cause no one from the Home Office knowns what a store is really like.
bad,"It was a good, fun place to work. They should just watch who they decide to promote and should treat everyone fairly instead of letting others slack off while others work harder. They should expect the same from everyone and not just a few."
bad,Not much communication from upper management. Understaffed work environment. You get hired for one position but you end up doing work everywhere else. You begin going to work each day not knowing where you're gonna be
bad,It’s a fine place to work for the money that they offer however the management is so horrible and the store is all over the place. I would not recommend working there.
bad,Arrive at 4am scan the shelves and see what needs to be stocked. Go to warehouse load up pallet/cart start stocking shelves. Repeat till break at 7am. Lunch is at 10 am then last break is at 12:15 and then go home at 1pm
bad,Stocking over night 10-7 and it was lazy workers and the manager was rude and the best enjoyable when going home.. i stayed longer because I need a job and had bills to pay and child to take care of.
bad,In my region it's quite common for people to hire and promote their friends and family. Latino culture in a nutshell is it's not what you know or hard you work but how closely you know the person in charge.
bad,"This is by far the worst company that I have worked for. The money is good if your not unloading trucks. Cap 2 gets the same pay as a cashier and cap 2 does a lot of physical work. Management is horrible and they do not care about their employees, only what benefits themselves."
bad,"Walmart is a typical retail establishment.  Low pay for high, even unreasonable, expectations.  Always understaffed and looking to restructure in a way that will most likely make the problem worse.  The hard working people are the best part of the job."
bad,"My location had a very dis-functional management team. It seamed as though lazy employees were rewarded or left alone, but those who try to make a difference were constantly being coached. "
bad,Walmart has a lot of ups and downs. Sometimes the managers are very bad about getting their points across and some managers even treat workers poorly.
bad,The pay is nice and they offer lots of insurance benefits  but management was absolute terrible! I quit because I couldn’t take it anymore! The management structure needs to change!
bad,I just wanted to work because I wanted to pay for school. To many cashier with horrible scheduling. There were people who had 40 hours or more and they were not even full time workers.
bad,"I worked at the customer service desk and there were at least 5 of us but I got overworked because I had open availability, only because I was told we had to have that to get the hours.  The managers didn't care about you and the environment was full of negativity and hate.  Walmart gives customers too much lead way and most of the time they came in there just to ruin someone's day because they're having issues.  The pay was decent but all of the hassle that you're given you deserved at least $15 - $17.  Also when you go into Walmart and see 50 people in line that's because they hire dam near everyone and only put 6 people on the schedule for the shift.  Half of the employees there you'll only see every so often because they're scheduled one day a week.  I wouldn't dare work for Walmart again unless it was my last resort and I highly doubt that."
bad,Never work at Walmart unless you're desperate for work and like working hard for little pay...I would say the only good thing about working there was getting free food from meetings and that they work around your schedule
bad,"worked with a lot of friendly people, good break times, was able to meet and talk to all kinds of different people. Overall the managers were okay. The hours could have been better for the employees"
bad,"I would not suggest working at Walmart.  No holiday pay,  or sick pay, they give you 40 hours of pto to use for everything, which don’t go to far!!  Minimal raises. "
bad,"I worked at walmart two different times in two different states. One was a neighborhood market, the other a supermarket. Both times I had trouble getting hr to listen to me. I would tell them plain and clear when I am available and when I am not, and they would tell me ""That's fine, we can work with your schedule."" The next thing I know, they're scheduling me times that I cant make it to work, forcing me to call in or be late. They put so much emphasis on how caring they are, but as soon as youre on board they forget about you. Its disheartening."
bad,Most days we only have a few cashier's and the changes being made I believe will hurt the company in the long run. On a regular basis I miss my breaks because of staffing and call outs.
bad,Buena empresa lo único malo que hay mucho faboritismo
bad,I used to enjoy my job at Walmart but in the last few years no one wants to work there . They do not appreciate any of the employees who have been there long term . I rarely miss work and am punctual they don’t seem to appreciate that either. I am very dissatisfied with this company . I enjoy all the employees I work with there a great group of people.
bad,"New attendance policy that is confusing and can definitely get terminated fairly quickly.  Working independently most of the time.  Production goal oriented, and can lose job eventually  if you are not meeting goal"
bad,"After a year I was placed on a Core Schedule that would not be changed.  Shortly after a ""computer system override"" changed my schedule and I was terminated under new guidelines as I was suppose to check my schedule daily regardless."
bad,The management sucks on both the assistant manager and supervisor of my department that I work in. They let me go due to putting my 2 weeks in and said that I was a negative person.
bad,"When I was younger always wanted to work for Walmart.  That changed when I finally did.  For the amount of work they ask you to do, the pay was very unsatisfactory.  When single people work full time and still have to apply for Food Stamps, something is very wrong."
bad,"I worked 3rd shift stressful job don't care about their employees there"
bad,Like any job it has its uos and downs.  You get out what you out into it.  So if you dont out anything into it you won't get anything out of it.  But if you work hard you can advance quickly.
bad,"I had work there for long time now. If the manager is not around, the supporting manager would come to you at anytime to make demands from you. Is more like bullying, that’s what she is doing. You’ll see what I mean once you start working there. Stay away, I’ll do the same too in the near future. It’s sad, really. Work at different Walmart or something."
bad,Everybody is for themself including manager playing favorites to the people that do not do the job well and not giving the right people the reward for there job well done and get rid of the worker that actually do work
bad,"Its a fast paste job and working environment. Not everyone was bad to work with, however, management can be very poor depending on the department of choice. I enjoyed organizing the merchandise, stocking the shelves and interacting with the customers to help them meet their shopping needs. The hardest part of the job was being under staffed, experiencing a glitch in the schedule or both. Overall, I learned to work better as a team to assist customers.  A typical day at work is interesting."
bad,if you're willing to put up with management constantly demanding something from you even when you're already working on something then this is the job for you. Some managers are ok while others just bark orders from higher up and have no idea about how things really work. They will randomly start cutting hours or scheduling for hours that are not even in your availability.
bad,Failure to fix problems in a timely manner.  Not support by management.  shift work that puts your shifts back to back with little time off in-between.
bad,I worked there as an overnight cashier and sometimes asked to work swing shift. The customers were a lot of times snappy and disrespectful with the occasional nice and cool folks. The management there was unhelpful and at times verbally reprimand me publicly within earshot in front of customers
bad,"I have never worked so hard for 8.15 an hour.  I walked about 3 miles a night returning items.  They had us to cashier, stock, zone, and returns non stop all night."
bad,"My experience at Walmart is kinda rough because my Walmart is unorganized, no communication, and team building is much needed. Once people get direction and the tools to the the job every thing goes smooth."
bad,I started off as a truck unloader years ago and within a few years became a salaried member of management. Walmart develops from within which I thought was a good thing the problem is once you climb your way up the later you realize how unprofessional and disrespectful those people up the ladder are.
bad,The only thing really enjoy was helping the customer and doing a good job by putting a smile on their face. I learn a lot but on my own but Wal-mart store 0931 is very unorganized they will ask you to do something and don't even show you half of the time I had to figure it out by myself. The management sucks they don't care about the customer half of them don't greet the customer or care about the associates they just don't care only when the corporate comes that's when you see them working and interested in the store.
bad,"The job itself isnt hard but, the management team and office politics make the job difficult to maintain. Overall the managers over the areas dont know how to actually work in said areas and expect others to do jobs that they themselves could not do in the allotted time."
bad,Starting at Walmart is fun at first until you realize they expect too much like wanting you to stay late but not wanting to let you keep your overtime plus they put many workers in positions they don't belong such as senior citizens helping on semis etc other than the decent pay it's not that great of a job in my opinion their very inconsiderate
bad,"good company if you have the ability to grow, becomes difficult as you get older to try and build your career if you don't have someone to help you along."
bad,Horrible hour and employee balancing. Hires too many people so jad to cut hours for full time employees to 25- 30 hours a week if lucky. Very overstocked in racks and in back freight room.
bad,"Serving customers, and cashier.  Put in positions without proper training. A lot of gossip.  A lot of disfunction.  Given one day training to work in the accounting department.  In customer service, there were too many different instructions on what needed to be done.  You didn't know what was the right way."
bad,You have to work fast to keep the lines down. Managers never back up what a cashier tells a customer on anything. The pay was good but the hours you work for 2 weeks it evens out to not much of anything
bad,For this to be multi millionaire company there is no benefits for people who works less than 40 hours only for employees that’s been there longer than 3 years
bad,The time allotted to finish some task is simply ridiculous! Their is always a shortage of workers. The pay is not fitting w the amount of work that u do..
bad,"I had a bad experience working at Walmart only because they didn't keep up with their employees breaks or lunch breaks. If you wanted to go to lunch or break because it was your time, they wouldn't let you go because it was too ""busy"". So you would end up going to your lunch or break, like two hours late."
bad,"The workplace is awful. Every member of management had a different set of rules and regulations. Scheduling errors are made frequently. Customers are rude and impatient. Overall, working for Walmart is a terrible idea."
bad,"Every couple months, upper management comes forward with something else they are taking from the employees. (Shortening breaks, raising standards, changing how much vacation time you’re eligible to get, taking away time off for holidays, taking away holiday pay)"
bad,Walmart has begun to try and automate as much as they can now.  They are cutting higher paid positions left and right in an attempt to save money.  There is not much room for growth in the company anymore and the higher up positions are being eliminated quickly.  Fairly soon entry level jobs will be where the bulk of the work will come from with increased responsibilities from the entry level workers without increased compensation.  I used to recommend Walmart to everyone i knew but not anymore.
bad,definitely not worth the 13.50 to run like a chicken with its head cut off. They will continue to add more work for you even if it is not part of your contract. Be careful not to call out too many times even if you have paid Sick time off. The assistant Managers will text you for not showing up to work. Always trying to cut hours and the CSS's and Cashiers take the fall for it. Not the greatest place to work at. If someone harasses you and you file a formal complaint get ready for management to talk to the person you filled the report and have them disregard any basic sense of confidentiality
bad,"A typical day at work consists of micromanaged tasks and consistently being asked to drop what you're doing to complete surprise priority tasks. The original tasks assigned aren't completed but employees are still held responsible for them even when completely following orders given by management. Management often denies their poor leadership by manipulating interpretation of their direction, and scapegoating employees for their failure to adhere to company processes.The culture at this establishment is that of a high school, professional only to it's customers but extremely snide among employees and management, divided into groups based on partiality. The hardest part of the job is obtaining the equipment and supplies needed to complete tasks. Management often denies requests of need, but always comes through for it's favorites, leaving the rest of us to come up with tedious and unorthodox methods to get the job done. Favorites don't believe that their colleagues are treated differently, and insist that any hardship must be due to work ethic."
bad,"I have worked there for about a year now, and have been trying to learn everything i can and move up, but people will not train you or do it very well when they do. if you ever have problems, most managers at my walmart will just blow you off."
bad,"Walmart is a decent job if you are a young person wanting to make money for bubblegum or an older person looking for supplemental income, but if you have a family to support and are the main bread winner, then the wages are not going to cut it.  A lot of the employees are not motivated to work hard or advance within the company, so they tend to be on the lazy side which is difficult if you are a motivated worker.  Management is only concerned with safety and employee satisfaction when it is beneficial to their position and the company in my opinion."
bad,"Management needs a lot of work. The pay is decent, but sometimes they want you to work other positions that are a different pay rate. They aren’t a fan of overtime."
bad,"I learned to come to work, work hard and leave to go home. Never felt it was career path, there were good days and then there were bad days. I had more trouble from the managers smothering me because they only wanted to use you. You ask to move around to learn different things and they would reject your request. If they want you to help in other area they would get offended if you weren't interested."
bad,"It is a good place to start a job with, like your first job, especially for students as the working ours are flexible in you could choose your shift. This will help student to work and study at the same time plus gain lots of customer services skills."
bad,Work. 10+ hours a day with only one break. Can be scheduled 7 or more days straight even though it says in the handbook it's not allowed at any level. Unfair and biased asm's you work with will fire your associates when your off. Store manager sat in her office all day on her phone on facebook being a complete waste of space and time. Store managers never have your back even when you do everything for them you will be thrown under the bus immediately.
bad,For the most part the people are great until you get higher up and it’s worse than high school with all the drama. I genuinely love being a cashier and working with the customers it’s the drama that has made this job experience a bad one.
bad,"Walmart can be a stressful work place some days can also be fun.Also management is not very good there, most don't know whats going on half the time. The hardest part is getting stuff done on time when we have a very short time to do it."
bad,"Never underestimate Walmart.  It is a great company, despite itself.  I fully support Doug McMillon's vision and strategy.  "
bad,I got fired because I accidentally cut my hand open with a dull old box cutter instead of a brand new one when I started. I ended up needing 8 stitches then i took 2 days off because my hand was in so much pain. Then hot fired because of attendence
bad,Most days are good but very stressful. Under staffed departments and hard to get days off when needed work all holidays and every weekend. If your lucky or you can sometimes get time off you need.
bad,"Stretched a growing, time sensitive, workload among small space, and short staff.  At first it was a challenge, which was fun, then it just got ridiculous. I saw some of the strongest coworkers break down crying on a regular day because the workload wasn't distributed fairly, and usually the same employees got most of the worst parts of the job. Felt obligated to stay everyday because your team would get overloaded if you left when you were scheduled to leave. The place kept falling apart. Would be a perfect place to work, if it was ran by someone. Just 1 person calling in would set the whole day back if we couldn't find someone to fill in that spot. The most enjoyable part of the job for most was a smoke break. Sometimes you couldn't even take your lunch because it would set everything back and make the day worse."
bad,"Every single day you are set up to fail, then yelled at about it. I don't know how many times I had to hide in the office and cry. Management are rude and expect you to go WAY beyond for them, yet they don't pay you enough for everything you do and go through on a daily basis. I've never hated a job so much in my life. Turnover is INSANE."
bad,"very stressful enviroment, very short handed everyday.  policies have changed dramatically.  I just want a change in enviroment. management showing lack of concern for their associates,"
bad,The job requires standard retail/fresh area work but offers little to no incentive as raises are almost never given and overtime is against company policy.
bad,working as a wall mart associate is straight forward.  you follow a set schedule and maintain a good pace you can easily get all your work done without assistance.
bad,"A lot of the time,  the workload is to much to be able to complete in a regular 8 hour shift. Sometimes,  they would assign additional tasks before current tasks can be completed."
bad,"When I first started working here, I felt like management actually cared about our customers and their experience at our store. I still feel that way, but corporate is making that next to impossible for us as employees to follow. Most days, we don’t even have enough people on the front end to have more than one register open at a time, leaving our customers upset and frustrated. I hear more and more customers saying things like “this is a joke” or “why do we still shop here?”. I have seen many instances where the people running the front end have to do that from a register, a door, or the service desk. When those people call for help on the front end due to long lines, they rarely get a response, and when they do help doesn’t show up until ten to twenty minutes after the first call. Part of the reason is that we simply don’t have enough staff. Part of the reason is simply because there is no sense of urgency in this store to do what we need to do to make our customers happy. We have 18 self checkouts and 14 regular registers and on most shifts (mostly at night) we rarely have more than 8 people on the front end to run these registers. These 8 people include the 2 door greeters, the person at the service desk, and the 2 people who are in charge of running the front end. This leave 3 cashiers. 1 for the grocery side self checkout, 1 for the general merchandise self checkout and 1 for the registers. All because corporate is regulating labor instead of each individual store like we used to. So much for caring about our customers."
bad,"Walmart does offer advancements in positions, but the pay is low, and the management can be hard to get along with. Most employees lack motivation and team work skills, even after extensive training."
bad,My only complaint is with the managers. Most of the managers could careless what is happening to you as a lowly associate. I left because the managers let you drown most of the time.
bad,"Its retail. Walmart's low prices means you get everyone. Its the only place where I had a lady complained to me about our lack of organic frozen vegetables and get interrupted by a guy looking for pickled pigs feet."
bad,"The best part of the job is your shift is a three or four continuous days of work, per week so you would get three or four days off in a row. Unpaid lunch but paid breaks."
bad,I worked for the wal mart coorporation for over 3 years total and never enjoyed it once. training is easy. work is easy. job is lame. lets grow vegetables and rabbits. why do we live like this ?
bad,It's good if you need a job for a little bit. Issue with favoritism in management was clear. This made anybody who was not brown-nosing eligible for termination. Management had no interest in listening to associates ideas and were sometimes hostile if an idea different from their own was offered. When problems did arise the solution seemed to chastised from the top down. No progress was made just anger which at times made for a very tense workplace. Don't be fooled by the training videos this walmart does not reflect the workplace culture the videos talk about. It always had a high turnover so don't expect to make a career.
bad,"It was not a horrible work environment, but the management and the way that they ran things were strange. They only had me train for one day and put me on my own if I wasn't quick to pick up things and learn I do don't think I would have been able to do my job properly."
bad,Constant changing and unclear priorities and expectations. No work life balance. Compensation is good but used as a tool to treat management as tools not people.
bad,"The job was ok but the job is never done. There is always another task or another customer. You are never off. If you are management, you are always reminded that you are never off. It really sucks after a while. If you don't have a family then it is probably great. If you have kids that you want to see then look somewhere else."
bad,I currently work in the fresh department where the manager rarely comes and sees or helps us. While at the same time we are short staffed in that area.
bad,"Do not work at Walmart, they screw you over on hours, any positions you need filled out for your team will not be filled if they get new people, they'll sometimes schedule you really late nights and have you come in the morning the next day, management was nice but had no idea what they were doing."
bad,Walmart not bad company to work for. management could be friendlier though. Most of the time great company to work for. I worked for Walmart for ten years. started as a cashier and ended as a stocker. felt that some were treated fairly well while others were not treated as well. A lot of favoritism went on.
bad,Walmart is a good start out job but don’t get too close to anyone Walmart is your work not family.they aren’t there to help you through troubled times they will replace you quicker than you can blink
bad,"co workers are mean and barely help you or the customers, they don't walk you to the item your looking for, managers don't do anything when it comes to making sure the workers are okay and maintaining a good work environment"
bad,Your experience is based on how good your managers are. If you have supportive management there are opportunities to move up. At times it can be quite challenging it always help to ask questions.
bad,Walmart has  me work the whole parking lot to myself from when my shift starts to end. They would send somebody only for lunch and when I get back it would usually be worse than I had it.
bad,Every day we go in we pull out freight and the we work it to the shelves. There isn't much to learn besides the hand held PDA as the job is pretty self explanatory. Good managers seem to be hard to keep. The hardest part of this job I'd say is getting enough sleep as I work on the over night shift. that makes it hard to come in energized and ready for the night. The most enjoyable part of the job I think is getting to know the different characters of the people I work with.
bad,"Being a cart-attendant is either so hectic it's impossible to manage and keep up, or so slow that there isn't a single thing to do except count the pieces of salt on the ground (or that should've been there after it snowed). The pay is measly as they went through all this effort to hand out raises for employees. Turns out we only got a ten cent raise, likely not even enough to keep up with inflation. This job is far too lax; scheduling is a joke; and co-workers are incredibly unmotivated and unhelpful. Good start for any high schooler who is looking to learn how to keep a smile on their face while screaming on the inside."
bad,"I had a very negative experience at the store I worked for but I can't speak for all stores. Management at my store did not care about the employees under them, mind you there is always an exception to the rule"
bad,"Every day I clock out to go home, I felt like a little piece of my soul was left behind for Walmart to make another dollar off in their grand Monopoly scheme to rule the world."
bad,"At first it was a very good place to work, but the last few years raises went down and new programs want into affect without enough equipment to do your work properly."
bad,"Management needs to know what each other are doing. One minute there will be one manager telling you to do this, then the next minute there is another one telling you that what you are doing is totally wrong. Tell you that you will keep your hours then cut them. Only a few good managers there with more of them leaving or being transferred out to a different store."
bad,Working at Walmart required a lot of team oriented work where usually every project or assignment was at least a two person job. Fellow coworkers were diverse and capable people and supervisors did the best they could with the guidelines they had to work with.
bad,"cash transaction, helping customers, count money and insure transaction and money collected is correct, stock shelves and organize them, assist when needed"
bad,If it were not for the pay there are quite a few people that currently would not work there. The management is rude to their employees when addressed to the store manager he does not do anything.
bad,they don't really care about your personal life just servicing the customer. They try to fire you over any little thing. Great money but not a great place to work.
bad,Not much room for advancement and management just sucks overall. Made some good friends there but that’s just about all of the good things I can remember about working here.
bad,"I enjoyed working with the people while I was there. the management was okay. I loved interacting with the customers, some customers made it a pleasure to be there."
bad,"The costumers are nice, the employees on the other hand. Some are good, some are okay, but the other are snakes in the grass. The hardest is telling the management that you CAT NOT do something and they tell you to do it because its your job."
bad,This has to be the worst job ever. Everyone say hey the pay is good but forget the pay! They treat their workers like their nothing. All Walmart is mainly just robots now so their soon to get rid of everybody!
bad,WalMart for the most part is a good job but you feel like you are over looked and held back when you work hard and when you don't get promoted. But is a good temporary job.
bad,"needs help management, assistants don't do there jobs, people take off to much with no consequences.  Don't listen about problems, poor stocking haBITS"
bad,Walmart will give you 40 hrs per week. So long as you say yes to everything. We are all replaceable.  And are treated as such. But like I said 40 hrs.per week. Stand up for yourself. Go to work not to make friends..
bad,The worst management. Lack of communication and understanding. The managers mostly only care about themselves. It’s not really the place I would recommend to anyone but it’s decent if they like you
bad,typical retail job the jobs focus what you can do for the co. not what they can do to help you. Have seen many senior employees leave the store because they were more less pushed out of there jobs
bad,"No hay respeto con horarios."
bad,"This company is very shady, using barely legal practices and ethics. They underpay their associates and punish them for speaking out. Not a good career choice."
bad,"While advancement was available, people who worked on their own was often sent on jobs without correct pay for that position.  It was not family oriented. Seems to be gearing itself for younger workers only."
bad,was temporary for me when the mines were closing.. it was a job. overall the people were great to work with and the job itself provided for me and my family. but it was hard to get hours and full time as I needed on the amount of pay that I was paid hourly.
bad,"Working for Walmart gave me the opportunity to learn management skills while perfecting my customer service and money handle skills."
bad,"The managers dont care about you, they broke many rules at my walmart as well. Every week was a mixed up random schedule, one day i worked 5am to 2am next day i work from 5pm to 11pm then comeback at 5am the next day."
bad,Would not work there ever again. Not very understanding of certain situations. You basically have to fall over dead to get an excused absence. Family matters with CLOSE family happens and if you try to be there for said family member they will give you a point for being absent. Which is what they done to me. Kind of feel like I am better off away from there anyway.
bad,Basic job was great. enjoyed daily responsibly.Received management  assistance when requested. Had ability to keep updated for changes in job allowing the fullest performance.
bad,As long as you keep all personal information to yourself. I confided a problem to the management and in return was relieved of my position. Do not share  information with your supervisors.
bad,"It was fun from time to time, but when it was “ go time “ then that’s when the managers got busy. Take work serious at all times. No matter what’s going on around you."
bad,Salaried managers are contracted for 48 hours a week but my last 6 months with the company I was working 80 hours a week with zero compensation and was called in consistently on vacations and days off.
bad,There was drama between managers and associates or between associates and associates so i had to leave to get away from all of it. Most of the associates are also part time with full time hours so we didn't get our benefits
bad,"This area is fast paced to keep up with the ever changing retail environment. I was able to work on many different projects to support the healthcare business. I was able to grow as a project manager and as a compliance specialist. Time management was the hardest part of the job as we handled breaches and requests from our regulatory agencies. Our team handles over 5,600 HIPAA breaches a year as well as advising the business."
bad,"I worked there for about a year and a half and it was one of the most miserable times of my life. When I first started, things were okay. I got to work full 40 hour shifts starting in the morning, which is what I wanted. However, as time went on, my schedule started to drastically change. Management forced me to change my availability so they could schedule me in the evening, even though there many PT employees available in the evening."
bad,"Walmart is Walmart. Customers don't want to talk to you, management doesn't want you to talk to other employees. You are treated as a number instead of a person. I simply knew some of the people I closely worked with. Some people I see every day I didn't even know their name. It wasn't super stressful but the hours for my shift were."
bad,"While the job was enjoyable with coworkers who shared similar interests, and easy going. The manager directly above me was wonderful, every other store manager was difficult to work with. They kept our department constantly understaffed, leaving us to constantly rush a lot of work."
bad,I would not recommended that anyone work here if you can help it. It may be a good starter job but it's not the best one. You only get two days off and you might run yourself ragged by working 20-30 hours a week and going to school.
bad,Lack of communication  and the fact that they didnt know where they wanted to place me and i didn't get paid enough to work in two places at once. In a typicl work day i would be in twl places at once. I learned to use the open door policy. Hardest part of my job was figuring out which department i worked in. I loved the people i w orked with!
bad,"I can't speak for all Wal-Mart's but the one I work at has such poor management I can't stand it. Your goals change every day and you're never really sure what your goals are because they change half way through your shift at times. Communication is poor unless it comes to making sure your work is done in the allotted time then they are great at harassing you to hurry up and get done. A lot of them talk down on you and they cut corners and it's just an overall head ache."
bad,"Walmart was a good job for me they gave out a lot of overtime hours, but the only catch for the job is you need to be on your feet for and long time and be willing to come in on your day off. no I would not recommend anyone to go to the job (Optional)"
bad,"Management favors who they will discipline and who they allow to bend rules. Promotion seems based solely on whether they like you personally or not. They definitely prefer to hire non-American citizens.The hardest part of the job was trying to do a good job, but feeling challenged in doing so if you 'didn't fit in' because others not willing to work cohesively."
bad,"Enjoy what I do and helping people, but management is very cut-throat and childish. Would not recommend working in this pharmacy, ever. The environment is very petty and middle-school like."
bad,"good pay but there is a solid gap of communication between associate and managers as if they feel like they are annoyed by your presence. If you can brush the managers off your shoulder and do your job, the pay is worth it."
bad,The only reason for anyone to ever work in retail is to learn to consider other people. Otherwise the pay doesn't even come close to compensate for the amount of work that you do.
bad,Incredibly high stress job with minimal rewards or chance of advancement. Incredibly nepotistic and immense display of favoritism. Would not recommend anyone to work here.
bad,"Ok company to work for, somewhat decent pay scale. Poorly managed at times, did offer a discount on general merchandise items and on grocery items during christmas."
bad,"I disliked my manager very much, she was very rude and never had time to talk. Very fast paced and very stressful. CSM can be very nice and caring but they can also be very rude. Not many hours and not flexible at all."
bad,I enjoyed many years with Wal-Mart. Things changed there drastically. There was no room for advancement within the company after several years. I was greatly disappointed. I left only to start my own business and I miss the people there still.
bad,this job had so many insignificant rules like you had to drink water by registers even if we had a water bottle the seals. the management system was very confusing. hardest part of the job was to stay busy most days
bad,Easy job to get and stay at but not a good job to keep or advance at. Worked there for over 4 years and am barely making over minimum wage and people that are just starting make just as much as i do.
bad,"It was one of the hardest working envirments that i have ever been in..I was talked about daily,never was trained so I had to either sank or swim..But thank God I learned and did better then most thought i would."
bad,"There are lots of changes happening within Walmart, both good and bad.  If you don't enjoy changes occurring consistently, you should understand that up front.  Great company, great people, just the constant stress of not knowing day to day IF you have a job, what that job might be, and how much of a pay cut will it mean."
bad,"It's an okay place to work, the benefits are fine and the pay and hours are good, but it's quite a hectic place, especially during the holidays and management does not often understand every part of their associates' jobs, which causes a lot of heads to butt over trivial things."
bad,12 hours work day very bad management bad culture.The pay and benefits are good the building is constant turnover and moral is low equipment is terrible.
bad,I was glad I worked at Walmart as a first job because it taught me how to deliver great customer service along with staying calm in situations where I sometimes felt I couldn’t and it showed me that you really have to work for anything and everything you want.
bad,Management moves associates around to try to get stock placed however management expects a case of freight to be completI u UT ed 60 second yes. Basically 60 cases and hour.
bad,stocking is a lot of fun you get to help people but not only that but learn where everything is so you can help people you get to walk around the store putting things up and help other employs
bad,pay good but some poor management  some out to get you if they don't like you very very stressful job and at the end of the week you don't know if you going to get wrote up for something also your job not promise real talk !
bad,I jointed Walmart's management team as an external. There was little training and what little there was was very poor. They put you in a classroom setting for five weeks that had little to do with our actual jobs forcing computer tests on you and when that was over they threw you to the wolves. Management is stretched thin. We can't do a good job because we're pulled in 100 different direction every day at the same time. You're always damned if you do and damned if you don't when it comes to prioritizing and making decisions. The market manager than comes in occasionally and treats you/talks to you like your dirt in front of all of your employees. The job has good benefits but it's just not worth working 65 hours a week and that time still isn't enough.
bad,Fair pay and fair working hours.  Discounts on merchandise after 3 months of employment.  This is all I have to say about working at this company.  End
bad,"Well, its Walmart, what you think is what you expect, its hard work sometimes and dealing with a lot of stress from management that need to you to do 70 hr of work in a 40 hr slot and there is no room for overtime."
bad,"Une journée de travail est bien, j'ai appris des simples tâches d'organisation, de cuisine et de rangement."
bad,I have worked for Walmart off and on for years. Every time I have been publicly humiliated. Have never been treated with respect by upper management!!
bad,they would put way to hard if there was a bunch of freight and said we would be wrote up if we didn't finish it. they really wouldn't deal with issues very well.
bad,"I do not like my typical day at work."
bad,The workday depends on the type of shift. Busy times start late morning to early afternoon and late afternoon to middle evening. Equipment problems are a constant issue. Management may or may not deal with problems on the front end. Coworkers will sometimes support each other but not reliably.
bad,"The day starts with unloading the truck of goods. That would be much more pleasant if management was more understanding of limited crew members, space in the backroom, or compassionate. You are ran dry and ran hard throughout the entire shift."
bad,Some of the management are good but the corporate does not care about employees anymore. they are not giving enough hours to live off anymore. They are are not letting managers schedule enough hours to do the required jobs anymore.
bad,If you want to work here it’s good as a first job but do not expect advancement or much of anything good to come out of it especially if you are a part timer. The only thing that’s good is the starting pay.
bad,"Hard to get started, the customers are hostile if you are a Cashier, and hard to work with. However, if you have the guts to get yelled at at every corner, its worth it."
bad,The CSMs are very unprofessional. They will talk behind your back for ANY little thing. I’ve gone home and cried from the mistreatment. I am in the process of looking into a better opportunity.
bad,"Start the day at 3:30pm and stayed very busy til 8pm when it. started to slow down. It was fine when all 3 of us were working together as team players but it was stressful since we had one person that was not a team player, half of the time we had to carry her load, while she was on her 30/40 minute break or not at work. There was a lot of favoritism. Managers never did anything about it, they only cared about production. I enjoyed my job but the hardest part was not enough help, and still expected to meet production."
bad,"The management here is terrible, you never know if you're going to have enough hours a week to pay bills. The other workers in general are nice. They usually do not promote people to full time. The only people who become managers are those who won popularity contests. The worst part of the job is the customers though. They look down on you and belittle you constantly. Every now and then you will have a ray of sunshine who has been where you are. The best part was how fast the hours go by on busy days (usually beginning of month). Sometimes they will provide lunch for you especially around holidays. I would not recommend working here if you can avoid it."
bad,Turnover has been high in my area. Upper management refuses to increase number of employees to better serve customers and reduce stress on current employees. No overtime and ever increasing work load. Communication is difficult because managers are often stretched to thin. Are encouraged to say yes to visiting management but not given an opportunity to have a real conversation with them about your concerns. Love my hardworking co-workers and customers and in store managers but I have to find another job before the stress kills me.
bad,"Working for Wal-Mart I was extremely dissatisfied with the management.  I was constantly getting called in, and the manager had no idea on how to create a simple schedule also there were times were the manager would slack off and play with a drone behind the store. Between the lack of a consistent schedule and low pay I decided to look for employment elsewhere."
bad,Walmart could be a great place to start a career. but they are really tough on their workers. It presents itself like a easy place to work. But its super stressful. And there is like zero tolernce for anything but work. no talking no leaving your area.
bad,"As a general overview, working in the Electronics Department at Walmart was decent enough. Given that we were in the back of the store, traffic was not as chaotic as the rest of the store (especially the front), and my coworkers and I did have to be knowledgeable about the technology and products we were selling. "
bad,The hours are good. Even if you're part-time you can work 32-40 hours. Solid job for extra money or for college students. The only thing I would say is that management can be better. Expectations are unrealistic.
bad,"Wasn't my cup of tea, managers always giving unwanted/unneeded pep talks, we weren't getting any hours when I was there, everyday they were asking us to volunteer to go home because there wasn't enough work, & random drug test were too big of a thing."
bad,not a very good job they were always taking away your hours.  The customers were enjoyable. Management were always telling you one thing then you did it and someone else would tell you different.
bad,"The store I currently work for has a staff that is constantly changing . Open door is not used as often as it should be in fear of retaliation. Communication is not guaranteed among management and associates. Communication is not Guaranteed between management and management. For a company whose employees need to work together to be successful,  it feels like there are many cliques and many people not held accountable for their actions. There are many good department manager that are fed up with the whole system and are wanting to walk,the only reason they don’t walk is because they need a paycheck."
bad,"I feel I should have recieved more compensation for my position. I only believe this because I myself had to work 4 different departments at the same time without help most of the time. Other than that, i still enjoyed my job and loved working there. Relaxed work environment while still being able to pick up the pace a lot of the time and accomplish a goal"
bad,"Lack of advancement chances due to favorites and company politics. Lack of compensation for doing more than what your job entails. Lack of intelligence per job requirement by management. Poorly trained management including the store manager. If you don't sleep with someone in upper management or are a favorite, you will not be promoted."
bad,Wal-Mart is a place where you can work in a area and be great in but sometimes it is a very stressful job. Not coming from the customer but the employess and employer.
bad,The people at Walmart are very nice but the management is very poor. They think they can just do anything to anybody. They also think that they are better than you and there not.
bad,Walmart is a pretty cool company to work for and they really care about their employees it really depends on the location of the store. The Wal-mart I was located at unfortunately was not a very great location. They were severely under staffed and most of the daytime-evening employees just walked around doing what they wanted most of the time. Customers complained a lot and we never really had the items that they were looking for or was suppose to be in stock. The overnight crew didn't really have those problems but was still very under staffed so we had to speed through our assigned departments be sent to 2-3 different departments just to make sure all the stocking was complete it was kind of stressful. But like I said other than the location I was at Walmart is a great company and hey you get a hour lunch so thats cool.
bad,"it was a pretty stressful job customers would be attacking you left and right in the electronics department"
bad,"It isnt the place for someone to work unless you have already worked with the company for over 5 years. The benefits are awesome, health, dental, and vision, stock options, 401k. Not much room for advancement within the company although this can vary from  store to store."
bad,"My sentence at Walmart is short and sweet, at my current location the teamwork could improve. You do get a full hour for lunch, and breaks are when you remember to take them. They pay alright for my level and it is a good starting job or part-time position for College kids."
bad,"Worked at Walmart as a Loss Prevention Associate and some locations management was good to work with but for the most part management was to intrusive, and always attempted to micromanage Loss Prevention Associates and they do not understand to job whatsoever. Also there is a huge lack of communication and due to this it is a very disorginised place to work at. Now I don't mean every Walmart will be this way but the locations I worked at in Calgary were definitely awful to work for!!! I would not recommend it especially now that the policy changed to no handcuffs for Loss Prevention yet they still push for arrests but most times Loss Prevention Associates work alone so due to working alone with barely any back up from management and no way to protect yourself or enforce the law it has become unsafe and impossible to properly do the job properly."
bad,"I was promised many things, such as, shorter work weeks, room for quick advancement, day shifts, and low stress workplace. none of these promises were to be followed through with."
bad,"It’s a joke. Atleast, the one I worked at, Trainyards. Management never communicates, therefore, if you make any mistake (or even if anyone ahead if you does) it falls on your back (because they never told you the right way to do things). I was a cashier and when I started, they gave me 30 minutes of training and put me on cash. A really cheap company, therefore, goodluck being fulltime or getting more hours than you originally receive. 10% discount along with that."
bad,"It’s a good first job, but only if you’re not looking to move up. They like to cut hours, and not give promised promotions to the people who deserve them."
bad,"I came in put my things in my locker, then put on my smock and came out to the sales floor to work. I went to my department. If my Department manager was there she would tell me what was going on and what I needed to do. Or what needed to be done. I showed the jewelry to customers cashed them out. stocked shelves. scan items to make sure they are the right price. Set mods. Do price changes. The managers don't really care about your home life. they care about the money that comes in. They don't believe in family comes first. the hardest thing about working there is that you don't stay in your own department because they pull you from department to department. Because they never have the right number of workers in each department. So they pull you to go to another department. The most enjoyable thing I liked working there is meeting the people. I am a sociable person and I love meeting people"
bad,"Walmart pays great! There are some amazing people that work at Walmart, but the management is so unbelievably horrible. The management teams belittle their associates, they play favorites, if they don't like you they will do everything they can to get you to quit or find anything to write you up. It's quite unprofessional. Now, don't get me wrong there are some amazing managers out there. But about 95% of them are just plain unprofessional and straight up disrespectful. They expect the way too much sometimes, YOU CAN'T EXPECT 6 PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO UNLOAD AND WORK 2 TRUCKS WORTH OF FREIGHT!!!!!!You could call ethics all you want, go to corporate, go to your market managers... NOTHING will happen. No one cares... not one bit... and it makes me really sad because I truly loved my roll at Walmart and I loved my department and my co-workers... But the management team just pushed me so much, I had to leave. It's not just what would happen to me that would make me angry, it's what I've seen with other employees, how I've seen them treat other people, and how I've heard them talk bad about their associates. Now with all that being said, I learned a lot at Walmart. I learned how to stack a pallet correctly, I would throw freight, bin freight, organize shelves, help customers, I would help back up cashier, I had to learn the HIPPA rules and regulations, I learned so much. The people you meet at Walmart are probably some of the best (or worst) people ever. Theres quarterly bonuses you can receive and if the bonuses are fairly good, Walmart will do something fun for the associates, for"
bad,As a Cap2 associate it is our job to unload an stock the whole store so it is ready. Walmart is a good place to start working if you are in need of a job. It is easy to learn with the right training.
bad,"The management would give more tasks than could be preformed even being a highly productive worker. I enjoyed cake decorating but even when i was overbooked they would still take cake orders and expect me to stay late to make sure they were all completed. I was the primary decorator and would have to remake the majority of the cakes the secondary decorator made. It would take me 1/3 the time to decorate than the other decorator and we were still paid the same. While in the middle of one task they would have me stop to work on something else which would put the orders behind schedule. In the beginning the staff/management was very nice and helpful but after a few months the politics of favortism would set in and you could see who would not have to do as much work or get away with doing less and others would have to pick up there slack and were reprimanded when tasks were not complete. the work done was not appreciated and when a customer would leave compliments with management on an employees work, the compliment would not be relayed to the employee because ""they know they do a nice job already"". I feel a little praise can go a long way."
bad,walmart is an okay job. i’m guessing it all depends who your managers are. the managers at 3654 don’t know how to appreciate their associates. they expect one person to do a job that needs many and that’s not how it should be. associates feel under appreciated and hate how the managers manage.
bad,"Provided excellent customer service to customers while answering technical support questions regarding various electronic equipment such as cellular devices, computers, television, electronic accessories, and gaming devices"
bad,"work in frezzer for 20 mins to get doughnut,do doughnuts ,fill case, clean in middle of cleaning move pallets work pallets fill floor, clean back room,slice meats , slice cheese, make salads, go back to freezer fix it, cover some one else shift forget to take a lunch, cover another go to lunch last minute, go back to freezer break down another pallet then stay late to break three more pallets but of your supplies go home"
bad,"Two many chiefs & Not enough Indians,Communication very Poor,Always changing things for no reason,Dictatorship in so many ways. Very stressful & cliquey"
bad,"Always short staffed. Too much work given to employees unachievable standards. Crossed trained in every area of the store, because of lazy management."
bad,"Very fast pace. High demand,  I enjoyed my job with Wal-Mart outside of the lack of support from my management team. And it really hurts that my store went from night stocking to a day stocking store.  And everyone that transition from night to day to a pay cut and my hours where cut. Plus took my family time away"
bad,"While I took the job knowing the hours (4am-1pm) and they were convenient for me as I have been taking care of my mother while she recovered from a stroke and broken arm, those are not ideal hours for me. My immediate supervisors are excellent but their hands seem to be tied in dealing with poor employees. There are too many call-outs on a regular basis which leaves other employees overworked and stressed."
bad,"Generally demanding responsibility, many conflicting job assignments and instructions by multiple supervisors. Many times staff Mgt not on same page. "
bad,"I was excited to work at Walmart, then when I started to get comfortable everyone started to act ""different"" somebody in Personnel was ALWAYS disrespectful and rude, the CSM (customer service manager) are rude and never come to help when you need it especially when you are helping with a customer they will literally take their time to come whenever to help you.."
bad,Walmart can really make it big in the retail world if only they get their business and tech strategy straight. The current saga after Jet.com acquisition is going on for the last 30 months and still the leadership doesnt have any clarity on how to run the show.
bad,"Only work at a walmart if you absolutely have to. The pay honestly wasn't worth the environment I was working in, and I wouldn't want that kind of stress on anyone."
bad,"Managment makes or breaks a job. I have worked with two different Walmart's over my career path. I was absolutely spoiled with the first. The management was amazing we had a few bumps in the road every once in a while but that's normal. The job wasn't easy but not having that added stress of poor management made work life enjoyable. However when I moved states and started working at this different Walmart, work life became intolerable. Managment is very poor, has lots of favorites, exploits the associates that aren't their favorites and pits everyone against each other. It has been extremely miserable for the last almost two years. Basically it's a 50/50 chance if you will be blessed with amazing management or stuck in a bad situation."
bad,every day would find a jack in the freezer. their monkeys.management was vs each other so nothing ever went smooth or got done from shift to shift. almost like shift warfare.
bad,"Management was an overkill. There was manager for you managers! And with so many people telling you what to do, pulling you in one direction, It very quickly became a stressful job"
bad,"Was nice working with associates, dept mangers were a problem. Never worked with people so disrespectful.Lots of poverty people with major home issues. Still could more respectable."
bad,"I enjoyed my co-workers, and most managers, but the store managers care little about their employees.  I worked for a long time at this company and was qualified for advancement for several years, but every time a higher position came up I was passed over for someone less qualified, and I wound up doing their job for them."
bad,"The managers and upper staff were very difficult to work with. They favoured certain employees which made it hard for others! Also, they give manager positions to people who have no clue what they’re doing!"
bad,"It's alright for a good part time job. But if you want to full time all departments don't accommodate you. Can get crazy, sometimes. I like as an employee you can get discounts. Some of their merchandise is nice, especially electronics."
bad,"Just not the greatest place to work at all. The cashiers are friendly, but the managers act like they don’t know what they are doing and half the time a cashier is doing a CSM’s job. And a cashier shouldn’t have to wait 3 hours on money to be put in their drawer and seeing the “CSM” walk by a thousand times."
bad,"Not flexible, no raises, no promotions, not treated properly. I walked out of the job. Management did not listen to my requests for what hours. Got in trouble for being in the hospital, basically a terrible place to work."
bad,i would never work at walmart again. some of the bosses are mean and only care about them selfs and money. need to get head out of but and start caring more
bad,"I worked here years ago so it may be different, but when i was there it was pretty fast paced and spread workers kinda thin. I got like borderline 30 hours doing part time which was kinda a bit much for me at the time, but also gave me a better looking paycheck"
bad,"Lack of equipment to perform expected job and productivity."
bad,No team work management dosent work with you not a family friendly place to work.some management only cares for themselves.they let go of older folks that are about to retire
bad,I would not recommend working at Walmart because of the personal treatment and the management is not good. They offer good benefits and paid time off but getting approved for days off is almost impossible.
bad,"As a cashier customers aren't always right and everyone have different personalities you don't have to smile all the time to have a good day (smize), standing long periods of time and the enjoyment of the job was the customers"
bad,If you get hired here your job depends on how well you can schmooze with management if you are hard worker then that’s all you do if you slack you get to work up the ladder
bad,it depends on what you are applying for cashier you are timed how many scans per min. Stocking shelves there are plan o grams for every shelf in the store you have to follow it to the T. If you have a dr note and miss work that is still a point and you have more than 5 points they terminate you. The scheduling is done by the home office a store manger does not do the scheduling they do not check your availability they really dont care. Being a door greeter dont be surprise that you will miss your lunch 2 hrs later or you will get it with then 3 hrs after you have been there the CSMS don't know how to run a front end sometimes. (Customer Service Managers) and yes there is more than just one.
bad,"Wal -Mart is a good place to work if you want to get money. However, the job itself is not even worth it. Constantly on you, if you are not meeting production numbers. We have twenty-minute breaks from where you go on break and it starts at that time. I was one minute late one day, gave me a write up for it."
bad,Wal mart was a fine place to work as my first job. but relatively poor pay rate and no hours flexibility leaves a lot to be desired. management wasn't very effective
bad,"Cleaning ringing items, talking to customers and interacting with them, bagging items up, stocking area, putting item back on staves,and listen to customers as they talk and I ring up things"
bad,"Day to day operations reveal that the actual core beliefs (respect for the individual, striving for excellence, acting with integrity) are no where to be found.  Instead, like alot of other large companies, the mantra is do MORE with less - that is, less hours, less staff.  As a result neither customers, nor associates are happy.  The difference being that unhappy customers have other shopping options.  Perhaps the most effective method for checking the pulse of any retail establishment is to ask an associate for help.  An associate that is overwhelmed with tasks will often resent the interruption of task number 65 of 100.  Is it right?  Absolutely not.  However, like many other companies, the effort to bring profits to the shareholders often out weighs the logical necessity to staff according to the needs of the customer."
bad,"Associates are being treated poorly, and people are too scared to speak up about it. Management is shady and act terribly behind Store Manager's back."
bad,I really do not have anything to say about the company or how they continue to do business. The company is a success and always hiring a workforce to continue to grow.
bad,"This is a place that says they respect the individual, but on occasion, they prove they don't walk the walk even though they talk the talk. If you can survive 3 months, you'll get a discount card for 10% off your purchases there and at the in-store McDonalds."
bad,"You meet great people and become a part of a very big family, very family oriented learned a lot about managing a department. Was in charge of 3 departments."
bad,The management made most of me and my team work less efficiently and instead of taking ideas shot most of them down. It gets frustrating when you try to work hard but just get shot down.
bad,"Always looking for ways to cut costs and get more done, even at the expense of employees, then wonder why they have such high turnover. I was rarely staffed properly (they never hired enough) and then wonder why things never got finished."
bad,Para quem está começando e for primeiro emprego vale a pena o aprendizado.
bad,"Fast-pace, no talking,  the raises at Walmart was horrible, Managers had there favorite on who got a promotion and who did not, different culture like that. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy boxes."
bad,Enjoyed working at Wal-mart as far as doing my job. Did not care for managerial style. Did not like the non-flexible work time. Reason for leaving is they started requiring employees in my department to be at work by 4:00 A.M.
bad,"Walmart was overall stressful, I didn't enjoy my time whatsoever at the location i was at. The managers seemed to never do their jobs correctly. I also experienced bullying and harassment from another employee. I was looking for a job that had decent benefits and that was a nice work place and that isn't something I'd recommend to anyone."
bad,This job is very stressful and management is always trying to involve personal life with work life. Seriously understaffed and management expects us to do more than we can do. Won’t let us finish our work before they switch our tasks
bad,Wal-Mart was an ok job that provided comparable wages. The job duties were we'll defined and explained. Job training for my position was inconsistent and no continuing education.
bad,"I cannot speak for all WalMart's but the one I worked for was rather rough on me. This could very well be because it was my first job, but I found myself so tired that when I got home I would sleep until my next shift and it felt as if I had no real time to myself. "
bad,Overall great coworkers who are willing to teach you if you don't understand something but if you are part time the hours are not great and sometimes management is not understanding.
bad,It can be frustrating balancing workload and providing customer service. Ability to work in all areas of the sales floor is required. I rarely feel fulfilled in my job.
bad,"Highly stressful and never enough help. Not given enough time to complete your own tasks, let alone making up for call ins, vacations, or just being understaffed. Plan on working 12 hour days to get your tasks completed."
bad,"The company itself has been improving with the raises and added benefits. The biggest issue I have is with the management. I have worked at three different locations over the 10 years. The first location I moved because of the horrible management. Now, I'm at my third location and is looking for a different postition outside of the company because of poor management once again."
bad,"Managers were not on the same page and did not enforce company policies throughput the store, They showed favoritism and did not give credit when the team did well."
bad,"It was an okay place to work the managements was good they were helpful it was a clean place to work, the hardest part of the job was nothing it wasn't really anything hard about it, the most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers smile and cheering them up"
bad,They only care about the bottom dollar.. no longer about their employees.. and even worse they dont care about the customers. its become so sad.. the company used to be a great place to work for.
bad,Sometimes you find yourself picking up the slack off your coworkers. And the customers try to get over a lot of the time. You will meet great people there.
bad,"The job was easy, but the lack of management in the place is huge."
bad,"Unloading trucks, stocking shelves with groceries, paper products, cleaning products, and pet supplies. Cleaning the stock room and throwing away all trash from the day."
bad,"Great Customers if you are willing to communicate to them."
bad,Had fun but the management moved around too much. Also had lots of complications with set hours. Not a place to stay your whole life. I don't recommend as a job. Also having a 103 fever means nothing but get back to work.
bad,Don’t have much good to say about this job to be honest. It’s Walmart so you get what you expect. Management is pretty poor and tend to show favoritism at times.
bad,"At times, the work day was good but other days it got too stressful that I didn't even want to be there. People were hypocritical, except for a slight few. Some Managers excelled at their job while others were not."
bad,"Very stressful, the manager makes you zone once you've done all your work even though you were hired to stock. The aisles are almost always disorganized with stuff in them that doesn't belong anywhere near it."
bad,"Good place work until you get on someone's bad side. Management is fair, schedules are good. Most people are friendly and are a pleasure to work with. I miss my job"
bad,Debo decir que el salario no es muy competitivo por el trabajo que haces.
bad,"It's a minimum wage job in retail, for a store that has a high burn out rate. If you're willing to put in lots of hours but stay as a part timer, they'll likely keep you around. it's a lot of hours on your feet, you're going to wear out your shoes. Get a good pair of insoles. "
bad,its what you would expect if you've ever worked retail. except its a little worse. wal mart is going to make money regardless... so they don't really care.
bad,"A typical day starts out by setting up the salad case, starting rotisserie chicken, and fried foods. The day continues by waiting on customers with slicing meats and cheeses to order. Other duties include maintaining sanitary conditions by keeping slicers cleans, washing dishes, making salads and sandwiches "
bad,"Working at Walmart was okay. I want to move on to bigger and better. However, it was an opportunity and it was greatly appreciated. Management agreed to work with me due to being in college and etc, but didn't quite do so. Moreover, it's okay and I still am grateful."
bad,A very difficult place to work. You must ditch your own ethics and morals and adhere to only their ways. Physically demanding even for management. Only the good old boys move up or get recognized in management.
bad,You still can't afford to live with the starting pay rate they offer now. Not enough help on the sales floor during busy times. Some employees abuse their lunch breaks by taking more time they are not allowed. Some lazy workers that don't care about their work so they do it half way and don't finish it properly within their shift time.
bad,I had to call a few times for family health issues management was not very supportive all though I had proof showing my where abouts. I loved my job i loved my co workers most of all I loved that it was fast paced and a challenge the job over all was great management on the other hand not so great.
bad,"Management only cares about results. They don't even bother to check and see how it is going. They only check the next day to see if its done. You do accrue PTO on an hourly basis. Calling out is easy, maybe too easy, and the attendance policy is rather lenient if unforgiving."
bad,"Inexperienced management. High turnover rate. Management team has no communication. They are not there for the customer in my opinion, they are there solely for a paycheck. I believe that when you work for a company, yes the money is important. But when it comes to the customers they are our boss. They are the reason we have a job and families to provide for. If you fail your customers you've failed your responsiblity."
bad,Walmart claimed to offer more than they actually provided. constantly kept your working hours just under full time so they could maximize your working time with out having to provide benefits.
bad,"At my walmart, the typical day included doing carts that the closer from last night never got to. (when I close, I always got everything done) and a bin of Organics that needed to be done, maybe a milk crate or two to be taken out. The longer I worked here, new associates come in to work, and they disappear during truck time, or anytime they have something to do. in my store, the Frozen/Dairy department was left up to me."
bad,"My favorite part of the job was working with my associates and helping my customers.  I started off pushing carts for the company and worked my way into a salary member of management position.  I learned a vast array of skills such as; Inventory and in stock control, PNL analysis and associate scheduling."
bad,Walmart is not a bad place to work. The only problem is  Walmart management team. Favoritism and bullying by the managers. The turnover is too high at Walmart.
bad,"Working at walmart was very stressful working overnight because there was a lot of work to do,  with lack of employees, and not a lot of time to do said work."
bad,"Management is absolutely horrendous. I've never met a group of more incompetent people except a select few. You can get promoted most times but that's if you're a brown noser, and walk all over other people to get ahead."
bad,"Show up to work clock in head to your department and clean up after customers all day. Answer any questions customers may have help them find products. This is a standard job i would suggest for anyone looking for part time work. "
bad,"I went above and beyond at Walmart to see that things were done correctly. I stayed over if needed to fill customers orders when I was in Dotcom, I did alot of things not in my job description just to support Walmart and the customer."
bad,"Project management were rude and aggressive, with zero appreciation for any of the employees. Started multiple days of the project with direct threats to fire the entire crew. Was yelled at multiple times for refusing to work outside of scheduled hours with no overtime pay. Project management actively cultivated a sense of competition between employees for an unknown amount of potential hires at the end of the project. Insufficient accomodations for disabled members of crew. Homophobic and racial slurs were used by most crew members. Project management changed supervisors about once every two weeks. Didn't find out who would be hired on full time until the last day of the project."
bad,I loved working in the pharmacy but the space was kinda of small. Was on site computer available for CEC’s. Manager was very helpful with scheduling flexibility.
bad,If you plan on advancing your career at a young age walmart is the place for you. Management doesn't really help out much they expect you to do everything or ignore you. They are sort of selfish.
bad,"The two jobs I worked at Walmart were both faced with the same issues, inept management staff that caused undue stress on me and my coworkers. Its a place where ""who you know"" is the only way to advance or make anything beyond grunt level"
bad,"I`m not hard to please, the managed of my stocking area was poor, the night stock teams management was poor, the job itself was alright just the lack of decent managers made it was harder than it needed to be."
bad,"Wal-Mart is a great place to work if you absolutely need a job, otherwise try to find something better. Profit and a lax culture comes before hardworking employees."
bad,"Walmart distribution center can be very physically demanding and is not for women. Women must be able to carry heavy freight up to 50lbs. Also, there is no room for advancement."
bad,"didn't enjoy this job a lot..."
bad,"I enjoy my work at Walmart. Love my co-workers. I like the atmosphere there. The company has adopted a new way of doing the schedule and my hours are continually being cut, thats the only thing I dont really like about my job."
bad,"They pay well but will not respect the hours you want. I told them I could work 32 hours tops and was regularly scheduled 40 as well as asked to stay for overtime occasionally. My schedule was all over the place and sometimes had me working until 10pm (when electronics closed) then come in again at 7am the next day (when electronics opens). Which would have been had I driven to work, but I took the bus which was an hour and a half commute to work and from work. The management very rarely listened to any complaints I ever had and very rarely took me seriously. "
bad,Walmart is some what friendly. They can do better with  their hours and be more consistent. I don't like the fact that our discounts are only 10% and we can't even use it on everything in the store.
bad,Walmart for some reason schedules the most people at the least busy times. It would be a decent job if you could get them to hire you full time. For some reason they do not like to.
bad,Wall mart management pays well but your work life balance will suffer. I also wasn't a fan of how they treated there regular employees. If you are into working 60 hours plus a week on salary then this job just might be for you
bad,Helps you get by at least. Managers need to be a little more helpful. Pretty easy and get it pretty fast. Just a little stressful when youre alone. Okay
bad,"I've been a Walmart associate a few times over the past 18 years now, and these last 2 times have probably been the worst experiences I have ever had. Lack of training, absent management, temp associates watching Netflix instead of working but nothing being done about it, as well as signing a 1 year contract and being able to be let go just whenever (last time was 2 weeks after start date after working 12 hour shifts over the Holidays) Not a company I want to be a part of anymore."
bad,"An ok job to have for a person in school who need flexible hours, its low paying but can be fun, sometimes hectic but overall its a job and better than no job."
bad,"Working as a cashier is challenging because no two people are alike. Some days are better than others, but public relations is more valued than respect."
bad,"My Walmart location, while giving fair treatment in regards to breaks and behaviour toward associates also, lacks career advancement opportunities.The corporation also represents the lowest standards for schedule management, flexibility in personal benefits, and next to no consideration for consistency or postition/hour security."
bad,"Overall, my experience was good working there, until I transferred to another location. Management was poor there, with the exception of 2 assistant managers and 2 Support Managers. Management weren't knowledgeable of running a successful store. I can honestly say, that I knew more about merchandising and running certain departments more than the assistants. I was held to the ""high expectations"" of fixing what I've fixed over and over again, again.Most of the associates were young and immature, so they walked around on their cell phones while the few of us (hard workers) did our job. Management also show favoritism. The store struggled to get on process, because of inconsistency. Probably still struggling."
bad,"They have the wrong people in management. The people they have in management are unwilling to listen and communicate with their employees and show little respect to them. They also will require you to do things outside of your job code and if you tell them no for any reason you can be coached about it. It's also really hard to get time off and you generally have to talk to your manager after having it previously denied in order to get the days off. "
bad,"I started out on nights . But no matter how long I was there , or how many jobs I applied for I could never move into a day shift, or a better position.I felt stuck."
bad,"A typical day at work, a good day was worked with the floor manager in woman appearal.She so organize and clear.I learned alot from her it was such a wonderful person to learn from."
bad,"When I saw that management was stealing, I reported it immediately. I could not work for a company with no morals. So I quit and worked  for Prestige marketing until the business closed."
bad,la job d'entrepot est vraiment dégeulace. Ce n'était vraiment pas plaisant.
bad,"I worked as a Tire Lube Express Technician. We would do oil changes and change/repair tires. When no cars  pulled in, you are responsible for stocking the department, answering customer questions within the department, and ring customers up."
bad,Not the worst place to be working by far but not the best. Management was slow to respond. Always had the parts and tools we needed. The fact that there was always some sort of management training to do was rather annoying. but was still a fun shop.
bad,This place was ok to work with for a start. I had no plans to stay there. It was not all the time a happy place as the managers just walked around while you're doing your work. Little help and not really pay attention to your concerns. Pay was bad too.
bad,Schedule was very good worked three days off four days to spend time with family and friends. The salary was decent I feel like the management did not support as much as they should
bad,If you aren't friends with managers at Walmart there is a good chance you won't move up at all. Okay work culture. As an associate you do way beyond your job and end up doing work above your paygrade.
bad,I learned how to restocked and put stuff away the right way. Some managers are helpful and some are very rude. I know how to helpful in every way and always listen.
bad,Walmart gave me an opportunity to grow as a manager to a level that I now feel comfortable being a manager anywhere I chose. It also enhanced my people skills where I now find speaking and communicating to others very well.
bad,"They put people in store manager roles that  have no clue what they are doing, they also have a culture where are you are completely guilty of anything they say unless you can prove otherwise"
bad,"The first thing one will likely notice when they start at Walmart is how many people have been with the company for years, even decades.  The company was founded on a few solid premises that they'll drill into you during orientation that lets you see why.  The company was founded on caring about their employees and their customers.  These days, however, employees are mostly ignored and marginalized while the customers can practically steal anything on the shelves."
bad,"Depending on the area you work its very stressful and unorganized. Management doesnt know what they are doing, and none know how to run all positions."
bad,"If you were overly kind to management, they treated you better than individuals that did their job correctly. People were wrongly coached or written up based on false statements."
bad,"Customers were rude, and we weren't allowed to change your hours even if you had school you needed to be at. Immediately denied and said the computers made schedules."
bad,"Walmart is a good company to work for, but you have to work with the right people to enjoy the job. I've learned how to work in multiple departments besides my own, and know how to do other jobs in the store well."
bad,"The assistant managers here are great and there are a lot of great associates. Unfortunately due to work in excesses of 60+ hours a week working 7 days without a day off. And some moral disagreements I had with the store manager, I felt it was time to find a new place to work"
bad,"não tenho como aváliar,ja tem anos que trabalhei la"
bad,"Started out alright. After 3 different GMs with 3 different ideas of how operations should work the job became a bit ridiculous. "
bad,"At the location I worked was horrible. I was hired as a tech. This location knew, I was new to the field with no experience. This location was apparently short staffed and to top it off one of the pharmacists there was so rude always yelling at me infront of other employees and customers."
bad,"Many people complained about how the management never did anything to improve the work environment.  many older people have issues with management because they don't take their limited mobility seriously.  "
bad,"good co-workers, though understaffed. An interesting place to work for what it is. It does provide an income that allows survival though that is about all."
bad,"So I started as a regular cashier, then moved to the money services desk, and I am now currently a customer service manager. One thing I am entirely grateful for is how to use a ton of technology specifically machines that had to deal with counting/balancing money or cash drawers. Unfortunately the problem with walmart is that we are understaffed almost everyday. Its definitely a fast paced job but i enjoyed that part of working and most of management was great. If there was just one thing I could change it would just be how many people were working in a day. I have literally been left with two cashiers on a busy Friday evening."
bad,management is downright disrespectful no matter what circumstances. it's just how you take it. management doesn't know how to speak to the workers. they are just about them selves
bad,"Other than the fact you could get a write up for any over time, no benefits and the way was horrible and the employees were always just as bitter. The environment was terrible."
bad,Walmart's Store manager was amazing. Most of the managers below him lack empathy. Walmart would be a great place to work if we had better managers in place.
bad,"Management does not seem to car about their lower employees and is hard to nail down in order to fix issues. A daily occurrence is the lack of cleaning solution, paper towels, bags, and over all empathy from managers. However, my fellow co-workers are fantastic as long as you skirt around the drama."
bad,My time here at Walmart did start off great. I did like coming to work but throughout time throughout different managers and different positions are going to realize that Walmart is not for me and not something that I want to do for the rest of my life.
bad,"The job itself wasn't horrible, but the management staff was not the greatest could use many improvements. They are very unorganized and handle things poorly."
bad,"No pagan horas extras perdí muchos años en esa empresa en ocaciones no puedes ni comer, nunca llega tu nombramiento pero trabajas en ese puesto trabajas de lunes a domingo y casi nunca estas con tu familia"
bad,"It was busy, underpaid, and the management really didn't care much about the employees aside from resources. But it was hourly in a job that anybody could do, so I understand why the pay was so low"
bad,"It can be busy or slow depends on the day.  I do phones and other task.  I like it when it is busy.  Sometimes it is slow.  I have learned to multi-task, deal with customers and co-workers, how to have professionalism.  I think it is all over the place.  I  think it has the same flaws as most work places.  Not having enough help to wait on customers.  I have fun with the people I work with so sometimes we are laughing"
bad,Gostei muito de trabalhar porém não me deram justificativa na demissão
bad,Salaried management focuses more on hourly management or other salaried management due to lack of confidence in their own abilities that they fear they will be replaced or passed over in seniority.
bad,The job was not difficult and should not have been stressful but management did not treat employees as they should. One person in management in particular was a bully and had me second guessing everything I did. The hire up management believed everything that manager said and did not care to pay attention to how the associates were treated.
bad,"On a typical day I would walk 5-7 miles."
bad,I was picked on called out taken advantage of by memebers of management. Because i was not very social with many i was looked at as a perosn who has no respect.
bad,"The wages are not fair. Holiday pay is a thing of the past. There are no paid holidays. They used to offer raises each year, but now they don't. I loved the people I worked with, but the pay was terrible."
bad,It is very hard to work in an environment where your fellow associates like to sabotage your work and management does not do anything about it when it is brought to their attention.
bad,Management changes turned into a lot of stress and employee turnover. In a company as big as Walmart structural changes happen ofter with translated to chaos and low morale in my store in particular.
bad,"Working here was nice at first until I got the worst manager. I would have kept working here because it is a nice job and the majority of people were nice, but the management is very unprofessional."
bad,"My typical day at work would be marking plants down and providing customer service and covering different lunches for various employees until about 5pm. After 5pm i am required to clean up Walmart and we call that ""zoning"". So depending on what time of the day i would have different managers."
bad,Walmart management team is whats lacking with this company. This is what usually frustrates employees the most. Alot of rules get broken and no one takes action.
bad,Granted it is not a tasking job but it would be nice to have had official training on what they expected out of your work and how to do your work instead of relying on coworkers passing on their bad habits or zero of the employees knowing how to do certain items.
bad,"it was a nice place to work and I was appreciative of the opportunity to work for Wal-Mart. People were nice and the work pace was fast, yet it was a great place for a short time."
bad,"The title says it all."
bad,"My Walmart store itself was a very good work environment, but as a company itself it is a different story.  Management and employees were forced to do the work of multiple people and reprimanded if it wasn't done.  They provided quarterly ""bonuses"" to employees if their store met certain criteria.  The problem with these bonuses is that they forced store management to cut employees hours at the same time they were receiving them.  Therefore the bonuses received equaled out to their typical paychecks.  Short staffing forced employees to deal with constant belittlement from customers as to why more registers weren't open and why they had no one to help them."
bad,"I worked for walmart for almost 9 years. I Worked many positions during that time. This job was perfect during the time I went to school as they were willing to work around my school schedule. I learned customer service, how to properly dispose of defective merchandise and how to deal with problematic customers. The work place culture was very diverse. The hardest part of my job is that they were not very understanding when work was missed for sick children, funerals or personal illness. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting all kinds of people."
bad,"When you have management that treats you like you are worthless there is absolutely no chance in enjoying your job.  As an associate at the Glenpool, OK Walmart my manager cursed at me and treated me as though I was insignificant. I am not a lazy person like some employees tend to be. So, for the diligent worker to be the one to be treated like trash I was not having it. So that is my reason for leaving Walmart."
bad,"This place started out great! However, once certain people became advanced in the company things started to shift. Associate became managers due to  favoritism. They lie about advancement only to give it to someone who doesn’t deserve it!"
bad,"The management and the people wore lazy. And it made life at work there not work, If you like to not do anything and not like to work than thats the place to go."
bad,"work and answer customer request"
bad,a lot of work load is usually put on one person
bad,"They always need cashiers because no one wants to do it.  You never knew how busy it would be, so it was boring at times.  I only learned how to use a register.  Management was not as kind as they could have been."
bad,"other workers were lazy, took breaks whenever they wanted management had lots of favoritism, inconsistent hours...low pay. Dirty facilities, old equipment"
bad,Largest retailer in the world that provides job security for hourly associates but not salaried management.  Constantly changing job discriptions and roles along with scheduling.  Ever rotating schedules for salaried management combined with expected 10+ hours each working day results in no healthy work life balance.  Family oriented indiividuals will not find this job to be desirable.  Single individuals with no outside of work life style would be most susceptible to this form of career.
bad,"The people who work at walmart are great. The issues are more focused on company policies. Managers are so inconsistent that you can expect to have a new manager literally every six months at a minimum. Every time you get a new manager they have different experience and qualifications and they all come with their own ideas about how things should be done. This is an issue because as soon as you have mastered the last managers routine you get a new one. This is also complicated by the fact that every single year at walmart there are new policies and procedures (CAP, Top Stock, Meat CAP, etc). So on top of manager shifts there are company wide shifts to deal with as well. "
bad,working at Walmart was fun in the beginning but working there the management see you for who you parents are and not who you are. They hold grudges agenst you and aren't always there for you. They don't care about your feelings and just worry about themselves.
bad,"It was a good part time job, but not a stable job, sometimes it got slow we were sent home, I'm looking for a full time job, even though it got slow I always tried to find something else to do, like go backs in different departments of the store, or help others, I volunteered extra hours when needed, try to be helpful when the customers needed help."
bad,"Enjoyed working with the Doctor and  patients .  Each day was different, at times you didn’t know what to expect.  Worked well with management on a daily basis.  Sharpened my management skills, learned better time management and how to  delegate  when necessary.  A competitive work place.  Most enjoyed the feeling of helping others with their vision needs, getting to know our repeat  and new patients ."
bad,Wal-Mart is ok for a first job or while going to school. I wouldn't recommend it if you wanted to get further in life.  They lack in training of the employees.  I worked there longer than the manager team was old.
bad,a company such as this should be run better then I saw as an employee. the disrespect that not only the management staff showed but also the fellow employees. I don't know if I could work there again
bad,work was hard and pay was ok. short hours and treated as though you are replaceable. my manager was good but many of them are not. i wouldnt recomend it to many perople
bad,I saw how the management treated the employees. I was in personnel and I got to see first hand how the employees are treated. You are only a number to the company.
bad,Not a lot of support for the regular part time employee. Although they don't tolerate disrespect among each other. I have worked here for 4 years. Job security has never been an issue but my hours always fluctuate.
bad,Working at Walmart can become very stressful at times. I have met some very nice people and gain some close friends. my job is very fast pace so  I have learn how to pace myself to get my job done efficiently.
bad,"A typical day of work required wasted time looking for the supervisors in the huge facility. There were so many customers needing help, it was difficult to get the expected job finished, The facility was understaffed, training was inadequate and instructions were contradictory."
bad,I have worked at Wal-Mart since 1994 and have seen a lot of changes.  the company has helped me transition from a displaced dairy farmer to a valuable asset in a large secure company.
bad,the days just consist of unloading trucks and stocking shelves. However there  are many other positions on the company. management is very distant and almost refused to talk to their employees directly.
bad,I hated the location i worked at only because of the store manager there which is the Charlotte Arboretume location. She was horrible. Every sing worker and manager hated her but corporate wouldn't do anything about it. Other and her it was not a bad job. I would defiantly work at a different location.
bad,I don't have a positive outlook on my time with Walmart. I do not wish to leave a review. I gave enough  information in my other choices and ratings. Thank you.
bad,Make this a starting point for your working life; a chance to grasp the complexity and frustrations of one of the most aggravating forms of employment. It's a good way to appreciate non-retail based employers.
bad,"The department management was always hard working and supportive of employees. But the higher you look up the long chain of management at Walmart, the less they seem to do. If the managers know you by name they'll volunteer you to do jobs aside from your own department while they do seemingly nothing. There is a lot of slack given to those who choose to be lazy and the more hardworking associates are expected to do the work that others don't."
bad,Stressful work environment low staffing and new coworkers are young and don't care about the job. assisting customers in the bakery is very rewarding.
bad,"Wal-Mart overall as a company is great, i enjoy shopping there, there are certain stores that simply aren't the best to work for. Sadly, I learned the hard way."
bad,The pharmacy was a stressful environment to work in but I loved my job.  Specialty division is the only way to go...the main store is not a fun place to be in.
bad,"Management is unwilling or unable to communicate with the employees. Time off requests are approved based on favoritism, there is no room for advancement within the company (even if you get promoted, they force you to work at a different store without any say in where you go, so you get booted to the bad stores that have all of the open positions) and I worked for the company for almost 3 years without any real pay raise. All they ever do is raise the starting pay. I make as much money and get as much time off as someone who joins on tomorrow even though I've been loyal to the company for a few years now. Corporate decisions are questionable at best, and the incredibly high turnover rate (hovering somewhere around 70% company-wide, it's at 118% at my store for the past year, meaning the store loses more employees than it gains) is a huge sign of trouble when most standard retail businesses are looking at a turnover rate of 10%-20%. Most of the employees leave within the first 2 months. By raising the minimum pay, the company has done little more than require more of an investment for training, meaning there is no standing impact on the turnover rate but the company loses more money on the employees turning over (the company pays for all of their training and before the employees can even hit the floor and start working alone, they quit.) These very bad business decisions get thrown out one after the other, and the company seems to go by the idea of ""too big to fail."" Try to express your concerns and you get shot down, their ""open door policy"" is a joke, and not even department"
bad,"Honestly, I did not enjoy my time working there. In the beginning, I did enjoy the hours, people, and customers; but after awhile I noticed some things I did not agree with. The management liked to abuse their power, and treat me like a slave, rather than an employee. Demanding I do something that wasn't in my job description and something they were told to do."
bad,"Sad to say, Walmart is not all it's cracked up to be."
bad,"Some days are stressful but everyone must work as a team, sometimes managers do not know how to separate home from work, balancing work and home because not having a set shift to work, meeting new people everyday is the best part."
bad,O supermercado maxxi do sarandi foi o melhor supermercado que trabalhei.
bad,Good pay poor managment long hours expected overtime random days considered as a holiday such as rock the south Superbowl iron bowl any major Alabama game
bad,Walmart is not known for being a great employer so it shouldn't come as a surprise that my review won't be a shining one. The company culture of Walmart is one of exploitation and borderline employee abuse. The work and jobs are needlessly complicated and stressful. Management is full of people who are no different than school yard bullies. Coworkers are great and are the only consolation of an otherwise intolerable job and work site.
bad,"Empresa boa de trabalhar,mas podem melhorar algumas questões."
bad,"Wal-Mart hires depending on who you know, not what you know. In order to be favored and/or promoted, you have to be either an attractive woman or have to be buddies with management. They do not treat all employees the same, nor do they follow to policies as written. Policies/rules are made up as they see fit. Management will only help you out and be reasonable if they are friends with you. There are many hard workers there, especially with open availability, that get passed over for people that are not hard workers and have closed availability. The reason is because they befriended management. If you keep your head down and don't care about moving up in the company, this job will be for you. Otherwise, ALWAYS cover yourself and try and befriend management (not employees)"
bad,"My experienced at Walmart we're somewhat negative ,do to understaffing and management working under, unsafe conditions. I had no problems when it was properly and safer."
bad,"Great customer service phone representative "
bad,walmart was going to be my career. But recent changes that have come down have made it very difficult to promote. Our associates feel they are working out of fear.
bad,"On the Cap Team 2 we unloaded between 1,000-3,000 piece truck plus a 1,000 piece truck everyday. We were low on staff and management was terrible on scheduling and hiring. The work place was chaos the workers didn't like each other and complained and fought all the time. I learned somewhat of what a factory job would be like. The hardest part was unloading the trucks with few workers, easiest part was stocking the aisle"
bad,"Walmart used to be a great company in my opinion to work for. Many things have changed. There is no typical day at work there. Work life balance can be extremely challenging,"
bad,"I returned to work for Walmart after a 10 year absence. I had worked for them from 10/91-03/06. Back then, Mr Sam Walton felt it to be important to put family first. He then stated that caring for the associates was a top priority as well. Together, the business he created thrived. I returned to find them now open for Thanksgivings and Easter. Family values were now replaced by greed. Benefits for associates gradually disappeared. No longer does family have any value to the upper management and owners in Arkansas."
bad,A typical day at work for me included planning for the incoming freight as well as following up on the execution. My responsibilities included overseeing the day to day operation of the store. The management team that I worked with was filled with passionate people who worked hard every day to help the team be successful. The management team and associates work very hard to make each day both productive and fun. The hardest part of the job was creating a work life balance. The most enjoyable part was helping associates grow to their potential and receive the promotions that they earned.
bad,It was a good experience  working with customers showing them where products were located. Helped organize the shelves and help coworkers when necessary.
bad,"Poor Management, they treat you as you are invisible till they need you to do something. Walmart has changed so much and is not what it use to be. Just not a good place to work."
bad,"They were ok. They a paycheck basically. Yes you can invest in stock and your 401k. The benefits are ok but their leave of absence, intermittent leave plans need a serious update. Their point system aka attendance plan needs to change as well.  You have so many older generations working there. Its hard to keep up with the policies with their health and others. But it would work if your management's favorite. But it is what it is. I would never go back. The job is for persons that are in high school or college. They just raised it after how many years? Treat your employees well and your business will raise."
bad,"This place was horrible. I ended up being terminated while being sick and on bed rest. The job had 3 notes from hospitals and a doctor informing them of my illness. When I went back to work, I was taken off of the schedule without notice."
bad,"As with any job. could be better, could be worse. Not really flexible once you get to full time employment. Not a WHOLE lot of room for creativity if you're that type of person."
bad,"Walmart is a corporate company with limited career advancement opportunities. I wanted to try the loss prevention world again as I had worked in that field before. This is not what I had in mind, they had hard quotas and goals to meet. It seemed there was always something that would hold  you in the same position."
bad,"They don’t care about their employees at all. If you’re too sick to work, they pretty much just say that sucks. If you get sexually harassed, they won’t do anything to the person that harassed you. Instead they might promote them or give them employee of the month."
bad,if your studying to go back to school this is a perfect job but to actually live off this would be very difficult.  also all your money goes directly back to the company since you'll be shopping there for sure
bad,"Walmart é uma empresa que dá oportunidade de trabalhar paga tudo direito mas tem um ponto. Negativo não valoriza o funcionário que tem, não dá oportunidade de crescimento"
bad,I have worked for walmart for about 6 years. The management teams are typically consisted of less than qualified individuals who form personal opinions on each worker and typically use those personal opinions against the worker.  I have seen workloads dispersed in ways that would be unequal to workers. I have seen poor communication toward associates.
bad,I learned a lot about handling people from this first job I got in the customer service field. I learned to think on my toes and find a solution to problems customers were having without having to involve managers.
bad,"Great associates at store level. Good opportunity to develop leadership, operational, and change management skills. It was however, a seven day/wk job. There was very little time spent on personal development and you were always reminded that results came before people."
bad,"I was very excited to work here for it was my first retail job and I personally love Walmart. However, when I became a part of the team I came to see it wasn't everything it was cracked up to be. They view just about any teammate that wasn't management as expendable and treated us such."
bad,The job itself is fine and I enjoy it and the people are great. The company is what i have problem with. they don't care about us. They fired a 82 year old woman who had been with them for over 20 years because they don't excuse doctor visits. The management over looked her point accumulation because of loyalty but home office forced them to fire her.  They have caged me there because I am very good at my job and I have customers tell management that I am great at customer service. I live about an hour away and have traveled to this job for years now. I have tried to transfer but I always have at least 6 points out of 9. I have to have less than 6 but something happens like I don't have gas to get there the day before payday. The one time I was at 5 points and tried to transfer the found some tiny way to write me up.
bad,"Walmart is taken the talent out of its stores, and making it more stressful for the associates and managers who work there. Poor communication from corporate, regional, and market level. I am disappointed where the company is headed, they have forgot about there core business which is the customer and associates within there four walls."
bad,No pretenses about what you're getting into.  Micro managed to death.  No proper training more of a sink or swim scenario when advancing to management positions.
bad,It was good working their.  Everyone is very welcoming.  They had some good managers.  We had okay bonus. I got to learn different things.  Being on the floor . Working and meeting new people.  Learning for their experiences
bad,I can actually say that Walmart was not the best job that I've had but I can say that the only thing that I miss about walmart is the pay!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,The work pace and physical demands at Walmart are very stressful and hard.  You will work a minimum of 10 hours per day and most days more than what you are scheduled for.  The pay and benefits are good and that is the only reason I would recommend Walmart Logistics.  You will have a mix between good management and horrible management it just depends on the shift and location.
bad,"For a place that prouds itself on taking care of the customers, it surely doesnt take care of its employees!!!...  Hours are hard to come by unless you are part of management."
bad,"This company is not about the family man,they are trying to run the company into the ground. The driver's want to do the best job to move freight. But company always throwing road blocks to disrupt the positive attitudes!! Money leaving the job..."
bad,My manager was a wonderful man and he tried very hard but his bosses and the entire corporate structure made it almost impossible to have an environment conducive to happiness and employees working hard
bad,"-management is very moody "
bad,"Great place to work until you become a threat to management.  Once you call them out on being wrong or breaking the law, they devote time to making sure you leave the company."
bad,They are suppose to be there for you but if you have even a slight disability they are not so supportive. They do tip toe around you a lot when it comes to when you are having issues. The pay is negligible like you would expect from a retail job.  If you have a small mental disability I recommend never setting foot here in thinking about working for even a moment
bad,"typical day - hearing the drama in my department of other people's problems; trying to bake everything in 4 hours and then packaging; trained a couple new employees (that don't tell you this or even ask you; they just push a new person on to you even if you are new yourself). cleaning, inventory, phones, cake orders, break down pallets in freezers, prepare your breakout for the next day. Management is not very great. You meet a variety of people, but be careful, some people are not very friendly and some are even a bit prejudice to others from certain backgrounds. Hardest part is getting things done in a short amount of time when your short staffed and there are a lot of complaints. Some people don't want to help and you are stuck with twice the amount of work. i don't really enjoy this job. Looking for something else."
bad,"not much supervision out side. only one outside during 3rd shift and required to walk the perimeter of the building and parking lot. not alot of breaks for the physically demanding job. "
bad,The management can be very not on your side like they make you think (I guess you can say). They even show a very Anti-Union Video. Which Growing up in a union family I feel it's very wrong to do. But I guess to each their own. They barely ever hire anyone full time so the hours very as a part timer. They also don't schedule properly to insure that you are not alone and become over stressed and over whelmed do to lack of staffing.
bad,"Walmart has recently started the Academy program in effort to guide its associates in the direction Walmart wants to go as a company. I have taken part of this Academy training and it is fantastic. It really makes sense."
bad,"Walmart has continued to drive productivity and cutting costs to the point of removing many salaried positions while increasing workload on remaining salaried management."
bad,"Wonderful place to work only if people could learn to work together.  I took orders, prepared buffet style foods, cooked chicken , learned how to make sandwiches on a Subway scale which is high.  Poor people don't always have a good attitude, they're frustrated."
bad,"The meat departments productivity and efficiency all depends on the people working in it. It relies on team work and getting your shifts assigned tasks done. When tasks aren't completed and left for the next shift to take care of. It slows the whole process down and causes a loss of sales and unhappy customers."
bad,"Long hours and very fast paced. We had a company culture but it did not mirror the real life actions of the management team. No concern for people, it is all for show."
bad,Sometimes when it's busy it can be a little bit stressful when have customer that getting mad  cause their standing in line for while other than that it's good place to work
bad,I left that job due to the management not being very employee friendly and their lack of understanding of leadership. They treated all the employees at this particular store poorly. I have recently learned that those managers have been replaced.
bad,"Difficult environment to work at and balance home life with job."
bad,"Underpaid, not enough hours, lack of training.  Workplace culture is depressing.  There is not much to forward to in favor of the workers.  All training is an 'as you go' situation."
bad,I work really hard and get along with people  I’m nice to work with I’m a friendly person get alone with I’m happy to work with new people at my job and helpCustomers out
bad,"I worked at Walmart for a good few weeks and I came in between a pay pierod so I had to wait 3 weeks which is normal , after 3 weeks and 120 hours of work time when I got paid I noticed I only had 322$ I was furious. I asked management why my pay was so low and he told me fed taxes. that's not even close to was taxes take out. he told me to wait til next pay day and see if it changes or the rest of the money I was supposed to get comes then, so I do and after 80 hours I only had 120$ no I'm was angry and asked him again and he told me I'm not even a employee and I'm not on the record, and told me to leave which made NO SENSE, a week or so later I get called into work from personal asking where I was and I told them what happened, and they immediately fired that manager that day. I don't know the details but that was that so I worked a week or so more and got paid a mesley 107$ and was told they wouldn't re emburse me or anything so I decided to quit, I worked a lot for almost 3 months 11 hour shifts and only got paid a total of 500$.....for 3 months,"
bad,"Was responsible for changing tires, old, lights, filter, and more on customers vehicles.  Keeping the work area clean.  Helping customers find anything they needed in the store."
bad,"I really liked this job , I started as an employee and worked up to department manager. I ran housewares and loved helping people in my community . I think they need to do more education and pay attention to each department , no favoritism ."
bad,"Walmart is a great place to get started working with lots of variety and opportunities.  It is not a longterm/lifetime workplace.  Management sucks and doesn't care.  The further up you are promoted, the more obvious and stressful Walmart becomes."
bad,"I had two great friends at Walmart. Other than that I was just there to put in my hours. Wasn't all bad, very simple job. The management was a little uncoordinated."
bad,"What can i say, its retail.  Your work life Balance is absolutely terrible.  Your pay is from what i understand batter than most.  Hard to hire good quality help."
bad,"All the recent changes Walmart has undergone over the last couple years only benefits new/entry-level associates.  It feels that us tenured associates are being phased out, which is why I am trying to find a new career with a new company while it's still as a choice and not as a necessity.  After nine years of loyal hardworking employment, I am at one of the highest paid hourly positions and will soon only be making a meager $1.50 more than brand new entry-level associates.  And with the newest changes about to take place, after four years of a consistent schedule, Home Office has decided I need to be on a schedule which will result in me having less time with my family."
bad,"Walmart has a disturbing company culture.  Employees and Management alike are nothing more than taskers.  Store Managers are not given the opportunity to run their own store, all the while having Senior Executives micromanaging their every move.  This company is in dire need of Process Improvement initiatives and someone to have a working understanding of Standard Operating Procedures."
bad,The management was just so rude all the time yeah they throw you parties etc but they get mad when you change your availability they dont do you justice on your hours especially if youre a cashier
bad,The managers and employees do not care for each other. So much so that the managers talk bad about employees to other employees in front of said employee.
bad,High expectations and upper management was the worst would purposefully ignore me when I needed help examples were I needed help called via phone ignored went to office management was in actively ignoring my phone calls
bad,"Gave this company 12 years of my life, missed holidays with my family after working my way up from overnight stocker to zms needed to relocate, took all necessary steps to transfer to be told after everything that they did not have a position for me."
bad,"I worked at Walmart for 6 years and at first was alright but as time passed it was a downhill roll. The hours were completely inconsistent, management spent way too much time micro-managing associates and was never on top of important things. I was pulled from my department on an hour to hour basis and was often coached for not completing my responsibilities. Overall the worst is part of my experience was working for so many years and still making the same pay as those walking in the door if not less so. Now my experience may have ended on a sad note but I did have a slew of opportunities to learn skills for the workplace and took as many as I could get. The benefits were ok but they at least offered health vision and dental insurance. The discount could have been much better and not controlled my customer complaint."
bad,Was very fast paced and you could do a lot and finish your tasks and the manager would talk down to you in front of everyone in your departent still saying how bad of a job you did or make one mistake.
bad,"The average day consisted of showing up to work and immediately starting work moving product to the floor as well as zoning, this was a never ending and would have been fine, but the problems came from poor scheduling leaving people alone to handle both customer service and trying to keep up on keeping things stocked. Which means you will inevitably fall behind and not be able to catch up which is when the managers take notice."
bad,"I was quickly advanced into management, then forced to manage two very understaffed departments, being forced to take care of all orders, over 40,000 lbs of inventory a week in total, eventually I became injured, then after coming back from restrictions, I was allowed to get both my departments back into shape, and orders back where they should be, after two days I was called into the office and fired for (unsafe work practices, for getting hurt doing exactly as I was ordered by my superiors)"
bad,"Managers abuse their authority and are unwilling (most of them) to do the same work they assign. Often they expect you to work in every other department doing other people's jobs, but then give punitive responses when your work isn't finished. Employees are often overworked because the store is not properly staffed. Management shows preferential treatment of certain individuals and allows drama to continue needlessly."
bad,"this retail company has recently changed the culture of work/life balance. A typical day of work starts at 4-5AM and finishes when your job's done. No such thing in retail! The culture at this company is not as it should be in associate metrics and the new structure while supportive of associates,but did not train or empower them to be self thinkers or to succeed based on what little training they were given thus the low associate scores given to over all store/morale. The hardest part of retail is with the company reducing overall staffing by 20% you are not capable with current levels to perform at adequate performance.Its not a bad company but the left foot and right foot do not work in series thus no movement forward."
bad,Poor compensation and poor benefits. Management was decent. hours were sporadic. Advancement was difficult. co-workers were generally good to work with.
bad,"They do not care if you aren't feeling well, the company does not accept doctor's notes. If you need to leave due to an emergency, it still counts against you as an absence/left early. They do not accommodate as they should. If you are extremely sick, they still expect you to show up to work as you would any other day, and if you don't a point goes against your absences. If you leave more than 2 hours before the end of your shift, it counts as a full absence. Some of the departments, the associates have to do extra work and there is no compensation for it whatsoever. Sometimes associates have to even do the jobs of the Department Managers, and even then there is no compensation, no ""thank you for doing what you do""."
bad,"Walmart is always a good place to get a job at, but this Walmart had poor service from the management and treated employees poor as well. I regret ever applying at that specific Walmart."
bad,Hard work is never appreciated.  You can do anything and everything you are never  appreciated.  If management doesn't like you it is hard to work there.
bad,"hectic, disorganized, majority of in store management poorly trained,"
bad,"A typical day at Walmart is chill depending on what time of the year it is. I learned that you have to pace yourself and dont overwhelm yourself if alot of put on you. The workplace is very dramafied there and people do not know how to stay out of your business. Majority of the management is poor, excluding a couple of the managers. Nothing is really hard about my job. Its fairly easy. The most things i enjoy about the job is helping customers and laughing and enjoying work with the people that work in the same department I work in."
bad,"it kept me busy, paid ok,i would have liked it more if i could have been allowed to to figure ways that helped me get my job done faster, but they were rigid in their policies and wrote people up if they found better and faster ways of working freight instead of improving company created policy."
bad,"fast paced, never enough help to get thru the shifts. all new hires were part time no benefits so was hard to keep people I worked for them for 16 yrs never been coached was let go unfairly, benefits were good for full time associates only. customer service was hard to do daily since we were  always short staffed."
bad,"managers do a run around when asked for help, also letting harassment happen i a work place isn't very comforting, the overnight csms never help when needed, only certain people get in trouble about not following dress code while others do as they please,"
bad,"Walmart, despite being the commercial monolith that it is, consistently makes short-cuts in the daily operations and staffing of its stores. While it is known for its opportunities for advancement, unfortunately, the company isn't particularly picky about whom it trusts with its salaried leadership positions, resulting in faulty day-by-day operations. However, it must be said that it certainly does have competitive benefits and provides a great entry-level employer."
bad,"It started out okay,but a former coworker reported me on the sly,called a coworker's wife and said I was having a affair with him,and would leave me alone for 3 hours on busy nights."
bad,They don’t treat the Cap teams with enough respect and common curtesy. Cap teams are the reason that the store is even operational and yet they are paid the lowest wages
bad,"Walmart is the sort of company you go to apply to that can absolutely be a great, emotionally rewarding experience - work can be fulfilling, coworkers can be a delight, the management team may be educational and guide you to greater opportunities knowing that your victory is also the company's victory; that your education means you are a better associate and a capable ambassador for the company to people within and outside of the organizational structure."
bad,"Work is pretty easy tbh but the customers and managers can drive you up a wall if you take any of it seriously."
bad,Busy store with a lot of confusion if you don't have support from co workers. Teaches you how to run a staff by yourself if needed and how to solve problems on the spot as a manager.
bad,"Well, Wal-Mart was/is one of those companies you hear everyone complaining about."
bad,I can remember the last time I had fun at work. The job has became very stressful. The management don't appreciate the employees enough on the night shift. Some employees get away with not doing their job and the other associates has to pick up their slack. Some managers act like they don't know anything when you ask a simple question.
bad,"good place for starting job but expect to work 9 hours every day if ur availibilty allows it, expect ur schedule to go against ur availability happened to me almost every month."
bad,I enjoyed my time at Walmart but customers weren't easy and everyone had there good days and bad. It kept you busy and never a dull moment but I got hurt on the job.
bad,"Needs revision of hired employees."
bad,It is not a great environment to work at. Management wants you to do too much while slashing hours. Employees do not care as much about getting the job done right as they do just doing the job.
bad,"Busy "
bad,This workplace was interesting. I was not planning to leave But due to medical injury unable to stay working. I learned how to run the Zamboni machine and the floor stripper and wax machine as well as stock shelves.
bad,"The workplace required fast paces and precision, however, the management was poor and uncoordinated, communication between managers and associates was subpar."
bad,"Bad direction from the managers, lack of necessary resources, little to no support, no accountability, little to no advancement, I learned to watch out for back stabbers. The hardest part was showing up, because you would come in with a good attitude, and somehow they would ruin it before you left. The most enjoyable part was getting paid, sad huh."
bad,"Negative work environment, managers treat you badly, have no care in the world about their associates, and very un-reliant almost half the time. Anyone gets hired, lazy workers are accepted in the workplace, and not just workers but managers also do not treat customers with a kind or respectable manner. Some ASMs sleep in the office or eat all kinds of unhealthy food around papers. Very inappropriate workplace."
bad,When i worked for Walmart it was like im working for more than one department. I was being called for customer service on the phone while dealing with a customer with her online order. I had low staff and many people called out. I could not depend on management. That work experience was overwhelming.
bad,"My experience with Walmart has not been a good one. It started out great since I had great management but then after a while, they changed managers. After I received  my new manager, things went downhill. He had it out for me. Causing me to have more medical issues and extreme stress. I was worn down from each time I reported my manager, it got worse from him. He was trying to build a case to fire me and wasn't succeeding. I would not recommend this to anyone except as a last resort."
bad,Great people to be around.  Good management in some location.  Spent a lot of time at work and minimum time with my family.  The hardest part of the job is being available to help out.
bad,"Walmart can be fun at times when it has to be. As long as i manage my hours, come to work on time, keep a smile and positive attitude, there are no complaints from customers. Also great hygene is also important along the dress code. I was told to be presentable and smell clean. It pays good sometimes too"
bad,"never enough employees scheduled for the day."
bad,"A typical day as a cashier at Walmart involves getting scratched by diaper boxes, hurting your back and being yelled at by customers. It's okay for an entry-level job, but working there is terrible when you get yelled at by everyone."
bad,A typical day at Walmart would be servicing customers and trying to get them in and out within a timely manner. I would say the hardest part of my job would have been not being properly accommodated with the appropriate amount of employees to assist me.
bad,"Very monotonous work environment with minimal spice of life. breaks were fair, employees were diverse while typically elderly. Most enjoyable part of the job being the unpaid lunch break typically."
bad,"Work life balance isn't very well. But overall, it pays the bills. As long as you come in do your job and don't call in, you will be valued, and they will give you the hours you need."
bad,"No one does their own work, the managers use the employees as scapegoats when the expected work doesn't get done, and most of the employees are unmotivated and do not cooperate."
bad,"job was great, associates were great even supervisors were great, however upper management treats you like dirt unwilling to help in most situation and lets you know basically you are not appreciated and completely replaceable"
bad,"Most management doesn't do what they say they will. Don't take anyone's word for what they say. The better you do at your job doesnt mean anything, besides getting made to do more work and nothing extra out of it. for example jobs that arent on your hiring list that they say is your responsibility."
bad,"Poor place to work, terrible benefits, underpaid employees, barely any sick days, part time employee received no PTO (may have changed now), will cut hours to avoid having to offer benefits"
bad,"Walmart is a retail store that people love to shop at and some love to work at. I would recommend it to people that would want a temporary job, I wouldn't consider it permanent. Management can be a challenge to deal with and it can get overwhelming, but that is anywhere you are going to go and get a job at."
bad,"Fast paced retail. Always packed. Always busy. Job security. A lot has changed since I worked there, so I really can't write an up to date review on it"
bad,"the job is okay, it is not for everyone.The job itself is not too hard, but the problem is with this job you are expected to do seven jobs with one job's pay."
bad,"always under staffed."
bad,"Retail at a giant store, was not a good experience.Five years there and I felt like I was among the living dead. There was not one good thing I gained from that experience."
bad,"Being a cashier at Walmart you deal with all types of people, but the ones that really gets on your nerves is the managers. They over play their roles."
bad,"Over time the lack of communication between management, the drama, the same things to clean up left by other shifts, lack of recognition for a job well done (miracles usually), the management always picking at the minor things that you didn't get a chance to do because, you were either helping a customer or ANOTHER person in management wants you to do something completely different even though you explain that you are doing something for another manager then being told ""no just do what I told you"". The same thing every day it seemed and nothing was being done to remedy the situation. Over the coarse of 2 years I'd have to say it was an easy and decent job when you got to actually do your correct job. But, having to pick up the slack for others constantly and being picked at for not getting something done causes a huge problem. Good money if you can handle the drama though."
bad,I worked very hard in what ever position I had for the day. I learned that Walmart was more for men than women. Management had their favorites. The hardest part of my job was having to deal with mad customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was making customers happy.
bad,"My employment time at Walmart was short due to the fact that i applied for a cashier/ sales associate position and was assigned to stocking frozen foods. The weight i lifted and the fact that i climbed cases of frozen foods to get to what was needed to be stocked was very difficult for me. I did enjoy my co-workers and the manager seemed fair.I think Walmart is a fair companyto work for , it just wasn't for me as the job was much more physically demanding than i could manage. I requested several times to be moved to another department but never was."
bad,"The hardest part of the job is during the holidays around Christmas time, people competing for attention, for service, frantic customers to deal with."
bad,"Going into Walmart as an Assistant Manager I knew it would be a challenging retail environment, that wasn't a concern for me. What I didn't realize was how much this one job would hinder my work/life balance. While there is great room for advancement, the expectation is that you spend upwards of 70+ hours a week to get the job done, even though the company expects 50 hours. And when you're a salaried manager, that great pay begins to diminish your per/hour rate. Additionally, my store manager have a very ineffective management style that ultimately lead to my interest in leaving."
bad,"Having to come in and be pulled from your tasks, to assist others in there task and when you are slow on the consumables side of Walmart you get harassed for not picking up the pace and completing your assigned tasks. management only cares for the tasks assigned for them and wont care if you need extra assistance completing your task."
bad,"Not only was I driven out of a position because they felt I ""was not part of their team"", the next manager ruined my schedule when I put my two weeks notice in as well as slander my name to all of my coworkers. My manager leaned on me because I was a hard worker, working nights, morning, weekends and holidays, yet when I couldn't take the terrible hours anymore, I was shunned. Very poor management, with exceptions to a few who are great managers, unfortunately they were not my managers."
bad,"A typical day includes being rushed in situations where you can't, being chastised by hypocritical supervisors and managers for following policy and helping customers, and having impossible demands made of you by supervisors and managers before they run off never to be seen until they want to get after you some more."
bad,"One of my manger had it out for me early on, she was friends with hr i had no place to turn. The store manger said he could not make sure i wasnt working with her. My other manger was nice and polite, as i always got my work done in a timely manner."
bad,"Repetitive, fast paced, but keeps you busy.  Can be fun at times,   hardest part of job is meeting standard time on trips, and making production.  Could use better equipment"
bad,"Walmart is a nice entey level job for college students, but not for people that need to make a living. Wages are structured poorly and annual raises are hardly significant. Advancement opportunities are above average but pay differential is terrible. Competitive pay is something they advertise, but you aren't too likely to see your wages increase by much annually. Altogether Walmart has its pros but the cons heavily outweigh them."
bad,"There is no sense of fulfillment at this job, the pace is rapid at times and slow at others. Advancement is long more tedious that difficult. Management is condescending for the most part, especially to each other."
bad,"It depends on the Walmart. Some a really good depending on management. Mine unfortunately wasn't one of those stores. Upper management didn't really seem to know everything about the store and has said very conflicting information. Saying the cashiers have too many hours, but then a week later saying they will be hiring more."
bad,Schedule inconsistent. Pay and benefits are more than fair for the job duties and qualifications. Turnover rate pretty high. Training and communication could be improved. Worked there for the last thirty months. Looking for something new.
bad,when i was an unloader I would get there and people wouldn't be in a happy mood on the unloader crew and then when i worked there as a night stocker the manager was bending the rules to suit his ego
bad,The people you work with truly become a work family. You all understand how each other feel and all of you have drive and ambition to do something better. Management also can become your friends as well. 90 % of the time their hands are tied just like yours.
bad,"This is a review for CAP Team 2, the second shift. CAP team is the general purpose position in walmart, you're expectations are to unload 2-3 trucks per day, a GM recieving, a Grocery Recieving and potentially a Frozen/dairy delivery. In addition you will stock shelves in high traffic areas, most often Grocery."
bad,"Walmart with suck the soul out of you.  I hated working there towards the end.  Between the management, and the customers, it was awful!  And god forbid you are there more than a year!  By that point they are looking for reasons to fire you so they can replace you with someone new they can pay less!  Management will lie to you in a heartbeat and set you up for failure.  There were a few decent managers, but they were rare. The job is not worth the pittance you are paid."
bad,"The management were very backwards, played favorites, and over stepped boundaries. Nothing was consistent. I did appreciate the hard work, and money but I'd never work at Wal-Mart again."
bad,Being a customer service manger is hard and stressful you are in charge of all the cashier the maintenance the cart pusher money center and the customer service representatives you have too run around the store and fix everyone problem and top it off you have too deal with the manger
bad,"If an employee needed some training or had a question and didnt understand, management wouldn't take the time to train or assist you had to figure it out yourself and would get in trouble if you didnt do it the correct way. Managers weren't even trained the right way, they had to figure it out or ask a regular employee."
bad,I love the job the majority of the time because of the people I met through it and how the environment was; However the management is absolutely terrible.
bad,At the Dunn-Erwin walmart the management doesn't care about the employees. The salaried managers are the worst when it comes to anything other than what THEY need to handle.
bad,"Upper management operations run the DC on a buddy system if you aren't one of them you have no chance of advancement in the building no matter what your experience or skill set, or seniority are."
bad,"My specific Walmart is run by fear and everyone is scared to lose their job causing an unneeded stress filled environment.  The current owner puts all the stress on the assistant managers which they then push the crew harder causing the drop out rate to sky rocket.  If I ask for parts to a machine or supplies that are integral to doing my job. I may not even get it for up to a month because it is not ""in the budget"" and by then the boss would have already wanted the job done. "
bad,"Customer service, sales and overall maintenance of the electronics dept."
bad,Before I relocated to the new site it was constant micromanaging from the market level. Constantly fixing problems temporarily instead of looking for a permanent solution. Never got any acknowledgement or positive feedback on the work completed. Always focusing on the negative and always putting the employees down. Promotion was based on who you knew. And if you were great a certain position you were stuck there because they couldn't afford to replace you. But I did learn how to delegate and change work focus on the fly. Great HR skill. I learned to empower and motivate employees. I have trained and promoted several great employees.
bad,I had to always make sure the work was done correctly sometimes had to work long hours around several people. Worked customer service most of the days.
bad,I have served  faithful to Walmart for lots of years but now I wanna do what my talent is and that is data entry or mail order  clerk.  I have worked in their cash office for 7 years and in there I did lots of ten key and data entry.  I worked  at other companies that that do nothing but typing and  data entry.
bad,I quit my job due to harassment. But upon leaving I told walmart I had a new employer instead. Who would put reason for leaving (harassment)? Other than the harassment it was a good place to work and I would not mind working at a different store. I like the pace and had fun with my job.
bad,"Working for the Retail Giant is nothing that I had expected.  I have experience different environments such as Schools, Administration, Clerical, Supervisory, Food and Beverage, Hospitality, Customer Service.  Working for Wal-Mart has been a wake up call for the nerves of the human body.  There is so much physical work involved in maintaining these stores.  I have found that most employees that stay for several years have a strategy all their own.  There is such a revolving door of employees for Wal-Mart that you can be hired with several people at the same time and within a two to three week period those same people are now gone.  The turn over ratio is overwhelming.  The major issue felt throughout the store is that Management does not really care for their employees.  This is based on the work load that is assigned.  It can be fun, if you maintain a sense of humor and positive outlook."
bad,"I happened to experience a manager that cared less for his associates and less about the customers than he did about the money being made for the company. It was a difficult place to work, and even more difficult to advance on a possible career path. I decided to leave out of personal reasons/differences with my immediate Salaried Assistant Manager."
bad,el ambiente laboral es muy pesado ya que por lo general los jefes de piso nunca estan de acuerdo unos con otros.
bad,"Managed over 700 associates daily"
bad,When I worked there the Sales Manager in place was horrible. She a temper that was so bad that she would yell at her staff in front customers and throw things. The work schedule was almost around the clock. You were always set up to fail with the daily to do tasks that was so long that you could never accomplish it all so you were constantly running around. But the Store Manager that was there during mu employment has retired and replaced with a much better one!
bad,Walmart is a retail giant that only cares about the bottom line and not the people it takes to get there. If you are not willing to get on board with there cruel practices then you will not fit in.
bad,Nous devons toujours travailler avec un scan à l’heure exigé. Certain clients peuvent nous ralentir. Au service à la clientèle nous devons respecter une certaine manière de faire et que nous devons appliquer mais si le client chicane un peu les gérants leurs donnent tout ce qu’ils veulent. Cela est un certain manque envers nous.
bad,"Very political. Management was out for themselves and treated people below them, just as such, below them. Not all facilities were like this, but my home store was not desirable."
bad,"Easy jobs, management always makes the job easier.  The shift times are not great, you just get off too late at night if you work second shift. That's the only con about working here"
bad,Walmart was a very stressful environment to work not a hard job just poor management skills and communication between the different shifts leaving the last shift to do 90% of the work. Great company wouldn't mind working there again just a different location with better skills.
bad,"This company would get you to clock in at a time clock  and preform all your daily responsibilities and gave you two fifteen minute coffee breaks a day and an hour for lunch.  They had plenty of support for their employees.  However, the pay was not good."
bad,Walmart has a culture where it makes it difficult to come from another industry and fit in. They do a pretty good job of training new managers but fail repeatedly in communication when changes are made at higher levels. This not only causes unneeded stress but lacks effectiveness throughout the organization. I simply view this as a job  and try and do my best each day.
bad,I personally like Walmart on the behalf that is a great company you can move up in only if you have a good management team. That's the part I feel they are really lacking in.
bad,"Walmart has a 10 ft rule to greet and assist all customers but most employees do not practice it or care about it. Everything is an inconvenience for all employees, including management. Most employees keep their heads down to avoid contact with customers or employees. Poor leadership and unprofessional behavior is rampant."
bad,"Walmart has great potential, but unfortunately the store I work for has unprofessional management & no communication. We have had a very high turnover in upper management positions."
bad,"If you are only looking for a limited hourly part time job, head to your local Walmart. If you are looking for a career and you have ambition and a good set of ethics, then you should not consider this as a growth opportunity."
bad,Walmart chicoutimi meurt peu a peu par leur mauvaise decision et leur maivaise gérance de leur stock
bad,"Didn't really enjoy my time with the company, but I didn't really expect to. The management is forced to under schedule, because of salary cost restrictions. So your constantly trying to do more than you have people available for."
bad,Working in walmart as it fair shares. Management is poorly and is basic on favorite not work ethos. I believe a work place should not be on who you know longer. it should be on how well you perform at work.
bad,I love working with my manager and partner in my area. They're very honest and believe in the new associates to help them move higher up working for Walmart.
bad,"They don't know how to train employees, they don't have good organization, people are lazy and if cant find something will say its overstocked they didn't know how to zone the shelves managers will micromanage you and play hide and seek and find someone who will tell you what to do that day. Once you first arrive you don't know what you are doing for the day."
bad,"We had a really bad store manager. Major issue with Favoritism in my store. some people could get away with murder, others couldn't get away with the smallest things."
bad,As a manager you are going to put in more time regardless of your performance. There is no such thing as a day off. No work life balance. You are compensated well but dont have the time to use your hard earned cash.
bad,"The staff tends to be lazy and rude most of the time, especially the management. Nothing could ever get done because there were only a handful of hard laborers. It was always messy and dirty. Management was just very, very poor. The pay was not worth all of the stress that came with being a hard worker."
bad,Everyone hated their jobs and the push to sell credit and membership (Sam's Club) was stressful. The pay was nice but it was only there to keep me wanting to work there. I would happily take a pay cut to go to a better company however.
bad,The biggest issue with working at Walmart are the customers.  Most are average.  A few a good.  A handful are demon spawn.  They spit fire when you don't immediately drop all of your work to help them.  They are the worst.  Coworkers are fairly nice and helpful.  Department managers can get stressed and lash out.  Upper management is a hit-or-miss.  Some are great and some suck.
bad,To much to do without the help. To many managers and not enough other associates. Just a miserable place to work. Taught to run your department as your own store. I believe they prevented us from doing that. I also believe you get to a certain pay and want you to move up or get out. They change assistant managers and co managers so often you are unable be keep up with the way they want things done. Lots of chips on the shoulders there.
bad,I worked there while i was still in high school. So they had a hard time keeping my schedule within my school schedule. The pay was good but you are supposed to get a small raise after you have been there for 60 days and you will never see it.
bad,It solely depends on which Walmart your applying for. The Walmart I work for now has very poor management and do not treat their associates with care.
bad,"Too many chiefs - lack of current / correct / details in almost all areas of management ... and regardless of ""fact"" - subordinates are wrong.  Very high turn over.  Many rules not enforced"
bad,I would not recommend Walmart as the pay is low and the stress is high to get things done. You are pushed to finish projects that would take much longer than it normally would
bad,"I really liked working with the other employees. they were nice and liked working with others. however, the management was really poor. They would always say that customer service is first priority but would never act like it. When ever something went wrong with a customer they would act like it was the end of the world even when it wasn't a big deal. I would say the hardest part of the job is dealing with customers. Sometimes customers will try to put the blame on the employee even though it wasn't the employee's fault. Some customers are impatient and some are really nice. It just depends on the day. I was able to learn a lot about different products, but that was limited to, mainly, the department I worked in."
bad,"i worked over night clearing floor,waxing and buffing.the staff are great,very helpful with each other. Management is ok but could be better n appreciative. ."
bad,"Es una empresa muy grande, vende mucho y por lo tanto trabajan mucho a los empleados por un sueldo muy bajo, es por ello que los trabajadores no satisfacen sua necesidades económicas y buscan una mejor calidad de vida"
bad,"Hours fit with my schedule while putting myself through college.  Work evening shift, company worked with me and adjusted hours to fit my school schedule."
bad,"During a typical day of work would involve scanning and counting all overstocked inventory. Unloading trucks, and bringing items to the sales floor."
bad,"Walmart is a BAD place to work - stressful environment, constant changing rules, poor management, HORRIBLE pay, many employees are on food stamps and almost ALL require another partner to work also, in order to make a minimal existence.  A typical day for me was eight hours at a register under CONSTANT supervision on the floor and by a  camera aimed at you from a remote location."
bad,Management was not on the same page. They wanted to be all over the store instead of taking care of their departments. Too many pets. Management would not back you in situations with customers.
bad,the management had no idea what they are doing there i also did not like how the hours were terrible and unless you were a favorite you never got a chance to advance
bad,"Our store is hiring 37 people right now. That tells you how ""great"" it is here."
bad,This is definitely a first job kind of place. Everyone knows this but if you do work hard and work well with others you will be promoted. It is the same job alot just keep working hard.
bad,"The culture of the Walmart I worked at was unpleasant to say the very least. Policy seemed to change on a daily basis and associates were often expected to complete tasks assigned to other shifts as well as their own. Unrealistic expectations and a constant loop of negative feedback were the norm. And the health insurance was garbage, so there's that too."
bad,"J'ai adoré cette emploi, le personnel, tout presque."
bad,"Management can be very stressful at this facility. Yes they are actually not bad managers, but if you are a good worker they can and will pull you in a thousand other directions because not very many employees get things done around the store. If you are flexible, prepare to be taken advantage of to a certain degree. Some managers will be respectful and will do awesome things for you, but others will only be there to make your job terrible."
bad,Most of the time the job was not bad but when you keep having managers changing or district managers that change and then you get people that think they are too good to help or they are certain people that can only work during the week even though we are open seven days a week and then there are people who think that the whole world revolves around them.
bad,"If you have to work for them, try to make the best of it. You have to have open schedule availability for hours. But then you close one night then open in the am."
bad,"Responsible for inventory management, personnel management and scheduling, ordering and customer satisfaction. The time schedule is extremely demanding. there are a long list of reports due each day which don't take into account any time spent with customers. The work load would be fine if compensated better for the position."
bad,"Bottom line is that Wal-mart views every employee as replaceable and abuses competent workers. I was nine months pregnant working the Customer service desk and because of inadequate hiring policies was forced to run the entire area completely alone. When I had to call out sick for infrequent pregnancy related concerns, I was bullied and had my job threatened. I left the company after I gave birth to my son, and I have no regrets."
bad,They worked with me with my hours because of school. The management was awful and there was a lot of corruption. They don't treat their employees the best either.
bad,"New changes implemented have disallowed for any work to get done without criticism about why it hasn't been done faster or without management breathing down your neck about following compliance. Having worked as long as I have in my area, I know how to do my job and have never had this issue. When raising issues of where things are falling apart, our concerns or proof are ignored in favor of being told it's under control. Associates continue to get away with doing minimal work or things that aren't their job and there is zero accountability for the actual job that is supposed to be completed. Part-time employees are overworked as full timers keep dropping like flies. The consensus is ""we need to hire more people"" but it's not being done fast enough. Where depts are only half-staffed, the expectation for all work to be done is still there; yet only held against some employees while other manage to keep on getting by on doing nothing."
bad,"Worked as an over glorified night stocker."
bad,"A typical day at walmart starts at 5 a.m and doesn't end til work is done and that's around 3:30-4:30 p.m. I'm one of the leaders at work because i have over 12 years experience and I work very well around others. The culture at my current job is fair most of the time. The hardest part of my job is to help motivate new hires who don't want to work and learn a new skill, Wallmart turnover rate is high than 60 percent, The most enjoyable part of my job is to interact with my co-workers who love to strive hard to produce quality work in a timely fashion."
bad,"They like to get employees from other companies in order to save on the benefits and labour, you don't do as they say on the spot you're more than likely out since the companies that supply employees don't ask questions you have no job security. The employees they actually do hire are basically hard labour farm animals to them, they will squeeze the health out of you."
bad,"I've been with the company 9 years now going on 10 early next year. The job use to be full of excitement and provided new and exciting challenges daily. This all change when the demand for more and more cases needed to be pushed out to the stores that it became overwhelming. They didn't staff properly to fill the void in areas that were lacking associates which really brought the meaning ""more with less"" a whole new perspective. Currently there is talk that lunch break period will be taking away causing you to work 10 hours straight with maybe a 20 min break during that time frame. Job pays competitively in accordance to other warehouses but with lack of proper management, expect to be receiving accountability for performances and breakdowns of equipment that is beyond your control."
bad,I have worked for this company for a total of 5 years and have truly enjoyed my time with the company. It was my first real experience in retail and I have obtained a vast amount of knowledge.  The company recently went thru a realignment with management team at location as well as the market team.  Unfortunately the new team is more concerned with their salary than the welfare of its associates.
bad,"was ok but as most big box companies go they lose site of was ppl what and start shoving what they think ppl want down thier throats,ppl hate being asked about credit card apps everytime they check out ,its border line harssment"
bad,Very fast pace. Management  not very understanding. Loved the discount that they offered. Lots of customers never a dull moment. Amazing co- workers. Overall okay place to work.
bad,Don't take a day off or you'll come back to a mess the next day.  Makes your days off anxiety ridden.  Store manager has her clique and everyone is too scared speak up about MAJOR issues.
bad,"Working at Walmart I can feel my will to live leaving my body. It's monotonous work with usually terrible managers who couldn't care less about you. I applied twice and was called in for an interview after the second application, but the manager who was supposed to conduct it failed to show up TWICE and I was sent away. If you can put up with the retail environment they really do pay a decent wage, but I can't get out of here soon enough."
bad,Fun place to work great associates. Hard work the hours were okay. Management where rude disrespectful to associates. I was a great worker I got promoted
bad,"Hard to move up in Management. Be prepared to do more work then what you are paid for, are stay longer the you are scheduled by finishing the rest of your work or task then have to to get rid the overtime by extending your lunch breaks. "
bad,"Never enough people working in the bakery, constantly doing the job of the manager because they can't keep one. Doesn't pay anymore to come in at 3am vs 9 am."
bad,I enjoyed working at Walmart their is a lot of things I wish I could had changed but it was a good and long learning experience for me but I decided to take my learning experience else where.
bad,lots of room to advance but more of a who you know type of workplace needs better pay and management could be more knowledgeable promote the right people and get rid of the first come first serve management rule
bad,"I do the Banking with the money center check cashing & send & receiving money cross country. The customer service I do all the returns & exchanges, sort out everything ones items by departments, I deliver & have take all claims in the last hour after I close down both systems."
bad,"While my immediate manager is great, people above her won't let her do what she wants and or needs to do.  Hours are cut drastically, they remove people without asking, and there is NO option to become full time EVER!"
bad,As a company Walmart is great. Unfortunately not all managers are consistent in there roles. Empowering your associates to do a job well it has to be a team effort. Not all members of the spearfish manage moment team know how to be a team
bad,"Low pay, treated like you're negligible, 40 cent raises per year, overloads you with work but no overtime ever. If you have overtime, you have to leave early during the week so you don't get more than your allotted hours. Wal-Mart truly is terrible company to work for. Oh, the health insurance sucks."
bad,"Wal-mart is a monopoly that is on the constant run to take down every aspect of competition. They do not care about anyone's personal well-being; if you are not in the loop, you are out--and you'll know and feel it. If you are lucky enough to work under a good store manager and work with working-associates, it could be an enjoyable experience."
bad,No staffing. If your sick you can not be excused even if u have a doctors note. Training is poor. Management does not listen to there associates. I like the costumer service working with my co workers.
bad,You will always have to cut mean either thick or thin you have to take to take care of customers and there is always something to take care of and always make sure the servixe is goos
bad,A typical day would be go into work and walk around watching people making sure the werent stealing merchandise. It was slow paced but would get exciting if you caught someone. When you made an apprehension you had to either notify the proper authorities or give them a warning based on amount stolen.
bad,"This job is all about politics when you're in the Salary Management positions. If you aren't liked, your job will be threatened weekly. There is absolutely NO training for management. There is a lot of management that will criticize you but never help you get better. They'll never encourage you or make you feel like an important part of the team. If you like to work 10-15 hours a day, 60-100 hours a week, have your days off here and there (never two days in a row), never have weekends off then this is the place to work. I tell people to NEVER go into management at Walmart. It is horrible."
bad,"Dealing with rude customers was the worst part of the job.  Management, at the store level, was always great.  Can't live off their pay, and the benefits were less than beneficial."
bad,"Stock new product on shelves and rotate product on shelves."
bad,Walmart was my first job out of high school and didn't quite have the work ethic to take this job seriously. Pay wasn't that great but loved all my fellow co- workers.
bad,"Pay isn't bad for the work, there is advancement but you better be ready to kiss butt to get there. They say hard work pays off but not here unless your in the ""click"". Benefits after you are fulltime for 1 year or part-time for 2 years."
bad,"Stress, lacks work life Balance in most positions.  There are some great people here, but there are some that only see bottom line as the source of managing."
bad,"Walmart pays well compared to other businesses in Kearney. However, the management makes things stressful and it can be complicated to work efficiently."
bad,I feel like I'm back in high school working here. The intelligence level is low and people that work there are backstabbing. There is barely any CSM support meaning that they  do not want to assist.  The most enjoyable part of my job is clocking out.
bad,"Never again. Everything about walmart made people want to rip their hair out. Managers wanted employees to work their school schedule around their work schedule, but it should be the opposite."
bad,"poor management, no full 40 hours. Very cold when working. Poor protective gear given. Have to buy more warm cloths and shoes. Steady pay check, not 40 hours. Great part its only 4 days."
bad,"This is a busy Wal-Mart, as it is the only one in the Kootenays so everyone from around Cranbrook comes shopping here.  It is just of the Highway that runs through town so it can be a very busy place."
bad,el ambiente laboral es pesado... hubieron casos en donde fui humillada
bad,"High stress environment.. Poor management.Not flexible on time or hours, must have open availability even if you have an additional job. Only plus is pay/stock purchase"
bad,"The management team at the Walmart I worked at stole a lot of goods from the store including T.V.'s and game systems, among other expensive items. They also tried to say on more then one account that they had lost my check and that it would take WEEKS for them to do anything about it. and when I tried to confront the management team they would elude me and come up with lies and excuses for why they couldn't help. However, there are a few members of management that are good, but they are outnumbered. Im very disappointed in the way the store was run. The main pillars of Walmart are customer service and everyday low prices, and there was neither one of those things in the Walmart I worked at."
bad,I felt my job was not respected by management. The time and effort that it took was overlooked. I was terminated for something that some one else did. Even though I had evidence and the person that did the wrong think would admit to it I felt pushed out the door so I did not fight it. The manager wanted various people out and he would have just found something else to get rid of us.
bad,"The workplace was fine the managers were the problem, they were new and very biased.if you could deal with it then it would be a good job for you just was uncomfortable for me."
bad,"It was an ok job, just can become stressful sometimes. The management was understanding SOMETIMES. But it was a decent paying job and it helped me get through college."
bad,"A typical day at work for me was setting up registers, delegating tasks, superintending breaks and lunches, dispersing loans, and overall helping my associates. I learned to take constructive criticism with a great attitude and apply those discussions to make myself the very best manager I could be. The management and workplace culture tended to be very strained and negative. The hardest part of my job was trying to communicate with others who tended to not want to participate in the team aspect. The most enjoyable part of my job was being there for me associates. I would often compliment them, focusing on what they were doing well so they would be encouraged to continue their good work. I enjoyed discussing their families with them and giving them the support they needed. As a manager, I work for my people. I am a leader, not a boss. Overall, considering the management and workplace culture, I would not recommend Walmart as a place of employment. There were some pros, but, unfortunately, the cons outweighed them."
bad,You can move up in the company really fast if you do your job and show up on time. The managers like to put people down for just about anything. The Csm's don't like to help the cashiers with customers
bad,"walmart only think about the job, not the poeple who work for them.they dont care about your personel life,or your plans, they want you at work even if youre sick, want you to work on your days off, no matter about what your plans are,forget your plans, walmart comes first, if not they will try to find a reason to get you fired, if you dont fit in they little circle, you dont belong. they have the buddy system.they write you up for being sick, give you steps, cant get more than three, another way to get you fired, long hours,and expect you to work long hours on your days off,hot warehouse and they expect you to perform one hundred percent, even the hottest part of summer,dont want you to take off a any reason,just want you to workso they get big bonuses"
bad,"I actually enjoyed the fast paced environment. I love to stay busy but the harder you work the more that is expected and less that is appreciated. I worked really hard every day in my position and had to go on maternity leave with prior bed rest. Between the extended leave and having to take off 2 weeks a few months prior because my husband was admitted into the hospital for his Cystic Fibrosis and very low lung function. They were very quick to take my position from me and post it for the over 12 weeks FMLA and did not bat an eye. They also tried to get me to step down before my leave because I wasn't moving as fast with pregnancy, I was expected to get more done at 8 months pregnant because of losing people; no understanding there at all."
bad,"In my 6 years of working, I've never been felt so disrespected, lied to, and treated like less of a human being."
bad,"A typical day a Walmart would consist of assisting customers, stocking shelves and cleaning the area. Shift vary from day to day, but associates have three weeks worth of schedules available."
bad,"overall lazy staff from my personal experience, far too much incompetence as well, ungrateful management who were very exploitative, Overall not a place you want to work. Very few redeeming qualities about the place but generally not a place you want to work at if you can find better."
bad,"I found you have no job security with this company, the turnover is very high below management level . Assistant manager and above the job security is next to  nothing, so you will be taking a risk in taking a position at assistant manager and above.level.."
bad,"There was lack of understanding, strife, contention,  partiality treatment toward relative that was hired. Worked with younger persons. Constant arguing, lack of professionalism, not preparing the work properly and safely. Anger and retaliation exhibited when  pointing out that work was not up to legal standards for patients. "
bad,Good job for anyone starting out in retail. give people hours based on how long you've worked there. Good training for anyone motivated to seek it out.
bad,"this job was very short, i thought it would be for most of the summer but it turned out to be a three week gig. management wanted things done in a specific manner."
bad,I have worked for Walmart as a Cart Pusher and I have never been looked at for advancement despite my 9 years of experience there and my college education
bad,They randomly cut ours. Management is not always friendly. Does not work with your schedule. Does not care about their employees. Just cares about money in their pocket.
bad,"At the beginning it was told to us by the higher ups that it was going to be a fun loving and family like workplace. And the first couple of months it was, then we had a full over haul of management, this is when everything got turned upside down. New management took over and just ruined this warehouse environment. The higher ups never talked with one another about what was going on in each department and just sat at their desks doing whatever it was they did."
bad,management is not professional at all and it seems like as a employee your not valued especailly if haven't been there long time. all about numbers to them. there no teamwork at all. poor training its like the set you up to fail i have two weeks of training that was basically driving equipment by three was on my own and after a month still learning and lost. job not hard after you know what your doing. culture mostly Spanish and guys so being a girl and white felt uncomfortable most of the time cause that mostly what is spoken there. and if make mistakes first thing they want to do is step you and turn over high especially if under a year with the company. best thing is the pay good. and warehouse is really dirty
bad,"At first, this job was well worth the effort I had contributed- the management was great, my coworkers were amazing, the customers were friendly, and the pay was decent. However, I started to have a lot of issues regarding management being deceitful and verbally cruel to many of my coworkers. Not every store is like that however. "
bad,"Not the best job, depends on the location of the store that you work at and management. A good manager makes you want to actually work, a bad manager makes everybody not want to be there."
bad,"Most companies, you'd think may care about your personal health. Walmart does not. Their policy states that they will continue to mark your absences EVEN  if you were to bring doctors notes. ALSO, bereavement is not excused either. It has to be someone like a close relative in order for the absence to be excused."
bad,"I didnt like working at walmart. They are very unorganized and management wasnt very good, I loved seeing new people every day and helping my customers out with picking out clothes or finding things that they were looking for."
bad,The pay was great but the management lacked effective communication skills and many safety concerns were overlooked on a daily basis. The associates health and wellbeing were rarely taken into consideration
bad,"This job is not for someone looking for a full time job. The management doesn't really care about it's employees. I enjoyed the postition and the co-workers. I loved interacting with customers on a daily basis. But as far as the work goes, they wouldn't hire you if you had any scheduling issues. You had to have open availability from 6am-11pm daily and they would drop your hours if you needed to change your availability. They claim there is no seniority, but there is."
bad,"It tends to take a month to get the items needed to do job."
bad,I enjoy produce and take great pride in my work. I enjoy most of the customers and give outstanding customer service.I have learned a great deal at walmart .The hardest part of my job is there is a lot of heavy lifting of freight on a daily basis which management does not appreciate . That is only part of the job.
bad,"Walmart is a place where you will get consistent hours, but they do not respect your life outside of Walmart. I had one manager that tried to work with me, but when she had to leave for surgery, no one else was willing to help me. They would say they were going to, but nothing."
bad,I did not enjoy the environment at Wal-mart. Employees did seem to care about the all the isles. I'am not even sure that the manager even know I excised. No once anknowleging me. Such a shame.
bad,I hated my cart pushing job. Despite them saying you can choose where you want to move up to after six months it NEVER HAPPENED!! I tried to move up to cashier or elsewhere and they said we'll see and it never happened. Its like they didn't care.
bad,Loved my job. I decorated cakes. But anytime I needed a manager for a customer they would never come or take for ever to come . I hope they have gotten better at this over the years
bad,"I was half trained, thrown onto the floor and told to ""have at it"". Most of my learning came from asking random questions of fellow associates. Yes, it was a steady job, and I never had to worry about getting laid off, but that's the only perk of the job."
bad,"My experience with Wal-Mart is not the same for other associates there. My experience was stressful and almost painful. I love my job and what I do, but being blamed for other people's mistakes and not being able to even speak your truth breaks down your resolve."
bad,VERY cutthroat. Everyone was against everyone else. Management was not unbias and had favorites. Rules everywhere and could be fired for any reason without review. Hard to avoid pitfalls and writeups because of the backstabbing.
bad,"Walmart had a family culture, but compensation was very low. No benefits for part time employees, which is almost everyone. Good for retail experience or starting work experience."
bad,"- A Typical Day At Work - "
bad,"En el dia a dia existen capacitaciones."
bad,The staff there wasn't to nice i didn't like this job alot everbody had bad attitudes they didn't have nothing to good to say about anyone it was very negative
bad,"Helped customers select products that best fit their personal needs."
bad,"This would be a great job for someone who is just starting out. Fun work environment. as a cashier if there's nothing to do, people watching is always a great pass time."
bad,"I started out working night shift where I would move palets out onto the floor and put the items away. I moved to day shift when my classes started up in the fall and then I worled in the electronics department. Very demanding job in terms of customer service, I would chat with customers as well as assist them in making educated purchases based around electronics. I would often be thrown around the store to different departments because of a lack of employees, it would be very frustrating especially because you had to get work done for multiple departments and would get in trouble if you didn't finish your main department. The management would be any where but near the workers, the back room would be overflowing with merchandise because some workers from earlier shifts didn't feel like working that day."
bad,"Could have been a location issue, but I had reported a coworker for repeated harassment, not only to me but to other coworkers, and nothing was done, so I left."
bad,"I learned how to be patient with customers, and I learned how to check items in a timely fashion. The management team was very unstable and didn't respond to work issues very well. There wasnt very much culture, everyone stuck to themselves. The hardest part of the job was getting along with people and staying out of workplace drama."
bad,"love working with my coworkers, job isn't bad.. for the most part management is ok..although you daily work load is very heavy and required to push the daily live freight.."
bad,"Retail can be fun and interesting, however if I had the 10 years or so to do it over I wouldn't have gone there. I was however given many opportunities for advancement, and was able to at least maintain my lifestyle on what they paid me."
bad,"Typical, assist customers, keep area zoned and organized.    Not relevant to desired job other than learning patience and more adequate people skills."
bad,"Walmart taught me alot about working as an cashier. Set the foundation as I provided a better customer service experience. However, that particular location the management lack understandment of my schedule. As to why I couldn't work some long hours  they had already provided without my consent."
bad,"Walmart often says it is all about advancement however when a position opens they don't inform anybody, they just hire somebody immediately without interviewing interested associates. The job itself isn't bad if you do not want to advance. Management chooses favorites and can sometimes be very cliquey."
bad,"You can be a hard worker and management will still find ways to set you up for failure and human resources turns a blind eye whenever confronted. For example, I was taken out of my own department to help a department I never worked in, and then was written up for ""lack of work"" when it was just a lack of knowledge of how to do the job being asked."
bad,The environment at Walmart was very stressful and unbalanced. The hours were not flexible and the expectations were unrealistic at times. Being in Management was extremely stressful under the conditions you were asked to work within
bad,I loved my job but having the store manger and market team only push for what bonuses they can make and their supervisors really hurt the people that actually make the money for Walmart. They can treat employees bad because they can and they can just rehire the worn out ones. THE OPEN DOOR PROCESS IS A TRUE JOKE.
bad,Good as a holdover job but do not put store management on resume. They would rather keep you at Walmart than helo you advance elsewhere. Terrible at honoring requested Paid time off. Terrible at honoring timely requests for time off.
bad,I like Wal-Mart as a job but having a good team of management makes all the difference in making it a career and growing with the company. Their are too many managers and people with authority and not enough team players.
bad,"The Ponca Walmart is the worst. Every time the District Manager came in, they were immediately surrounded by the management team and would not let the employees talk to the district manager. I have worked in other Walmarts and this is by far the worst ever."
bad,"At the pharmacy level it felt like corporate always had goals that included ways to make your job harder to do without your input.  They pushed ""model pharmacy"" on you and concerned themselves with how your workplace looks behind the counter, which often meant moving something you need for work every day all the way across the pharmacy from where you need it and threatening to write you up if it wasn't found in that location.  They wanted to push immunizations and required each store to hit an immunization goal, but it wasn't for public health and instead for the profit margins. They do prioritize the immunizations that they make more money on.  They will make promises and never come through with them.  At the store level there was a lack of respect and communication. It often feels as though management looks down on the pharmacy for one reason or another: workers at other stores seem to echo this."
bad,"If you want to work 3-11 pm a lot,work the holidays,and get moved around a lot ;Your in the right place. Do not get hurt on the job,Because,you will become a sudden Liability,and the management will try to find a way to get rid of you.Most,if not all of the people you work with outside management,are wonderful human beings;which is unusual ."
bad,"Be ready to eat,sleep, and drink Walmart. Management is terrible, but the associates are wonderful. Customers are mostly rude so be ready to hold your tongue."
bad,"There is NO training, every manager has their own agenda, and you get yelled at if you are doing something a manager tells you to do that conflicts with another managers agenda"
bad,"Working in walmart as a support manager was a very stressfulplace to work. It's good to work with most of the associates, but to work with the assistant managers and co managers, as for my experienced with them, i could say that they were the worst people I've ever work with. The hardest part of the job, maybe because I am a minority,its seems like I'm the only support manager and they want me to do all the works. The enjoyable part of the job, because the associates respect me as a support manager, so every I told them to do something they follow right away."
bad,"they a great schedule 4 days a week on the weekdays or you can 3 days on weekend,good pay rates,sometimes overtimes are mandatory,but most of the jobs are very phisycal,management is really sucks."
bad,"Its Walmart. Not bad, not good. Kind of felt like a cog in the machine that is Walmart. Pay is decent for what the job is; definitely a fair amount of work. Management was fine.Coworkers were fine."
bad,I use to be employed for them but I wouldn't say the experience was a good one. I started to experience health complications which needed minimal accommodation I followed proper procedure and still lost my job.
bad,"The job itself is very easy, and I really liked the challenge it made me bring to the Wal-Mart family. But truth be told, it's a horrible company to work for. Yes the benefits and pay is fair, but the managers and higher staff members take advantage of their position and favoritism other associates. The job itself is fair,  but I rate management a low score."
bad,"I love my job,wanted to stay there while i finish school, but wasn't happy the way management handle my injury or the way to handle the paperwork they sent to me"
bad,Walmart is a great place to work at to build a good mature mind frame to teach you good work ethics. Walmart is company that is steady changing for the company best interest but not the associates
bad,There is a lot of drama in all departments and the management is very slow and does not handle things to the professional level as they should. I recommend thinking twice before applying
bad,a typical day there was that you ran around and tried to hurry and put things on shelves all day or night. they try and push you to do stuff that youve never done before and put alot of stress on you while you try to be fat paced at putting items away and zoning.
bad,My main objective was to obtain stolen merchandise. I learned how to improve my communication skills while encountering various people. The hardest part of the job was deterring thieves from returning and reoffending.
bad,"This was my second time with the company. It was so much more different than the first. I helped put a new super center together and was hoping to get a supervisor position, but after getting my hours cut badly and such I had to leave."
bad,"It was a job "
bad,"I go into work and the store is a mess, they treat there hardest working employees the worse, while other people are just sitting or standing around doing noting. If you are one of upper managements favorites you get by with anything. If you Are A very hard worker then they push you to your limits."
bad,Really poor management. Associates are practically used as disposables and it's hard when you have to work and go to school working for a company like Walmart.
bad,Changing tires and oil all day was pretty fun. But most of the time all you did was clean up the shop and stand around waiting for someone to come in.
bad,"Working at walmart was good for a first job and nothing more. The employees made the culture, but sometimes too much gossip. Management their started off great, but when the old management left and new staff replaced them everything went down hill from the schedules to the workplace environment."
bad,"Wal-Mart just got bad really quick.getting off was great working with my crew was a pleasure, but management put unrealistic expectations on us most nights, then nights you would work a whole week or more...then have a day off and be right back...you felt like before you could get to move up they would bring someone in from another wal-mart...the culture was more like crew vs. management."
bad,"Bad management, they were never around. Very unorganized, poorly trained. Assist customers with anything product or store related. Maintain cash register."
bad,It is a lot of hard work. Managers are below average. Upper management sucks tremendously. Picking boxes all day sucks. Company doesn't allow for you to get many hours.
bad,It's ok place to work at. They pay is ok benefits are very great if you have a family. But I wish they supported family's more. More understanding then cut thoart. But that's was as my location.
bad,I worked a walmart for about six months as a cashier. It was okay but the store needs a lot of improvement. They only seems to notice you when you mess up not when you do a good job.
bad,Walmart used to be a great company to work for but with the current changes in leadership it is harder to work there.  They are laying off constantly and there is no trust in leadership anymore.  I wouldn't recommend working there for a few years or until the reorganization stops.
bad,its alright i mean you can do muuuuch better management is horrible i mean they dont know how to do anything they dont help at all and when you need them you cant find them and they also play favorites
bad,"There is little to no training for any positions in the management field if you are not becoming an assistant manager. The store I work/worked for is/was the bottom store of the market and even though I was brought on from outside the company into management  they acted as though I should know everything Walmart related.The lack of training, the constant failure of the upper management team to put out effective schedules, and the pressure the upper management puts on the entry level to work around their short comings makes Walmart, or at least store 5654 the bottom of my recommended places to work."
bad,They will give you hours and an acceptable wage however the culture is one of passing the buck and poor training. I learned inventory management skills basic understanding of retail work.
bad,"Its an okay job. Really depends on the people you're with. I didn't have great managers, so the job environment was less than ideal. After dealing with harassment from my department manager I decided it was time to go."
bad,"some unfair situation"
bad,"Not a very fun place to work depending were you are working in the store. electronics has a lot of customer interaction usually involves helping someone finding an item or has questions. Setting up pre-paid phone plans were the wort part of it having to basically call the customer service and having to deal with a machine or really terrible service, sometimes setting up a phone plan could take upwards of over an hour. the management can be pretty hit and miss."
bad,"Work life balance was less than adequate. Management was strong, but lacked the proper amount of employees to properly handle the tasks at hand. Not a great experience."
bad,I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart.  My job kept me running al the time and got to inact with a majority if the store.  Wal-Mart could do a much better job of paying and providing better benefits.
bad,"I worked at this job for almost 7 years and did not move up. I received good reviews every year that I was employed there, I took the management test and passed with a good score, and they always had an excuse why I was kept as a cashier, like they needed to find a replacement. I did the work of a department manager, but they didn't want to pay me for it."
bad,"I worked in the Connection Center. This dealt with setting up cell phone service contracts, troubleshooting cellular devices for customers, and stocking phone and phone accessories in the area."
bad,Not a good work environment. Doesn't pay enough and there is never a set work schedule. Will have multiple managers telling you to do multiple tasks at one time and wanting them all completed at the same time which is close to impossible.
bad,"It's an alright place to work. It's an alright rate of pay. "
bad,"Life at the distribution center. "
bad,Buen ambiente de trabajo y mal manejo de recursos humanos y jefe.
bad,The retail stores policies are based on the Store Manager's preferences. The candidate is selected for a positon prior to posting to internal employees.
bad,Not a job for everyone. I have been with the company for a long time and have seen a lot of changes; both policy and people. Can be a very fulfilling career if you desire to push your way up the management ladder.
bad,"If you're looking to move up,connect with customers and quickly earn raises Walmart is not the place for you. Although it is a great way to start working if you have little or no work experience."
bad,"The management was terrible, the pay was awful, the chance to move up was non existent, the associates customer service was a disaster, the employee to manager relationships didn't work"
bad,These jobs were heavy lifting and men's work but I did my job until I was put on disability in 2001. I worked six years at cassanos and three years at Walmart it was as though it took my body down so fast and i could not drag myself out of the store anymore i was in chronic pain all the time so I had to quit.
bad,"Work was long and repetitive. Customers tended to argue over every little thing. The store was always filthy, being in a bad neighborhood didn't help. Theft was through the roof and most customers were pretty gruff, you did get a few good ones, tho.. When I was moved up, my original manager threw a tantrum and got me moved back down because of simple miscommunication. None of the managers were on the same page and constantly went behind each other's backs to the store manager to try to get what they wanted. Bunch of toddlers running the store, honestly. The best part of the job was the people, both coworkers and customers. You tend to meet some interesting people and a lot of the people make a big impact on such a small part of your life."
bad,They don't really have the employees best interest at heart and are not very good to them. The managers at my location were so great but there was only so much they could do to fight the policies of the higher ups.
bad,"Manager was terrible, would book over my availability and would be demanded to work when I had college classes at that time. Would not suggest working there. Busy around christmas hours, overwhelming if you're not good with fast pace working. Lots of memorization. You have to ""sell"" people on the mastercard and they get mad if you don't reach their standards."
bad,Management knew their stuff the problem was that they had favoritism when it came to someone moving up in the company and that had a affect on the people that worked hard and wanted more out of the company.
bad,Worked excess hours under a lot of pressure and stress from management team. The was no work/life balance. Customers are rude and get away with returning used merchandise.
bad,"Worked 15 hour days five days a week.  Very tough physically and emotionally. ( I have gone into war in the middle east for my country and did not work this hard ) "
bad,"Absolutly dint enjoy this workplace need alot of work and communication . Hard on the back, very short breaks, disrespectful coustomers / employess and managers ."
bad,"it's a place to work just to have a job. you are just a number. if you cannot be there and what they want you to do, you will be replace before you know it."
bad,"Depends on your management team I have had really bad management and some alright managers. Overall my experience has not been too good, only pro for me is the pay. Besides that I cannot say I would recommend working here."
bad,"The associates are great people, but management is horrible. They are incompetent, lack empathy, play favorites, and treat their associates horrible. The benefits are good though."
bad,But don't get hurt on the job or you will lose your job by any means necessary. Other than that and long hours I up in it wasn't a bad company to work for. Help in the tle was very low
bad,"Management is worst than the associates with favoritism and racistism. They do not care about employees and our families, only their friends. Do not appreciate go workers and take all credit for themselves when corporate is around."
bad,"Severely understaffed and employees are overworked. Constantly written up for working over, but still expected to complete extremely large work load. Pays well, but the customers are extremely rude and often threatening."
bad,Considero a Walmart como una gran empresa a pesar de que tiene muchos defectos que deben corregir.
bad,"The work load for most stores is overwhelming, Managers lack understanding for incomplete  tasks when coworkers call in, or short staffed. Walmart's turn over rate is above 80%  Work atmosphere is unhappy."
bad,"Walmart is an okay company to work for. Yes the benefits are great, but managers show favoritism. They let one person get away with one thing, but don't let anyone else. They always think you're stealing. It's not somewhere ill work again."
bad,Good people to work with. If you wanted to advance you might have a chance but be ready to relocate. The pay was not that great and good luck getting on full time. They only are allowed so many full time employees per store.
bad,This company would be a whole lot better to work for if the dispatchers knew how to tak to and treat their drivers. Their very rude and they think they know everything. They're late most of the time getting the drivers out on their loads and they know nothing about setting up the drivers fuel cards correctly!
bad,"My personal experiences in the 5 years of working for Walmart vary."
bad,"The management were only out for themselves. I received no training, no one told me what to do most days, and I got yelled at for going on SCHEDULED breaks. This location and the other locations in my town are awful employers."
bad,The review I would give for this company would be souly based on the store that I worked at and other stores may not be as bad as the one I worked for. The most enjoyable part of the job was when it was time to go home for the day. The hardest part of the job was wanting to go into work.
bad,I learned that when your working you have to be productive willing to work hard and put in much effort as possible .it was easy sometimes sometimes it was hard most of all I just feel like the management and people that runs the store wasn't helpful or associate with the customers
bad,The working environment is a very steady yet easy working environment. They have excellent benefits they do not require too much work. The managers are pretty flexible
bad,"Working was the easy part, it was the management staff constantly getting in the way and making work harder then it needed to be that was the real issue. Management would constantly be upset we'd leave things in the walkway when we already have barely enough room to stand, requests for extra space dating back well before I'd started work there were constantly denied, equipment such as printers were old and constantly breaking but never properly replaced, and the constant condescension from some managers was unpleasant. Coworkers were all great people and supervisors were great, management staff wasn't all bad either, they just had no idea how to manage things."
bad,they say they treat everyone equal but they do not!! some associates can stand on there phone and play games but i got yelled at for not getting my work done!
bad,If you're not a member of the clique group then it's hard to get by. Preferential treatment given to those that are sycophants and others are given little support.
bad,I really like the job just couldn't move up in the company. I think if they offered advancement they would have more workers stay and make a career out of it.
bad,"Coach and train New and old employees. I do scheduling and enrollment. I managed 5 department through my career at "
bad,"Its a good place to get a job if you need one. Just do not look to get promoted if you are good at the job, such as stocking freight on shelves. Full time work is only made available for management positions and over night stocking."
bad,I liked the exercise working in different departments.  It was fast-paced work.  I had never worked overnight and eventually gave my two weeks notice because I couldn't sleep during the day.  I was almost in an accident one morning on the drive home.
bad,The person in charge up front at the moment as an assistant manager at my Walmart will treat you like a child. They have other coworkers tattling on eachother and if you switch jobs they don't actually compensate during your two weeks they just say they are then you have to miss the last week cuz both jobs are scheduled the same. They don't normally give you a regular schedule. I bet if you worked in a different department then cashier it would be perfectly fine when it comes to management. There's just new management that is very difficult to deal with in the cashier department. The actual coworkers you have are very nice though and no matter what department you will have good people to work with. It's just the main female boss up front you have to worry about.
bad,"Walmart is a double edged sword. Yes, if you put in the time you may make enough to support yourself and get some benefits, but it is really tough to get there."
bad,"working for Walmart has many great opportunities. there is great insurance available, treated equally, and fairly. scheduling is very flexible to fit each persons lifestyle."
bad,"- Typical day includes counting cash, bagging customers products, answering questions, helping out customer service associates,"
bad,"I enjoyed my paychecks from walmart but if youre a new hire..you have to come to conclusions that you are now a slave for walmart. Barely free time, and please dont miss any days of work. The management barely cares about you, because you can be easily replaced depending on where you work so its best to stay to yourself. The pay is good, breaks are reasonable when the manager remembers and its a very fast paced environment."
bad,"Poor management, drama, store manager is rude and ignored customers, too many unknown rule changes , shoes favoritism in certain employees, customer service stays backed up , management never backs up employees knowing when a customer is wrong or out of control"
bad,"At first, working there was great and my co-workers are nice & friendly to work with. But after four months, things become unwelcoming and atom-sphere each time i clocked in for work."
bad,"After working there for a while, the managers began to take advantage of me (abusing my available hours, scheduling me as full time when I was part time) etc."
bad,"I have learned in the 13 years that your really not valued as a worker,fufurthermore the new associate are making more and have no knowledge or have no ideal what they are doing."
bad,"They do not support management or associates. There is zero job security and it is now, more than ever, CYOA. After 17 years of service to the company in 3 different states, they terminated my employment for a social media violation.Yes, I am angry that they rid of me so easily, but I really feel like I have lost a family. Farewell"
bad,Management changes every 3 months so as soon as we get a new manager trained he/she leaves the department and we have to start all over again.  The employees keep the departments running not management.
bad,Good paying job with terrible hours. I would not recommend anyone with young children or any outside activities that they enjoy doing because the job literally takes up all of your time and energy.
bad,"Hours tended to vary, and coworkers weren't always pleasant. The job itself was okay and sometimes customers made it worth it to work there. It taught me how to better deal with people and their problems without letting it affect me so much. The hardest part of the job was the long hours of standing, and the most enjoyable part for me was getting to meet new and interesting people in my community."
bad,"Everyone you work with seems to try to the bare minimum to get by."
bad,When you try to explain something to a manager and all they can do is yell at you and talk to you with no respect for the job you have done or are doing. Not having the right equipment to do the jobs at hand it makes for an aggregated day but they still want you to be able to do the job. It's just hard to believe in the company & management.
bad,Then dont say anything. I received pay for the work I completed. the job is not hard. Overhead makes it stressful.its best to keep on looking.
bad,"Working at WalMart is basically a last resort for a lot of people. It sounds good on paper, sure. You get all these fancy benefits and such, but then they added Paid Time Off, which is basically that you no longer have holiday pay, but you can earn so many hours for PTO. Nothing extra for working those holidays anymore. Yeah, they still have bonuses. But when you get cut down to 18 hours a week because they don't need you, that's a problem. You make just enough to get stuck there, because no one else is willing to match wages if you haven't learned a trade, but too much so you don't qualify for food stamps or any government assistance. They treat their employees poorly, and the employee turnover rate is abysmal because they don't care about their associates."
bad,Worked for this company a total of 16 years.  They have no loyalty to their workers only for the dollar.  They expect people to do things that are unreasonable.  I did not realize this until I became a member of management.  They want numbers in safety and well as production and preach for these things but do not always follow that when it comes right down to putting this on paper.  They will ask you to do things and overlook things until they want to use it against you.
bad,"Certain management members were very unprofessional and you were constantly been told to by one manager to do something else than what another manager told you to do. When you told them this management would get upset and tell you just to do your job. However, when the managers tell you to do many different jobs and then blame you for not getting them all done because they pull you in all different directions and do not communicate with one another I felt this was wrong."
bad,A good place to learn about retail I work in many areas and I always learn something new I meet many different people. I have a very good chance of moving up in the company.
bad,"Decent work place, but when your working overnight stocking, there's no Management support."
bad,"Okay I have heard many people complain how bad Wal-Mart executives and managers treat employees, from several various states."
bad,"the company treats their employees like slaves, and its goes all the way up the ladder. its seriously not the place to work unless you're a kid trying to get your first job and have zero intention of staying."
bad,So many good people working here and always a few bad eggs too.  It was always interesting to watch the Ast. Managers leadership styles.  A few dictators and a few collaborative players.  Also fun to watch the dictators get rolled out the door.
bad,"A typical work day at Walmart is face paced and most time stressful. Being able to have patience and hard working ethic is a must."
bad,Stocked soft lines daily. Was used in other departments as needed. Cashiered as needed. Most of upper management didn't know my name. Enjoyed working with customers.
bad,"good day, you sometimes get those customers, but managers are there to help you out if you get stuck , sometimes might take them a while to get to you but their there."
bad,if you need money it is a job. this company offers a vastly different things and place to be worked . it once offered stable opportunity of employment. a learning experience is offered and there are times of advancement.
bad,First few weeks you will like it; but after a while you will stop caring and give up. Majority of the associates say that management is one of the worst they have ever seen.
bad,"Working at Walmart is relatively straight forward, especially at the entry level. Attendance is a must as with any job, and while direction can be a little vague there is always plenty of onsite leadership to give clarification and training to the self motivated. Because the field level at Walmart engages is such a diverse range on enterprises I think that it is a great place to receive experience and training in a number of fields. I find it a rather ideal place for someone looking to test a few career paths before settling on a direction."
bad,"A typical day at work is working on the cash register, greeting customers, cash handling, bagging items, making sure area is clean, asking customers if they are ready to check out. What I learned is how to pay customers credit card bills on the cash register, I also learned how to load gift cards with money. The management is pretty good. There are different managers each day you work or sometimes it may be the same one. The workplace culture was somewhat nice. Some people were rude and then others were nice. The hardest part of the job was making sure customer didn't leave there bags behind. The most enjoyable part was employee appreciation day."
bad,"Work consisted of stocking shelves and helping customers, I obtained experience in cooking, cleaning (from past experience in deli), and merchandise. Environment was fast pace and productive and i enjoyed working with team members and management to find solutions as well as helping customers."
bad,There is a lot of communication issues within the big stores. Some employees myself included are treated unfairly. Clientel varies from store to store.
bad,"While the job asked is pretty standard, management will always figure out a way to cut your hours while increasing your workload. On top of that, no communication is made between higher-ups which leads to conflicting tasks and conflicts arises. Multiple promises have been made regarding our hours and none have been kept. As of right now, we were supposed to keep our 37.5 hours a week due to low staff and yet, everyone has been cut by a day. Due to the low wage, a lot of the staff has looked into a second job or an entirely new job to stay fed. However, when you work hard, your immediate superior will definitely notify you and give you the proper thanks."
bad,"You meet a lot of great people.  I have not had the greatest experience with upper management, but lower management has been great! The job itself is very easy and you don't have to have too much going on upstairs to understand what to do.  A typical day at work starts off for me early in the morning, I help out my department manager by splitting the load.  We then take our freight from the truck that had arrived and we work everything into its proper home.  Through out the day we get more freight to be worked, as we are working freight we also zone up the area to make it look nice and so the prices reflect the accurate products.  Essentially that is all that is done.  Personally I would help out management in getting the sections refreshed and I would be in charge of setting up and painting all of the Demo units, i.e. Tablets, TV's, Laptops.  I would also help out in the similar departments to electronics, so Wireless Phone Center, Photo Center, and the Online Pickup Center.  It is a fairly relaxed job with the occasional unhappy manager.  You could do the absolute best that could possibly be done and some managers just can't be pleased, but you try your best anyways and make your self and everyone else pleased.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with particularly difficult customers and managers, other than that it is fairly easy.  The most enjoyable part was definitely the friends you make on the job.  Over all it is not a bad or hard job at all, but it is not something you would want to do for the rest of your life either.  So it is a good temporary job to help you"
bad,"Se hablaba mucho sobre la politica de puertas abiertas y eso nunca sucedio, la subgerente de la empresa era una persona a la cual todo los empleados temian y de ella nunca se pasaba como conducto regular, si algo a ella no le parecia o no le gustaba, lo mas probable es que a fin de mes estuvieses despedido."
bad,"Wal-Mart is typically understaffed so you have a great opportunity to learn and grow by helping in other areas of the store. It's easy to advance if you work hard, stay friendly, and have good time management skills. It is a fast paced environment where you have the ability to learn many customer service skills and work with merchandise."
bad,Walmart could be a great company to work for depending on the location. Management at my store makes it really hard to enjoy the work environment. They also have great pay and they also give you the hours you ask for.
bad,"It's a job... you'll be working they will see to that you won't have a life. Most the managers are ignorant,talk to u like a child,you don't get overtime..."
bad,The customers can be the best and worst part of your day.It was an experience that I do not regret. Management do not have your back. They will tell you one thing and tell somebody else different.
bad,"Walmart in my opinion is micro-managed and unorganized. The rules and expectations change from manager to manager. The pay rate is exceptionally poor for the ever increasing work load placed on associates. The training is done mostly hands on but begins with a tiresome extensive online orientation. All of my daily tasks are fairly simple minded. My co-workers are friendly but inconsistent. We struggle with completing a work load we are not efficiently staffed for."
bad,The management at this location was super lowsy as in they wanted me at two locations at the same time...this was very undoable given the situation at hand.
bad,Benefits are pretty good for full-time. Pay is not really an issue. Scheduling is always a problem and management dose not adequately address issue. CSM's have a ton of responsibility.
bad,When Wal-Mart opens a store they take a lot of Store and Co managers that are not doing good and give them one last shot before they fire them. this creates a lot of turn over as Wal-Mart opens new stores
bad,Walmarts management treated employees like we were expandable and that is not how you run a business. The associates were great to work with. Unfair Treatment
bad,A nice place to work while you look for a better job. Some management are ok. Expectations are high for low pay. hours vary. lots of week ends worked.
bad,I worked in the toy department and we were always busy. They asked a lot out of us for only $9 an hour. The hours you have to work if you have family were always terrible.
bad,"Walmart can do better, they can give steady hours instead of all across the board, They can give regular jobs of at least or close to 40 hour per week to every employee that wants it instead of making them grovel and get second jobs.They can also provide all benefits to all their employees instead of making us pay more to get our own. I have never worked for such a backwards company hence why I went to college and now looking for a way better job.!!!!"
bad,Estresante.  Es un ambiente muy pesado...ya que no recibes capacitacion alguna...
bad,a typical day at work is being given  a task and seeing things through from top to bottom. assisting associates in areas that they need help in also making sure the job is getting done effectively making sure your cashiers get their breaks and lunches. being able to interact with customers of all races and creeds makes everyday interesting and a positive challenge.
bad,Lazy management has created a poor work environment for me so I am seeking other employment. I am not appreciated in any of my work. This company claims to be one big family but in my experience as well as my co- workers we are second rate citizens.
bad,"ok place to work, c-workers are good people and help with job. Management wasn't really good. Hardest part of job was unloading trucks with more than 1500 boxes. Best part of job was hour breaks"
bad,"Horrible company to work for with little chance of advancement unless you are one of the favorites. Great coworkers,horrible management. expect more out of you then most"
bad,Environnement très promoteur. je travaille en équipe avec mes collaborateurs.
bad,"General day at work consists of coming in and cleaning up after the previous shift (ie. taking back there trash and cleaning work surfaces)"
bad,A decent job and the work is very simple and straightforward. The employees really make the work environment a solid experience. The main problem is the managers. The are very bad with communicating with each other and a majority of them do not know how to talk to employees. They make the job harder than it need to be at times.
bad,"A typical day at Walmart would be worrisome, exciting, and all friendly for the most part. All your friends happen to stop by once and a while, nice place."
bad,can be a bit much managers can rude or nice depending on the person but thats expected any where you go the work wasn't difficult and the people are kind
bad,"I started out loving the job, I felt respected and made a lot of headway in learning the processes. I was trained by floor management because I let them know I was interested in promoting and worked hard at it. They told me they have a 6 month minimum before you can promote, which is understandable. Then things started going south. They hired in 3 employees as cashiers and promoted them immediately to the position I wanted. When asked about it, they claimed these people had previous experience, despite one having been fired from walmart multiple times, and the other not even having walmart manager experience. Then the location I was at was robbed 5 times in a month. I asked to transfer because I didn't feel safe, and was met with criticism from management calling me ""thin-skinned"" for not being able to deal with it. They also wouldn't let me transfer."
bad,"When i entered work , its just another day ! I have learned that even though customers get mad at an associate you always have to remain calm and collective . The management are very friendly and always know what they are doing when it comes to helping customers . Coworkers are always welcoming when coming to their shifts and end of shift , smiling and interacting with regular customers . I don't think there's anything hard about the job but to have great customer service and for always have a smile . The most enjoyable thing about when coming to work is to have a smile and work !!!"
bad,"employees are cool but not the managers . You have some managers who cares for you but most are snobby and rude with no hearts. The pay is not that good , theyll have you doing a whole lot of work for little money"
bad,A typical day at work was pretty fun and i offered excellent customer service.learned from all of the different customers personalities.
bad,"You definitely feel like a cog in a machine. Managers barely remember your name unless you're a pet or a troublemaker. You're required to do an outstanding job regardless of training. Constantly moved from one area to the next with little training in that specific area and then was reprimanded for not knowing the position. Expected to be a swiss army man who could do it all, but only wanted to pay me for the one position."
bad,"Job field could consist of better management overall, better personalities all around the store and just a better environment."
bad,Walmart is sometimes a busy place where you need to be fast paced. It teaches you how to interact with customers. You also come across new people daily which can be exciting.
bad,Responsible for making provisions for quality customer service delivery. Providing a prompt response for inquiries regarding merchandise availability. Safe guarding all displays and merchandise. Filling back stock or warehouse when the shelves are out of stock. Adhering to the rules and regulations of safety. Providing effective help when requested by customers onsite. Responsible for offering and providing assistance with unloading of merchandise and uploading stock. Committed to providing the excellent customer service to address all customer concerns.
bad,When i had my first job in the US i was so proud that i get to own a little cash in my pocket. Most of my co-workers were really nice and helped me understood all of the job duties. I learned how to use different kind of equipment's due to floor and carpet cleaning.
bad,"The pay is not large enough to give up my personal life. There is no work life balance for assistant managers in complex stores. I have never left work on time in the past 2 years that I've been with company. The earliest I have left work was an hour after I was supposed to get off. Depending on your upper management, my job is more dreadful because some managers are condescending."
bad,"my typical day at work would involve joyful dedicated and easy to work will all individuals. I am very energetic and like to complete all tasks at the end of my day. I am a very well organized person work and at home, that makes my day much easier. I like to see people with smiles on their faces everyday and for them to be able to smile back at me, that gives me confidence in myself knowing that I done right."
bad,it was cool laid back like the people there it was different getting to work with the customers and stuff and seeing new people everyday
bad,Muita falta de organização de seus gestores. neste ponto o Wal mart deixava muito a desejar.
bad,Putting out stock and zoning in my area. I learned how to merchandise product. Co-workers were okay and the hardest part of the job was trying to get out all of the freight. The most enjoyable part eas making new friends.
bad,"There is so much unprofessionalism going on in the Walmart I worked for. It's really not worth the effort to put into it. The management is very disorganized and everyone is cliquey. If the management doesn't like you, you'll be out faster than you can say ""see ya later."""
bad,The worst job i have ever had.  Rude people and very unorganized.   I would not recommend working there. And the people that shop there are even worse.   Trust me not a good place to work for.
bad,Most days were busy so it kept me working at a nice fast pace and made my shift go quickly. I enjoyed the job itself but not so much the environment around me.
bad,I started out young and found it hard to advance any further within the company. They gave more opportunities to people outside the company rather than within. The team I worked with didn't take their jobs as serious as I did so it was difficult to work with some individuals.
bad,"They cut hours way to much and make it hard to earn a living here. My checks have been cut about 100 to 200 dollars, they have no one to help us when needed and make us feel underappreciated."
bad,The company provides good healthcare and great PTO. That being said employee morale is incredibly low. Management teams do not communicate and as a result the employees suffer.
bad,The work wasn't bad at all for just being a cashier but the management was very childish. They don't care about anyone but themselves and they all clique up like high school students which made it not so great of a work environment.
bad,Work to pay ratio was satisfying however the Management for Walmart could use some better training for their positions.
bad,When I first come in i bake all the bread and then get all the doughnuts ready. then i put all the breads in the bags and label them. i put all the doughnuts in the cases and get everything ready to open.
bad,"I was hired as a stocker, but they still put me on the front registers, which I didn't like having customer after customer with no breaks. Managers treat regular employees like they don't matter."
bad,"Wal mart doesn't really take care of their associates or customer as they portray. It is unfortunate. If they had better customer and associate relations, it would be a great place to work."
bad,"I was an order filler for a walmart distribution center. I enjoyed the people that I worked with and they were very helpful. Nobody tells you what you're in for when you start working there. You hear the same things, ""It's a very physically demanding job"", ""Work safe"", things like that. "
bad,Work load is always straining. Management keeps employees under constant pressure with impossible standards. The only benefit is there are usually promotion opportunities because people are constantly quitting.
bad,"Al llegar al inicio del turno constatar que los guardias hayan llegado y disponer la distribucion de los puestos, luego revisar la sala de ventas y ver que todo este en su lugar, coordinar las colaciones del personal  y mantener al personal en alerta ante cualquier evento."
bad,Departments didn't work with eachother there were times i didnt get my breaks because no coverage and css wouldnt help because of some scoring system
bad,muy presionado cada día por la presión de los socios y gerentes de la empresa.
bad,"The neighborhood walmart on 90th and blondo is probably one of the worst jobs we have ever come across. Most unorganized and horrible management, favoritism is huge in this store when it comes to employees. Not sympathetic at all to sickness, injury or family related problems. do not work here you will regret it."
bad,My review is only for 1 year because production was so slow that they let most of us go. We were laid off and that was a terrible thing.
bad,"Though a few of the managers respect their best workers, in general nothing you do is ever enough."
bad,I found it boring at times. Not challenging and does not pay well. I worked part time while I was going to college so I didn't qualify for any health ins.
bad,"At the beginning of the day, I would assist any customers needing help. Then I organized and cleaned the deli. I also helped by assigning tasks to other associates. It taught me to work with others. I gained leadership skills, as well. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to interact with people daily, and the most difficult part of the job was time management when the store got busy."
bad,My first experience was amazing. I had to leave the second. It is a job. Pay is not great and medical benifits are the worst for any job I have ever had.
bad,Fixing broken machines and doing building maintenance. I was present for the overall renovations and installed overhead and lense generator conveyor.
bad,"I get there at 3 and unload a truck then we take all of what we unloaded to the sales floor and stock it. We go for lunch at six, get back at 7. From there we take merchandise from the backroom out to the sales floor and stock it and then go home at 11."
bad,"Like may companies today, Walmart is trying to get more work out of fewer workers.  "
bad,"My typical day at work is like i come in to under stocking & constant fussing. I had to pull the weight of my other coworkers to help my shift run smoothly. I would be called on break to assist in other issues in other departments. "
bad,"Walmart was a awesome experience when it came to meeting different kind of people and having a comfortable uniform but besides that it was pretty bad for me, I was a cart pusher that did alot of everything but didn't get paid for it at all, they had me pulling from trucks, stocking shelves so many other tasks that were not in my job description. they were not willing to promote me to any other position when asked."
bad,Normal day there was usually busy. I learned things i had forgotten. management wasn't the greatest. co-workers didn't know what teamwork is. hardest part of the job was the lack of staff. most enjoyable part is that i walked to work.
bad,"a carga horaria era bastante , e o salario era muito pouco , a empresa nao se importava muito com a vida pessoal era cada um com seus problemas"
bad,"My favorite part of the job is the chance to help people and to make at least a small part of their day better.  A photograph can mean so much more than just an image on paper."
bad,I go in to work and find myself fixing managers job. I learned that you cannot rely on a manager at Wal-Mart to help you because they are to busy taking multiple breaks. The co-workers at my Wal-Mart are kind and underappreciated. The most enjoyable part of my job is assisting the customers to the best of my abilities.
bad,Wal-Mart was an enjoyable job overall when you consider the employees. The company was constantly changing policies without informing staff. Management had poor communication skills. Training was close to none. One day on hands with another associate and then you were left alone. I was there for slightly over 5 years. I enjoyed working with most of the customers. Most of them were friendly and considerate.
bad,"You'll either burn up or freeze depending on which side of the building you work on.  It's physical if you like an upper body 10 to 12 hour workout. Prepare to be an order filler for a very long time before you can transfer to some other job.  "
bad,"The work was pretty straight froward, but found the tasks repetitive. Could have used more constructive criticism from management vs the methods I encountered. Overall was not satisfied and is the reason I left...."
bad,"A company geared toward providing low prices at any cost necessary. If you are planning on taking post-secondary courses, cashier would be your go-to position in this company."
bad,"Great employees and management most of the time, but the low pay and virtually useless benefits make Walmart a place to work if you want to gain some experience and take your skills elsewhere."
bad,This was not the best environment to be in but it paid the bills so I couldn't complain. hardest part of the job was that we were very understaffed so it was basically twice the work for a fraction of the pay.
bad,I want to work for a company who is proud of myself and the skills I possess. I also need a job who helps me put school first and is willing to be flexible with my school hours. Walmart as a company can not provide that for me. I do not regret working for Walmart because I have learned so many skills such as customer service skills and management skills. I have enjoyed working as a team with my many coworkers and seeing them as a part of my family.
bad,Great people and great team workers. management at Walmart is very open to all of your concerns and needs. Walmart has a lot of opportunities for u to their. The hardest part of the job is when we are short staff. But the most enjoyable thing are the different  people you meet every day.
bad,"Some days suck and some don't. There are co-workers that are very friendly and are willing to help in any way they can while other less pleasant co-workers will find anyway possible to make work stupidly stressful. Customers vary from person to person on manners and behavior. Work isn't so bad, some days your rushing for 8 hours to finish, others are slow and a bit more lid back."
bad,"I enjoyed working with the public providing excellent customer.  I learned that the  culture there was not as publicized."
bad,I enjoyed the overall learning experience. The management didn't care about the store and when working as a team the team is only as strong as its weakest player.
bad,"Company allows you to move and keep a job as long as incoming store has a position."
bad,A nice place to work until you find something better i found walmart as a stepping stone to glazers I took what I learned at wal-mart and put it to good use at glazers
bad,overall Walmart is a good company full of opportunities but not fair when it comes to flexibility some of my co-managers are fair but others show favoritism to some associates the hardest part of the job was backroom unloading the truck the most part i enjoyed was helping customers and learning new things about Walmart everyday.
bad,"there managers really need some Improvement with the emploeys "
bad,"i will learn at work like how a wrork of america it looks like,"
bad,"Work was pretty simple, but there was always a shortage of employees to work. Lots of work was left for other shifts because management would not schedule people to help. This ended up causing fights between first and second shift more often than not, lots of complaining and many call-outs. Also caused bickering between department managers; when you only have one person available to help a manager and you have to decide where to send them between five areas that need help, you can't make everyone happy. When you have a truck coming in 5-6 days a week you need someone to work that truck. "
bad,"The typical day at Wal-mart, is busy you are always short handed when it comes to the food side. You learn to manage you time and learn you priorities, and that it easier to work as a team to succeed. The hardest part is when you have call in and you get slam with customers and you cant slowed down to breath. The most enjoyable that I loved was decorating cakes."
bad,Management at Wal-Mart was sub par to say the least. Instead of doing things the easy it was always the hard way. Definitely not a company that values it's employees.
bad,"aprendi mas sobre el cobro en caja, trato con el cliente y corte de caja. Aprendi a estibar y a hacer mas ordenado asi como tambien trabajar en equipo. Tambien aprendi a desarrollarme en el ambito de salchichoneria."
bad,"I worked at Walmart. I don't miss it, although there were some good things about it."
bad,"I was glad to finally get hired after applying for 4 years to this company and even though the work is physically demanding, the pay was decent. But the employees could be treated with a little more respect from other employees to upper management."
bad,it was nice people where nice but management sucks but they will not help me go to collage I need days I work overnight they will not switch me over
bad,"I worked as a cashier and then got promoted to a Customer Service Manager within 3 months of working there. I practically worked 35 hours a week and the work load was too great for the small amount of employees there so the work that was done for the amount we were making was not worth it. The management tried their best, but still sucked at doing their job. Since Walmart is a corporation, they really weren't given the tools and resources to make work easier. The coworkers were okay but too many teenagers worked there which made the work environment too lax. A lot of them did not take their job seriously and were lazy. I absolutely hated it there after I realized that they were not going to hire anymore customer service managers to evenly distribute the workload; especially since Walmart Customer Service Managers make less money than many other establishments."
bad,"Manage employees to stock freight overnight, scheduling, hiring and training. I work 4 nights a week, 13-14 hours a day. I enjoy my employees."
bad,Working with walmart and the employees was a great experience but when I requested hours to be changed on weekends due to MY FAMILY they refused to change them and insisted i stay with the hours that i have been given.
bad,We are always at working trying to fix other people's mistakes. The Sr. management makes guidelines and procedures but no one follow through with them.
bad,"a typical day at Walmart Distribution Center is riding on Powered equipment lifting thousands of products with a certain amount of time to finish your trip. My co-worker are very hard working and fun to work with. I have learned, without the Distribution Center none of products would not be available for Walmart customers. The hardest part of the job is lifting thousands of pounds, which can be physically demanding on the human body."
bad,the managment at walmart need to learn how to communicate better.  also if a person is in a managment position they shouldn't treat people like they are a piece of garbage and treat all people like they would like to be treated
bad,"Abusive, toxic environment. My supervisor was extremely hostile towards me due to the fact that I was a woman. I was the scapegoat to my supervisor, and the rest of my team decided that treating me in such way was the ""cool"" thing to do. I dealt with severe discrimination and harassment; which they did absolutely nothing about. My supervisor also Favorited, and refused to communicate with me about any important information. Managers constantly talked negatively about other employees."
bad,"Unloading trucks is an intense job where you aren't given enough time, space, or any kind of lenience. They have an extremely high turnover for the job, and it's easy to see why. Also the job is far more difficult than it should be for the amount they will pay for it."
bad,Good job stability. As long as you show up you have a job. Management is reasonable and will work with you. Defers in stores whether advancement is possible or not.
bad,"Employees acted unjustifiably arrogant and superior to newcomers, management drops the ball on training, employees are rude to new employees who are attempting to learn processes, assigned overwhelming work early on while my experienced individuals worked inefficiently. Culture developed by employees and not monitored by management is full of machoism and and unsupportive qualities."
bad,"walmart es muy buena empresa lastima que no cumplen las reiglas que tienen"
bad,being very busy with customers i learned alot ordering merchandise  checking in merchandise setting shelves some managers were better than others coworkers were great managers changing all the time and each having a different expectation how busy  and all the things i got to do
bad,"Ok so Walmart was at first an awesome place to work for. Advanced quickly within 6 months I would say from sales associate to Customer Service Manager. It was managing all cashiers, sales associates and manning the money for cashiers. Dealing with customers that might have had issues with cashiers was sometimes trying due to if they were angry about something that the cashiers couldn't help with. Professional is key with dealing with angry customers.  My co-workers were a very enthusiastic group and always lending a hand. I loved working with all of them. Like with many jobs we all want something a little better for yourself and the family. So another adventure to a better job was in my path."
bad,"Friendly environment, but is very stressful and dreadful. I was able to learn simple tasks in terms of, cooking, cleaning and customer service skills."
bad,"My experience was not good.  The job duties/requirements were fine, but the environment was not.  High turn over of managerial staff left the store without a vision; the store had a huge problem with theft, and a ho-hum attitude by most of the employees.  All attempts to improve moral or instill excitement were forced, without any sense of sincerity.  Hopefully, the management has improved and conditions at this particular store have improved."
bad,I used to work very hard almost everyday to get paid minimum wage as a Inventory Associate (CAP Team). Then I had a medical condition that I couldn't do my position so I asked them to switch me and instead they said that I voluntarily left. The managers do not care about their workers. I also ended up having back problems because of what they were asking me to do.
bad,"Depending on your department, you usually do pre-assigned tasks. Assistant Managers rotate every 6 months, which means you have to ""re-learn"" the expectations of your assigned job every time there is a switch. Hardest part was completing assigned tasks plus other tasks that were assigned to you throughout the workday, and then getting ""yelled at"" for not completing the original tasks. For the most part, I had a fixed schedule so I knew what I was going to work up to a 3 week period."
bad,"Working with Walmart was a good experience for me. I enjoyed it when I first started out. The benefits of working with Walmart are outrageous. If you work there for a good amount of time you are eligible for health insurance through the company, and you also get a discounted card, which is much like a debit or credit card but it just holds your discount on it. Those things are very nice to have and to look forward to. Everyone is kind to each other. It's not bad. Just a usual workplace. But as a student in college, this work place just got tougher on me. They work you shifts, which is great. You've got first, second, and third shifts. I find this workplace better for people who've got families, and who are wanting to retire. Being in college and working with Walmart is hard. Shifts are what make it hard. The managers do work with you on hours, but even when you get those hours fixed you're not making enough to make a healthy life style out of it. It's decent. The way I see it, is if you're a student and working here then you've got to pick one or the other. And don't get me wrong I love to work. But this workplace just wasn't cutting it for me."
bad,"usually you would clock in and get ready to sweep floors for a few hours. on your feet the whole time. you have to make sure everything from floors to bathrooms to outside is clean and spotless. waxing floors was fun with co workers,"
bad,had not very much help wasnt my cup or tea. didnt like when i needed help always having to wait and having people wait in a long line because they were to busy talking.
bad,"Wal-Mart was very short-staffed. A lot of departments were behind or the employees pushed themselves to do the extra work. I learned how to cut and measure fabric, bin products, and use the phone system that they had. I gained extra customer service experience, but I don't wish to work there again."
bad,Company has a lot of upside but have a ton of downs that will probably never change in regards to how employees are treated and how management does actual get opportunity to develop and grow employees.
bad,"Walmart is a deceitful place. I would not advise anyone to work here. They are a company that is solely focused on money above else. The employees are nice to work with, management is generally okay. But Corporate is where it's messed up. In 2016, they raised all wages to $10.00 and hour and the proceeded to slash hours, mine were cut in half. The employee discount applies to everything but food, which is where most employees would spend money. Why do they do that? Because they're too worried about the money they would lose on that 10% off the employees get whilst buying food."
bad,"My typical day at work, I always did my best to stay positive and hope for a great day but, during the course of the day something would go wrong and killed my mood"
bad,"typical day at work, some nice workers, Great customers. Managers are not easy to get along with and there is favortism. I have a great boss, he is very sweet and understanding"
bad,It's Walmart. They epitomize the concept of getting as much return as possible for as little investment as possible. Most of all the management really needs to remember where they came from.
bad,Not somewhere i'd consider again because they don't care... sorry to say but its all about the money with this place. not enough pay
bad,"Les hace falta respetar los horarios de las personas, y dejar de presionar tanto a los directivos para hacer un mejor ambiente laboral"
bad,The people I worked with where amazing. You just have to be strong working there if you are not the customers will run all over you.
bad,"Got hired, went to orientation. The next work day that I was scheduled it was for the CBT well during the training I started having pain in my side. Left early and i went straight to the ER. The next day was Friday well I arrived at 8 am the manager told me to wait for the lady in personnel so I waited couldn't clock in well its 9 am still she hadn't gotten there an neither did anyone come to check on me to see if I need help with anything finally I found someone to help got clocked in after an hours an some min started my cbt got finished an went up front for training well that night I gotten sick again tried to call out but for some reason i was asked for a win num didn't have one Tried to reach someone in personnel again no answer so couldn't call out after I gave up on calling so I assumed I was terminated but I saw how unprofessional things were so I didn't return. Now I'm having the same issue with getting paid. Either this lady isn't picking up or she's always gone for the day. I requested a money pay card twice during two diff days didn't receive one well crazy I was terminated when I did what I was told to do when calling out but it's not my fault the store is not professional. I'm seeking a lawyer I'm done playing with these people."
bad,"Working for Wal-Mart is like riding a bike...except the bike's on fire, and you're on fire, and everything's on fire."
bad,"I only enjoyed certain aspects of this job. Management was very helpful, but the associates I worked one on one with lived on drama. There was nothing but gossip about everything and everyone. No one was safe there when it came to the continuous gossip. "
bad,Working at Walmart was okay. I didn't like how the management treated their employee's though which is the reason why I left. They just treated us like they we all were just a burden in their day.
bad,"I enjoyed work for over a year it was challenging and faced paced I had some problems but nothing that wouldn't be expected with any supervisory job. Up until the assistant manager left the person who replaced the previous supervisor drove employee after employee out with her rude, brash behavior until the whole workplace environment was changed."
bad,Walmart is a good company to work for with the intentions of advancing into a better position. The most enjoyable part of my day is interacting with my other coworkers.
bad,Work consists of senior leadership second guessing your work. Learned to always have numbers to back performance. Management is unaware of daily operations.
bad,"A typical day involves heavy contact with the public.  I learned how great the public can be when they are treated well and leave the store smiling.  Management at Walmart is very good at the top level, however, the quality varies at each individual store.  Since their minimum wage was raised to $10.00/Hr they have become micro-managers at the front of the store.  My co-workers are great, very caring individuals."
bad,While the job itself isn't to bad. The inconsistencies and non-communication between members of management makes this job unbearable.
bad,"I enjoyed working in the fast paced, team oriented, customer service industry.  I worked with many people, handling the phones, filling paperwork, taking care of each and all of my customers,"
bad,"Typical Day:"
bad,"It is a very stressful place to work. Whether you are forced to take on the tasks and areas that other people are supposed to look after, or because of your lack of training that you are hit with angry (job security) threats and verbal attacks. "
bad,I loved my job and want i did. Policies that are in place is and does cause problems with life.My customers were great. I always had great feedback from my customers. I did my job very well.
bad,"I loved working at Walmart. I had the best co workers, the shift worked great in my life. I overall had a good experience while working there. I had one manager which everyone had a problem with."
bad,To easy but if cart boys need help and you are a male cashier you will be slotted to help push carts the rest of ur shift. Csm shows you qtrly performance and its irritating. Who cares if you ring up 115 items per hour.
bad,First and foremost it's good pay .. However the hours they give you are random especially when you turn in a work availability management in electronics will still schedule you ... I go to school as well and lost my 2 years free because of poor scheduling and having management forgot to put it down . There is good managers and dept partner management in electronics is horrible . The female management told an employee that we had to do her jobs that were assigned for her to make her look good .. Half of the people in the department run off to the back especially while busy . Now they have a point system like a factory and treats the employees like complete nobody's and we were promised a raise from 9.90 to 10.00 and yet have I seen that on the pay stub .. If it wasn't for the pay I would quit but I need the money to pay for school and once I'm enrolled in quiting.
bad,"there were quite a few co-workers that i became friendly with along with some members of management."
bad,"Daily life at Walmart is a mixed bag, you'll never know exactly what's going to happen each day until it happens."
bad,"I worked over night, so I never enjoyed my schedule. The shift always started with a meeting and then we were sent to do things the couldnt possibly be done in 8 hours. We were under staffed and over worked. I liked my coworkers though. Every night was a constant struggle with management because they had 3 people doing a 10 person job. The store manager was the rudest and irrational person I've ever known.I did learn a lot about working in a warehouse and keeping inventory/"
bad,"i enjoyed working there just management wasn't the best"
bad,"typical work day boring"
bad,Did not like the managers felt like they didn't care about their employees. Co-Workers were very friendly and worked well together. Hardest part of the job was the hours or lack there of. Most enjoyable were the customers.
bad,"A place that claims to be better for the employees, but actually exercises for the older members of management while replacing the lower men. Management is too focused on the customer and doesn't give the light of day to employees which in turn makes the stores seem pretty terrible and bland in sight. Employees want to be treated right are treated terribly and stripped of say in any situation."
bad,"A typical day at work included stock, help customers, water plants, run cash register, push carts if the one cart pusher we had wasn't there, help unload the truck, and pull pallets from the truck to the floor."
bad,"Working at Walmart has been one of the worst experiences of my life.  Management constantly takes advantage of their workers.  Assistant would managers not communicating with employees enough.  When an associate would ask a manager for their time it would always be we will talk later,  but later would never come.  This is why I am branching out to look for another job.  Currently we have 3 associates for all of electronics and management have done nothing to change that yet.  Not all of it was bad my department manager and fellow associate are very knowledgeable and make the day go by faster."
bad,"sweeping floors, get assingments for to work. hard to work with co-workers when their English is not good. Only good part is driving the forklift at end of the shift."
bad,"*I've only worked at one Walmart so this review doesn't necessarily reflect a work day at any other Walmart."
bad,management not very good I over all liked the job simple and easy. my co-workers were great and easy to get along with wasn't any hard parts and the most enjoyable moments were being able to work and stay busy
bad,"The people(other cashiers) are great to work with, but the management sucks. I have never worked  company that is so poorly managed, I do not want to get into it online. But lets say it's time for a change. It's pretty bad when you hate the job so much, you just dread, I mean really dread to go into work!"
bad,"Store is Closing. Gave 2 weeks notice, Wal-Mart is Notrious for under staffing and does not give tools do do job well. I really cant figure out this review"
bad,Walmart provides the backbone of a large corporation with all the cheap business practices as well. They have time and time again taken advantage of their employees. When breakthroughs were made they would still yet cut employees to 15-20 hr per wk. Ultimately Its a decent transition job for high school/college students
bad,"i love my bakery supervisor nikky, and some of my coworks were ok to work with.  and i learn somewhat. but there was a lot of disrespect from the zms bigger manager they were not thankful for the hardworking cakes we did. that hard hours we put in."
bad,"Assisting customers with finding their wants and needs. Dealing with angry customers, assisted with unloading trucks and remodeling. Built end caps and stack bases."
bad,"This was by far my least favorite position in which I held. Management was rude, condescending, and treated employees poorly. I personally will say placing my 2 weeks in and leaving this company was the best option I had before relocating."
bad,A typical day at work was doing my job plus whatever jobs management wanted me to take care of for them and other departments. I learned that maintenance workers take care of a lot of things that are very unappreciated. Management have their good days and their bad days just like other people. My co-workers were all very dependable and hard workers. The hardest part of my job was trying to stay busy on slow days or days where we had too many maintenance workers compared to the amount of work available. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interactions I had with customers and my co-workers.
bad,"Hardest part of the job is lack of clear direction and communication, Multiple managers giving different directions at the same time, Safety issues not addressed in a timely manner. Terrible scheduling."
bad,Overall I miss my customers and my employees but the management team could have been much better. Just hate I wasn't able to stay and help better the atmosphere.
bad,"mi primer dia de trabajo como todos fueron iguales de agradables primero por que me dieron la libertad de ir y tomar mi propias decisiones con respecto al puesto sin salirme de las normas claro."
bad,Co works cant get along and managers are gossips. hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who cant take no for an answer
bad,"I worked full time graveyards, 5 nights a week, for two years straight. I recieved a .10 wage increase during that time, from $10.00 to $10.10 with $1/hr night differential. They attempt to cover up the ridiculous deadlines and goals with team building games and Ice Cream, forcing the employees to walk away from their work to engage in these activities, but not compensating for the lost time afterwards. There were several managers that were employed while I worked there, it never felt like a reliable or dependable place management-wise. It was a job when I didn't have one, until I found employment with BC General."
bad,"Co-workers were great and helpful!"
bad,Management proved to be jerks! Overly meticulous and spoke with condescending undertone. They made it very difficult to apply for advancement as the standards were place too high. Minimal interactions between employees and management.
bad,"Drastically cut hours, even for full time employees. Poor management practices and ridiculous expectations of employees with only about two on the floor in the entire department."
bad,it was not bad but the managers needed to communicate better to the  employees and they need to not push us as hard as that do at the fact that we all drank monster energy drinks and eat candy just to stay awake most overnight sifts.
bad,Walmart is good friendly work environment a typical work day for me starts at 10pm and ends at 7am I like my co-workers and my immediate manager. the hardest part of any job is long hours and heavy lifting. the best part of the day is when your appreciated.
bad,Company use to be family friendly and a great place to work.  Decline started around 2003 when they started hiring bodies instead of career minded people.  All professionalism has vanished so it is time to move after over 20 years.
bad,We start off with a group meeting with the assistant manager of Wal-mart on third shift and she gives us a report of freight coming in for today and the sells report. And she assigns the jobs to the staff in the different department of the store which is open 24 hours a day. The co-workers going to there assigned place to work there freight and greet in customers and direct the customers if they need any help with finding a product or items .The hardest part of the job is not enough workers to complete the job and we have to work like two or three persons. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting greeting of thank you from the customers knowing that they are okay.
bad,"Depending on what manager was present, we were able to have a good work environment and joke around on lunch and breaks."
bad,"I was hired on as an ""External"" employee here in July. I figured that I was done with my previous employer, Toys R Us and that it was time for me to take the next step in my career...... Boy was I wrong!!! First off they put you in a class in either Phoenix or Dallas (I was in the Phoenix classes) for six weeks if you are an ""External"" employee, then proceed to continue to distance you from the other trainees that are ""Internal"" like you have a communicable disease or something, THEY DO NOT TEACH YOU ANYTHING IN THESE CLASSES!!! All I learned in these classes were how to run and analyze reports that I dont even use out in the field!!! The idea is that they want you to learn the information on your own, well that could work only if there were enough facilities for the trainees to use! When we were in our ""Host"" stores, we had to fight tooth and nail for the precious computer time as we had to fight amongst not only each other, but the associates that work in the store everyday. The Facilitators (instructors) were smug and almost always re-directed questions that could've been answered if they would get off of Facebook and do their job, but whatever. I ""graduated"" the four week program and had just two more weeks left in my Host store to do ""OJT"". This was a huge joke! The person i was to shadow was never in the office but two days out of my whole two weeks there, so i finished out my last two weeks clueless as to how to actually do my job. I get to my home store expecting to get some kind of training only to be sorely disappointed. No training whatsoever, I didnt even get paid"
bad,Working at Wal-mart was made me want to strive for a better future for myself. the amount of work they give each person was high. the work systems were bad.
bad,"Co-workers were fun and easy to get along with and most of the customers were a joy to meet. My managers were easy to talk to and express my opinions and concerns. As far as advancement opportunities, hardly any were presented to me or my co-workers even when there was an opening."
bad,"Walmart is a diverse company that will help you to better your job skills and try new opportunities. WAlmart has an open door policy for associates problems . The hardest part of my job is the busy times , just keeping up on busy days. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and helping them find what they need."
bad,"Wal-marts has some great People working for the Company. Co-Workers are expected to go over and above But, sometimes treated like they are not Appreciated. Expected to do a two or three person job at all times. Hardest part of job is having to work without half the staff needed for a regular schedule day. Most Managers are Supportive"
bad,"Fun work environment at times and very busy all day long. The hours went by quickly because there was so much to do. Very challenging job for minimal pay but I am thankful that I gained the knowledge of accounting and bookkeeping. I prefer to be busy on a regular basis and learning knew things so this was definitely a job that kept me ""on my toes"" in time sensitive situations."
bad,Management was always changing.  This made it hard to keep policies in place since they were also changing.  Employees wanted to succeed but were held back by poor leadership.  I did my best to help those who wanted to do well succeed.
bad,I'd push carts in the garage and help my co-workers with their garage when they fall behind. I've learned that team work only works when everybody puts in their part. management was only helpful when they weren't over scheduled. Half the co-workers did their jobs while the others did. The hardest part was when multiple member of management would give me multiple assignments at once. The most enjoyable part was when I was helping the customers.
bad,"Management could use a little more Training , Pay could be better and some of the employees could do there part, other than that I like working at Walmart. Employee Discounts are helpful."
bad,"easy starter, great foundation, great advancement, easy learning, customer friendly based, interesting customer interactions"
bad,working at walmart in Lebanon pa was not what I expected it would be. I thought working for a billion dollar company there would be some degree of profesinalism but I thought wrong. managers talk about other managers blatantly to other empoyees. as a new hire its breeds a toxic environment for empolyees to pick and choose who they like as manager when everyone should be coordinated working together. and if you don't be xtra sweet to your managers as to lick there boots practically you will be terminated
bad,I was an assembler but usually I got stuck setting up and unloading trucks. I learned that Wal-Mart isn't very organized. The management was terrible. I felt like I was being directed by kids. Some of my coworkers were nice and friendly people while some others were not. The hardest part was probably stressing my back out setting up and unloading trucks. The most enjoyable part was when I actually got to do my job.
bad,you learn as much as you can and enjoy learning from others with you. organize your priority to get as much completed in the time given or allowed.
bad,"The management there was horrible unorganized, unfair when she was having a bad day she took it out on a lot off the employs, what i learnt. I learnt how to do maintenance work and stock shelves i worked night hours and it was really hard on me."
bad,"management was rude,and unreliable.but loved just working around people and being their for the customers.I like feeling like your needed at a job and taking care of people."
bad,"I would have liked to have a manager that showed appreciation for how hard we worked and made it easier to discuss issues that could have used some improvement in the workplace. I also would have liked to see less name calling from supervisors and have an open ear when it came to suggestions or reminders of policy. I did enjoy my customers, but would have liked to have been given the option to help them more without being reprimanded against our code of ethics when policy requires us to help."
bad,"The management is my only concern, everything else was awesome when i worked there. The management was very rude and constantly threatened me and other employees."
bad,"It was a typical 9-5 job.I enjoyed helping customer on an everyday bases. My co-workers made it worth coming in everyday. Task were simplistic and easy to explain. There was constant work everyday ie, Stocking, re-arranging, helping customer."
bad,"The good thing working at Walmart is the flexibility of the work schedule, except during weekends wherein, favouritism plays a big part in approving work schedule request."
bad,The company was good to work for. The type of work had to be done fast and was mostly under staffed. A majority of the freight on the trailers were destroyed on the pallets and would have to be re- palletized.
bad,"I learned all kinds of jobs to do like mixing paint, selling guns in sporting goods, cutting fabric, setting up merchandise  and they didn't seem to care at least at that store."
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart was a very great experience. I learned how to serve different customers needs, communicating with co workers and customers allowed me to feel good about myself to be able to execute the needs of my company"
bad,"Management was lax to say the least. Employees who were no shows/call out on a regular basis were not held accountable and the behavior was accepted. The expectation was ""do as I say, not as I do""."
bad,I enjoyed meeting new people and helping people.The hardest part of the job not having enough help. I also enjoyed setting up the ad for the store and doing the competitive shopping for the store.
bad,"Over worked their employees, especially when you were a department manager. Other than that I liked working for the company."
bad,Walmart was a good second job while my children were in school. I learned a lot about what people buy and why. I also learned how to assist customers with their needs. I worked mostly evenings as a cashier.
bad,managers need to work on communicating with there employers better. I would not go back to work there until that problem is fixed.
bad,"It was very busy daily there for the most part. There were times where it was not really anything to do, but something can easily be thought of. The hardest part of the job was taking out the trash because sometimes the bags would tear."
bad,"This is probably the hardest job I have ever had.  Every day starts with unloading a truck and sorting them to their respective departments, while maintaining a sturdy pallet.  The time it took us to finish this was dependent on a variety of factors, such as allotted space, size of the truck, and number of workers present on the line.  Once this was completed, we would then work on department picks, then delivering the completed pallets to their department using a pump truck if you weren't machine trained.  The shift was always 3:30pm - 11:30pm.  With the amount of work we were expected to complete, the pay isn't that great.  That being said, there were only about 7 total employees, PT and FT, so you get to know the people you are working with fairly well.  I have made some good friends, some of whom I still speak with to this day.  Also, you would have to do something drastic to get fired."
bad,"My job at Walmart was to stock shelves with items for customers to find and buy them.  Stocking the shelves was hard work, tedious, and exhausting.  This was the hardest part of the job due to manuel labor and not having a home for the items without a place on the shelf.  Some upcs do not match the item that's suppose to be placed there and some shelves do not have upcs at all for the items.  I've had rude associates yell at me and one at least being mean to me by yelling at me for putting something is his kart.  Management's not that much better either because they just pile the work on you and expect you to get it all done which was horrific.  I did learn how to become an overnight stalker and it was fun at first but then I began hating the job.  The hours I started hating too because I was working from night to day eight hour shift and the give you a whole pallet to work on by yourself which did not happen at the beginning.  I had help with the pallets before but towards the end of the beginning they start scheduling you to work pallets by yourself which I greatly hated and still hate the idea to this day.  The only wonderful part of this job were the nice associates.  They talk with you and are friendly towards you.  I would not want to go back to Walmart to work for any reason; not even to be a cashier.  It's a terrible working environment and some people are just mean, jerks and I do not want to go back there."
bad,"I am an honest person so the hardest part of my job is putting up with screaming children all day. It is terribly hot at the registers. I must assure my customers they are not having hot flashes or a heart attack. Associates are compelled to work a schedule dictated by a computer that doesn't know what eating, sleeping and using the restroom are. Typical look on an associates face, anguish, fear. Most enjoyable part of the job, vacation."
bad,"A mediocre, mundane, low paying job."
bad,"I stocked the store and unload trucks, and I help costumers. The most thing enjoyable about my job was the people and the costumers"
bad,"The salary is great, but the work life balance takes a major hit. Work crazy amounts of hours, with no appreciation. The compensation is great, but you pay for it in never being home with your family."
bad,"Overall the job was great, I loved taking care of the customers because I am a people person and it makes me feel a sense of accomplishment knowing I have helped someone and satisfied their needs. However, those whom I worked with did not help my work environment. Having attitudes from co-workers and management that weren't understand with health issues I was going through."
bad,didn't really like it after a while. Managers didn't know how to speak to co workers. Managers didn't know what they was doing as a job.
bad,"Customer service#1 "
bad,"Greet customers with warm hello. Ring up each item as fast as possible. Bag items accordingly. Cleaned my register counter, took my register trash out counted my draw. Restock my candy in my row."
bad,"overall great experience with the largest retailer in the world. Very long hours, not enough personnel to maintain high customer standards throughout the year"
bad,"The no faults policy,makes it impossible for life to happen .so hopefully ,nothing happens ,that causes you to be late or absent..death/car wreck/ect . You will be held accountable..and the accountability,won't go away until 6 months after the fact ..Real good money .though"
bad,Quick advancement for those that show potential.  Structured to succeed.  Very little room for the middle man to give feedback and input.
bad,"Unless your officially full time or a manager of some sort, they dont care about you at all.  Not good communication between management either, if you can handle a mess, then your ok."
bad,good place to work as far as benefits but Walmart pharmacy was very disorderly. Log copies where left undone every night. The crew was lazy and left work for u to do when you came in.
bad,great start but failed in the end  to cutting reports hours to save budget leaving our customers unhappy and upset with there visit
bad,"no a great place to work at or try to build a career, have management that dont what to do so they have to ask and employee that knows mre that salary management"
bad,I really enjoyed working with vets and helping vets in every way i wouldnt recommend is job to everyone. very rewarding job to work at.
bad,"management is changing requirements, lot to learn, good computer system, there are all kinds of people good and bad . those who know the job an d those who are learning ."
bad,This job at  Wal-Mart was absolutely horrible and it's not just this Wal-Mart that I worked at it's all across the nation. I don't know where to being but the management is completely inconsiderate towards the employees by giving unrealistic expectations as well as an inability to understand how hard the working conditions are. Hard working conditions such as giving too many assignments for one employee to complete in one shift. The reason for this condition is because the greedy managers don't want to hire more employees to hire more employees. Also when you work overtime it's without pay they basically use the pay for the next day. I remember coming in one night and the manager telling me I had overtime the manager told me not to clock in until my overtime hours was up. There are so many issues with this company but I feel I'd have to write a book it. It's not a good company after Sam Walton passed away.
bad,management was bad great co workers just a horrible work experience there was really no backbone pretty much everybody did what they wanted to
bad,"On nous prend pour des machines, pression constante, rémunération faible ( très faible vis a vis le travail à accomplir )"
bad,"Stocking, moving a lot of heavy freight. Learned about about money and merchandise. Management was very unorganized and not helpful in no difficult situations. Co-workers were kind, very nice, always willing to help out a new person. Hardest part of the job was not knowing which manager to listen to all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things and getting the experience."
bad,"Productive fast paced environment, Great for adults and children to come in and shop worry free, I started as a cashier and was promoted to money center 4 months after hired and I am currently apart of the management team super Awesome!!!"
bad,"Took charge of the floor. Placed in charge of three departments. It was basic, clock in then take car of sales and the floor. Assist the stockroom when assistance was needed. Handle customers complaints and questions."
bad,Worked on Audits for Bin accuracy daily. Bin any overstock in backroom bins for about 2 hours. Pick merchandise out of bins to go out to the salesfloor.
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart has it's good and bad days. Some days are fun and I tend to enjoy my job. I enjoy the face to face customer reaction, even the difficult ones. I enjoy working with most of my peers too. The management is the problem. Wal-Mart is ran like a prison at times. The Store Manager is the warden, who hands orders down to the guards (assistant and department managers), who then enforce said orders on the prisoners (associates). Not every manager conducts themselves in this way though. There are definitely some amazing people I've had the pleasure of meeting and knowing in my time there. But the culture and environment that has been set is disappointingly tiresome. There is no rest. The moment you slow down and take a breather there's a manager there to crack the whip and tell you to get back to work or else they'll find you some work. It's a nice first job that teaches discipline and good work ethic, but long term? I don't see a future there."
bad,"was being harassed and when brought to the management teams attention nothing was done, was treated poorly when hurt at work and actually mocked about it. I constantly felt like I was never going to advance within the company and that I wasn't respected (by the managers) as a supervisor."
bad,This job was a lot of hard work. Long hours with minimum pay and the hours are never consistent except when the holiday rolls around.
bad,Wal-mart was a reliable place to work. I think their hourly pay could be better. I like fast pace work and this definitely was just that. Customer service always busy. Everyone was very nice.
bad,I worked at Walmart for a project they had to earn some extra money and it was the worst job i had. i wish i would have never took this job on and stuck with my main job.
bad," Duties included unloading merchandise from delivery trucks and placing stock in the appropriate location such as the back-"
bad,"Spend all you time working and still to not have enough time and training."
bad,"Weekends were busy"
bad,"Little communication between management and employees"
bad,"just another retail job, but with a pesky union, which I was not a fan of.  I didn't enjoy paying a fee every two weeks just to watch people that worked considerably less than me get advancement opportunities I wanted solely because of seniority"
bad,"o trabalho não era ruim,o que era ruim era as pessoas lideres que não faziam direito o seu trabalho"
bad,the workers would not work together which makes the work harder for some of the other people. they would stand and talk to the customers about nothing making the workload for the actual workers twice as hard. one night I pulled 20 pallets of freight out while one nameless person got two in a two hour time slot
bad,Everyday I was in a different area which made it hard to get use to stocking different working areas. The managers were very rude.
bad,"Usually your day will consist of long line's because there supposedly aren't enough hours to go around and management is pretty nice depending on who your manager is, co-workers are friendly also depending on who you get involved with and some co-workers aren't so good, another downfall of the job is the customers along with price matching. I know that most customers complain about the wait in line before checking out which is nothing i can do about. But there's always a time that after a good amount of time of waiting they will get to the check out and not have their wallet or not know how much money they have or leave the rest of their items because they didn't calculate how much everything cost. Also there are some who take an maximum advantage on the price matching policy by just throwing in low price numbers that doesn't break the barrier for the employee to ask for an ad. But i would say the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people"
bad,"I learned how to handle many different costumers from all walks of life."
bad,"My day starts at 5:00 am I am responsible for daily meat shipments getting to sales floor.I also do markdowns dealing with all kinds of meat fresh,frozen and seafood. dealing with customers Is Awesome."
bad,"i loved the job i was doing, but the training was not very professional, most of the training was done by co workers and if they did not become friends with you the training would be lacking. the department manager was not friendly or approachable and was constantly looking for things to reprimand me for."
bad,My walmart experience was not what I had expected. It was okay in the beginning but as the months progressed the ruder the staff was.
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of clocking in then checking in with management to get assigned which side of the store parking lot you would be on until your break. Walmart has various assistant managers and only one keeping the book. I once got reprimanded for being on the wrong side which I went over because that side was overflowing with carts and it was rather dead in comparison on my side. Another time I got reprimanded because in the exact same situation I stayed on my side. The inconsistency of the management was one of the hardest things to deal with on the job. "
bad,"A typical day at work was usually pretty stressful between maintaining the needs of customers and those of my manager. Time management was the most important thing i learned. My manager was wonderful, she was by far the best i have ever had. I only really worked alongside my direct manager, no other employees. The hardest part of my job was managing my time, there was always alot to do and nobody else working with me. I did however enjoy working with my manager and the public."
bad,"Meet and greet customers, ring up store items, friendly environment. I enjoyed mostly talking with the customers. The hardest part was angry customers."
bad,Walmart is a great place just need to hire a lot of people to get the numerous work done instead of over working and pressuring small amounts of people.
bad,"Working at Walmart  was a job that I would work at, but only for a short time like during the summer. I was not a job that I would want to work at again. A typical day at Walmart would consist of me checking in and going straight to a register to check the items that the customers were going to be paying for.  My co-workers were friendly people. I got along with them. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. I always kept a positive attitude regardless of what was going on. Sometimes the customers would have problems with the service provided to them and they would take their anger out on me by ranting or saying some words that shouldn't have been said. Even through that, I still kept my positive and polite attitude. Honestly, the most enjoyable part of this job was clocking out and going home. The job was good but it just was not for me."
bad,"Apart from the low wages and expensive benefits, Wal-Mart provided me with my first opportunity to manage. I enjoyed the work it took to take a run-down furniture department and turn it into a furniture showplace."
bad,Hours change to much.  Need to pay more.  Need to give better benefits to part time employees.  To need more employees for customers.
bad,"Clocked in walked the floor see what needs to be filled, learned so many different aspects of the retail business, mgmt not fair all the time. Enjoyed meeting new people from all walks of life a very diverse place. hardest thing was pulling some very heavy merchandise but enjoyed being there and learning more and more everyday."
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart, although I loved the customers, was a horrible job experience. The management never did their job, just put it on the employees who were getting paid much less than them, and that's if management even made an appearance. In my first month I believe I saw my manager once. I would not want to work for them again, not sure if its all or only that one specific Wal-Mart, but they just did not care of show respect to their employees."
bad,"emploi etudiant de fin de semaine"
bad,You start out at part time and it may be 1 year or 2 to 3 years before your full time. You can work hard and do your best to bust your butt to get done. Its not enough. They expect you to be super human and finish things that are just not humanly possible.   The good part is you get paid extra for working nights and you get holiday bonuses with every three month bonuses depending on how the store dos those three months. I learned Howe to work at a fast passé and how to use a teals ion.
bad,"It was usually short on staff, so getting customers out in a timely manner depended on the associate. I learned that customers come first so its best to reach out to them and help them as much as possible. They are why we have our jobs in the first place. I feel that management, at the time I was there, were very willing for the customers and associates. If we had concerns or comments, the managers were always there to listen. My co-workers were great to work with! We have fun working together. The hardest part of my job was dealing with irate customers, but it was a lesson that was great to learn. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help a customer and see them leave happy."
bad,"Selling firearms, customer service and zoning mostly. I learned a lot about firearms and the differences between them and how to tell them apart. Management had a tendency of being too stuck on themselves and didn't treat their workers below them at equals. Most of the co-workers were very easy going and great to work with it was the management that has personal issues and treats workers as less than people. The job itself wasn't that hard except for when you had stuff to do and 3 different managers would pull you in all different directions. I loved selling firearms and working with people."
bad,"start my day by walking my departments to see what need to be done an assigne employees to specific tasks then do orders schedules paper work go back help employees finsh task if they "
bad,"I enjoyed my actual work but the people made it very difficult. One thing I wish I didn't do was express how much of a hard worker I was. Once you do this you get taken advantage of very quickly. I was often given tasks to complete in other departments or tasks that I weren't responsible for including assignments assigned to managers. I did appreciate the benefits given to part time employees such as 401K, stock purchase program, insurance, personal hours, etc."
bad,Typical day at work is helping customers finding what they need. Working on multiply and different areas. I have learn my management skill from walmart not from my management but through the associates that Im working with. Some management are good but some are not... Some show concern some does not. Hardest part of the job working with managements give you multiple direction with giving a proper planning
bad,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is just like any other day if you were to shop there. I have learned so much especially some manager skills. The management at Wal- Mart is not fair, and unorganized. My co- Workers are some what helpful and great to work with but, sometimes the co-workers cant be helpful. The hardest part of the job is trying to stay stress free because your never doing your own job.The most enjoyable part of the job is some people that you get to work with."
bad,is not really that good of a job but for some what it is okay for a start job to get your foot in the door. takes management for ever to approve u vacation even no u tell them all the time. and they don't really start you off with good pay innless you work out back then its alright money. but im looking for a job right know that will pay the bills if u know what I mean.
bad,"The best part was all of the coworkers that I got to know over the years. We formed relationships that lasted even after I left the company. "
bad,the benefits a great but the associates are treated poorly. Regardless of the adversities i face working there i learned how to keep a positive attitude. I Treat my associates with respect and i am a team player. I learned how to keep my composure under tense situations the best part of my job is managing my department while keeping it neat and organized while helping customers. The hardest part of my job is not feeling appreciated by higher management and being treated poorly at time.
bad,"I was  a customer service supervisor and ran the front end of the store. Which included cashiers, customer service desk, money center, maintenance, door greeters and cart associates. What I learned was that people are very different and that I had to treat each person as an individual (including the customers).  I do not have a lot to say about the management. I became an at work, work friend with a few of them. For the most part, most of my co-workers were easy to get along with and were easy to supervise. I let them know my boundies from the very start. Even that there will be times to enjoy our work as well as taking our jobs serious.  The hardest part of my job was when, on several occasions that I was well qualified to move forward in the company they held me back from promotions. People say it was because I did my job too well. As far as my job being enjoyable, It really was. I had a very good relation ship with the associates as well as the customers. One customer had said, ""When I walk into the store and do not see you, they asked another associate if I was working that day. If I wasn't working they found out when I was then left and came in when I was working"". WOW! That made me feel really appreciated."
bad,"A very unorganized place most of the time. Have to learn a lot on job   ,training is orientation was not that helpful. The typical day was not hard. Only thing that I was bothered by was not getting a lot of direction from management."
bad,My coworkers were awesome and we got along great. The hardest part about working for Walmart is how poorly the customers treated the employees and management wasn't very respectful or understanding. I enjoyed meeting people and seeing the same wonderful customers every week. I also really enjoyed my coworkers.
bad,"The best thing about Wal'mart is knowing that as long as you show up every day, you will always have a job.  Not a very good job, but a job"
bad,Started on the remodel team moving counters and other things around the store. Got hired on full time as a stocker with no training had to have an ile done in a certain amount of time which was somethimes inposible. Me and my coworkers worked as a team to get things done.
bad,"environnement de travail agréable"
bad,Working at Wal-Mart was a good experience for me because I learned a lot about big stores. my co-workers were alright to work with but I did not make friends there so o well. hardest part of my day was standing for long periods of time but that was OK.
bad,"High pace, constant work, low pay, I learned how to decorate cakes how to deal with irate customers, management skills, no management support"
bad,Too much drama! Liked that they rotated days off. Great place to shop....not a lot of room to advance. I was stocker so work was same everyday.
bad,Walmart is a part time job I took while I was looking for a career.  It is a company that hires people for low wages and takes advantage of their skills.
bad,Don't provide enough hours. Worked with Walmart since age 17 and after 10 years only got to 12.00/hour. Was told about promotions but never happened. Much favoritism.
bad,"When I worked here, most of my coworkers were courteous and understanding. But others were rude and disrespectful to some customers. It was a decent job and I didn't mind it at all except for all the gossip between coworkers about customers and other coworkers. "
bad,Working at walmart is even worse than shopping there. The managers there don't care about you and your fellow coworkers are all temporary so there's no use in making friends.
bad,"Eu era a representante do meu setor no Comité de Engajamento, e mesmo com diversas personalidades diferentes, mesmo com o fato de que nem todos aceitam o que é sugerido, mesmo assim conseguia parar todos para dá Feed de Back sobre as reuniões, e colher sugestões dele para levar para o comité."
bad,"To be honest the pay was good. $10.95 hr after couple years working at Wal-mart. The problem is with management and their over dependence on their computer system. "
bad,"Every morning when I leave, the backroom is clean and organized. When I come back in, however, the backroom is a mess with pallets of freight down every isle and no sense of organization at all. The equipment necessary to do our jobs is often hidden from us by previous shifts, which management has done nothing to deter. Even though 3rd shift does most of the work in the store, we are still treated as if we are the laziest bunch in the place. We even get this treatment by our store manager. The hardest part of the job is trying to comprehend the decisions made by our management team. Even though we have attempted multiple times to tell them that our counts are off and we are receiving a mass amount of freight that we do not need, they continue to ignore the issue and act as if its our incompetence, not the counts, that are the problem. The ONLY thing I enjoy there, aside from an hour lunch, is getting to leave every morning."
bad,Walk into work clock in get right to work i learned how to balance a cash drawer great co workers terrible work condition
bad,"- during a typical day you are over worked due to high number of customers and low number of staff"
bad,The job is good and keeps you busy but the hours are not so good. Cutting of hours and constant changing of days make it hard to have Family time or to pay bills. Co workers are nice and lots of fun. I  learned how to handle all kinds of people and complains. Night shift starts with a meeting.
bad,"I worked here for 3 years. I have made some great friends, and that's about all I can say that was good about the place and enjoyable. For the amount of work some of us have to do and the little amount of money we were paid is garbage. The discount is even worse. The fact that this company makes billions of dollars and does not care about their employees is disgusting. Most of the management has let it gone to their head that they are management - you work at Walmart, so take it easy!"
bad,I did not ever feel like I had job security.  It is very cut throat and tries its best not to offer benefits to regular staff employees.  Not even full time status.
bad,Would love to work in a Wal-mart where the Companys three basic beliefs are being practiced. It has not happened in 1763 in two to three years and no one from upper management can see it and if they see it they do not care.
bad,I have held several different positions in my four years that i have been with the company. I love that i'm able to meet new people which are the most enjoyable parts of day. It's never been a time that i haven't learned something new about the company which i love.
bad,"Every day is something different no day was the same, which is an aspect that I liked.  I learned that I work well under pressure and understand that one person can only do so much.  The employees were some of the hardest working people I have ever met, the only problem was the store was severely understaffed.  The hardest part of my job was coming up with solutions to seemingly impossible expectations.  The most enjoyable part was working as a team to accomplish tasks."
bad,"Job needs to be more understanding of employee needs, not given breaks at appropriate  times at the right intervals"
bad,"ay demasiado trabajo a diario,incluso siempre terminas haciendo el trabajo de alguien mas,ademas del tuyo.aprendi a tener paciencia,hacer panecillos y decoraciones nuevas,los gerentes no hacen valer tus derechos como empleado ni los respetan,mis colegas son buenos pero les cuesta trabajar en equipo,lo mas dificil de mi trabajo es que no tenia tiempo para mi familia,lo que mas me agradaba aparte del sueldo es que me gustaba mucho lo que hacia que en sii,era decorar,,,"
bad,The salaried members of management are very unorganized in all aspects of the store.
bad,"Teamwork is valued above all else, save customer service, but generally employees are better at teamwork. Can be a great place to work for the right person, Entry level is rough in terms of pay and benefits, but loyalty and commitment are rewarded."
bad,Would help customers daily with positive attitude. I like helping others.
bad,"My shift always starts out with, having to clean out my backroom, so I can start my job. I have to take out pallets and carts to the floor. I log in the system and start order picks. I've learned that i must remain calm in a very stressful place. Management is at best difficult. Some of the managers have a way of doing things that I feel are wrong, but I have to keep my mouth shut for fear of being fired. The hardest part of my job is dealing with a company that values the customers more than the employees. I enjoy my job when I'm left alone to complete my job."
bad,good place to work. hard to move up in the company. easy job being  cashier
bad,"Customer Service,Cashiering,sales,phones, Photo Lab, Hardware, Sporting Goods,Customer Service Desk,Friendly work place and great team"
bad,taking care of customers and keeping up with daily tasks. I have learned how to self motivate and work hard . management there were fair . co-workers were friendly and helpful the hardest part of the job was probably teaching myself to do phone contracts . the most enjoyable parts of the job is when customers keep coming back to you and you know them by name .
bad,"Being out in Lawn and Garden, we would be transforming the department almost constantly with the change in seasons and holidays.  I didn't mind the constant reconstruction of my department, but the borderline slavery and lack of employees throughout the store was intolerable."
bad,"I learned a lot about customer service, management, truck unloading and heavy work loads"
bad,Employees all around feeling of being unhappy with their supervision. Put in a month in advance for a doctor appointment as I needed to have something checked and also need blood pressure medication refills. When the schedule for that week was completed I noticed my supervisor scheduled me to work anyway. I had followed protocol in requesting the time off in the system and reminded him of it. He then would not let me off. I couldn't get in to see my doctor for another month. Also He never address the person who continually harassed me making it a miserable work invironment.
bad,"Long hours, work practices change frequently, pleasant co-workers, and low job security."
bad,"Packaging customer orders, assisting with digital photo machines, camera sales and cleaning of the photo equipment. I learned a lot about digital cameras, printing photos, editing photos and specialty photo products such as posters and coffee mugs. Most long term co-workers were great people who were a pleasure to work with. Management was great until the company changed the set up of the management team. After that it became difficult to rely on them for any kind of help. I loved almost every aspect of my work. The two difficulties were having to tell customers they could not print something due to copyright and being expected to do the job of nine or more other people due to scheduling issues."
bad,it is a ok copany to work for the fist year and then they keep on adding stuff on to you every day task i hated it there
bad,"I learned to do multi-tasking. I was a cashier, Maintenance, I helped to stock shelves as needed, I was trained in the photo department and also in Electronics. I did a lot of customer service and I love working with people. Started day as maintenance and did what ever was asked through out the day. Never the same thing. Management was ""ok"". Dealing with the assistant managers NEVER on the same page with the orders they gave out, they did not stand up for what they said so the associates were always in trouble. Learning new tasks every day and helping the customers was the most enjoyable part of the job. Making others happy makes me feel like I did a good job."
bad,co worker and some management were nice and respectful. Managers showed no respect.
bad,"7.90$ per hour is just not enough to live off of, and for such a multi-million dollar company, you would think they could pay their employees a little more."
bad,"i have learned a lot at walmart in the past year  i went from a sales associate to a manger of meats and deli from all my hard work. my typical day is sorting, stocking, making sure everything is in the right place paper work, and order inventory. the hardest part of my job would be the non communication between staff and store mangers. but the most enjoyable part of my day is to see all my regular customer who come in  just to see me."
bad,"Fast paced, especially during holiday season. Co-workers were great, management was rude at times. Hardest part of job was having a dissatisfied customer."
bad,"A typical day of work included helping customers locate items. "
bad,A typical work day would be watitng on customers and cahsing checks and sending money returns and exchanges.  I learned how to do things at the service desk.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers.  My coworkers were easy to get along with.
bad,It's highly stressful well at least working at this disorganized poorly managed store.
bad,"good opportunity for advancement, friendly staff, poor pay"
bad,Gained many skills in retail. I was able to learn more than one position and expand my knowledge.
bad,"troubleshooting repairing and replacing mechanical, electrical and pneumatic parts and control.  Mechanical is what i learn the most with wal-mart.  Dealing with management was the hardest part of the day, because of the lack of understanding and training in the maintenance part of the operation.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when i could fix or repair something that others had left for the shift early and could find the problem or issue."
bad,Although it can get very busy on week-ends and holiday sometimes that is when it was the most fun. Would prefer to have more respectful upper management it makes the job more enjoyable and I think respect for the individual is important.necessary.
bad,"They do not care about their associates their motto is ""You are replaceable"". But its a good job if you need a flexible schedule, just don't expect to see your family if its a holiday."
bad,Through out the time that I worked at Wal-Mart I had so many problems with the managers there they are rude the call there employees names and they also make you work the people that they know you cant stand to work with and they also set you up to get fired that goes along with working with the people that you don't get along with...
bad,"responsible for overnight stocking, unloading freight within a period of time. making sure allies and product was placed in shelves correctly."
bad,The customers were great to be around and I was able to make sure that I was able to engage with the customers.
bad,"A typical day of work was going through the aisles and zoning the product, helping customers, and stocking shelves. I learned more about where food items are located in Walmart. Management was reasonable. Co-workers were decent people. The hardest part of the job was de-escalating customers who were upset about something. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employee discount."
bad,"Helped customers by answering questions about merchandise that they were looking for within the store."
bad,"I love the opportunity it gave me, another job. I am looking for something that pays a little better, has better benefits with more and different areas of growth."
bad,""" En u día típico de trabajo en WALMART, checas en el reloj , te diriges a tu área de trabajo, tu Supervisor te indica tus labores en la jornada, sales a comer, puedes hacer compras en tu horario de comida, controlas todas tus compras, aprendí a saber dirigirme a la gente, darle un buen servicio,manejo de objeciones, mis compañeros eran amables y cordiales conmigo no discriminan o critican a nadie."
bad,"i never worked a retail job, but my experience at walmart has on the most been a good experience, i learned how a large retail store worked and how good customer service is the key to having customers return."
bad,"the most enjoyable part of the job is leaving work."
bad,The management was good. They helped me with any issues I had. I got along good with my co-workers. The hardest part of this job was that it was an over-night job. I would rather work during the day. I learned how to be a team player and get along with different kinds of people. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with and helping customers.
bad,"From the time i sign in, work begin i proceed to my work station to do my checks.I learned that everyday is different and to always bring a positive attitude to the work area.management can be very demanding at times.It is a relief to have dependable coworkers that i look forward to work with each day.The hardest part of the job is when multiple trucks are weighting to be unloaded.The most enjoyable part of the day is when i'm finish working, knowing that i did everything that i needed to get done, and heading home."
bad,"Typical workday - stocked your area, then helped with other areas as time allowed."
bad,"Helped customers by answering questions about merchandise that they were looking for within the store."
bad,"While you are busy working the freight of stocking the shelves, you will notice countless co-workers gathering together to hold loud conversations about pop culture. Some co-workers fail to maintain an healthy temperature for cold products. When management is informed of employee failings, they either look the other way or literaly walk away."
bad,I cleaned and sanitized the meat slicers and counters as well assisted customers with their orders.
bad,"Handled customer transactions. Took payments such as credit card, debit card, cash, food stamps. Handle coupons."
bad,Lots of room to grow but I don't like the hours they schedule. Management team was friendly.
bad,"All other employees were courteous to help and teach me. There was lack of help from management. If you had a customer that wanted to directly speak to a member of management they waited for ever. When the customer was waiting they would ask did you try to get a hold of a member of management several times. When technically me and my employees would be waiting forever for management and also Csms' to respond. Nothing was also organized ever in the back just thrown all over the place. Especially infront of all the electronics department products. They always kept saying customers come first. It sure didn't seem like they cared at all about the customers, employees, and the store."
bad,"Typical day consist of working in multiple departments, fabrics and photo-lab.Selling electronic products and cleaning the dept, stocking and organizing There is no hard part to the job and the most enjoyable is helping customers."
bad,taskmanager isn't set up properly and is unfair to try to force employees to be production workers and not  be compensated for reaching managements expectations.
bad,"Wal-mart was a fun part-time job to have when I was in school. The people I worked with were nice and it was nice being able to help customers shop. I loved that part of the job especially, since I got so many compliments from customers on how much of help I was to them, as well as compliments saying that I was the fastest cashier in the store. That really made me love going into work everyday. After finishing school, I requested less weekend shifts and more weekday shifts, which I didn't get and so I found a full-time mon-fri job that made more sense for my lifestyle. Wal-mart's hourly wage was low and other employees got paid more for doing the same job which I didn't think was fair, however, Wal-mart was really good at giving their employees a generous number of hours every week to work, so we all went home with a decent paycheck regardless of our hourly wage. It was very difficult to move up in the company as their was no union, favoritism was very common in many cases."
bad,"El trabajo diario en ésta empresa era pesado, pues la tienda en la que laboré es de las más importantes en la el país, teniendo altas ventas diarias, por consiguiente  una gran cantidad de clientes todos los días, y todas las inconformidades que se presentaban era uno de mis trabajos resolverlos. Aprendí a darle respuesta rápida a cada cliente y cajero, algunos problemas más difíciles que otros, pero siempre con solución. Lo que más me gustó de mi trabajo fue el trato con las personas, y conocer buenas personas."
bad,A job for someone who is looking for a set schedule with little guidance.
bad,It really has its days to where its just horrible and then there are some days when you just love it. The people you work with make it more enjoyable for you but you are often overworked and unappreciated
bad,"I usually work in the back , unpacking the new staff.While i was working in Wal-Mart, i have learned how to do cashier, answering  phones and zoning. My co-workers are very kind and helpful. They help me when i have so many work to do."
bad,"Busy at times, but enjoyable, learned how to prepare food, liked co-workers, hardest part of job was working in freezer"
bad,"I have been in management the majority of my life, I have enjoyed working with people. Teaching and training people to be the best at there job has always been my goal. In my everyday journeys, Respecting / Listening / Learning, has always been a Priority. "
bad,"Typical day included routing stocking cleaning organizing and creating ,maintaining a safe work environment and interacting with management"
bad,working in management at wal-mart was very fun very demanding but I got burn out due to no help and I became sick and stress out
bad,"A typical day starts with our routines of scanning to fill the shelves, taking care of any left over freight from the night, receiving to-do lists from our managers, and taking care of customers throughout the day. On an average basis, our management is inconsistent of what to expect from them, can be very hard to work with or for, and can be negligent on caring when it comes to personal matters. Co-workers are great and can make the day go by so much better and quicker, especially when having a bad day. Hardest part of the job is dealing with upper management, whether if its being given daily to-dos, or having an issue, be it personal or business related. Most enjoyable part of the day is helping customers, especially when steering them in the right direction on a product that they are not knowledgeable on."
bad,"dia agitado, assumir responsorialidades, gerencia ótima, participativa da rotina dos associados, colegas unidos para exercer as atribuições diária não me recordo da dificuldade, dever comprido."
bad,Trabalho monótono e com cobranças desnecessárias pelos superiores imediatos.
bad,"Its Walmart..  Pay is good, Management is not.  Im not sure what they do at this point because it has been awhile since i worked for them."
bad,Busy retail environment. Worked around my college schedule.
bad,"A typical day at work is really fixing what it was left from the day before. Try to get your own stuff done while taking care of customers."
bad,a typical day of work consists of signing in and going on your register to help cash out customers i learned that even when customers arent right they have to be you you have to keep your calm because their has been many times where i want to snap the csm are great but the mangers i dont even know what to say about them... the hardest part of the job is standing for 9+ hours a day it gets tiring and annoying and the pay is not worth it the most enjoyable part of my day si clocking out ..
bad,"My co-workers for the most part are a bunch of slackers that I would've fired if I were the supervisor. Management is fair, but do nothing to rid the slackers. My day begins with unloading 1 or 2 trailers, than pulling freight too the floor, and ends with me stocking freight. The hardest part of the job is watching the slackers get away with doing nothing all day. The best part of my job is going home at the end of the day."
bad,es una empresa que te explota demasiado sin recibir nada a cambio ya que en algunas empresas como es walmart te plantean al cliente descuentos de productos sin saber que son las utilidades de los empleados
bad,"walmart was ok, i didnt like the pay, or the position i held. Walmart has bad management  and horrible pay for certain positions."
bad,"I didn't know who my manager was to be exact, I pretty much taught myself where the items in the backroom went.  Managers would tell us that we didn't do something in the alluded time frame but when someone on the shift would say that the previous shift wasn't completing their task and we had to finish that before we got to ours that was swept under the rug."
bad,"As a cashier, you are responsible for handling merchandise,payments, great customer service at all times."
bad,Everyone is aware that Walmart does not treat its employees fairly.
bad,I stand in one spot for 8 hours and just set bike parts onto a bike and then the next order of either toys or air compressor parts onto the toy or air compressor. I learned how to move fast and how to work an assembly line. Management did not care of what we did. Hardest part not doing nothing else but stand in one spot and put piece on piece on toys and bikes. Enjoyable not that much of hard work done.
bad,"No communication. One manager can tell you to do one thing, and then another manager wants something else done. Stressful work environment. When tasks re not accomplished due to reasons beyond your own control, you are still punished for not getting them done."
bad,work freight make store look presentful.i learned many skills and learned about different machines.management treat us bad.and the hardest part of the job is getting treated bad.the best part i like what i do and i like the people i work with
bad,"As a manager it was a alright job, not the best but not the worst either. The management system there is a mess and they are confused themselves, lots of favouritism going on these stores. It does become very hard to move up in the company."
bad,"Walmart was a fun place to work especially alongside other great associates.  However, management was not always conducive to providing successful customer service.  They were not always organized nor well-prepared for routine, impending situations that would occur."
bad,"It was always busy and we were always low on staff. I learned a lot about how mange my time, when i have to get a whole section(s) organized while, providing good customer service for people that needed my help. Management wasn't professional and didn't care about peoples personal lives even if it was important. They didn't teach me anything, i was thrown out there to learn everything on my own. The co-workers made my time there more enjoyable; they showed me the way around the store and the rules. The hardest part of the job was management, it was horrible, everyone complained about them. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the new things about each department i.e the fitting room, jewelry section, etc."
bad,"empresa etica, agradavel de trabalhar, respeito pelo individuo."
bad,"A typical day was stock freight. Do price changes and make  sure that all the mods were done. Making sure that all the freight was put in the backroom and binned. Making sure the shelves were clean and   full. The counts were correct."
bad,"i worked for walmart for 6 years, and the whole atmosphere changed drastically at the end for the worst."
bad,Same thing every day standing at a cash register checking out groceries
bad,"Start of the night. Clocking in, going to the night meeting, then going to stock the shelves. "
bad,"The job itself is simple, and in some cases, almost enjoyable. As a Deli Sales Associate, I was responsible for slicing meat and cheese, and cooking rotisserie chickens for customers. There was also cleaning, but it was mostly customer service. Co-workers usually were agreeable, and in some cases made the job more fun. The biggest problem with this job was corporate. They would send directions that would either not solve the problem or create a new one. We had to adhere to these directions without question, and when things inevitably went wrong, we took the fall. These were things that were obviously ill-considered, and yet we had no say in the matter. There was also difficult management. I realize there is one in every crowd, but it seemed like quite a few of the managers simply enjoyed having a slight amount of authority and abused it with impunity. Any attempts to report them, even discreetly, were met with aggressive revenge tactics that usually culminated in the associate's dismissal."
bad,"Working here you keep busy which is a good thing. There's many chances to meet new people. Management could communicate better with the employees. The co-workers for the most part are team players. The hardest part of the day would probably be towards the end. After working all day at a fast pace, that can take a toll on anyone. The most enjoyable part of the day would be the chance to meet and greet the customers and assist them with locating their items."
bad,Walmart is really only concerned with money and worrying about their employee's needs is not a big concern for them anymore.
bad,"I worked here for a few months until I decided it was my time to find something new. Management was not up to par, had late deadlines, always tried to get people to stock faster than they could because they don't care about their workers. Employees that have been their for more than 5yrs run in clicks and talk about others that work their. A very awful place to work at and rude people to work for."
bad,I believe that Wal-Mart would be a much better place to manage if they improved employee relations and weren't so cheap. The budget that they gives store is inadequate to the needs of the business and causes much stress for management.Also you pay employees minimum wages and they expect them to move mountains.
bad,"Wal-Mart wasn't the best place I've worked for. Although Wal-Mart gave me a nice pay check, I truly believe that team work and management should have been trained a bit more to work together. Having both being bad creates a hostile environment. I believe that a work environment creates the atmosphere for customer service. Although the work environment was less then friendly, my contact with customers was never a problem. I was always patient , kind and a problem solver with my customers. I can ever say, I had specific people for my like just to see me. Overall, if you can set aside feelings for your customers and is good at customer service, Wal-Mart isn't so bad."
bad,"Most days are pretty intense. I for the most part enjoy the people I work with. I normally work more than scheduled because there is always something to do. "
bad,I informed Walmart of some pending court stuff previous to being hired on with the company. They still offered me a position which I accepted. I had no issues with the customers or the environment. I was a great worker but when my court stuff was up and even though I did everything I was told to do by multiple supervisors. I was still terminated without cause and unfairly. The termination is now on my record forever.
bad,Its very easy work and easy to follow through. but the people are so very uneducated rude lightly mannered. but besides that its very is and good work.
bad,"We work long hours as managers and we do carry a lot of responsibilities. Our job consist of. managing at different levels, we do administrative work, accounting, some auditing among other job functions Can be very stressful and over whelming at times."
bad,"The day begins with pulling product and auditing the inventory, mid to end of the work day we pull merchandise to the floor to be stocked."
bad,"Fellow associates were nice, but management was increasingly uncaring the higher up you went, constantly asked you to preform tasks for which you were never trained. Enjoyed working directly with customers."
bad,Wal-Mart from my experience is not the best place to work. It is very unorganized and the people that actually work hard for the company are not appreciated and do not get promoted.
bad,"A pesar del buen ambiente de trabajo hay partes en las que no hay seguridad del trabajador ya que en algunos casos el trato del jefe no es el indicado, esto hace que los trabajadores renuncien o dejen de ir sin alguna baja. Aun que si se aprende mucho, a mejorar la paciencia, mejorar nuestra destreza, sentirse seguro de uno mismo. El tener la mejor actitud y tener una mente positiva hace que el día se disfrute además de experimentar un buen trato de los demás."
bad,"Stocked shelves"
bad,Alot of work on a typically day with very little pay but I learned how to stock alot of freight in a short period of time which was played a big role in being the hard part of the job but for the most part I worked with alot of good people
bad,"Great coworkers.  "
bad,"Apesar do pouco tempo que estive trabalhando nela, notei que ela dá oportunidade de crescimento na empresa, um ambiente onde todos se respeitam da diretoria ao funcionário mais simples."
bad,wal mart is temporary for a person with true goals. pretty laid back environment most of the time
bad,"Wal-Mart has changed since the passing of Sam Walton."
bad,Walmart employers do no care about their employees. They treat you any kind of way and work us to death. My former supervisor at the Wal-Mart on Mahan always harassed us and threatened to replace us when we were not working fast enough for them
bad,"wait on customers, to move fast, they don't all agree on the same thing, a different bunch of people, standing in one spot, customers"
bad,Walmart continues its downsizing regardless of how it impacts customer service.  Multiple times employees from other departments need to help customers when walmart reduces its payroll.  Lines are long and customers suffer from the company need to always reach goals for management to receive their bonuses and the Board to remain billionaires.  It is no longer Sam's Walmart.  He was a good man with great ideals and beliefs.
bad,Walmart is a good company to work for. I was able to learn a lot from my positions at Walmart.
bad,If i was offered a better job elsewhere i would leave WalMart as they are under staffed most of the time.
bad,"On a typical work day I would clear the parking lot of trash and bring the carts back into the cart area for the customers.  Then at the end of the day I would see if anyone else needed help when I caught up with the carts.  I enjoyed talking with the co-workers, but I was generally outside by myself.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I had a few minutes to spare and was able to strike up a conversation with customers or the co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was working the weekends when other courtesy associates quit.  I learned that in order to keep the workplace flowing with ease you have to treat your employees with respect."
bad,"checking product on the floor, replenishment, floor sets , I learned the harder you work the more assignments you receive"
bad,Wal-Mart is by far the most interesting place that I have ever worked. The customers are one of a kind and the staff can be a box of chocolates. All in all I have very fond memories of the company and the experiences.
bad,The walmart I worked at was the one in Capital Plaza so it was just that walmart that wasn't so pleasant
bad,"I loved my job as a cashier, however I did not like how I was treated by the management there. my first day on the cash register someone was suppose to be helping me in case I needed help and the girl who was responsible for that just left me alone. I was under the age limit to sell alcohol so this was another problem. The management took at least 5-7 minutes to get to me so they could complete the transaction, this made the customers very mad at me. Also every time I got an alcohol purchase the management was always rude towards me because they had to come to my register. Overall I did not enjoy working here."
bad,"Turnover is high, even among management. All employees seem to lack the ability to think for themselves, especially among management"
bad,Its a really nice job but the pay is so low. The chances for raises are also VERY small.
bad,A typical day is getting everything binned and orgainized and cleaned up and ready for the day.
bad,Most enjoyable part of this job is working with my crew and their company on breaks and lunch periods. I also enjoy stocking my aisle while helping customers.
bad,"The job was very hands on and you would always be on your feet all the time. I liked stocking the shelves every once in a while if I was needed to do so. To be my first job, It was the hardest job that I ever had in my life. Pushing large rows of carts every work day  without a machine was hard labor. Me and my coworkers had to push carts in the rain, heat, cold, snow, and sunny days. It was rough but doing this job for 17 months made me a stronger person and it was a great learning experience to help me further grow into the near future."
bad,"pay was great, but the upper management was directionless, changes happening constantly, they would see one thing they liked and make all the stores do it, then have a conference call about how we were blowing payroll, then come in and ask why we don't have more people to work the freight, in 12 years with them the last two really went down the toilet. No big deal to have all vacations canceled, or put in 80 to 100 hours a week, complain about it and get told you cant make this much elsewhere...."
bad,"I like the job a lot. A typical day at Wal-Mart is very busy and productive. I have a list of job duties daily to complete and I finish them daily. For example, Pulling bins in the back room and stocking merchandise. I have learned a lot at Wal-Mart and an example would be operating a telzon machine. The management staff overall are not professional. They are not on the same page. One manager  will tell you one thing the other a whole different story.My co-workers are overall hard workers and get along at times very well. My job isn't hard at all. I stay focused and complete all my tasks. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers and being able to help them."
bad,I highly recommend you find another job than this one. There is not much good to say about this company.
bad,"It was OK to get me by at the time. Pay sucked and never any room for advancement at the time. Always a drag every night, and always covering another employees call out."
bad,"A typical day while working at Walmart as sales associate was to stock shelves and direct customers to store products. What I learned while working walmart was to keep my composure at all times while communicating with a customer no matter how intense it gets. During my stay at walmart management did not help employee's or prepare them for various situation while on the job, leading into a high turnover rate. The part of the job was to hardest was dealing with the rude customers and high work rate. The most enjoyable part of my job was communicating with different and having fun with co-workers"
bad,"J'ai rencontré toute une variété de collègues de travail tout aussi différents et sympathiques les uns que les autres. La chef de département était si agréable, que je l'aurais amenée partout avec moi, pour m'assurer que je travaille pour elle. Le bémol, c'était la ""marraine"", la seconde chef de département, lors de l'absence de la chef officielle; je me demande pourquoi elle a mérité ce titre. Cette succursale de Walmart met rudement à l'épreuve votre motivation à travailler avec la clientèle, mais la diversité des tâcfhes me plaisaient bien. J'ai particulièrement apprécié la clientèle au téléphone;j'aimais bien faire les mises de côté, car on pouvait sentir la reconnaissance des clients."
bad,"Working at Walmart is fine, the pay is decent and they give you the hours that they promise you, but the management could treat people better."
bad,I like the hours and getting the pay but too many taxes get taken out & the management team is extremely poor.
bad,"You can't clock in early or late, you must do your work and not talk to anyone, they only start you out as temporary part time worker, you can't park too close, you can't have your cell phone. "
bad,"I have been at my job now for almost 4 years. I love the interaction I have with co-workers as well as customers. In a typical day my duties are to keep my area neat and tidy, to assist customers with product selection and information. I also operate a POS system daily. The management team are fantastic and have provided me the opportunity to grow my leadership skill set. They trust in me to provide direction and guidance to my fellow associates so that they are able to focus on more important tasks."
bad,Associates wee expected to work for wages that did not meet their job needs.  They were expected to have little tools or training when starting.  Management would not give associates time to associates and needs.  It is not a family oriented company.  When given supervisor or management positions they expect you to put the company over family.  They do not stick to policies when they have positions available.
bad,"Wal-Mart will help you get where you want to go professionally. I moved quickly from a part time job into salary management. This is the good, however, what they fail to tell you is the total time commitment that moving from hourly to salary will require. You will give up holidays, weekends, and sometimes even your evenings."
bad,"you felt like just another number working at this job, many sexual harassment claims, and rude management"
bad,"With the recent changes and craziness it seems like Walmart has little respect for employees. You don't meet a certain quota at the end of the day, your job is threatened. Even if you work hard you have very little to show for it, just sore feet and knees. When the big wigs come in their are no 'thank yous' or anything of the sorts. They come barging in to find every little thing wrong even down to the dust that accumulated during the day when you clean every night. When I can just do my own thing and be left alone to do my job its not so bad. But its just so tiring to hear negatives on a daily basis. I noticed in the store I am in now that if your in a small clique with certain managers you seem to get away with sitting  on benches and talking in a cliquey group."
bad,not real direction. workday was busy which wasn't a problem. i loved my job but the managment was poor. quick to call out certain people for bad reasons but rarely did you see writeups for good work.
bad,"had a difficult time at this job, constantly being sexually harassed by other employees , and managers did not show appreciation or compassion."
bad,"Stock shelves, reset modular, assist customers, supervise associates, order and display merchandise. The hardest part is too much work and not enough time. The most enjoyable part is I made a few good friends."
bad,"I would manage 8 employee under me. We would cull produce, set end cap, and stock.  A typical day for me would be check the freight, do counts, put away the freight, help costumer  and stock. I enjoyed working with the costumers."
bad,didn't have to much time working here but the time I did I was treated with the most respect.
bad,Walmart was very assumptive of what people were doing and never followed through with actual investigation of employee actions being taken to keep up or correcting mistakes. Management was often hard to work with and usually very unreasonable. Hours fluctuate constantly and they went through employees as though they were nothing. You never quite get recognition for jobs done to an exceptional level as long as something is being done. The pay is low for the labor they expect under the frequent stressful situations they put you through. Other employees tend to make it harder for you to do your job efficiently. Overall it was a poor job experience. I didn't really enjoy any aspects of this work environment. If there was anything I enjoyed it was a small handful of my co-workers.
bad,"My days seemed to get longer each day I arrived at work. We had to constantly get everything ready because previous shifts never had things setup and ready for our shift to begin. I helped stock pallets and carts for sorting of inventory before we took it to the floor. We were not allowed to take breaks until truck was entirely finished, going against the companies policy of every 2 hours you receive a break. I would typically get to lunch around 9pm, come back at 10pm and begin taking all sorted merchandise to the sales floor, when finished, I would assist the next shift in stocking product so they could get their schedules work done by the end of the shift. "
bad,"Walmart in general is a good place to work. They have many different sections, and places for growth. Their were some cons about working at Walmart, but you can find that at any work place. I would recommend people to work at Walmart."
bad,It is very hard to move up in this company. Not like it use to be.
bad,"During my time as a tech, for wal-mart TLC I performed many different duties. I began as just a regular tech. learning to"
bad,"i enjoy meeting new people,  you always have so many mananger  on at one time at walmart and didnt no what one to listen too"
bad,"I work in the Tire Lube Express Department at Walmart. I am responsible for operating the register, cutting keys, taking tire and oil orders, keeping the sales floor clean and presentable, dealing with customers, battery cores and new batteries, and stocking shelves."
bad,You spend a lot of your day trying to get to what you planned for the day
bad,not much to say. the job is ok. If u like o stay busy it's the place for you.
bad,I work here for a few weeks on third shift. This company does not care about your personal life whatsoever. when you are hired you start as temp and have literally no perks to working other than ok pay.
bad,I worked there for 9 years was a good job until they started getting rid of all of the full timers.
bad,"Push carts, greet customers, clean parking lot, and help customers carry stuff out."
bad,Walmart is not worth the stress they put you through at work every day. You walk into work and there is no motivation anywhere you look and it seems as though everyone does not want to be there
bad,I would order fill orders that can from the walmart stores and sams clubs. I would have to fill 2 pallets full of grocery items and stack them nice and neat in an interlocking fashion so the food would not fall over and get damage. I have learned how to stack and drive power equipment at walmart also working in a fast paced environment. My co-workers really just keep to them selfs cause this job is primarily a job that would do on your own with no one to talk to or little or no supervision. The hardest part of the job is the demand of walking and bending over for 10 plus hours a day. Plus the heat in the middle of summer.
bad,"typically the store is under staffed and managers are careless regarding employees  feelings,opinions, and safety"
bad,"Get to work, start stocking meat.  Look for bad meat or meat that is passed date.  Worst part of the day is working in the cold freezers and fridges.  Best part is 10% off of store items (not food though). Co workers were decent.  Management was decent as well"
bad,"I opened the deli getting meats and cheeses ready for sale, put chickens on the rotisserie would turn fryers on ect. I would check dates on all meats and cheeses and throw the bad stuff out. would prepare and subs and meat trays ready that may be ordered for that day . Would then wait on customers for the rest of the shift."
bad,"My job as sales associate was to stock freight for the grocery, paper goods, chemicals, and pets departments as well as help customers along the way. I did learn how to use equipment such as the walkie stacker and the electric pallet jack. Working with the people at Walmart was kind of a mixed bag. The employees for the most part were very nice and easy to talk to, while the managers on the other hand typically weren't as nice. The hardest part of this job was to manage all of the departments at once by yourself. The best part was working with the employees."
bad,On a average day you have many departments to work. Can't get the work done and they complain even when your constantly helping the front end. Managers tell you your not doing anything when your working your butt off. Schedule is always messed up.
bad,when i went into work i had to stock the frozen food department with new products and with products that needed to be filled in. I also had the opportunity to learn how to work in different departments. the management was ok but there was one i had trouble with.
bad,"The environment just is not a pleasant one. However, the coworkers were delightful!"
bad,"A typical day was baking breads and helping customers find what they needed. I did learn valuable skills at walmart while being a baker, I learned how to properly deal with customersand work in a fast environment."
bad,not enough money. to much management not enough workers. stocking shelves with product.
bad,"Productive in cake decorating area, but its not very relaxed. customer service is a must. Management is not always on one accord. Some co-workers are fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is all the excess  work that has to be done before you can start doing what has to be done for the customers which is preparing their cakes for that day. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customers compliment you about how beautiful the work you have done on their cakes. The next enjoyable thing is going home after a hard day."
bad,"What can i say its walmart you can decide for yourself."
bad,"Enjoyed my past employers. As I semi retire would like to work daytime hours for 3-4 more years. Looking for less stress as wal-mart having a hard time finding good workers. I have shopped at shopko and really like the way their stores look and everyone working seem very happy,"
bad,"A typical day at Walmart starts off seeing what's in the process of being done before starting anything else new. Stocking freight that has either been de-plenished or almost de-plenished, and then condense the backroom storage bins for better inventory efficiency. I've learned several procedures in certain areas and other departments mainly because I've worked here for so long. The hardest part of the job is being overwhelm with too many tasks for one person in a certain time window. The constant scaling of hours does not help with finances. These are the problems I face here. Other locations are not necessary operate the way my store. The most enjoyable part of the job is relationships you develop with most co-workers."
bad,"- Clock-in and get to work. The manager would ask you to perform a task and a time limit to make sure you are capable of doing the job."
bad,"-Greet customers and ring up customer sales and transacations as well as assist in any questions to meet customer needs"
bad,"Perform a multitude of tasks in various settings"
bad,At Wal-Mart I was often required to fill in for other positions as needed. I had to be flexible as well as dependable. I enjoyed working with customers and fulfilling their needs.
bad,"Low staffed and not enough associates to meet the demand of the customers, constantly dealing with frustrated customers because check out lines were long, due to not enough cashiers, and no floor associates to help with customer assistance. Management had positions available to hire more employee but wouldn't to cut cost for their own benefits. Having to do the job of 5 different people in different departments made it difficult to do the job I was hired to do, without making any mistakes.. Management was uncaring about the situation even when it was brought to their attention by customers, they just agree with the customer then turned a blind eye.."
bad,"A day at work at Walmart would start with a management meeting where I was given direction and priorities based on the needs of the store.  I would then meet with my department managers and tour my areas while taking notes so I could give detailed tasks to my associates and to get a better idea of how I could merchandise in my areas.  I would then work in the areas that needed my attention the most, while also performing the duties I was given by upper-management.  I would spend time checking electronic resources for info on sales, training updates, etc..  I would follow up on tasks that I had given to associates throughout the day and move resources as needed.  I learned a lot working as a ZMS at Walmart.  I learned how to use minimal resources to accomplish large tasks.  Also, I learned how to better prioritize my goals and tasks.  Working at Walmart also taught me how to adjust to change quickly and efficiently.  My co-workers were very professional and supportive of a team environment.  Management that was above me rotated often and sometimes there were several managers giving me opposing direction at the same time.  I would close my day by attending a management meeting to report on how my tasks went and then preparing turnover notes for the night shift and instructions for associates to complete while I was gone.  "
bad,"I worked in three separate facilities over the course of several years, and the culture of each facility depended entirely on the management at that facility."
bad,"Working at register, handling & processing money & transactions from customers & employess. Meeting new people everyday. Staying shorthand."
bad,Walmart was easy to work for. Cashiering is the easiest. I learned how to handle rude people. Management wasnt so great. They mistreat their workers. Co-workers were friendly and helped when I needed it. There really wasnt anything physically hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the paychecks I worked so hard for.
bad,"They want the least possible employees, and they want them working as hard as possible for the lowest pay they can work out of them.  About the only good thing I can say about working for this greedy corporation is that you get an employee discount."
bad,Walmart was over all a nice place to work but is very unorganized.
bad,"Remodeling the store, was to become permanent, budget didn't allow for new hires."
bad,I like it but management is very bad I would not do it again its a  good for a first job.
bad,"This job didn't last very long. I was hired on at the same time the store was doing re-modeling to make room for Subway. From what I remember, I didn't particularly enjoy the job. I decorated cupcakes and prepared (frosted) cakes to be decorated for customers, and wrote down orders. My co-workers and boss were alright. My hours were decent as well. The only downside that really bothered me was getting punished for working past my shift when I was busy with customers or preparing product."
bad,"A typical day as a Walmart manager was very hectic.  Store management meetings came first thing in the morning, followed by zone walks and admin duties.  "
bad,"Muito bom trabalhar, aprendi a respeita muito mais as pessoas embora a gerencia de lá não sabia fazer isso."
bad,"Immediate managers over you do not care if you receive your breaks and lunch on time but will make sure that they get theirs on time."
bad,"Really need to learn what equal treatment of workers is. Need to actually follow company policy. I liked most of my coworkers, but your never gonna like them all."
bad,"Typically work 8 hours a day, Monday - Friday from 7 a.m to 4 p.m. You get two 15 minute breaks plus an hour lunch. Management is never on the same page so therefore you are getting pulled in several different directions. This makes it very hard to get any thing done. There is also not enough staffing and expect each person to perform the work of several people. The hardest part of the job is trying to get everything you are told to get done and still be able to help the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with."
bad,I was basically a floater. I worked any and every department in the store as needed. The pay isn't equal to the amount of labor expected of employees. 
bad,I accomplished much more at walmart. I liked my customers and my employees. Did not always see eye to eye with management. Overall I learned a lot about many different departments and enjoyed all the experience I received.
bad,"Good pay for retail environment.  Poor benefits for hourly employees."
bad,The management was pour. Full of people who think they are better then you because they make more money. Place was horrible.
bad,You can make a pay checkbut no where to live. Very cold in the cooler
bad,I loved working there but management team was changing almost ever 3 months
bad,i started out on floor crew learned how to run ride on floor cleaner. some of my co-workers were hard to work with but i just done my job.management wasn't to bad they help and answered quistions when needed.i moved from floor crew to stocking shelves at night.i enjoyed the change to learn new things and was able to help others in their dept.
bad,"I worked there for almost 8 years and enjoyed the majority of it. I learned many different areas of the store. I learned how to recieve merchandise claim out merchandise, the hardest part of the job was our management team, they seemed to show alot of favoritism and if you werent with the group they ran you out."
bad,"Typical days at the store included a hectic wave of customers."
bad,"The hours are impossible to balance with school, the supervisors/management have very little care towards staff and often talk down to them. The work environment is extremely loud and a very large portion of customers are hostile and angry. There are no opportunities to talk with co-workers. The most difficult part is having no support or help from the management who trained you badly. The best part was that at least they gave you enough hours."
bad,"Typical day was assisting customers, some of who were very rude and, picking up after children whose parents thought my department was a play area.  Putting up re shops, zoning and cleaning the department, printing and flagging the department, and stocking the shelves with merchandise as well as covering my neighboring departments.  The most I learned was how to be good a customer service.  How to smile while someone is being very rude to you!  The management in my store on the shift I was on was fairly good!  The only problem was that they didn't make themselves readily available when called.  I was the only 2-11 associate in the toy department so I didn't have anyone with me, and most of the time there was no one in the 2 neighboring departments, so I was constantly called to cover them also.  The hardest part of the job was the constant standing and climbing I had to do.  The most enjoyable part of this job was going home at night!"
bad,Always a eventful day. Many customer interventions while making a enjoyable day for all 
bad,The management was terrible and the pay was low for all the work that we did in the back room. Equipment rarely worked properly.
bad,The Florida Heat is the worst when working outside. Flexible Schedules are a plus.
bad,"Walmart has went downhill a lot in the past few years, at least this one.The more I went along the sloppier and unbalanced it got. Manager communication was terrible, the right hand never knew what the left was doing. You would waste time doing one thing and have to change it ten minutes later because another manager didn't like it. The problem seems to be in upper management, the assistants don't communicate at all. The co managers jump to conclusions before they get all the facts. And the store manager seems to hide behind two of the co's, letting them make most of the decisions for him. The hardest part of my job was getting my people to work, upper management didn't seem to care as long as I got all of my work finished myself. "
bad,"was fun hard work met lots of good people and experienced every department in Walmart, if u need to know where something was, just ask me I knew that store like the back of my hand"
bad,This place would be a lot better if management would all get on the same page and communicate with ALL of the employees.
bad,Travel to specific retail outlets and solve issues within the store. Pre sell seasonal items and ensure that all products are on the selling floor.
bad,Great workplace with a family atmosphere but due to economical difficulties layoffs were inevitable.
bad,"A typical day here consists of unloading freight off trucks onto pallets. After this task is complete we must unload the grocery truck and down stack the grocery onto carts. Once this is completed carts are distributed to corresponding aisles for 3rd shift to stock. After all freight and grocery has been pulled to the sales floor, we have to sort and hang apparel onto designated racks."
bad,"you are treated with disrespect because the corporate ladder has padded steps.... anyone in good with the manager or co-manager did good... but if you dare to complain, make suggestions, or have children you were pretty much do it or fired.... co-workers were always complaining and I agreed with them.... the hardest part of my job was the negativity by the management... the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people...."
bad,"A job. Not enough hours. Great co-workers. working at the company was very stressful, no kind of leadership."
bad,"Working at Walmart is essentially just another job. In electronics its a little different primarily because there is a lot of face time with customers. One of the issues with Walmart electronics is that since Walmart is not specialized specifically in electronics such as MicroCenter or Fry's, it has its limitations in products and this can frustrate customers which can end up being vented towards the sales rep."
bad,"Ok but was not that great in Indiana, lost a child to sids and they cared at first but then changed how they were. Would throw giving me time off in my face when they wanted something done. A few people there were great. A couple there would ruin it all for me though."
bad,"A typical day at work is usually hectic.  I learn a lot of different things daily thru my associates, co workers, etc. Management most can learn more on a dily basis, the hardest part of my job is to get some areas back on track.  the most enjoyable part of my job is engagemnet with our customers and associates."
bad,"When I worked for Wal-Mart I felt as though I always had to walk on egg shells.  There was poor communication between the members of management and the other crew members.  I was always told something different to do by both managers and when i didn't get something done the opposing member of management would be upset that I was unable to complete their task in the time given.  They have a bad habit of running the store on the smallest crew possible.  I found myself having to get very good at prioritizing things at the store.  The most important thing was to make sure that every customer was taken care of regardless of what other tasks I had on hand.  The most enjoyable thing about my nights at the store was that most of my co-workers were pleasant to be around and regardless of being physically and mentally drained we always were able to find a way to keep each other in positive spirits. The back-room system is completely and totally flawed and they need to find a way to fix their system, the same goes for their ""My Guide"" system."
bad,aprendi que metas  é uma busca constante da felicidade ideal.
bad,"It's a job that can get you by. There is no shame in working with the staff and customers, as long as it is manageable for you. Unsatisfied customers can be challenging, but it is easy to brush off how they treat you if you are confident in your abilities."
bad,"Higher income,also more promotions,and also more apprecation for the mutiple tasks."
bad,"Empresa bastante dinâmica e abre bastante portas, instiga e desafia seus associados."
bad,I've been there 2 and a half years now and I work my butt off for these people and I don't feel they appreciate it. Going into the pharmacy I was told I would be made into a pharmacy technician after a little while and once the manager left the new person that took her place had no interest in making me a tech even though I pretty much do everything a technician does. I'm tired of being under appreciated. The best thing about working there though are my really nice coworkers and the bonuses you get every three months based on your stores performance.
bad,"well i first started working for wal-mart in february of 2012 as a cashier. pay was good considering i was just part time. as are all cashiers. in july of 2012 i advanced to deli thinking it would be a better suit for me. more money,better hours. and health benefits. about 2 weeks into working in the deli i had been throwing up daily. and leaving working early all the time. i went to the e.r after work one day and they told me i was allergic to the cooking oil the deli used. so i asked to be transferred back to being a cashier. they would NOT let me go back to being a cashier so i agreed that i would go to TLE as a service writer. but until then i had to stay in the deli. well days go by and i still have yet to sign my transfer papers to go to TLE. so i went to managment to talk to them about it. they had given my job in TLE to someone else. they offered to move me to pets but that would require me to lift heavy boxes/bags which i cannot do because i have sculiosis and a pinched nerve. because i could not accept their offer in pets that told me i HAD to stay in deli . i had to quit this job on the spot as i had lost 20lbs in 2 weeks. to this day they still give me a bad refference when someone calls. i hope you all have a better experience's with this company then i did."
bad,"A very selfish place to work. Managers only care for themselves giving tasks that overwhelm workers, shows favoritism to employees that are friends. Does not care about workers personal situations and low rate of pay with no overtime"
bad,Walmart had placed 4 complete management teams in 5 years. Inventory shrink had increased every year. More was expected while creating a hostile owrk environment and did not allow overtime.
bad,I hope that my honesty is not held against me. I am a very hard worker and my excellent evaluations are proof of that.
bad,"The number one rule was respect for the individual, i did not get that at all even when i would try to bring it to higher management, nothing was changed. To big of a company with to many micro managers. Got up at 5 am to go to the bakery to work with a bunch of females with bad attitudes, and to have managers frantic 24 -7 about things that associates have no control over."
bad,"Never enough crew to get the amount of work done, manager's almost never around and inexperienced. Manager's contradicted other manager's, same answer's to every question/problem often without hearing the entire question/problem. looks down on union jobs, doesn't allow doctor's notes for illnesses. Co-workers were the only positive part of job, they were nice and helpful for being overworked."
bad,"The work, began every night at 10pm, with emidiate custumer service, that required showing customers jewelry,then ringing them up,while delagating waitng custumers as well.I did not get to really stock,until 2am most nights."
bad,Ive been there 2 years and I have went from being a cashier up front to being a cashier in the pharmacy temporarly and now I am a Photo center tech. I enjoy my co workers and most of us work well as a team. Some of the management is great and others dont seem to work well with others.
bad,The pharmacy crew was great to work with. Always willing to help each other out. It was consistently busy. They expected more work done with less people and hours to give
bad,trying to stay in rules and regulations due to very easy to get fired
bad,"For a huge well known company only 10 percent discount. will work you till death if in management and does not care if you have family. Job security depends on if you store is a trouble store or not. If its a store that is always firing management, then i suggest go some where else. benefits are also horrible too"
bad,"I didn't like the unorganized environment, the crazy schedules, sometimes the 15hour shifts"
bad,horrible place
bad,"go in at 5 a.m set up and open the deli department. Set up all log books for the day. Check the order book prepare all orders deli trays, subs and salads. Then start on the subs and salads for the cases. Begin the cooking for the cases. wait on customers. stock the kitchen and dinning areas. stock the deli shelfs. Inventory and order for the deli department. I learned about the temps, how to use the pallrt jack, bailer, telzon. My dept mangers were good. My co-workers worked. the hardest part was probabaly working the freezers. I enjoyed working with the public"
bad,"Typical work day: review emails for new projects, or concerns, or issues for your department. Stock your department, order, and change prices. Set new merchandise to feature."
bad,hardest part of the job was having your attendance held against you when your children are extremely sick and in and out of the hospital for week. they did not accept any doctors excuses even from the emergency room and held every call off against you. I worked hard while i was at walmart did my job better and more proficient then anyone else and followed the policy. Even some co workers had many complaints about walmart and how they treat the employees. Best part of the job was working with the customers and making them happy and having all the kids smile.
bad,"Working as a cashier at any retail establishment is an easy but aggravating job. It is rather mindless to stand at a register and cash people out for 8 hours a day. The part that is hard are the angry customers that yell at the cashiers for no reason. The coworkers really again are the best part about the job, they helped to make the day go by. The management at this location was not the best I have experienced."
bad,"A day at work would involve assisting customers, running the cash registers, stocking shelves and moving merchandise. I learned how to put the customer first and how to provide friendly service. Management were mostly worried about how things reflected on them and took that out on the workers. Co-workers were nice and helpful. The hardest part is assisting a customer in an area of the store where you have little knowledge. The most enjoyable part is when you are able to help someone who didn't expect to have their problem fixed."
bad,"A typical day at work as a overnight cashier has multiple paces during one shift. I have learned multiples skills such as customer service, customer sevice management, and money transfers for customers. Management can use better communication skills and my co-workers are usually pleasant to work with. The hardest part of my job is staying awake at night and the most enjoyable part of my job is getting my paycheck."
bad,* Take job serious
bad,I didnt have a good experience at walmart.It was not for me some people like working there.It takes a very tolerant person to work there.
bad,"Good benefits, but you have no time for a life. At all. They want you to be ALL about their company. They believe they should be number one on your priority list, all that talk about the 'Walmart Family' is complete bull. There are many people there who won't do their job, so if you're known for actually DOING your job, you will be forced to do their job as well. Because they would rather pass off the job on someone they know will get it done then confront or fire a slacker."
bad,"If you are in a department with a crew it is an ok place to work. Learned alot in many departments. Upper management makes it difficult to complete all tasks or provide quality customer service with a skeleton crew. Most co-workers are great and fun to work with if you have a chance to work with them. Too many pointless meetings that pull you away from getting your job done,"
bad,"é uma das empresas onde não se tem muito recursos, mas aprendi a lidar mais com as chefias, mais deixa a desejar quando se falam em integração pessoal."
bad,"A typical day at work would involve one RPh with a shift from 8 am to 5 pm and another RPh arriving at noon and closing at 9 pm. Each RPh would stand at a particular computer and do a 4 pt.check on each new rx then a visual check of each (new and refill) rx before bagging the prescription and stapling the pharmacy receipt to the bag. Every action of each RPh was recorded by the Walmart computer system. The average number of prescriptions which were four point checked and visualized were recorded for daily, weekly and monthly percentages. Therefore, if a pharmacist was interested or felt the need to walk out front into the otc section and personally help a patient with questions or recommendations or actually spend time counseling a patient for appropriate medication usage, that time spent away from their work station would actually decrease that particular pharmacist's work production averages. Consequently causing that pharmacist to be ""coached"" by the DM. After three coachings a RPh is terminated. That is the ""hardest"" part of the job of working for Walmart. The management of pharmacy at Walmart is interested in numbers only and not the quality of particular patient care. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay rate which doesn't matter as much when the professionalism of your career has been taken out of the equation."
bad,Very simple place to apply and recieve employment.
bad,"cant move up in company, favor certain people. when u need a day off for personal reason they hold it against you.not family friendly. very me ,me, me.. nothing for the employee."
bad,"As a cashier it's pretty much straight forward checking bagging merchandise for customers. Sales people were in charge of keeping their departments clean, stocked, and helping customers when needed. Learned much about customer service in this job. As with all jobs, co-workers had some good people and some bad people. Most other cashiers were fun to be around and chat with, others were naturally quarrelsome, a few with personal issues. Save for a few cases, management was an overall letdown. One instance had one of the managers discipline a cashier about attendance while she was on the job tending to customers. Completely unprofessional. Would not work here again."
bad,It was nice meeting and becoming friends with many other co-workers and the 10% discount was great along with the extra discounts at Christmas !!! Raises were nothing to talk about
bad,registrava as mercadorias e lidava com valores.
bad,"A typical day at work is very stress less, because I work in the cosmetics department of my store and I stock shelves and monitor the area for 5 hours Mon-Fri"
bad,when I first started at walmart I loved it then the management wanted to much work done for a little bit of pay they didn't treat us like we were workers at all the most enjoyable part of my day was going home .
bad,Management does not acknowledge the hard work that so many of their employees do on a day to day basis. If you want to move up in this company you have to give up your life away from work along with any free thinking you may posses..
bad,"Everyday you are constantly trying to do the same thing and there is never time to perfect any aspect in our buisness. The lack of associates leaves of with freight that doesnt get worked from our truck deliveries. This causes our backroom to be full constantly. My job is to manage the backroom and everyday I attempt to clear it up little by little. Any area I clear in the backroom just gets filled the next day. So its constantly a daily battle for the same thing. The management team is good at giving direction but really doesn't do alot of physical work to help the store. But the most enjoyable part of my job is just the people I work with. If it werent for the people that work there, I probably wouldn't be there."
bad,"constant grind, gets old really quick."
bad,mue dia tipico no trabalho cansativo eu prende a separa ortfrute quero dizer separa frutas e verduras para lojas e adirecao ea gerencia sao pessima em comunicacao e os meu colegas de trabalho bom tenho penas deles aprte mais dificil do trabalho era viver com falcidade dos encarregados gerente e aparte mais agrdavel do trabalho e quando saia de folga ou quando ia para casa.
bad,"Productive workplace, but management is a bit rude. Overall good pay, but a stressful enviornment."
bad,"A typical work day was taking orders from customers such as; oil changes or a tire replacement. I learned how to strengthen my people skills by interacting with customers, and other co-workers."
bad,Was promised that I would have more employees working for my Departments and never followed through. Therefore I had to work twice as hard to acomplish everything that needed to be done.
bad,The best part about this job is that your opinion is valued and heard.
bad,Management was all over the place there was no communication.
bad,Expectations of the associates grows higher and higher which push away employees and destroys morale and while we lose man-power the expectations continue to grow
bad,Typical day of worked consisted of stocking food. I leared that the food should always be rotated. Management was harsh and rude. Co-workers where slow and non-energetic. There where no hard or enjoyable parts of the job.
bad,"I learned a lot at at this brand new door-per-store facility, serving 100 stores. The hours were extreme at times (18 hours one day and coming in on off days more often than not)."
bad,managers like to yell at you for no reason. they dont care if you have a pneumonia or your dying you still have to work.
bad,"my day started at 10.00 pm I had 4 to 6 cashiers under me, we would stard out reviewing what had to be acomplished . I would assign some to the registars, others to (shop the store) and the rest to start working on the go-backs then I would look up the assistant manager for the night to find out what progects were on the schedule. I enjoyed workig w/ management and my co-workers."
bad,A typical day at is making sure all customers are satisfied with my great customer service skills. I have learned that Walmart is a good place to work if you enjoy staying busy during your entire work shift. It is also fact-paced and a great motivation to pursue your career goals. The hardest part of the job is pleasing management. Nothing is good enough and no matter what the customers are definitely always right. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting various people along with their cultures and traditions.
bad,One of the worst jobs that I have ever had. Management is awful and do not care about you as a person. If you have to work there know that the pay is bad and the job is soul crushing.
bad,"My typical day at work required me to report to my department n to see what my department manager had on her ""to-do"" list for me. If our department was up to date at the time, we were required to assist the rest of the store. While working at Walmart I learned a lot about customer service and inventory management. One of my daily duties was to uphold the inventory of the department. I also learned how to work with multiple tasks in one day. As far as Management, I'm pretty sure this applies everywhere but there were some good one's and some bad one's. Co-workers were a little hard to deal with but i stayed out of the mist of the gossip and kept to myself while still interacting with others in a productive manner. The hardest part of the job was miscommunication. Multiple managers could ask you to do many tasks without acknowledgement of the others(nor concern sometimes). This sometimes made me look bad as an employee just following instructions. But my most enjoyable part of the job would have to be seeing certain associates and customers. They can really uplift and lighten a mood sometimes."
bad,My Typical day at work is keeping a smile on my face at all times. Some days i have great customers other days i have not so great customers. Though i Love my job the management is a total reck. I love the coworkers that i have at this current time we all help each other and work as a team. no hard parts about the job. If you dont have the patience cashiering is not for you. The most enjoyable part about the job is meeting new people and making sure my customers walk out with a smile
bad,I worked in the back where there was no air conditioning. I didnt learn a whole lot because I didnt work there very long because i was on medical leave due to complications with my pregnancy. The hardest part of the job was trying to work in four different departments and still stay in the department that im was hired to be in.
bad,The position you're in determines how you feel about your job.
bad,You learn a lot in a fast passed enviroment although expectations are extremely unreasonable. Lots of room for movement.
bad,a typical day at work would be to review the cameras and pursue theives. the most enjoyable part of the job is that i feel as though another criminal is caught and hopefully taught a lesson.
bad,A typical day at work in volves going in checking the backroom for freight that the overnight team did not finish or has more often left because they just didnt want to deal with. Then I scan my lows and outs on the salesfloor. From that point I work my exceptions and get started on my notes and projects for the day. As my associates come in I assign them their tasks and we work together to get things accomplished.
bad,"An okay place to work at as long as you don't want to advance. You'll work hard. If an opening becomes available, such as department manager, the position will be given to someone they choose based on favoritism, nepitism or personal bias not on merit. I know this from personal experience. At the store I worked at they would decide who would get the position even before they had posted the position."
bad,terrible management at the distribution center and treates employes like 2nd class citizens
bad,"Most of the people who work at Walmart for any length of time are really nice, hard-working people. Some management is as well. Others are pretentious, self-righteous control freaks. The work load at my Walmart seems excessive and even unrealistic. It creates an environment where work either cannot be done correctly or cannot be done within the given timeframe. It also seems that the driving force for this way of doing things is executive bonuses, which drives resentment from those people busting their hump trying to get all the work done on time."
bad,"A typical day at work was very busy and a lot of the times understaffed. Some of my co-workers were enjoyable to be around and hard working people, but there were also just as many people that did not do much to help their fellow co-workers and that made working there just as unenjoyable. It seemed that no matter how many times or different people in management that I approached about a problem, nothing was ever done. I worked at this job for almost six years and tried several times to move to a different department but was never allowed. I was told twice that I would be moving to a different department, by two different managers and it never happened. I had to approach them to find out why nothing was happening after a month went by with no results. The hardest part about working at this job was that I would work hard while others did not, and while I got in trouble for being out sick, those that showed up and did no work went un-punished. I feel like I wasted six years of my life at this job and its sad because had I been allowed to change departments I feel that I could have done extremely well and had the opportunity to learn a lot more."
bad,I enjoyed the job and working with people. but Compensation was poor.
bad,"hate the management and how they run things though, always make you do more than your task asks for, none of them are on the same page one will tell you one thing and the other tells you different and both tell you there right do it there way if you get caught doing it the other ones way you get held accountable for that and they take it out on you, they play favortisim and depending on what manager you get to work with depends on how well they follow walmart rules and guidelines, cbls are also a big part of walmart but on 3rd shift were told not to do them so they end up being late and we get held accountable for em and get to a certain level of coaching! I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there but def. a must visit the people that work there are truly amazing!!"
bad,- there is always a lot to do
bad,my typical day consist of the same thing provide the best service for each customer.
bad,"Alright managment schedule was unrealistic lot of work for a little bit of pay,no overtime"
bad,"I liked the pay, walmart bases your pay grade off of experience. I disliked the amount of management they had. There had to have been at least 10 or more different manager and assistant managers, you never knew who to go to with issues or questions, when it came time for review someone gave it that I had never met, and had information from other managers I had never met."
bad,Its an ok job for right now just not long term. You have four to five supervisors over you at any givin time that are all telling you different things to do.
bad,"I was hired to be a cake decorator at the Walmart in Piqua, Ohio in July of last year. Starting out, I did love the job, specifically decorating cakes which was my job. However, the longer I work for Walmart, the longer I dislike my management and the company as a whole."
bad,A typical day at work was stocking shelves at a fast pace
bad,I worked overnight so by the time i came in the store was a mess. Every night we had to clean and put out stock that came in on trucks every night. All this had to be done by 7 a.m. in the morning. Usaually we got it done but some nights where harder then others.
bad,"walmart as a whole was great, but the management was not professional/"
bad,I enjoyed working with the company but make sure when you do your application that you mark the hours that you want to work these week and day's off because once you get hired it hard to change them.
bad,Nothing is ever in stone and always changes 50 times but tests are good and so is change it keeps you from being stagnant.
bad,the company was great but so of the managment was unpleasent and made my work expericence there a not so good one
bad,"My experience as a Wal-Mart employee was only somewhat good. The work itself to me was fine and I liked my coworkers, but I felt that the Wal-Mart I worked at was poorly managed. Also, I feel like they had little interest for the employees. They did not give you good benefits and expected you to work in different departments at once. Lastly, I was an apparel associate but was sometimes used as a cashier with no training, because they didnt want to hire enough cashiers. They never took the time to train me but expected me to know what to do. Those were very bad experiences for me. Their scheduling was also no good."
bad,WalMart is a great place to work if you have two incomes and the other person has great medical benefits. I don't know if its because the economy but you are lucky if you get 12 hours a week. The workers are great once you get to know them. WalMart is all about their stocks and stock holders not about their employees.
bad,I really enjoy working in this type of job it's what I do best.Walmart doesn't let you be your best because rules change from day to day one manager says you are doing a good job while the other asked why did you do it a certain way and tells you to change it and you explain the other manager says it was fine and he or she says to change it because he or she doesn't like it.
bad,"Its a good company, pay raises are slow, advancement chances are their but are rather difficult. Your performance may be overlooked. Really stressful at times and with no set schedule and overtime and not a high starting pay."
bad,easy to advance wonderful health insurance plans vacation days easy to obtain great as a starting job
bad,No job security with poor management. Products are well below par.
bad,"Not enough pay, not enough benefits, not enough opportunity for advancement."
bad,I enjoyed the freedom I got when I was able to work in the lawn and garden department. I also enjoyed working with the customers and the fast paced environment. The surpervisor was always very rude and short. The person employed to do the hiring was very much under the impression that she was better then everybody else and made her position known.
bad,they make it hard for you to transfer out or to any other postions. They coach you like crazy if you want to leave your postions. They watch you to make sure you aren't stealing even when you are not. Pay is good but it isn't enough to cover rent or pay other bills. alot of people who work at walmart end up having two to three jobs. Policies are not quite followed. they make you work even though you are at the point of fainting. you can't even go home if you are sick unless you call in and that ends up on your records. People act like high schoolers there. best advice watch what you say because it will spread like wild fire at wal-mart. health care is too expensive.
bad,Was overall a positive place to work their main focus was for their customers and what they wanted and would do their best to make sure every customer left happy and satisified.
bad,"I am sorry that I cannot give a great review for this company. I went into it, thinking that it would be a great place to work and be a fulfilling place to work. I worked very hard to the point of having panic attacks and almost blacking-out on several occasions. The harder I worked, the more they wanted. Also, it was a rule that we were to get every fourth weekend off, but that rarely happened. Finally I got burned-out. I had to quit. That night, I tried to call the store several times, with no answer, so I ended up being a ""no call, no show."" I am a people-person that tries very hard to please others. But the more I tried to please my employer, the more they wanted."
bad,"Good stable job but lacked advancement in the workplace, job security, and managing skills. Did not care about familly matters. Easy to anger and upset if did not meet rediculous demands."
bad,"Not worth the lack of benefits. A lot of the management team is great on a personal level, but every employee's worth at work is reflected in their work attitude."
bad,"People Don't Work All They Do Is Talk. Team Lead Just Watch You Like A Hawk, You Ask For Certain Days Off They Look At You Like U Stupid... So Emotional Drain Just Need A New Job With Weekend Off.."
bad,"Management rotated every 6 months so nothing stayed the same. So you must be very open to change OFTEN. If you are not, plan on being frustrated. On the plus side, there are definitely opportunities to move up into management as those positions always become available."
bad,If you have full availability and like to be a part of the team at Walmart you will enjoy the experience. There is always room for promotion if you put yourself out there. The people I worked with were great and I had fun with the customers as well.
bad,The managers don’t care how they treat you  as long as they are getting paid. They will ignore you till customers are literally walking out of the store because they are so fed up with it
bad,Did not want to leave Walmart. Management abuses their power and created a hostile workplace for me and my team. seeking other opportunities at other companies who will appreciate my work
bad,I did like the job and what i had to do. Stocking isn’t a problem to me and i’ll love finding that position in another job that i might get hired for.
bad,it is easy to move up positions at this job and it pays over minimum wage. however if you are a minor there are many restrictions to what you can do and when you can work.
bad,Booneville Walmart is a horrible place to work for. The managers are aweful and very disrespectful. They don't appreciate anything. I would not recommend anyone to work there.
bad,Nothing too serious about Walmart it is a good place to work and they pay well but it’s not really what you expect especially from management. Managers aren’t doing what they should
bad,"When I first started I was on overnights and everything ran smoothly. i also was in school at the time so the manager on overnights was very helpful when it came to my schedule. When I moved to Cap one associate ,which is four in the morning to one in the afternoon, at that time we got a new store manager. This store manager has no respect for his coworkers. He made my whole team go out in the middle of winter while it was pouring rain, with no coats on to push carts in. It was not and has never been part of our job description. Then once we came back in soaking wet, we were sent back to frozen and dairy to finish our pallets. I do recommend  the company as a whole because they give you many benefits and are good with schedule flexibility. I do not recommend working at Home wood Illinois. Store 5404."
bad,"Delivered First Class customer service via phone, email, internet and fax. Assist customers with placing orders, providing quotes, and samples. Following up on orders and assisting outside sales people is a part of this position. Ability to communicate."
bad,"To me management wasn't good, they let everyone get away with anything except the hard workers, they had to pick up the slack of the workers that wouldn't do anything. "
bad,The company cares more about the dollars it makes than employees. bottom line this used to be a job that worked aound employees to make schedules now you either work what they have or you don't work.
bad,This job was fantastic for building customer service and professional social skills. However the job overworks it's employees for such a low wage and often neglects to issue brakes and even lunches to it employees.
bad,"The Job in itself is a great job!"
bad,I learned a lot but management needs to quit being afraid of their bosses. Everyone likes to point fingers without having a solution. Not enough help.
bad,Very hard to work up. If you wanted to be a manager you can act like one but never get paid the salary you deserve. Some of the managers are nice to you but most of them ignore you and walk past you. Only good this is that you get along with the people you work with and have a special bond with them.
bad,The management there is very poor and unorganized. The management was never on the same page with other managers or the employees. There has been days working there where I was unable to find a  manager to find out my task
bad,The place is alright. Could be a lot better. Management needs to be trained on how to take care of there workers and customers. They are very under staffed.
bad,Working of optician has shown me a lot but I feel like I have outgrown the company. I have picked up on a lot of skills along the way such as dispensing and being educated on different lenses.
bad,"There are many managers, but virtually no leaders.   Even higher level managers (Store Managers, Market Managers, Regional Managers) exhibit poor, little, or even NO leadership skills or qualities.  This is because the current recruitment  structure renders management positions most attractive to newer associates who possess the least amount of knowledge and experience.  They see the potential for much better pay and jump at the opportunity.  Those people with a greater repository of knowledge and experience recognize that the trade off of pay per hours worked isn’t balanced and therefore not worth the commitment"
bad,It’s an okay place to work at least at the store I work at but overall they don’t give opportunities to move up within the company and get raises. Management is okay overall.
bad,"The coworkers were nice and helpful. The management is terrible and unfair. They treat the employee in a very inhuman way. While hiring someone for a department manager role, they don't give value to the right person. Poor management ever"
bad,"i excelled at my job and went above and beyond for this certain walmart store and was eager to learn new things. unfortunately this walmart played the favoritism game and you could only advance if you personally new certain hiring managers or if you were a transfer. seldom Internal advancement. Never gave me the opportunity to become a manager but applied to 4 or 5. Had the experience but was never even given an interview. I amongst other associates knew i Should have been given the chance to a manager position in my own area, but they decided to hire outside our walmart and not even give me an interview. i couldn't even move around in my store because i think i was really good at what i did In my area that they couldn't afford to lose me. So, they look out for themselves first and not the employee. overall good job though but not so good management team"
bad,"Cake decorating everyday helps bring creativity to my daily routine.  It is hard that Walmart has taken away a lot of my creative freedom, but I do enjoy decorating."
bad,it was like working at a high school. there was so much drama between coworkers. most being 30-60 years old acting like they're 16. paid the bills tho and got flexible hours.
bad,My overall experience was great in the begining but to date things have changed and you are not treated as an equal and there is favoritism of a certain nationality and it is reflected in the hours given.
bad,Pay is decent. Work environment is not a ideal place for me. I would prefer management that focuses on a balance between employees happiness and customer satisfaction.
bad,This job was not at all I had expected. I wasn't able to find a balance with work and family. My position required many hours and a lot of physical labor. My position was eliminated with very little warnig.
bad,"Solo agradecer a la empresa  por dejarme participar de su grupo de colaboradores  y la ayuda brindada , como persona  en situación de  discapacidad"
bad,"The Co-workers were great hard workers, but management liked to over extend and over work people without any thought, which resulted in me getting a injury on the job."
bad,"They work you like a dog, doing your own and everyone elses job, then decides to cut hours, so they make their yearly bonuses for being under the mark. But you are still suppose to get everything, plus some more, done on time with a skeleton crew. And unless you suck up, you won't make upper management, they will string you along promising things, but never follow thru."
bad,"Unfair treatment , often asking me to pull carts,stock,and clean the entire store is insane. I was hired as maintainance but they couldn't keep anyone so now I have to do other positions . I wanted out of that Wal-Mart so I go to another one and tell them they told me I need to file for a hardship or stick with it.Them they come up to me and say I'm not cleaning fast enough I'm like you have me a task I planned out how long I was going to spend at both they got mad and said they needed me for other things and fired me"
bad,The good about Walmart are the other employees. The management sucks really bad. I went the hospital and they didn’t even except my doctors notes cause they don’t except them.
bad,Management was undertrained and over worked. Pay left something to be desired. Hours weren't available. Honestly the day I quit was the most free I have ever felt in my life
bad,There are so many favoritism at that jobThe lazy workers got treated good and hard workers were made to work harder and I felt that was very unfair And most of the times Very stressful
bad,"I was excited about getting employment with Walmart, The customers were great to work with . Unfortunate management made me feel like I was bothering them when I had a training question.  This was my first retail job and I do not feel there was any guidance or guidelines.  When I asked a question they would have me step aside and do it themselves instead of guiding me through the process.That is not a training tool."
bad,its a good place to work for your first job for me it was you can go up in management fairly easy if you are seen by management the people that you work with are great especially co-workers thats why i stayed up until management became dicks 8 years ive been with them
bad,"Management could use some much needed work. Would not recommend working here. They do not treat their associates fairly or really hear what they have to say. Nor do they take what they have to say into consideration, even if they are listening."
bad,it’s a great first time job. The benefits are ok very diverse and friendly. They made you feel like you didn’t have to stay bottled up you can open up to people
bad,I feel like Walmart acts like they care about their associates when really they don't. I feel like nothing I do seems to matter I always get viewed as a terrible worker. But even still some managers and  associates make it fun there.
bad,I work morning shifts mostly everyday. Theres a routine that has to be done everyday. Assisting customers where items are and mostly answering questions. Managers will try to work with you but they dont do it often. You can also learn something new working here.
bad,company Changes all the time for business needs the pay structure is good they are very involved in the community and always there to help in natural disasters
bad,"To many changes leaving many employees without sufficient training/education. "
bad,"Walmart has a lot of benefits to working there; the pay is good, and you can pretty much be by yourself. But, the management there is a downfall a lot of the management doesn’t do anything and pretty much leaves you to fend for yourself when in need. Walmart also cuts your hours a lot and fires a lot of the employees that have been there to cut on management expenses."
bad,Most Walmart's have poor management teams and they don't really care about their associates. You're forced to word holidays and your given a tiny voucher for 15 percent off one purchase on specified days they allow. The attendance policy is also not good for families.
bad,"10-12 hours per day! Constant manual labor of heavy lifting upward of 80lbs!! I didn’t have a life outside of work, because I was too exhausted on my days off."
bad,Not enough training with new employees. Not hiring enough people to cover shifts. Hours vary week to week. One week you could have 34 hours and the next week 15 hours. Scheduling of hours fluctuates week to week. No set schedules.
bad,Could have better mangers and have nicer people but most of them are friendly and help learn to the new people but hours are bad and overall a alright place
bad,Our group was pretty much determined just to get as much stock out as we could and we all got along good with the same goal in mind. Go to work at 10 at night. get our first break at 12. Lunch was at 2 which I thought was too long. Go back to work. have another break at 5. Get off work at 7. Typical night at work.
bad,Watch your back. They are never satisfied with what you do very critical. A lot of delegation but no support. Management does very little to help you succeed and take all the credit for the work you do.
bad,If you like on making 10.50 an hour this is the job for you i think the only reason why its good is for the %15 off on black friday if you work that day.
bad,The location I work at is not necessarily fair. You cannot move up even if you qualify unless you are willing to be negative and tell on bad actions all the time. They also will not move you up in the company if you have family members they do not like. They say they will give you a chance and to apply but nothing even further no matter how much you bug them.
bad,Walmart was a steady place that I could count on for hours to pay the Bill's. Management for the most part was helpful and the other employees were very helpful and worked as a team
bad,If you put in the work there are many opportunities for advancement.  you can gain a lot of experience working in a high paced environment.  As a manager you are able to learn many aspects of running a large business
bad,"Wal-mart is not what it used to be. i have worked in 6 stores in 2 states, its the same everywhere, CLEAR favoritism, often turning blind eyes to MAJOR safety and policy violations."
bad,"there could have been better management, but overall the shifts were fairly easy and I knew what I was usually going to be doing before I even came in for my shift."
bad,"I worked for Walmart almost 4 years. The first 3 years were so great. I loved coming to work. My management team were awesome and made sure the workers were not only shown appreciation but took time to ensure everyone understood everything. The last year when management was changed, we were belittled, yelled at, and never shown any appreciation."
bad,"Could be a good place to work if they would hire more employees. Expect employees to do 3 people's jobs for one persons pay. Rules change ever day . No holiday pay. No sick days. Bonuses as based on attendance and sales, not performance. Yearly raises are across the board not job performsnce."
bad,When my FMLA was up they made sure I was fired. I had been off for cancer and blood clots. My managers were great it's the higher ups that are the problem. I beat them and got my unemployment.
bad,"Don’t listen to other associates, and always keep your head on a swivel!!! "
bad,"This job has a high amount of stress with a decent starting pay for little to no education. You are taught lessons here that I believe is essential to working in customer service. Patience, and the ability to see things from both sides of the equation were learned here."
bad,"Many days working in the deli, I found myself tired. I often had to work until 10pm and come back the next day at 8am. I suppose it is just on the border of giving me enough time to sleep but considering I live about twenty minutes away from my work location and have a bit of trouble going to sleep, it guaranteed that I got no more than 4 hours of sleep.mthan"
bad,"A bit understaffed, asks a lot from an individual, hard to stay energized/ motivated, sometimes requires an individual to perform tasks not in their work field"
bad,The walmart I worked at wasn’t the best place to work. Management wasn’t so great as they treated us like replaceable pawns. The associates are mostly awesome and friendly. It’s minimum wage bad it’s not that much work so it’s good for students or as a first job. You get a 10% discount after 90 days.
bad,It was a great job up until management got overhauled and the new managers started treating us like garbage. It was disgraceful. One manager even threw a box at me because someone from a previous shift didnt put away her returns.
bad,Management had their favorites when it comes to employees. Hours were given to those full time employees instead of dividing them evenly. When asked about questions it takes time to get responses.
bad,"Overall, working for Wal-Mart wasn't too bad. As a cap 2 member, I don't feel I was paid fairly. The work was physically demanding and hard on the body. Co-workers were hit or miss as far as level of work ethic."
bad,"Working as a cashier, there are no guaranteed hours. Co-workers were nice. Clientele varied. People call in sick all the time, so you didn't always have the support you needed on shift."
bad,"Walmart has good employee's and bad employees but what really hurts Walmart the most is its leadership the managers, they take advantage of there jobs and of there employees."
bad,"It gets you by, but they screw you over with hours. If you aren't available to work crazy swing shifts (open one day close the next) your hours get cut."
bad,It was a good place to work but they don have over time so I had to find a better job for me there was some good ppl I work with there an met some good friends
bad,Not that bad of a job only because you work by yourself. Also goes by fast but it’s get boring really fast. You don’t get paid enough because you do multiple of people’s jobs but you still get paid as much as cashiers.
bad,They don't work like a team like they say they do well they didn't when i had worked there they give you a time frame for when it needs to be done for each aisle and i didn't think the amount of time they gave was fair
bad,"Co workers are awesome and supportive."
bad,"Have doctors note requiring a chair (policy nobody sits)"
bad,I am very tired physically after working that I have to sleep for at least 9 hours to recover although I work part time. The work is very demanding however it is safe and secure job. Just that we have to work continuously and extra mostly still the managers are not happy with the performance. Thus job satisfaction is not there.
bad,"Long hours overnights"
bad,Very long stressful days. Work is extreamly back breaking. Management is okay but stay in there office all day. A lot of drama and people talking about each other. Just a stressful place and the days are super long and exhausting.
bad,When I first started my career with Walmart is was a great company to work for. Home Office always changing things. The company used to be all about their people now it’s all about the money.
bad,Management isn’t for employees.Slack of respect for the individual person.All management is for themselves not employees.Job place is for individuals in high schools
bad,"Management at store has old style of thinking about running the business, women employees and work culture."
bad,"En general la compañía es buena, solo deben tener más organización para trabajar con los horarios( las horas que le otorgan a los empleados por hora) para que se les pueda dar el servicio al cliente que ellos merecen"
bad,I worked two years there and the management miss treats and constantly uses employees without considering their personal life / well being. I'd only really recommend this job to people struggling to find a job as this will give you valuable experience and gives opportunity to train on machinery
bad,"Here lately I feel as if I'm not being heard in my position, I go above and beyond for my job title and this company but I feel as if it's not good enough alot of things here lately are being overlooked"
bad,"Some people are great. Management is lacking. "
bad,Stock freight all night and have the store cleaned and zoned for in the morning. Management there can be good and bad. A lot of biased relationships with managers and employees.
bad,"I love helping people. Customer service is very rewarding and enjoyable for me. I worked long shifts at Walmart. When I arrived home after work and on my day off, I wanted to sleep and rest."
bad,"It's all about protecting the corporate leadership.  Work harder and faster for the same amount of money.  They say they care about their associates, but have a funny way of showing it.  Would not recommend."
bad,Was shot while on the job as a cart Attendant. Never received and worker's compensation. Going to court soon. So ready for them to pay me. They let me go after I hired a lawyer.
bad,Walmart is a tough company to work for. You will not have a work life balance. You will be required to work several holidays and almost every weekend. Working here is very stressful because of the high turn over rate. The company wants you to do the work of 4 people but you are only one person. My dept is completely understaffed. If you decided to sign up for the benefits Walmart provides: (Health Insurance and Dental Insurance) all your paycheck will go toward covering those expenses. You will feel like there is nothing left for you. Walmart needs to figure out a way to get their employees to stay or people will just continue to quit.
bad,No communication  management is encouraged to be mean to workers  they set unrealistic work goals  never enough people  have to cut any overtime by taking extra long lunches before payroll goes in  no communication
bad,"Management only cares about the numbers, not the people. Weak workers are expected to do weak work, while exceptional workers are pressed to pick up the slack. Mandated overtime weekly which creates conflict with work life balance."
bad,"would work 9 hour shifts with an hour break and two 15 minute paid breaks. the job would be stressful most days with management breathing down my back about things beyond my control and really felt like a lose-lose situation. One of my supervisors had it bad he was a real great guy but would have to come down on us because the higher ups would be forcing him to push numbers but he couldn't do anything about it because he knew nothing was really anyones fault but the higher ups don't care about eemployees."
bad,"All associate work harder than they get paid, lifting many and tons of boxes all in a fast pace. not getting paid enough for straining yourself to lift."
bad,"I loved my old store. I loved management and they were flexible and I loved coming to work everyday. Moved here, management is horrible and will not work around my school schedule. I also got wrote up for calling off when I was sick and had PTO to cover my time. I dread going to work everyday. I wish my overall experience was great, but honestly this place has just gone downhill. Management needs to be revised because they will just hire anybody any more."
bad,"Bad managers are at every job. But walmart is leading the market in them. Also I went back to school unavailable to work past 5 pm tuesdays and thursdays. But can work from 11 am to 11 pm any other day of the week including weekends. Tuesdays and thursdays are our slowest days and there was always an employee to cover me but they used it as an excuse to cut my hours to save them money. I went from 40 hours a week to 16-24 and have had to sell my personal belongings to make ends meet. Each store is different but overall walmart does not care about employees overall. If your availibilty isnt 24 hours a day, dont expect hours."
bad,"hectic work environment with very little support from management, advancement goes about as far as you can take your self with no direct training. equipment is always breaking with no new equipment in sight."
bad,"Stop hiring young lazy fresh out of high school kids that are half awake ,and hire people that actually want to work and make a difference for the store."
bad,Working with the coworkers are amazing they get what it is to be human. The management on the other hand don’t give 2 rips. I was in the ER for potential internal hemorrhaging. I called all the appropriate people and was still put on the termination list after almost 3 loyal years. Customer abuse is also regular.
bad,The pays good but the management is makes it hard. Most don't know what their doing and the ones that do get fired or quit. All the overtime you can handle.
bad,Not good for advancement. Work hard all day. Lack of communication with management. Not recommended for employment. Need to have management on the level of communication.
bad,"Depending on the department you’re in the job can be extremely easy, the management is not what it should be. They say they care but don’t act like it"
bad,The work place was rather stressful as management will constantly rush us and only make our daily tasks harder. This in conjunction with certain members of management being difficult to work for due to them changing our tasks every hour or so made for a stressful environment.
bad,walmart is a friendly working environment ive worked there for almost 10 years and there is the ups and downs but overall the benefits are good and you know walmart isnt going anywhere
bad,easy job to get in to if you need the money. managers are stressed out form consent changes to layouts and work loads. would help if they hired more people to get the work done. to take the stress off employees
bad,Walmart is fast paced but I enjoy working in fast paced situations it passes time. I enjoy helping people when they need help. Just like a good days of work.
bad,you show up to work and you walk in the back and you grab your stocks and you start putting things out on shelves. you also had to help out all the customers if they needed
bad,But the company has gotten to where it asks more and more without the compensation that should go with it. The company isn't very family oriented. The employees are wonderful. Just not the policies.
bad,Walmart can be good for the person willing to work with the corporate game and stick with it. does have some good benefits. just need to know what you need and what you are doing when filling out paperwork.
bad,The managment was bad. Lack of communication. People I worked with were nice and friendly. Work was fairly easy and stressful at most times. I would rotate area's a few times
bad,"Did not have a good experience, manager lied to store manager to get people fired, even after admitting he did he was still a manager. I got sexually harassed and management didn’t do anything to the ther co worker until they get caught stealing on shift, they then fired him"
bad,"not everyone did what they were supposed to do. alot of the time i would see other workers doing nothing and just talking, leaving more work for the next shift."
bad,Stressfull. under appreciative. Working us like dogs. Poor management. Doesn't care enough about employees. Only cares about profit. UNDERSTAFFED. Not willing to come help the associate.
bad,"They only pay as much as they have to. They hire you at part time and still work you until right at 40, getting away with keeping you from full-time hours. They don't give benefits until you become a full-time employee and that takes to long. They use and abuse their associates."
bad,"When I first started it was a fun place to work, however things changed drastically over the years. Upper management has become greedy and hours are cut."
bad,"Is not helpful when you have family at home to take care of and too many jobs to do and learn no one is willing to train you properly"
bad,Walmart is a great place to start off and work but as you move your way up the company you learn that the people up top are pretty awful at their respective jobs. Still is a good place to meet new people and work but trust in their is hard to come by.
bad,"As cashier you are constantly on your feet.  You will do a lot of bending and twisting to bag groceries.  You are allowed a 15 min break every two hours, but you have to depend on Customer Service Managers to have someone cover you.  Often your breaks are long overdue and so are your lunches.  The hardest part of the job can be the customers, as some are extremely rude.  On the other hand, they can be the best part of the job, too."
bad,Races towards filipinos for the four years I've work at walmart. For example I had no points.  I am always on time. I work hard everyday.  I ask managements if I can be transfer to electro ic I was
bad,This company is big on who likes you and  not on how hard you work. The paid is very nice. Work life balance is non existent in this company for management. Management is often talk down to by upper management.
bad,I have an extensive career in automotive and and extreme thoughtfulness for customer safety and manufactures recommendations and this company does not.
bad,Not saying as the place is different for each person. I did work there for 12 years so they can be worked with. Just don't expect anything with out brown nosing.
bad,I was always confused and felt more like a burden to them and like I couldn't express things I saw that were wrong. There was definitely a lot of negativity in the environment.
bad,"Attendance is based off a point system, but doesn't take into consideration of ill/Elderly family. Any reason for a call out besides your actual health is irrelevant"
bad,Assistant Managers are only for themselves and you can never find them because they tend to all group up and go on lunch for more than a hour which is unfair considering regular associate can’t go over the time without money being taken out of your pay check. But thanks for the work experience on my resume.
bad,"Great pay, not alot of family time and dont work with you on hours. Some Management is great others are very rude. If you can move up in the company it is recommended"
bad,I did not feel valued by the company as a human being. I would put in extra work and see no return on my investment. I watched good people get canned for frivolous reasons.
bad,"I started working at Walmart a month before they increase the minimum wage and thought it would be a good thing to be paid $9.00 an hour as opposed to the average minimum wage; I was wrong. Once I started getting paid $9.00 an hour, my hours were cut. My hours were cut so drastically, I would have been better off getting paid the standard $7.25, at least that way I could've worked more and got overtime. Time and time again, the facts show ""fight for 15"" only hurt everyone rather than help."
bad,I pretty much enjoyed my job at Walmart with the other associates and customers. But some managers and customers made it difficult to perform my work efficiently.
bad,"When I first got the job offer to work for Walmart, you couldn't believe how happy it was. I always wanted to work at a large company like them, and when I got the chance too, I was ecstatic. It was hard at times, but I really enjoyed working alongside my co-workers, because they all have their own life story. I still do, in fact."
bad,Not family oriented like it was back in the day when I first started. No work life balance at this company. You don’t have much time  outside of work to enjoy yourself.
bad,"I don't know if it's like this at other stores but the one in Manchester, NH isn't a great work place. You will get used, pressured, and talked about. Management isn't the greatest. The store is understaffed as well. Overall not a great place to work."
bad,"Del 1 al 100 le doy 39 ya que aprendí, crecí en el ámbito laboral pero no personalmente y/o profesionalmente ya que es difícil posicionarse en mejores puestos y más si no eres un empleado directo."
bad,"Hard work, unfair management, unfairness to workers , trained new workers for positions hired, data entry, stock shelves, unload trailers, coordinate new hires, coordinate  training, Data input of employee information, time sheet calculated and insurance benefits, assist with timeshares for company."
bad,"I hated my job most days, but it wasnt the worst ever. I worked customer service and busted my butt only to be told I was doing stuff wrong constantly. Management is terrible at my location. I ended up pointing out."
bad,"Idk wasn’t good at all management was horrible!they had bad attitude,wasn’t helpful at all,to much mess,no working together,every body in management had attitudes like personal reason!"
bad,"Working at Walt-Mart I've learned to do things I've never did before. I've made new friends while working there. Walt-Mart is a good place to work. I've learned to pull freight on a manual pallet jack, stack pallets etc."
bad,I had gotten into a wreck a month ago that left me unable to go back to work until I was cleared by my doctor. I had a broken wrist and a concussion. Their sedgwick plan for LOA was denied literally 3 days after and immediately expected me to return to work even after being told I had to be 100% back to normal in order to come back to work. Considering that it took ten days for the paper work to come in the mail. I felt like they don't care about their associates especially those that have never received a bad evaluation.
bad,Walmart provided me with the opportunity to manage a multi million dollar budget as well two of the most in demand departments and revenue makers within the business. While I valued my time there it was not conducive to my family life as it demanded far too much of my time.
bad,"Petersburg Walmart is a joke and I don't recommend it to anyone, they'll reschedule you on your day off when you have important plans that same day. When you desperately need help there's nobody to help because of the bullcrap scheduling. They'll give you tasks to when your just getting off work. It's miserable"
bad,"Has changed in so many ways, Walmart only want you to work work work and forget about your life outside of it because it will cost you your job. The benefits is about the only good thing they still have and I think that’s why some people haven’t left the company yet."
bad,"Must have superpowers , will stress you out . Pay is good enough to deal with bullsh*t everyones complains (normal thing to do everyday or you’re an weirdo) expect to get nothing done BUT TRY TO"
bad,Great company benefits and room for  advance ment. Pay is better than most places. Work is not hard. Work environment  is freindly and  welcoming. Hours are flexible
bad,management sucks from top to bottom. they aren't equal with associates. company always cutting hours or jobs. no work life balance. really hated this job
bad,"When I was in the back room at walmart, under new management twice, we ended up having someone who got fired from a warehousing job because of lack of skills/safety problems who got hired as our manage for unloading truck who was more of a joke to us than an actual manager. "
bad,"It was an ok job to work at in the beginning. The only reason I left was because of management, otherwise I would probably still work there. I did learn a lot there with it being my first real job."
bad,Just like most of my co workers I didn't have such a good experience working there because they make you do things that are not in your job description and when you ask to be considered for different positions they expect you to do the job without giving you the title.
bad,Brought issues up to management about other workers and they brushed me off. Made me into the bully and let the real bully get away with everything. No sense of ethics.
bad,"Management was overall terrible, plenty of overtime and benefits were great if you stay long enough but you're not fairly paid for your work nor are you appreciated. You are worked like a slave and not compensated nearly enough."
bad,If you're looking for a job you can get easily this is the place to go. Both times I've worked at Walmart i went in for an interview and had the job in the same day.
bad,"Honestly had a lot of fun in the beginning, but started to see the very negatives of working there. If an associate had overtime, they were forced to burn it or face consequences. That also includes if the management team made them stay late. In the backroom while unloading, we had a bottle of liquid chlorine spill and gas the truck and the backroom. The management team didn't tell us to stop, but keep working. Which is very illegal and caused us health problems. We were coughing and eyes were watering up."
bad,Walmart did not treat their employees fair. I felt they took full advantage of some of the workers that stayed. My reason for leaving was to graduate college and follow my dreams.
bad,"On a typical day in tle i would change and replace tires "
bad,Wonderful company to work for in the beginning as the years went by management and company policies began to go downhill. No longer about the employees but about filling the pockets of the owners
bad,No from for advancement. Always give you the run around. Good benefits. Managers will expect more from you for the same pay. Will wear your body DOWN!!
bad,I often felt  as if they did not provide us with the tools we needed to preform the tasks we were supposed to do. We constantly had new managers and the general atmosphere was chaotic.
bad,"Depending on your management team, you may have an okay experience, or a bad experience. My experience has been somewhere in between, there are days where I'm comfortable in my job, and there's days where I use my breaks and lunch to apply for other jobs. This is far from the WORST company to work for, however I'd accept another position at another company if the pay was within a dollar. I don't understand how the gold Badgers do it"
bad,"Could definitely be a better place to work. Poor management, scheduling errors, employees doesn’t seem like much of a priority in my opinion. Could be a way better store."
bad,This company does not work with their employees personal life. They pick  and choose who is on the schedule and leave employees without working for 1-3 weeks. I do not recommend it unless you're looking for semi good pay.
bad,"Management doesn't care about workers, have to finesse your day on the job to be happy. Stay away if you have school and kids. They have a ""no fault"" policy that basically says anything that happens to you, is not their fault..."
bad,bad management good people low pay if you are a person with a family and bills to pay this is a good job if your looking for hours all the time but the pay and management is what makes this job not so great
bad,Walmarts Job description was very very misleading. The job described seemed to be very appealing and interesting. After starting at the location training was not a primary focus and the location had a very very large turn over rate for the store manager which led to a very bad situation.
bad,"Working for Walmart had some perks. They allowed room for growth, had insurance benefits, 401k, and PTO. However, the store was mismanaged and understaffed. Employees are expected to work every weekend, stay over scheduled hours and take long lunches so not to go over 40 hours a week. Retaliation for complaints was so common employees wouldn'tcorporate homme.off"
bad,"When I started at Walmart in 2002 the management would greet us sincerely every day. They cared about what was going on both in the associates lives and at work. They were very professional and personable. "
bad,"Hours change weekly, the stress of retail is enough by itself, but put Walmart in the Equation I'd rather work at a zoo cleaning up after the animals !!!"
bad,Not much room for advancement to anything except normal retail management positions. Company outsources all skilled labor and prohibits most employees from getting hired by said companies. Alright scheduling but you'll always be forced to take extra workloads and when eventually you can't handle it as an individual they'll place the blame on you instead of remedying the problem.
bad,"It's a good job. I like the customers, and my co-workers. I feel my job in the jewelry department is somewhat rewarding in the fact that I can do the smallest thing for a customer, and they are so grateful.  Actually, some customers greet me and tell me that they are so glad that I am there!  That makes for a great workday."
bad,Very fast paced environment and sometimes you don't get breaks on time. The company has changed a lot  since I was hired in 2015. It takes a lot longer to accrue vacation time and sick time.They also started a core schedule and if you are not available when their busiest times are then your hours get cut alot.
bad,"I worked at Walmart for a fairly short time, and it served me well enough while I was there. Don't expect to be paid particularly well. I was offered a supervisor position but turned it down. It would only have meant giving up more of my time and hour flexibility for minimal pay raise. Walmart is good when in a pinch, but don't expect a stimulating career out of it."
bad,"It is an extremely stressfull environment and it's a struggle to advance in the company, it's fine as a temporary job, benefits are good but management direction and expectations are very unrealistic."
bad,Absolutely no motivation to work there management completely unfair way too much work and expectations for very little pay get pushed to the point where you are more stressed out than trying to focus on completing your task way to many unfair management decisions for there associates such as favorable towards associates
bad,Very disappointed with how situations are handled by management. It is also a very hostile environment. The management is what makes the job stressful
bad,"I disliked working at Walmart the entire 4 years I was there. My number one complaint about the company is the lack of resources to do the job. The store was understaffed most of the time and if someone called off, it got worse. The handheld wireless computers frequently locked up (when you could get one), which was especially frustrating when you are trying to help a customer. My home department was electronics, but I would take bicycles down in Toys, generate hunting and fishing licenses in Sporting Goods, cut keys in Automotive, mix paint, cut fabric, help customers in shoes and on a rare occasion even assist in groceries. At times, I was required to spend several hours fronting shelves in groceries. There were a myriad of rules to follow for just about everything. There are not near enough price scanners located around the store and customers can be very difficult to deal with especially when they are drunk or high on drugs. The store operates on a bonus system based on business costs and many times employees and especially managers will get a bonus even when the store is running very poorly. I can give more examples, but I think I think I have made my point."
bad,This used to be a good place to work but all the changes are making it horrible. A lot of associates are thinking of leaving. They took holiday pay away. It's going down hill.
bad,"Walmart has a strong job view of ""promotions"" , they say that they promote many people at each store on a regular basis..however having an employee apply for a job and go through a job interview process to get a new position is not viewed in the business world as a ""promotion"".. a ""promotion"" is when an employee is performing well in their position and asked by management if they would like a better position or possibly more hours...please note"
bad,It was great at the beginning it keeps u on your toes and very busy but. Team work is needed and at the first Wal-Mart I was at there was team work my second one felt more like u are by yourself and everyone was for everyone no team work
bad,wasn’t a good experience! poor management . didn’t care about associates . did not keep promised hours. point system was a little to much. there was never any team work being done.
bad,You never know when you are getting off and do little to tell you. Not very honest with you and all about the numbers and not about employee safety like they claim.
bad,Often times I would be so worn out from work that I would not have anytime to do anything.  Work was quite disgusting in the Deli because of all the food.
bad,I worked five years for Walmart. I only worked in two stores. The experience was almost the same. Managers micromanaging and never actually lifting a finger to help you out in any way. You can work your butt off and never get a thank you from them. I was almost always very stressed and never looked forward to go work. Calling out seemed like the way to go. The job itself isn’t bad it’s just the managers that make it unbearable. Walmart may have okay pay and very good benefits but it all starts how management treats its employees. The last store I worked for my store manager rarely threw us cook outs or any sort of banquet. They never really care about the employees. They just want the job done. No one I worked with was actually happy. Most of them were usually looking for new jobs. I don’t recommend walmart. Not a very healthy environment.
bad,"Work was only part time and contracted for the holiday season, would have been great if job could have continued.But not enough hours."
bad,"They are great with working with a schedule, most of the time, but most everything else needs serious work. They are so focused on sales that they lack in so many places. They keep lazy employees for a lot longer then they should."
bad,"A lot of different departments to work in, but, be prepared for slashed, low or ridiculous hours. No matter what department you work, you WILL be called CONSTANTLY to get on the registers and help with lines. Also, don't be surprised if they inform you that your position is either being changed or taken away completely and you will either have to reapply, find a different position in the store or have to just go get another job. They will constantly set you up to fail and then punish you for failing. Good luck!"
bad,"Entry level developers may or may not be placed on teams with technical needs aligning with developer skills. You may go in with Java experience but be placed on a team that does nothing but support and implement 3rd party software. As such, you may not be programming at all. You may only be updating configuration files and working as a go-between for Walmart's internal customers and support/development group for the 3rd party software. Make sure you know where you will be placed and if they don't know, that could be a red flag."
bad,"As sad as it sounds, Walmart isn’t the best place to work. Operations managers constantly bringing change, coming up with new rules, changing the rules, switching managers to different shifts...it was terrible! They dont know what they want for their own facility! SAD! Lots of associates were under appreciated. Associates having relations with managers, even HR. Proves how unethical they are. Work would get slow and yet wanted all associates to meet a rate like it was so easy. Easy work gets assigned to managers favorites. Pathetic work environment if you ask me. You’re late from break by 1 minute and they accuse you of stealing company time. This is for building 7049 which in my opinion is no different from 8103."
bad,"It was an all around bland experience. Every store is different and management play fast and loose with rules. what is right for one is not right for another, and they have no problems going back on their word very quickly."
bad,You get over worked for bad pay im a Manager making less then some normal employees because its all about who you know and expect to work every day you want off and never have a Thanksgiving with your family
bad,"Work is steady.I have learned the details on inventory, how to stock, how to manage store accessories, there is no hard part of the job the job is easy and stress free. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to come in work your shift, staying focused and going home with a smile on your face"
bad,MOST of the time it was enjoyable for the 1st year I worked there the AM was super cool and helped me fix my schedule around my life but then we got a new one and he was not.
bad,"As a manager it can beef up your resume, but there are tons of caveats for working here. It’s not a career type of place. It’s a mixed bag of attitudes and work ethics, i worked at more than one location, one was better than the other experience wise, so location will make a big difference. Make the best of it and keep a plan to move on to better."
bad,The job was great and required a lot of activity. No support from management at all. Very short staffed on a daily basis. Unfair treatment by management
bad,"Like all jobs, its nerve-racking in the beginning and exciting at the same time but, that didn't last long. My school schedule and availability was an issue to management. Non- flexible with hours as they say they are."
bad,Unfortunately management fell short with assisting other employees when it got very busy. You would call for help but didnt get a response. Walmart cut hours and added more work load to the csms because they eliminated positions to save money
bad,"I worked at Walmart for a few years and don't really recommend it now that I have done more with my life. It's a good job for kids, mothers, and the elderly, but not a place where I fit in."
bad,For the most part a decent company to work for.  Some good people and some bad people there.  The balance of life and work is okay.  Some good policies but also some policy work need.
bad,"Staff was cool, but the customers were the worst. Not much to say its Walmart. Everyone knows that some customers could be the worst. Not all of them. There was plenty of days where every customer was respectful but others days where you had to question is it worth your job to deal with these people."
bad,"I wasn't liked by one of the members of management who often would belittle me and had me on more than one occasion had me work beyond the end of my shift and yet complained to me about clocking out late. He even had me doing stuff that generally didn't apply to me in the store and as a result, I've had to abandoned my tasks more than once to deal with in. In the end I got fired and they changed up my information to say I worked in his department and that he was my manager when that was a blatant lie."
bad,"Walmart gives you a chance to move up in management. Awesome place if you like people"
bad,I have worked for Wal-Mart for almost 12 years now and have seen the good and bad of the company and the changes that Wal-Mart is making only help them and not the people that work for them and that will hopefully change again but for now things are going for bad to worse
bad,It’s a relaxing place to work the manager overnight was a reason I lefti felt she had something against me. But overall Walmart is a really nice calm place to work.
bad,"Depends on who your management is, and whether or not they like you, it will make or break your job. Overly demanding, expect you to do your job plus others, with a smile on your face. Associates who do minimal work get praised while the ones who work the hardest get criticized. Too many call outs, bad at scheduling."
bad,"While my manager was a very nice person, she was a very disorganized and frustrating person to be around. The company lied to me about time off on two separate occasions. I liked the culture and I thought it was relatively easy work. I thought that overall it was a very frustrating process and place to work at."
bad,"I wouldn’t really recommend working at Walmart because they put a lot of pressure on you as you’re trying to get comfortable with your surroundings, also it’s best that you takes a couple days off even if you’re sick while on probation."
bad,There is no holiday pay and during holiday weeks if you call out you to absences instead of one if you are looking to get decent pay apply at the 3 dc stores or Tyson’s corner va great co workers
bad,"If you can adapt to change and work hard, you can grow with the company. I started out as an unloader and within 7 months I moved up to department manager."
bad,"We need more workers it should be someone in all areas until we close. The new point system sucks. We should be allowed to use our sick time for us, but we can't only immediate family member."
bad,"my overall experience was not a horrible, i've met some great people but the managers are all terrible. they will also work you to the bone and don't get paid well for the time and effort you put in. the high stress you gotta deal with from managers, your co workers, and customers is taxing as well"
bad,"walmart was a stressful place to work at. you have to have a strong mind to work on the register because the customers are hectic. i don’t believe the amount we’re paid are enough for the amount of work we done at walmart. and when it got closer to the holidays hours were CUT and you was getting paid as if you was getting paid 9 an hour. but when i first started walmart, i always had 9 hour shifts everyday. 2 days off but you hardly get any free time because you’ll be so exhausted."
bad,"once hired management owns you no such thing a complaints"
bad,Walmart was a good place to work in the beginning but the longer I work here the worse it has gotten. Other sales associates think they can boss you around and management does not help you at all. They just watch while it’s busy and not help or even offer. Definitely don’t feel comfortable around the managers.
bad,"Walmart corporate rules are rarely followed except when corporate visits, OSHA is violated on occasion without  repercussion, always fixed when they visit, and management is rarely understanding."
bad,"I needed a source of income while in school so i worked at Walmart. At first, i used to walk in with a smile on my face but now after dealing with rude customers and unfair managers, i feel as if it is a field i can no longer work under. i have learned to disregard any rude comments made by the customers but my manager is someone i cannot stand. Someone who talks condescendingly, gives his employees an unreasonable task in an unreasonable time limit, and also talks as if he has no common sense. It has gotten to the point where I turn the other cheek whenever he opens his mouth because it is some nonsense. instead of helping out employees when overloaded, he sits in the back of the store laughing and giggling. i remember bring all my trash from my assigned aisle to the back to throw away he said with attitude ""Why are you back here instead of out there?"" i responded with ""I know you can clearly see I have multiple carts of cardboard and multiple bags of plastic that needs to be disposed."" Again, with attitude, he rushed me outside back to the floor. Literally, i had less than ten minutes till it was time for me to clock out and go home, he told me to finish an entire aisle that nobody had worked. So i clocked out almost an hour later. In my opinion, he's not a leader. He is a boss."
bad,"Typically you have multiple people on one register you relieve people for there break or lunch, I enjoyed greeting and interacting with the customers,"
bad,"Well, it’s Walmart! Pay is minimum and 80% of the associates are part time so no benefits. Schedule is terrible. You might be scheduled to work mon- wed- sat. The manager is good but when he’s away, the support managers will come at you with lots of bulls*t. If you can get some other place to work, then do so. If not, welcome. You won’t die anyways"
bad,"Very unorganized management,"
bad,"Management is awful now. I started working in 2017  and I loved it. As soon as I get back from school, management is down the drain. If I could stand on my feet for 8 straight hours, they would make you. Some people within the company do care about their employees and co-worker, but overall I wouldn't recommend this as a full-time job"
bad,"Usually we did the same thing every day for my position at Walmart come in at 2 unload truck and then stock shelves. Management there were not the best they weren't as knowledge as they should have been and some of them didn't do their job properly. As for their rules and guidelines they are basically setting you up to fail, but as for the general team and work it wasn't bad I got along with my co-workers and the work was not bad."
bad,It is a good place to work move to assistant manager if you want it been there for 8 years and it is tome for me to move on to something else cause it not meeting my bills
bad,Game playing by management when trying to advance or switch positions. With proper documentation you are still punished for being sick. Management picks on certain people to keep them stuck in certain positions if you are good at what you do they will not let you transfer to a different position unless they can bring you back at their convenience.
bad,I had worked at this location few different times. they work with you when injured for a period of time then they have a problem with it and will let you go. they don't allow time to rehabilitate from an injury without consequences.
bad,"There are good opportunities for rapid career progression at Walmart Canada, but it comes at a cost."
bad,Could be a fun place if the management was fun to work with they never smiled or spoke to any one.  People greeters have to stand for st least 7 to 8 hours a day they didn’t believe in anyone sitting down when working in lawn and garden provided no shade stood in the hot weather
bad,"your not allowed to talk to other coworkers at all not even if your talking and working."
bad,Walmart is always changing trying to change scheduling bringing in a scrubbing robot in September or October and more robots are in the future so associates can do other stuff on the sales floor
bad,"You'll be overworked and underpaid, that being said, as long as you show up and try you won't be fired. This applies to night shift only as I have no experience working with anyone on either of the other shift with the exception of Black Friday, which will be hectic regardless."
bad,No accountability. Rules are not enforced depending on who is working management at the time. Loud music playing by anyone. You have to make production but you have no control over most factors that affect your production. I could go on and on but....Nah.
bad,"It's stressful environment and most of the time it was caused by co-workers,. Enjoyed helping pt's. Pharmacists were unprofessional at times getting on techs in front of PT's. One was nasty and rude at times."
bad,"I liked most of my coworkers (managers included), I didn't have a problem with them or if I did it wasn't a big issue. The company itself was frustrating. I wasn't able to change my schedule very easily, having to wait at least a month every time I needed a schedule change. I had to go to my supervisor every week because of schedule conflicts, such as my shift being outside of my availability or being at the same time as my college classes. Working part-time and being in college at the same time, I was also very frustrated that my week hours were normally 35-39 hours, just under full-time except I get no full-time benefits. It stayed like that for months, mostly closing shifts while I had an 8am, 3 hour long class 4 days a week, before my availability form went through. Also, around when the holidays started, myself and my coworkers took notice that our hours were all cut drastically (full shifts turning into half shifts short enough you wouldn't get lunch). Fewer hours, less pay, and apparently, there weren't any shifts we could pick up either. I quit before the new year, but one of my former coworkers told me that while the hourly wage went up one dollar with the new year, her hours were also cut so she isn't making any more money. Frankly I just find it sad and frustrating. So here's what I think, your walmart associates and coworkers may be good people and having good people as a face for the store is also a good thing, but the company itself I don't like, and I really do not want to work in a walmart ever again if I can help it."
bad,"clock in and head to the meat department and start checking dates as i wait for the 6am truck to arrive. "
bad,A great place to learn and promote within. Fun environment with great customers and associates. Very knowledgeable place to learn. The cons would consist of no hours for schedules. Low pay and  recognition.
bad,"It’s a simple job that pays the bills. Whether you"
bad,"Don't work at Walmart; the pay that they offer is half-decent for retail, but other retailers can match it, and can actually provide a friendly work environment besides."
bad,"While working with Walmart the management was quite rude to their employees. I have overheard some racial slurs from some of the other employees, including some of the department managers."
bad,"I went into the job feeling optimistic and left feeling defeated and a failure. I believe management will suck the happiness out of you and I do not feel that most of the people there are happy working there. There is a mistreatment of the employees by management that I have never experienced in my life. Most of the people that work there are unhappy and don't feel that they have anywhere else to go and are stuck there. However, Walmart is a great place to work at in theory, as long as the management is good."
bad,"Walmart is a good place to work and they give you an hour lunch and the breaks are at ease. However the CSMs and Team leaders sucks. They have bad attitudes, they have their picks and chooses on which employees they like and don't."
bad,"Laid back but bad customer service.  Corrupt management,careless employees,low morale. Hour long lunches,discounts at alot of places..................................."
bad,"Needs more communication in this area. And fewer arguments of who is going to do the job that needs to be done. When a customer is waiting, they need to be attended to as soon as possible."
bad,Walmart open door policy doesn't work and management is micro managing. They no longer listen to associates. I feel that their trying to get ride of positions at the company.
bad,I wouldn't really recommend anybody working at Walmart because they overwork you and under pay you. The pay is definitely not worth the time or stressed.
bad,I liked my job but management is overall lazy and expect too much of certain associates. They’ll allow some associates to slack off and do whatever each night and then make certain hard working associates pick up their slack constantly. Everyone on the team should be expected to do the same amount of work.
bad,It was a cool working environment. The manager was a bit flirty but overall it was fun. Enjoyed meeting new people and the different interactions. Would recommend
bad,"The pay sucks, but the work isn't horrible. If you can get promoted it gets better, but promotions are rare and few. Open availability is not ideal for a family, but if your working at walmart dont plan on supporting one"
bad,After working there for over 10 years I was paid the same almost as much as people just starting there. I don't like how we're treated and I didn't like the poor treatment.
bad,it’s a good place to meet customers and new people who work there. i love working with my co-workers and the love everybody bring be so joyful i glad i work there with the people who are working there with me.
bad,"I’ve been employed here going on 2 going on 3 years.  It’s and okay place to work. The attendance policy I do not like. The assistant managers, well the ones I’ve have have been great. Overall a good job. But not a career."
bad,"typical day starts at 4:00 AM & ending at 1:00 PM. Customers are really nice, you get to know the ""regulars"" & of course they stop and chat with you about their families."
bad,"I only stayed as long as I felt I could due to the increasing pressure by my co-workers and supervisors participating in activities in which certain NORMAL customers would be sought out, much like a shark smelling blood and circling its prey, for Asset Protection “stings” as they called them. It resulted in numerous jailing of innocent people for petty larceny which 8 out of 10 times Walmart did not have the evidence to prove it. Walmart used to be the pinnacle of customer service and happiness, but since Mr. Walton’s death, I believe that has gone out of the window."
bad,If you stick to that policy and avoid getting caught up in various forms of drama then the job is decent for getting paid.  Most issues with Wal-Mart stems from the interaction of too many leaders and not enough workers.  It's also pretty nice working in a place where you can do your shopping before heading home.
bad,"A company that will lure you in with good wages and an enticing amount of PTO.  The problem is having 38 PTO days a year does you absolutely no good when your manager refuses to approve any request you submit for PTO.  God forbid you get sick, your other scheduled days off for the week will immediately be retracted and demanded as mandatory overtime.   Are you a team player on salary who will come in on your day off to help complete an important objective to boost store experience?  Then expect every week to have an exception like this while simultaneously cutting payroll for hourly associates. (These incidents are not isolated to a single store location) Great tools available, mobile productivity apps that allow you to do all store handheld functions with your personal cellphone."
bad,"Typical day is busy and unorganized, you learn slow and most of it by yourself, management isn't that good. The culture is great everyone is welcome, the hardest part of the job is the people you work with they don't act professional and if one person isn't on top of their job it gets harder for everyone else."
bad,"while work was never intrusive with constant over time management lacks in nearly every aspect. Pay was fair with quarterly bonuses, but with the stress of management it is hardly worth it as far as a career goes."
bad,I enjoyed working at Walmart. The job wasn't hard however the coworkers at Walmart all tried to be the boss. All the supervisor's would tell you something different to do and then you'd get reported for doing what they ask you to do because you weren't doing your job in timely manner. I thing it would be a great place to work with better management.
bad,"Honestly Walmart is going to be like most any other retailer. Much will be demanded of you, and you will likely not have the support you need to do your job. Management will not/can not develop you or other associates. You will simply be told to improve or you will end up terminated."
bad,"If you treat your employees unfairly and with disrespect, then you will notice a decline in job satisfactory. Low morale is always due to the fact that the employee does not feel that their ideas or opinions matter. In order to supply your customers with satisfaction, you must first make sure that your employees are satisfied."
bad,Walmart gives you the opportunity to learn however there's lots of preferential treatment within the store. I've attended a co-operate workshop which included representatives from the co-operate office as well as other regional stores which contradicts what the the company represents and how the employees should be treated.
bad,I never got any coachings n they said that you are allowed three coachings and i never got one. I really didnt like working there. To me they only like serent people. I cant come plain it was money and it help me out with my son. But i not giving up im still out here trying my hardest to get a job. I love working no matter what it is. I will do anything
bad,The people i work with are awesome but management need improvement. I use to enjoy working at Walmart but everyone has there own rules. To many fake mangers
bad,"I could have worked here forever, but they felt otherwise. I gave them 16 years of my time and that meant nothing when it came to considering me to continue with them."
bad,Stayed in back mostly assembling items. Learned how to read lots of different directions as to assembly several different items.Management was lacking as I was left to do what I needed to.in the back room.Most enjoyable was learning the few new tasks
bad,"I truly loved working there. They did great hours, a lot of the staff was so sweet and friendly, however; my boss treated me as I would ruin everything around me and constantly yelled at me the whole time I was there."
bad,"At the time, I was making 7.45 to do back stock inventory which means to unload all of the merchandise off the truck and get it ready for the over night stockers to take care of them and stock the items on the shelves. It was pretty hard on the body for the wages made."
bad,"Working at Walmart is very stressful, most of the upper management staff is unwilling to help, and demand to have assignments done in a rushed manner. Most management do not have good manners( saying please or thank you), are demanding and treat associates with little to no respect"
bad,"The typical day at work there was always something wrong with machines or management wouldn't help me with a customer at all. Plus when I was about to go back to school, I needed to changed my hours and they kept denying my availability, so I had to put my 2 weeks notice in and leave. What I learned was that the store manager that I had when I first started (didn't meet the female), he was always really nice and helpful so if I needed help with schedule stuff or felt uncomfortable with someone then I knew I could talk to him. The hardest part was when it was a rush day and people would go off on me for supposedly going slow, but I could only go so fast. The only enjoyable part I can remember is that I made some friends, but I am not friends with them no more."
bad,"Every position in Walmart is easy to fulfill. I would say it's one of the easiest companies to work for. Considering how easy the work is, I would say the pay is fair- especially, when you take into account all of their benefits."
bad,"I personally feel like I should be able to look up to my manager and treat them as a friend, not go into work believing they were looking for reasons to coach me or get my fired the minute they knew I was on the clock. If you aren't the perfect employee, the management at Walmart will hound on you for every single mistake you make or every task you don't get done, even if they assign you too many or assign you one that will take longer than the time you have left on your shift."
bad,Be prepared to do the work of two or three people. Hours have been cut back and there's not enough people to get everything done. I would not recommend it to anyone.
bad,"I was employed with Walmart for over 20 years. As the years progressed, Walmart's treatment of employees worsened. Attendance policy is unrealistic and is not suitable for people with families ."
bad,I've worked for walmart for 2 years and never worked anywhere with suck low regard for there employees advancement and employment growth. With low amounts of training and very high expectations.
bad,Some bad management. They don't care about their employees. Stressful environment to work. A lot to do for one person at the deli. Didn't hire people for deli on time. Coworkers are no help.
bad,"Long shifts "
bad,This job wasn't the easiest . It had a difficult moment with management and employees but I pushed myself to do my job and nothing but my job. Overall experience was fair.
bad,Great place to work and managers were caring and understanding. Managers also would help whenever you needed assistance. Great place to work overall. I would work there again
bad,Not worth working there doing what I did... NonCon orderfiller... do not do it. Not worth it. Hours suck. The pay is not worth the work you have to do
bad,"to be clear this is my personal experience with this company. the store i work in had no clear management structure (one employee many managers) although i did like some of them. they are only reacquired to give you 8 hours between shifts most of the time this left me about 4 hours to sleep considering how far i lived from the store and the fact i like to be clean when i start my shift at least. you may work only two days in a week or seven in a week but will never be anything more then a part time worker. finally you may be exposed to and forced to work in temperatures of 110 to -10 degrees, depending on what part of the store you work in and the time of the year. thank god for space heaters and customers how know what heat exhaustion looks like."
bad,"Been with Walmart for 5 years looking for a new change, chance to Better my career and learn something new. Walmart has great benefits, but could use a better attendance system"
bad,"In my experience at Walmart, the upper management expects everyone on the floor to be able to magically do everything at once, leading to a bad experience for the customers and employees."
bad,"my manager at the time did not like me for reasons unknown. when the busy season ended and they were required to start cutting hours, instead of taking a little from everyone she had taken away all of my hours for two full weeks."
bad,"My employment at Walmart Canada truly changed my mind about how the retail and food industry is processed and run. Not only were the managers present nearly incapable of coordinating and managing large-scale teams, it seemed their methods of communication were definitively lack lustre. With frequent miscommunications or at the worst, telephone-tag tasks."
bad,The work itself at Walmart is not stressful but once your hired there is no training proccess and you are thrown into an aisle an expected to know what can't go on the shelf and where items go. They judge your time spent in an aisle based off of a computer so your always feeling rushed to finish and the managers are surprised when they find out you don't understand something but ultimately nothing changes there.
bad,It is a very stressful position and a lot of drama. but if you like fast pace it is a great job for you and pulling a cart and being timed. You get timed but its not bad.
bad,Typical work day was long and tiring when standing all day. Learned how to use the register. Management was ok when it came to some managers. Hardest part was working 8 hours every day when i was told i was going to be part time.
bad,"A very busy place to work in but, equally very stressful."
bad,Great place good paying job great hours they with what you when you need more hours just talk to them and let them know and they will grant you hours most of the time
bad,Horrible bosses that do not follow all safety or regulation procedures. Worked there for a year and a half and they want you to already know how to do the things that need to be done. Very stressful environment.
bad,Management makes the work environment very stressful for employees. Management does not know how to talk to employees in a professional manner away from customers.
bad,"Walmart is not a bad job, but the people I dealt with were nothing but drama, and two of the three mng were disrespectful and had a sense of ""I'm better then everyone"". Wade was the only mng at that location that I can say has any respect for his employees."
bad,"The company itself is moving in  a different direction and outgrew me, so I moved on to try different job criteria's that would fit me better since I am family oriented and Walmart clearly is not anymore."
bad,"Working at Walmart was very fast paced and there was a lack of help for the new hires. Your only allowed to miss 4 days in your first 6 months of employment there or you lose your job. That's hard when your hired on during the start of winter and they would ""prefer you stay home if your sick so you don't get anyone else sick"". But yet even if you have a doctors note, its a point against you. I strongly feel this is unfair treatment of their employees as some situations just are out of our control."
bad,thankfully for me I worked when there was actually a real culture in place...I learned that working for this company I can do anything or work anywhere...hardest part was losing people and most enjoyable was hiring and training.
bad,Pretty easy job but the management was terrible and played heavily on favorites. Really no way to go up in the company unless you want to be in a terrible department as a department manager.
bad,"They were a good company to work for but they were always taking benefits away from the employees and upping production constantly..They did provide all the necessary work equipment and tools necessary to perform our job, and they made sure we knew about safety and what to do in certain circumstances."
bad,They are a place were I fill like. No matter how hard I try to do good. Upper management is just consented with keeping. Cost low so they can have a chance at a bonus each year. I fill like if you are not the managers favorite u will not get far.
bad,I was there for about a year. Every day was very stressful. The management was not that great. It was very unorganized and sometimes they weren't clear of what they wanted from us. The place just wasn't for me.
bad,"Great experience, learned and managed a great deal in multiple areas, supervision of hundreds of associates, great deal of responsibility. Horrible opportunity for advancement, pay and bonuses not good, work life balance terrible"
bad,"I gained a lot of retail experience, but the overall experience was not enjoyable. regularly under staffed and ill managed. Over time is actively discouraged and penalized."
bad,I worked at the distribution center as an order filler and then as a fork lift operator in the freezer and refrigerator. I'm just going to share my personal experience and not sugar coat anything. It is a very fast paced environment. I had four days off during the week but its not with it when the three days you do have to work are like burning hates.  The pay is good but it doesn't add up to as much as you'd think in your head. you end up working an average of 30 a week and after taxes make 850 a check on average which turns out to about 1800 a month. Not much opportunity for overtime either. I started losing eyesight from cold constant temps and you are expected to bust yourself into the dirt to make productivity. After your training curve if you can't hit 100 percent they start calling you to the office and giving you occurrences every week. Driving a forklift I wanted to be more concerned with safety so as to not damage things or hurt anyone and because of this I didn't make production and eventually got kicked out the door after a year and a half given to was mart. TO WRAP THIS UP THERE ARE PLENTY OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE MUCH MORE MONEY IN A MUCH LESS STRESSFUL MANOR. Would not recommend.
bad,"Most shifts are swing shifts. Full time jobs are being replaced with part time employment.  Not a lot of respect for the individual here but, they do hire a great deal of people so it's easy to find employment."
bad,Would of loved to work there longer. I loved do this job just wish it had better management ! would like to go back to it but just need something different !
bad,"When everyone in your life is off for the holidays typically you will be working.  Not only working but working extra days as well.  The money is good but not for the sacrifices you have to make at home.  The pressure in the store is also increasing.  More work with less staff.  Not good for the associates trying to succeed when all they hear is more, more, more.  Ultimately bad for the customers that Walmart touts are #1."
bad,Its a productive work place for sure but the management and some of the people there are messy and try to get you fired. I cant really say over the year and few months that ive been working there that ive learned anything.
bad,"Receiving processor, unloaded trucks daily. Put labels on boxes, scan items. You have to make a certain production level and if you don't you will be written up."
bad,The work was too much for the pay.  They had all these expectations but the pay was too low as compared to it. Pay more if you want people to work extra hard.
bad,"High turnover, stressed management, personnel shortages, poor upkeep of facilities, scheduling problems. Everything is based on cost containment. Does provide significantly lower prices to consumer."
bad,It has potential but that job doesn't actually care about its employees especially if you work for them through a temp service. over all for such a big company they can do better.
bad,"I feel like you get overworked for the amount of pay. The costumers can be very rude, management pretends for you to do the job required and way more without having the staff necessary."
bad,"Most of the problems i had with walmart were with the poor management and bad practices. Other than that most of the time it was, at least decent with good people and simple instructions."
bad,Working at Walmart was fun but the managers were subpar. They would get on your back for talking to another associate and then when you turn the corner they are chatting it up with another manager about personal life. They also are on you for even taking a little 30 second break or seeing a friend in a aisle. If they saw someone they knew they stopped what they were doing and talked to them but I get united for it. Unfair managers
bad,"I feel like a lot was asked for a one person job.  They did not allow team work to get big tasks done. Not enough time to get a task done.  They could have approached things differently, if they wanted it done very specifically."
bad,"I worked for Walmart for over two decades, they no longer care about their greatest assets, their employees. They have less and less of them and expect you to take up the slack from lack of help. Hiring in people part time only so they don't have to pay them benefits."
bad,"Walmart is an okay job to work, you make good enough money to access your needs. The minimum wage there is good for new employers, but the managers are very incosiderate"
bad,"The hardest part about the job is when the assistant manager does not Schedule enough cashiers through out the day and when the cashiers call off,  which makes the customers upset but when that happens I always tend to find to still make it work and I also make sure the customers leave with a smile"
bad,"Walmart itself isn’t a terrible company, just the one of Gold Street. All of the good people leave and lazy ones are never reprimanded. Most of the people who work there are great and there is a huge family vibe. But the majority of management really doesn’t care about anything more than their stores rep. Talking to them is hard and gets nothing accomplished."
bad,"A typical day at work is very stressful and strict. We are not allowed to stand up at our desk or talk to our co workers. We are expected to stare at our computer screens and answer calls all day, every day. Our schedules are on a set rotation so the hours change weekly. I enjoy my manager and co workers. I do not enjoy how we are treated in the building. We are not treated like working adults."
bad,"Managers don't work with your schedule, no matter what they would like you to believe. I worked there for three months and never received any assistance with direct deposit, so I had to pick up my checks on my downtime because Personnel was never in. I never received the sticker on my name badge, so I manually had to check in each day, which became tedious when everyone around me could just swipe and go. I got scheduled on days that I had closed availability on, and rather than fix my availability, the managers would just tell me to submit an availability sheet when I already had submitted the sheet several weeks in advance and they had yet to put any of it into the system. On the day I quit, it took me nearly 3 hours to find a manager to speak to about it. It was an appalling and miserable place to work in, especially when the managers tried to save face for their own mistakes by scolding team members just because it was an ""Academy Store""."
bad,Walmart was just a job for me. I knew on the first day that it was going to be that way. No one in management knew that I was there for the job that I was hired for. There was no communication between the managers. you only got bumped up in pay once a year and that was a 2% across the board for everyone. No incetive to try harder.
bad,Walmart expected a great deal fro their employees without equal compensation.  There was a lot of competition and back stabbing.  The only good thing about them is that they hired handicapped people.
bad,"Walmart is a mixed bag. There are some good people. That comes with some bad people. This is my experience. I had two main managers. One that was kind and helpful, then one that was lazy. The lazy one made me do the stuff he didn’t want to. The kind one was always willing to help and give advice."
bad,considero que tiene buenas políticas aunque pobremente administrada por alguno de sus lideres.
bad,jai beaucoup appris au seion de cette cie meilleur ecole
bad,I began the job as an inventory worker and was later transferred to overnight stocking.  I would be assigned a department and would re-stock the shelves.  A short time later I was transferred to the front of the store and became an overnight cashier.
bad,The people at Walmart are all nice to each other but there are a lot of times to feel neglected by managers. After each year you get a raise but once minimum wage surpasses that amount you're being paid the same amount as someone who could've just started.
bad,Walmart is a very competitive place to work. I'm not sure why this company never honor availability. I did learn a lot form working here but it was a intense work environment there not sure why maybe because we had no store manager at the location I worked.
bad,For me Walmart was my first job. I got to get better people skills by working with customers on a daily basis. I also learned how to multi task. for me I would recommend this as a first job and also a part time job.
bad,"no advancement and the company takes away more than it gives, the company advances the wrong people into management positions,  they are unqualified because most of the time they couldn't or didn't know their own jobs to begin with,"
bad,"There was no problem working at Walmart, if you focus on your job and mind your own business."
bad,This job was very rough because of all the things I had to do here. The toilets would always blow up and I had to clean it. The managers were never to be found when I needed them. The hours were also very limited
bad,"I worked as much as 15 hours per day, 22 hours being my longest day and was salary.  Areas competed with each other and I would be very cutthroat.  I did learn to roll with quick changes and make decisions the could cost thousands of dollars.  Employees were never happy ever though they were paid well for our area.  Call-offs were horrible, about 15% each day"
bad,"This job sucks at times, but there is opportunity for avancement for those who go hard and deal with the stress."
bad,The company and its management dont follow sam waldens dreams for the customer or its associates. Walmart is now solely focused on what the can make money wise.
bad,"""Cuando no tenemos la plantilla completa pasamos por alto conductas que van en contra de nuestras políticas y procedimientos, desgraciadamente así es Walmart"" "
bad,"The customers are always right. Hours was not a issue, they can work around your schedule. they help you go to school. easy to move up. They work you hard, you will work put of your job description."
bad,"As a company Walmart can be an exciting place to work and grow provided you have a good management team and support from your fellow associates. Benefits are very good compared to most companies in the Retail Sector. Training is circumspect. Management relies on a program labeled Pathways. its a 10 week program to ready the associate for their job on the sales floor. the plan itself on paper is good but it lacks a key ingredient , working with a trained associate. Management doesn't see it that way and that's why a good percentage of them quit or are let go.Pay raises were once based on an associates evaluation, now corporate has done away with that and gives every associate a 2-2.5% raise(annually) across the board to each and every associate , ultimately eliminating any incentive to do well."
bad,Currently my location is undergoing some changes and we have a new GM; Therefor you must stay focused and active because it is very consistent with the flow of customers that come in and out.  You have to participate as a team in order to make the day easy going
bad,"Not enough cashiers for the shift, long lines, rude customers always complaining. The other customer service managers are great to work with. We work together to make the day go by"
bad,"I do not feel that this is important in filling out an application. I am not giving a review for this company. So this is just to get me through to the application that I am trying to fill out,"
bad,"You get paid well enough. If you can stick it out long enough the benefits are outstanding. Most of the time the working atmosphere is actually quite positive, it was just the department I was located that was negative."
bad,Working with customers all day does take a toll on you but you learn a lot of new skills and earn a lot of patience. Being able to work fast is the key to this job.
bad,"I've been with Walmart for two years and if you allow yourself, your coworkers truly do become like a second family. I worked in the inventory control department and we had a very set routine, going into work I always knew what I would be doing. However my reason for leaving is the demands and expectations are ridiculously high for employees they want you to work at the speed of 10 people and then will discipline you when you can't. Another major reason for my departure from this company is blatant racial discrimination within my store, I asked my manager if I could start at 7am instead of 6am and she said ""no because your team has to start at 6am"" which would be fair, except a coworker of mine who is the same age, we go to the exact same school, and we are in identical programs, both part-time employees, they are also fairly new to the job and I've been there for a long while, and that coworker is allowed to start at 7am and 8am because they asked for it, the only difference between us is our gender and our race and it was the blatant discrimination that led me to decide to leave this job. My store manager is of a different race than I, and although I'm not by any means a minority many people who are of the same race as I am have noticed that he will not acknowledge your presence, by that I mean say hello, ask about the task at hand, and he will go so far as to avoid looking at you if you're not of his race, he blatantly treats members of his own ethnicity far better than any other ethnicity in the store"
bad,"An ok job at best, wouldn't recommend anyone work at Walmart unless they were a salary payed manager. If you get stressed easily or can't work under pressure or can't deal with customers or people don't work at Walmart."
bad,"Working for Walmart taught me how to be a good leader by example. "
bad,It gets super busy on weekends and sometimes they only have few cashiers on the front line so they call sales associated from other departments to go help.
bad,"The managers at the job do not care about the employees, or to cater to their needs. Make schedule mistakes frequently and will not change or acknowledge it. If employees call off too often they will get fired even if the schedule was wrong."
bad,"walmart wasnt all that bad but definitely needs new managers, or better managers, ones that you can talk to about stuff that's going on, and maybe a new point system"
bad,"The work place was very unfair and biased, the management was admitted to do whatever they please while employees have to do whatever they say or be punished for it."
bad,Ok place to work. Full time hours that are usually set times. People are good and helpful. Pay not so great but opportunities for career advancement is pretty high.
bad,"Unfortunately no work/life balance and a culture of threats and corporate ""sneak"" visits make it hard to enjoy a typical workday.  Pay for management is very attractive and the bonus structure is enough to encourage staying longer each day."
bad,"I helped customers with their online purchases. Received packages, scanned them in. Handled all customer inquiries and problems. Also worked in the online grocery area picking customer orders."
bad,"I learnt from Wal-Mart is to never trust what managers said. Every time something happened to me health-wise, they wouldn't care and would bash me for it. The management was all over the place and most of the time, I couldn't find them when I needed them. The workplace culture was fine however. The hardest part about my job was that they said I was their best worker but yelled at me when someone else didn't do their job. The most enjoyable part of it though was seeing the happy faces of customers when I was able to help them find the product they were looking for"
bad,Walmart was not a job I liked in my history of jobs at all. People were rude and not flexible. The work was fine but the people were very rude and would gossip quite a bit
bad,"Out of the 7 months I’ve worked currently. All of it seems wasted. Not only do the managers not help new people , but the skill you need to learn require someone to help. Managers are always requiring maintenance to do stocker and meanial tasks, then get upset when we have no time to complete nightly tasks."
bad,"It’s was a good experience for a first job but not for a long time. Learned many things I had not known about basically from how to interact with customers, finding merchandise in the back room, unloading merchandise from truck, stocking, and working in apparel and clothing . Wasn’t a very positive environment to work in. The managing was very disorganized."
bad,it was a great experience and i had fun but never again will i work for walmart. it was a great in between job and i will never forget the lessons i learned.
bad,"My managers at Walmart are lazy, expecting the associates to do everything, Doing more than managers and supervisors and get paid terrible is definitely not worth it."
bad,Assistant managers were never around in areas assigned and were always in the break room.  Work load was good but low pay and with no recognition or gratitude for a job well done or going above and beyond.
bad,Walmart wasn’t bad it has its fast and slow moments.Its pretty easy the only real problem I had there was the deli manager she was really rude to all of the employees.
bad,"They offer a lot that can benefit you in the long run, such as stock, 401k, healthcare, dental insurance, vision. As an associate we get discounts and bonus checks."
bad,Mudanças Estruturais frequentes e sem organização.
bad,I think Walmart is for a perfect just coming into work I wouldn’t recommend this place for a career they will hire anybody that’s one of the problems and you have to no somebody to move up
bad,"The job is good for the hours and pay, but the work still doesn’t justify it. You start by unloading a truck for 2-3 hours, and then you stock shelves and move pallets for the whole night. It was simply too much for me to handle and the stress was bad. Morale was never good there, management was no better. I left abruptly after 3 months because it was all too much for me."
bad,Everyone is hardworking makes sure each and every customer is satisfied. I learned the most important part which is having good patience. The hardest part is standing for 8 hours straight but the two 15 min breaks an hour lunch helps out a lot.
bad,The management does not like confrontation with the employees so problems never get fixed.  They expect more work out of one person than they are capable of.
bad,"A typical day here depends on your staffing. If you have enough people to work registers, and other customer service managers to help you, then you're going to be fine. If you don't, which is more often than not, then this job is going be overwhelming and stressful. You will get lines, you will not have much back up from management, you will not have many back up cashiers, and you will probably no get your breaks or lunches on time. "
bad,I unloaded trucks at a walmart. I'm not sure what you really want from me here. I was paid minimum wage and was supposed to get benefits after one year but it took another six months to receive them.
bad,"Walmart was the most stressful company I've ever worked for. Policies were constantly changing, employees were constantly changing departments, we were grossly understaffed, and constantly overworked. The biggest challenge was convincing my superiors to let me work in my department and not in another department, even when I was the only person in the department and the oven was running. I clocked into work one morning only to be told that I was the only person left in my department. Everyone else had been transferred, and I would be working alone (and I did for the next four to five months)."
bad,Hard work production  job sort hours   very  hot   building.  Very good  about  safety. Management  need to be more concerned  with the  needs of their  employees
bad,Hours are different to the point your specific days off are switched and they cause you to gain an absent point for not attending even though the day is what you want off.
bad,"Je travaille là depuis plus d'une année et au début, l'ambiance était bonne, nous étions une bonne équipe productive.  Certe le travail était dur parfois , mais l'ambiance et le salaire comblait, cependant tout cela c'est vite détérioré, nous ne pouvions plus parler entre amis (même si l'on travaillais en simultané) nous nous faisons donner des objectifs et des limites de temps irréaliste et infaisable, nos gérant était toujours sur notre dos, il y avait constamment des changements de façon de faire... Et puis l'ambiance c'est détérioré, beaucoup d'emploi on démissionner parce que le travail est tout simplement toxique. Même moi je suis en recherche et le plus drôle dans tous ça c'est que pour combler pour la pénurie de main d'oeuvre, l'on se fait encore plus poussée par nos gérant pour aller plus vite. "
bad,The way my day typically went was we were unsupervised and then yelled at for new implementations we weren't told about. All of the people in my department always got their jobs done but management always was trying to pick out something we did wrong.
bad,working for Walmart has its ups and downs. the staff are good people and are very nice to work with. The work expectations from the higher up mangers is stressful to say the least.
bad,You are only a number to the company.  If you don't like the way they treat you.  You can leave they will just get someone else.  I enjoyed meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of backgrounds.
bad,"It was a fast paced environment where you had to meet your numbers weekly and monthly.  You were a number to management and they always looked for ways to write you up.  There was no room to move up.  They promoted outside of the company, so there was no incentive to go above and beyond"
bad,"Management was rude,  discouraging, they ignored employee complaints.  A lot of employees and managers where rude to customers. Store is disorganized and employees like to spread rumors about other employees. While I worked there I was offended on multiple occasions by other employees despite never being rude or disrespectful to others."
bad,"I was asked to be transferred because I was a student and it was too far for me to drive. Between what time my classes ended and the time I was scheduled I was going to be constantly late and was well aware of this which is why I tried to avoid the situation. When the transfer was refused I worked until I had accumulated enough points from fired fro termination. I was basically told that they could not transfer me and as a result I lost a very good job. I loved my job at Walmart, my co-workers were all very nice and we were like a family. I guess that's why I was so disappointed when I was fired 3 days shy of having worked there 90 days"
bad,"Being a department manager over paper, pets and chemicals which all consumables is too much for one person and all my help was part time and came in when I was leaving and they could never do anything in the department because they were called to be a cashier or help in grocery.  So everything they they were suppose to do fell on me the next plus my regular duties."
bad,"Working at walmart was stressful, in the way that as much as you accomplish in a night, there is always something else you can to. degrading r not.But it was not the place for me"
bad,"I started off my first day with the longest shift, little training, and rude co-workers. The deli was always time consuming because of how busy it was but management was not organized at all. Good pay though."
bad,Like the work I did but management is incompetent. They seem to be completely clueless about the everyday responsibilities of associates. If you just plan to go to work and do your job don't expect to get recognition or advancement.
bad,"Its a great place to work, as long as you show up and do your job you will be fine. But don't expect much help from management if you need it. They do not listen or care what you think."
bad,Although my time at WalMart was rather short I did enjoy myself. The vast majority of management were very easy going and appreciative when you completed a task efficiently.
bad,Walmart does not care what your family is going through at home. Was fired because I had to take my dad to cancer treatments and had to miss over the amount of aloud days.
bad,It's was a fun work place to work at i learned alot about inventory working there i also learned how to stock merchandise i also learned alot about the conpany and how big the company is and i really enjoyed working for walmart
bad,Poor management. The job could have been excellent if the management was more professional. Need to show more appreciation to employees to create a great work environment.
bad,"I walked off due to poor management and very rude associates sitting in the lunch room daily. "
bad,it was fun at first then i got to know the people some were nice and old and others just sat there and talk behind your back but just ignored them. the most enjoyable thing about that job was getting paid
bad,"The day usually begings with scanning , than running he freight.I have learned that the store manger can speak to any person any type of way.The store manger to me shouldn't be there. I love the work ethic is a nice customer service."
bad,friendly coworkers and a great way to build your customer service skills. You must be flexible and a good communicator. The most enjoyable part is creating relationships with other coworkers and customers.
bad,they told rita staffin g to get rid of me and they kept pushing and pushing and its crazy i was doing my job yes i my have been not getting the 300 in my work but i was still working that is all that should matter to them is that the job was getting done.
bad,I liked working there at first and then after you've worked there for a while the managers start treating you really bad. This was my first job in high school and it was not a very good experience for me.
bad,Culture changed over the years.  they are no longer pro associate.  The management is used as free labor to cover all of the holes in coverage throughout the store.
bad,Okay place to work at depending on which store you are at and your management team. A lot of advancement opportunities. Training has improved over the years.
bad,"Working here is ok unless you're salaried, they make you work all of the time and switch you around between day shift and nights and make you work every holiday."
bad,"Walmart can be a good place to work in there is good management.  I worked there for many years and over all I had one or two good managers.  however most were not team players and did not help employees.  Its sad that this is what Walmart has become, I remember when everyone wanted to work there, now, not so much."
bad,"It's a good stepping stone job, if you're in need of income and hours then I suggest you apply, get your money, and get out while you still have a chance to find something better. "
bad,This place wad way to stressful! You weekdays worried you were the next one to go. The asst manager is always looking for something to get rid of employees for.
bad,"At first things were going well, and with different unique promotions, but when certain things fell out of place in the company My shifts went into something that I DID NOT enjoy. The work hours were long and sometimes I didn't feel appreciated."
bad,New structure with hours is horrible and they do not care if you have a life outside of Walmart. pay is decent starting out now and overall is just like any other retail type job.
bad,It’s a good place for the benefits you get but the management team is terrible.  It’s days where you ask for help and instead of helping they call you or take 30 minutes to respond and that’s if they respond. The hours aren’t all that great and sometimes depending on who management is can’t help you get the hours you need.  Personel coordinator has too much power in my opinion. A lot of shady business goes on behind the scenes with management
bad,"The company has a lot of different kinds of people working for it, which means that one would have a variety of different experiences based on who they meet. Each Walmart is a little bit different, so the management, staff, and customer base can have vastly different impacts on one's experience working there. It can be a fulfilling and eventful job, but its quality can vary based on who you work with."
bad,Walmart doesn't want people to say their long term I feel that their point system gips the workers he have to be at your lunch by your 5th hour or you get a 1/2 a point that adds up people lose their jobs
bad,Compañía estable que se caracteriza en explotar al trabajador sin dar un aumento adecuado
bad,it is no longer focused on customer service or providing a good working environment for its  employees. the focus is about cutting costs and sales only
bad,the automotive side was nice to work at but the other management was not nice and did not help out at all so would not go back do to their prosses of work
bad,"If you have nothing else going on in your life, and you want to work to the point where it's all you ever do, then apply to Walmart. You'll not only just work the position you applied for, but you'll do multiple, Yay! so exciting. Walmart does prefer you to have open availability, you're most likely to get your application accepted, if you do. If some time down the line you need to change your availability, Good Luck! Unless you are in school, or active duty, you have nothing to worry about. A typical work day starts off slow if you're starting off in the morning or late night shift, but if you're working around noon shift on the weekends it can be chaotic, you may learn to get use to it, but in general Walmart stays busy. Management; where do I begin? Not all bad, but with some, you'll start to question if you're the one that's crazy. I did like working at Walmart because I enjoyed interacting with the customers, that's it.  Everything else is, well, go find out for yourself if you are interested."
bad,"It's great that the company gives both full and part-time employees paid time off, and the starting pay is $11.00 per hour for all employees.  The coaching system, however, is unfair to employees because employees get accused of things that they haven't done and then receive a so-called ""coaching"" for what they supposedly did wrong, and after the 4th coaching the employee is fired.  This is a ridiculous system because the management is unwilling to do anything to verify whether or not an employee actually deserves the coaching; so employees can collect ""coachings"" and get fired for very frivolous, unfounded reasons.  I don't think that some of the managers are very good at managing, including some of the upper level managers, such as the store manager.  I think that they only got into those positions because they worked their way up to get there, but they actually lack the skills that a good manager should have.  I do not feel like I was ever appreciated by Walmart when I worked there either; I was treated like an expendable employee when I worked there, and I have heard NUMEROUS current or former employees say the same thing about working at Walmart.  Also, cashiers frequently did not get their breaks on time, but management never seemed to care about this either. I would not recommend working at Walmart to anyone, unless he/she is not able to get a job anywhere else after spending long hours looking for one and applying for hundreds of jobs."
bad,"Not a good place to work, wouldn't recommend working here for anyone, the management is terrible, employees are terrible just overall not a good place to work. They had me work overtime almost every week and I never got paid for it."
bad,This company has great benefits and pays well but it’s very slow paced and unorganized. All of the shifts are long and draining. The breaks were short and you go with a lot of people. It feels like being in prison.
bad,"The hours were very long. They were unable to work with your availability. When trying to change availability, they cut hours. I felt it was a very easy job and enjoyed helping customers. They just did not work with you about your hours."
bad,I provide the public the best retail service that one can. I work well with the management team and make it an welcoming environment to work at. The hardest part id not having enough staff at times but you learn to pull together and become the best team you can.
bad,The management was always on your case about something and at times management would try putting me down which irritated me because I was trying my best each time I was on the clock but management didn't care where the items to stock went as long as it was in the isle that the item being stocked was located. pretty much I went by the book and management just wanted the job done.
bad,"During my 20 year tenure I saw the company culture going by the wayside. Upper management are mostly from other countries that Walmart had purchased and just had never lived the culture and truly couldn't talk or act it,  mainly because they didn't know what it was. Their out to pull Walmart into the tech world of today and mainstream all. to worry about a culture long forgotten. Walmart today is not the Walmart of yesterday. A typical day at Walmart is very routine oriented. One only learns what it takes to do his or hers routine. Everything has a price and there is constant pressure to perform. That's typically the hardest part of the job the constant pressure of do or we'll replace you. The most joyful part of the job was talking and visiting with the customers."
bad,Management was very concerned about the workplace along with everyone else business. it was a very hostile and stressful environment to work in. along with very rude customers
bad,"This was just a job for me, I guess.  I didn't mind the work.  Management was kind of a drag because they didn't really treat employee's all that well.  They never hired anyone full time because they didn't want to give out benefits.  So, it was fine at the time, I suppose, but I don't think I'll ever go back."
bad,"I began as a cashier and worked for about a year and a half at that position before transferring into the homeliness sales associate. I have been in that position for almost 3 years. I have money handling skills, as well as customer service, cleaning and organizing, stocking, pricing, and setting modular experience."
bad,"Working at Walmart was one of the worst job experiences I had. The managers were rude, inconsiderate, and unorganized "
bad,"A Day at work: Tedious and rarely rewarding"
bad,"Walmart isn't a horrible place to work when you're a teenager, it's a great starter job. The typical work day, for a cashier, consists of scanning, bagging, and zoning items on shelving. But also dealing with annoyed customers that didn't have the experience they wanted. The management, at this specific store, wasn't all that horrible but I feel as if they were too relaxed on some of the employees. The hardest part of being a cashier is finding ways to deal with upset customers, because believe me it wasn't easy. The most enjoyable part about being a cashier is often times you get to see the same customers quite a few times a week, it makes for great conversation while scanning their items. Lastly, there are some things that this walmart does absolutely poorly. When it comes to holiday shopping/sales it is not well managed, and it is just a mess. Nothing is planned it feels as if it is all thrown in your face, it is a very overwhelming time of year. Hence why I quit in November."
bad,This place had a lot of new managers and workers. They was unfair to a lot of their workers. They would change the rules around all the time. The managers was never there when they was needed.
bad,I enjoy the people I work with. Their nice honest people that like to have fun. I hate the fact that management never respond to the pages whenever their needed. Their never around when you need them never on the sales floor.
bad,"The assistant managers and store manager has their own set of rules and regulations. Plus, I am a department manager over three departments with little help. I do not have any associates under me. The assistant managers rarely finds an associate to help me in all of my departments which makes my job stressful."
bad,"I was overworked with this company. They were always pulling me in different directions and then would be upset when the duties were not performed in my previous area (that they pulled me away from). They forced me to do jobs that were not in my description due to under-staffing. They also did not adhere to the availability hours that I provided on more than one occasion. I was a student, so this was problematic because they did give discipline if you missed work."
bad,"Used to be a cool job, not so much now. The pay is still pretty good. Pay tops out at 2 and a half years. We used to have holidays off and overtime pay when we worked them. Not anymore all normal work days now, no overtime when working holidays now. They try to write us up for using the restroom now. Our breaks start in work area and end in work area, meaning the walk to break area and back cuts out most of our break time. I.E. 20 minute break = 10 minutes in reality. The place is becoming a joke and half of the associates who have been their at least 5+ years are looking at a way out."
bad,They didnt really treat like people with lives outside that building and they will terminate you for the stupid things like if you never called out before but call out one time for a family emergency they will terminate you.
bad,I don't plan on ever working for walmart again or at least for a very long time. I've been mistreated and lied to plenty of times. I'vve worked hard when told to and somehow it's still not good enough.
bad,"at the specific location management was often rude and only cared about themselves, did not care about employees of the store, other co-workers were mostly very friendly and became good friends with some co-workers. Other co-workers who were looking to advance within company were only concerned with themselves."
bad,"My view from working there is that it is a very good job, but the lack of respect on the job makes it easy for one to not want to work there for very long"
bad,"Most employees were friendly and helpful, managers except a few were stuck up. Got to work with an old friend made the days go by easier. The store needs to really look into who they hire most are just lazy"
bad,"Empresa boa de trabalhar, mas depende o setor e gerencia. "
bad,"At the time I worked there, I went from leading a team to Department Manager within 30-45 days, received a $0.70 raise. Tripled my work load and was only able to work no more than 8 hours a day. Loved the work, but the amount of the raise was not cohesive with the amount of work."
bad,walmat is a job for teenagers or college students or retired people based on they keep you partite for years unless you get very lucky the salary will have you working another job
bad,It was not a great place at all to work for. I've talked with many that say that it was not run correctly. Have even seen customers complain of the way some management treated the employees.
bad,To work at walmart takes a special breed of person. You must have great patience due to customers and management. Customers have little patience with workers and management pulls you in all different directions.
bad,Benefits are cheap which is nice but the pay isnt worth what you have to put up with. You dont make enough for cost of living and the management isnt always great about dealing with problems.
bad,"A typical day at work involved preparing the goods that were to be baked the following morning, stocking the department and cleaning the bakery. I learned a lot about breakout (bakery prep) as well as customer service skills. "
bad,"Upper management expect alot out of store managers. Work alot of hours, no family time. The hiring pool of employees wasn't good. Alot of managers in each location, but the quality of workers was non existant."
bad,"Walmart is so prideful on being the best, they don't allow any room for mistakes. Being human, I made several and they barely gave you any room. The pay was good, but they barely let you breathe on your own. Employees from different departments had to share equipment which really cut back on productivity because usually under-trained associates take too long to figure out how to work them!"
bad,Not comfortable with new direction of Walmart scheduling. It will not guarantee 40 hours a week or enough hours to qualify for medical benefits regardless of availability.
bad,"Was an ok company"
bad,needs an organization especially in training.they lack consistency on majority of things in this company.culture needs to be changed to especially in hr department.
bad,"If you are looking for extra money then its a best place for part-timer.  Expect to deal with customer by helping to locate their desired products. Ensuring the shelves are stock.  As a associate, you will educate yourself on varieties of products to execute excellent customer service.  Due to multicultural workplace, You will be meeting different people and their various attitude to work/deal with.  Difficulties that most employee encounter was getting a chance to step up in the ladder through top management.  I enjoyed most of my time meeting new people."
bad,"A typical work day is stocking all pallets zones and down stocking."
bad,I would recommend working at Walmart if you are really into customer service. At Walmart the customer comes first. I did like 1 of my CSM's but not do.mucj the others. I had one who would constantly get on to me about Walmart credit card applications and how to ask the customer. I had one make me and a customer wait for 15 minutes before the actually helped is.
bad,Very demanding fast paced job but they pay well if your looking for quick money apply high turnover rate the breaks are short and the break room is very far from work station
bad,"They focused more on their credit cards then their employees. I'd probably never go back. They pay was good, but if you're a cashier your work is very boring."
bad,"The environment was relaxing and quiet, however the management gave unrealistic timelines for work and were also showing signs of favoritism in the work place."
bad,it was a fine job right out of high school but the management was very mean and not willing to work with my availablity and would constantly schedule me outside of it. i liked being a cashier i made okay money and got to talk to alot of people and it was fun but it definetly gets boring and tiring after awhile and you do stand on your feet for a long period of time.
bad,customer service is the main thing I did here. management were not trust worthy at the pico location. Store closed and did not allow many associates to come back.
bad,"Maybe not all stores are like the one I was at, but mine wasn't good at communicating and always lacked resources. It wasn't a fun time for little pay"
bad,"The managers at this establishment were very motivating, but not in a very inviting way or with a friendly tone. This was a time based job that seemed to alway be pushed for time. The push for time made strong workers dislike the ones who fell short in what was expected."
bad,"A typical day at work is cleaning the area and stocking the shelves making them look real full in the morning for the customers to shop. At Walmart, I learned to work and not complain. Management there are okay and reliable to help a person if needed. The hardest part of the job is maintaining your time if you have a lot of freight. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and workers."
bad,"Software programs were constantly replaced with the concerns of management being given priority over assisting users to save time and ease of use."
bad,"Over-tasked with no room for advancement, management does not proactively assist in your career advancement. Very deficient and inexperienced management in place."
bad,I don't want to do this. I have learned that you need to watch your back at all times. This all I am going to say. so that is all.  Working here is a job.
bad,"Wal-Mart is a comfortable place to work management is good but the pay is,low it would b a great place for young people to work if they like retail and customer service"
bad,"Having worked there for 10+ years, I feel as though a lot of the principles that glued the company and its employees together are near non-existent. Managers use their position more so to assert dominance than guidance. At times they even blatantly ignore the needs of certain employees if they are considered ""disposable"". They even impose tactics to rush elder employees into early retirement."
bad,"stocking merchandise, collecting inventory on high priced items, marking and replacing price tags, displaying new laptops and televisions, generating phone plans for customers and processing payments, taking customer phone calls, running a cash register, and scrubbing and dusting the department."
bad,Management was a joke. The store i worked at was open 24/7 and the night manager and daytime manager constantly fought over my daily tasks and pitted me in the middle. My co workers were mostly great. The stress and annoyance of incompetent management was not worth my pay.
bad,Very good Training if you're getting into security work will teach you all the ins and outs proper procedure for report writing patrolling and working with a team
bad,I worked in accounting at walmart for roughly a year and decided that it was not for me to work in an accounting setting. The job is okay if you have good managers but can also be frustrating when working with a bad one.
bad,Going to work was good. My shift was 4am to 1 pm. I learned how to work with customers more. the best part about it was i got off early. Management was very helpful.
bad,"Walmart is a great competitive company that is a benchmark in its industry.  The role I had, although it was a good one, was one that was more temporary than anything.  I did enjoy my time there."
bad,management does not care for employees. As long as the duties that they ask to do are being completed they could care less about your well being. I was throwing up at work and they tried to get me to go to a different department. Like wow.
bad,I was a overnight stacker associate I would receive pallets of food and I had to brake them down and put all the merchandise on the shelves were they belong
bad,"A great place to get started but looking for something more, friendly work environment and great employees. Understaffed and poor management are the only downfalls I can speak of."
bad,the company is pretty reliable. if you are looking for a job wal mart. as long as you have an open availability you should be able to get the hours you need.
bad,"Place the cans on the shelf, place the boxes on the shelf, don't knock over the shelf, or the items, or the glass bottles, or the plastic jugs, or anything really. Don't make mistakes, don't forget to come in after you have had four wisdom teeth pulled to turn in your note, no matter how groggy or out of touch you are at that moment, they will fire you. Don't forget to come to work after going to jury duty as well, as they will also fire you for turning in the appropriate paperwork and digital system information on time."
bad,"Used to be an acceptable place to work.  Too many frequent changes and taking from associates. The associates are not top priority and neither is safety. Cases per hour, that's what drives our business."
bad,"Walmart is horrible with entry level positions, most walmarts management is horrible, most people that are higher positions treat you like your nothing"
bad,"The job was decent the entire time I was there, until people began to quit and new store managers were employed, the workload tripled, being understaffed by at least 10 people with store managers expecting us to be able to function as if we did have the appropriate amount was terrible, my first write up wasn't because of behavior or something I'd done but instead not completing an on of many pallets from a large grocery truck and I wasn't even notified, I thought it best to quit at that point,"
bad,"Management seemed to only care about things being done and not how they got done. "
bad,I left there because the hours be up and down sometime id get 40 hours and some time id get 34 hours they base there hours off of sales and i needed my hours to be 40 every week
bad,"Not bad, fair pay,  good scheduling,  management could use a touch up. Needs more opportunities for full time. Almost 3 years not full time yet.Boring"
bad,"Hard workers are taken advantage of, being required to do extra work outside there job description to help other departments and management to cover the poor work done by other employees, as well as constantly being pulled from there own jobs to help then being blamed for leaving there positions by other members of management. had very little trust of higher management as confidential open door meeting are being brought back up to you by other member so management.As well as the ignoring of interoffice relationships between management and their subordinates."
bad,"The fact we r so short with staff. N help, I mean when I call for help to someone to help a customer , my call is rarely answered leaving me have to deal with a mad customer or customers becoming impatient cuz I'm only one person n can't help 4 customers at one time so they end up leaving."
bad,Do not like how I was treated ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!        !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh I can not stand this company because they act like you owe them your whole life and want to pay you smalls and make you work way more than they pay for
bad,"There is too much of a ""good ol boy"" sense in certain stores. There is deliberate favoritism, to the point of exclusion in some cases. Management is not congruent as a whole in ascertaining the collective needs of associates, and it is divided as shifts. Personnel is The least personable and helpful aspect of the store."
bad,I just wish that the upper management would take more care of their employees as well as interact with customers more. Also it would be better if the company would hire and promote from within instead of hiring new employees from the outside.
bad,"States they are a ""New"" Walmart but did far from being able to prove such.  Put you into positions that you specifically stated that you are not a good match for and then punish you for not being able to do such position well.  Termination with out warnings is a problem.  They are the same Walmart as usual."
bad,I worked overnights in the dairy and frozen department. I worked all night in the cold and if the freight was not complete then we had to stay later but could not keep the overtime.
bad,The company gave up on the core values set forth by Sam Walton and now they care just about the dollar. Yes there in business to make money but you can't make money without good associates. Now they are getting into do a lot more with a lot less and the stores are hurting from it.
bad,"I feel as if i threw away 18 years of my life slaving for this company.  I was a cheerleader for walmart ""family culture"" for many years. i would not go back,and they have asked several times."
bad,Ability to try different areas to learn customer service from working on the floor stocking shelves to learning how to running a register and providing the last face on customer service
bad,working at Walmart was stressful because they would work you hard but pay minimum wage I worked from 12-8 got one half hour lunch break and two 15 min breaks. they treat you with respect I can say that they have good meetings but the pay was the only part I didn't like
bad,"I'm just filling this out cause it wouldn't let me skip this process. its Walmart, you clock in, you go to your department, and perform your daily duties as schedule"
bad,The job itself is fine.  Lots of pressure to get quota.  Lots of drama between employees.  Supervisors do little to stop drama or stop those not following the rules.
bad,"If you want to work hard and move up, you’re generally able to do so. However a lot of people don’t which puts more on your plate because you have to pick up the slack. Management is rotated semi frequently which effects how things go in a day, some managers have different agendas as others."
bad,Did not have enough workers on shifts but would not give overtime . No matter your job description you always had to do other persons in different departments job
bad,"Overwork employees. Long term employees not compensated for loyalty, manAgement lies about scheduling. No respect with management employees. Treated- and told- that employees are just numbers and easily replaceable"
bad,As an OverNight ASM I was always getting the short end of the stick. Day time mangers would love to leave unfinished work for Overnight to do on top of stocking and zoning total store. I was not aloud to leave until I was done with everything. I store manger made me work 15-17 hrs a day and one extra day a week. I was always exhausted and will never work for Wal-Mart again.
bad,Mangers does not care one but about the employees. I been in a bad wreck and all They kept asking is when im going back. Never once ask if i was ok. They expect you to go in evening if the roads are icy so they want us to kill ourself for them. Do not work for opelousas they are horrible. They have no sympathy for there employees.
bad,"Fun place to work , Healthy and safe environment . Benefits weren’t good at all . I loved the customers and the people I worked with . The pay rate wasn’t good ."
bad,"Walmart back in it's day ( 13+ years ago ) was a great place to work, at any level. Change is good, as long as associates know where they are going and why. "
bad,"The job itself is fine but with all the stuff from customers, coworkers and managers you have to deal with, minimum wage at a little over 7 bucks is so not worth it."
bad,I mean it’s a good job to work long as you got the people to work but with no help and no respect you somehow wouldn’t like to work for a company like this
bad,A lot of stress and not enough staff for the workload. On the phone most of day assisting other associates. A lot of data entry and manual processes. Office casual dress code. learned many processes and systems. Hardest part is angry callers and those who are dishonest. enjoyable is hearing joy and relief when you can help the customer who has all but given up.
bad,moral was always low due to management putting A LOT of stress of associates.  The work load was always too much.   We were always under staffed.  The company was always changing policies for the worse.  Wal-Mart says they are all about family but when you have to have time off for Family they wont let you off for it!!
bad,"The company itself did it's best to take care of its employees, when it came to getting paid , benefits  and time off. However I would not recommend anyone to work as a cashier in this company if you have a low patience level. Working in retail is hard any way when dealing with people, but this company is the worse ."
bad,"While many blame our new store manager, I don't believe they're solely responsible for the decline in work culture. It seems Corporate has shifted more from taking care of their employees in favor of taking care of customers. "
bad,"It's retail, and the same as it has always been. The only thing different at Walmart is the lack of skilled management. Some of the Managers hired in come with a degree in Business Management and if they can pass the test required to become a manager, they immediately promote up with no experience. Lack of communication is also a serious issue."
bad,people need to go to work and just work. not worry about anybody's personal life. to many people talk about each other including the mangers.   work was good place to work the work was not hard at all. its just the people you would work with and for.
bad,"I like everybody. But the company doesn't often inspire motivation, neither does management. And unmotivated workers make your day more stressful and means more work for you if you're a hard worker. Which makes it frustrating. And I get it, it's a stressful low paid job. Some people are just there for school and don't care about the job. "
bad,"a daily routine is expected and must be completed.  To be able to lead others. Management is the reason I would leave, The leadership is not continous to strive for excellence. The hardest part of the job is being expected to multitask , a situtiation I found to be stressful. Love interacting with prople and fellow employees."
bad,Working with Walmart was always stressful since you never knew how many hours you would get. It was hard on the mental health.The point system was lacking in any kind of understanding and there is extreme miscommunication between departments and management levels.
bad,"Was a lack luster onto things cause the employee's were very mean, Management didn't do much of there jobs, and as for me I got screwed over to get an upgrade to move up to get out of my last position."
bad,very cut throat. production expectations cause undue competition and every one is able to view other associate's production levels. a violation of privacy I think. soft tissue injuries prevalent due to repetition of job. you're a means to an end.............way for managers to earn bonuses. GM not a ppl person.
bad,"the higher management needs improving. most workers are nice and helpful. learned how to operate certain machines. hardest part of the job was finding work to work on. most enjoyable, operating the machines."
bad,"I had a bad experience, and worked with people that were not friendly. "
bad,"Have to make sure you keep up with the policy changes that happen. As long as you pay attention and do your job to the best of your abilities, making sure the customers in the area your working are being helped you won't have many problems working in the company."
bad,Typical day at work can be stressful especially when you don't have enough people to help you at the register when needed. If they had enough people schedule it would make a big difference at the end of the day.
bad,The jobs point system is what is the worst part and management don't have your back when I customer is unruly.  Customer is not always right when cursing.
bad,My direct supervisor was amazing! She made coming to work less of a burden. She made everything fun! I loved my cashiers and most of the customers. I was not a fan of some of the upper management. They expect way too much of the CSM's and Front End Zone Supervisor. They pile additional work onto our already stressful duties without batting a single eyelash. It made the entire day sort of frustrating.
bad,I would rate it 5/10 due to the management not being very nice or considerate. They do not treat you the best but they pretend too. The dress code is good.
bad,"It pays well enough, but with schedules being mad by computers in Bentonville, AK instead of human beings in your store, don't expect to get the hours you need to pay rent/feed your family."
bad,no comment-It will not be positive- I feel they discriminate to those over 55 yrs. People employed afteer me were offered full-time. Alot of unfairness
bad,"The job was ok it was just extremely repetitive. There was slight room for growth but not enough in my opinion. The pay was excellent, and the people I worked with were genuinely enjoyable to work with."
bad,my work day started at 8am when i got there i punched in and then was assigned to a register i learned how to interact with people management was great there was nothing hard about this job and i enjoyed the parties they gave for the employees
bad,"No training for the job you are thrown into because there is no one scheduled for that position"
bad,"Not open communication, not meet need and not organized. Some manager have attitude how react deaf people. Some are fine and some not. Break room coffee maker need new one."
bad,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart, but disliked the store's management structure. I found myself in an odd role within the store in that I had a huge amount of responsibility, but no control over hiring, firing, or disciplining the people that worked under me. A higher level manager could easily make or break me depending on who they hired to work under me or whether they fired my associates without warning. "
bad,I worked for Walmart for 3 years. Management was terrible and hardly listened to what the employees had to say. Would make you look dumb in front of customers even if customer was wrong. Got overtime hours for the most part. worked in several departments during the day shift as well as working as a Stocker at night which I think I enjoyed more.
bad,"Amo a empresa Walmart, sua politica, cultura e historia me fascina, mas seus atuais lideres tem pecado muito em relação aos seus associados, não se importa com sua base, infelizmente esqueceram o que Sam Walton dizia: "" Grandes LÍDERES mudam de estilo para levantar a AUTO-ESTIMA de seus associados ou de suas equipes..."""
bad,A typical night at Walmart would be coming in at 10 o'clock. Pulling out pallets from a freezer. Down stacking it onto rolling carts. Taking the carts to the floor and stocking the counters.
bad,management didn't take their time to discuss any of the problems I had at work including conflicting work hours with my in processes education. after directly talking to my manage a few times about this problem he told me that I complain too much and basically didn't do anything about it.
bad,"I've worked at Wal-Mart for 9 years now, and it's just gotten progressively worse. A little bit of power goes straight to heads. Many of which do not deserve their positions. Expectations are set way above one person's reach, which conencidentally is about all they schedule to run multiple areas. I'm almost 30 and I feel about 50 just due to the never-ending stress."
bad,"It is a typical ""high school"" job.Typically only available as a part time shift and can be pretty monotonous. it is a good job for those looking to find work elsewhere."
bad,"A typical day at work at walmart was not enjoyable. The management would forget your breaks regularly. They were not flexible whatsoever with hours. I am in grade 12 and asked for MAXIMUM 20 hours a week, and they would schedule me between 25-27 each week. I asked to not be scheduled sundays for religious reasons and they would keep scheduling me each sunday. "
bad,"Walmart is good if you have no where else to work. It's a very cookie-cutter job. You are replaceable and they make sure you know that. As long as you do your job it's all gravy, but God forbid you need to take some time off."
bad,I loved my job at first but then I started to see favoritism and unprofessionalism. My electronics manager only cared about gossip and having her friends come up to the store so she could talk instead of working. Managers talked to you like you were stupid and work you as hard as they can so they don't have to do the work. I was promised to be put in the mentor program to become a manager but waited 2 months and heard nothing. They promise you lies so you will work harder but never come threw.
bad,"Management needs to change  "
bad,"i prefer not to review this company. My main issue with this company was management. I enjoyed the work, i enjoyed working with all the other associates. And being walmart there was always something to do."
bad,Productive fun place to work with variety of friendly people. Lots of options to do different jobs throughout the store. Had discounts available and training was excellent.
bad,The coworkers were fun and helpful to be with. The work was easy and manageable for the most part. Customers were nice and were very calm and thankful of the the work we did
bad,"I am hard worker and responsible. "
bad,Management only promotes people that they are friends with and are highly unqualified. That results in people in management that are unqualified running parts of the store that they have no clue how to. Making the work load harder and unnecessary. The people that are qualified for advancement are often overlooked and ignored which is the common culture at Walmart.
bad,"okay, I don't have mush to say about the job I do. To me a job is a job that we all have to do. Every job have it up and down. It a good working place."
bad,"I would come at 4 AM bake donuts, cook bread, and prep for the next day. Management was poor because we lost our store manager, so we had mangers from all around coming in trying to fill the hole. It's an okay place to work."
bad,"Understaffed, alot falls on your shoulders. Some people do very little and some people have to do alot. It can be pretty stressfull. Lots of expectations."
bad,Need bettter management and better less racist people better food at the deli cleaner restrooms and better judgement on workers because they keep the lazy and get rid of the good worker and as a business manager you should not show favoritism
bad,I enjoyed the people I worked with. The work was not all that great but fairly easy for a part time position. I liked being able to work night and weekends. It allowed me the time I needed to spend with my family.
bad,"La empresa te da prestaciones de ley, permanencia laboral, muy pocas veces te da crecimiento laboral, es puntual en su pago."
bad,Steady work. Always something to assemble. Learned smart system and inventory control. Immediate assistant manager was awesome to work for. Best part of job was to help out customers and see them smile with complete understanding of what they were purchasing.
bad,Ive been working with walmart for almost a year now and I've realized that their management sucks. They don't work with you when it has to do with schedule or being sick either.
bad,"clock in in the morning get your job  for the day and go off and do the task you where told to do , then lunch you had an hour to eat then they may or may not have you on the same task all and all it was good that they did change it up once in awhile ."
bad,If you are a casher it can be quick or slow depending on what time of day it is. Start off pay sucks and so does the raise. You do get a bonus every 3-6 months. Depending on how long a shift you work you have an hour lunch. You get a 10% discount card after 90 days.
bad,"Room to move up in the.company, pay raise yearly good benefits friendly environments fast pace easy work on spot training overall a good place to work"
bad,"lots to do, no help management didn't seem to care that much for employees.  changing schedule at last minute sometimes not tell the person or have another associate tell them  instead of management team"
bad,"Just clock in hope that they have all the tools for you to do your job."
bad,Bad Managers corrupts good staff. Certain managers show favoritism towards employees and give unfair treatment. I would recommend working in certain departments though
bad,"Walmart was an alright employer, starting out. But pretty soon, there was a change in the structure, and they seemed to care more about monetary gain, and less about their staff."
bad,Have worked in 2 different stores and both are different. My current store is awful. Most management is very uncaring and work environment is hostile.
bad,"While working here, I worked under several floor managers who all brought a different style of management to our department. The majority of the time I was under an unfair manager who required more than my job was supposed to have and I was told numerous times that I shouldn't have been put in those positions without being properly trained. I loved my department manager, as well as the one who took her place once she retired. They worked to help me lean all I could and helped me stock, though it wasn't their job to do so."
bad,"I would not tell anyone not to work their, everybody will have to experience it for themselves, because you might like working their but you might not. so would would have to experience it for yourself because I don't judge anyone."
bad,good job with benefits but poor management and lack of training provide to new hires prevent increases difficulty of the work and the position carries a large amount responsibility
bad,"Poor management, lack of employees, cashier had to do maintenance work, favoritism, not organized, a lot of call ins, breaks weren't on time, personel forced us to get direct deposit."
bad,When I first started working for them I didn't mind the craziness but ever since upper management changed hrs and days off aren't consistent. Also hardly get breaks on time and often times will be skipped.
bad,"Very busy,fasr paced enjoyed my customers some management was very fair and others not so much hardest part of job was dealing with angry customers most enjoyable part of job was solving their problems"
bad,"Wal-Mart is what you think it would be like and that is very good at first but then, it goes downhill. Most nights you're by yourself with 5 or 6 plus pallets with no signs of help to come for the rest of the shift. The managers are nice people but overall doesn't know how to run people rather so the company. Nice pay, very good and respectful people to work with, and above mediocre benefits. Would recommend for an high school graduate juggling college and a 9 to 5."
bad,"The work is not bad at all,new management is racist. His goal is to make the distribution Center I to a 3rd psrty company with an affiliate temp service from his home town. He's firing Good managers as well as associates."
bad,"Overall, Walmart is a good job to have, but the ever-changing hours and overly abrasive entitlement of the customer's can make this job very stressful and is a testament to one's daily patience."
bad,"Late shift that was moved to become a later shift"
bad,My review of the job need better management and better customer services  work for this job I came every day on time 1 call in my 2 yrs of working there
bad,"Maintenance I learned to scrub, buffer, wax floors, restrooms. Hardest was clearing out under shelves. People gossip a lot, and management was alright"
bad,I found working at walmart the managers are unfair. they don't care about their employees at all. all that matters is that the work gets done. nobody was ever happy going into work there.
bad,A typical day at work consists of constantly moving and being under pressure to get people to apply for credit cards. I learned how to in every department in Walmart. Management is a bit harsh. Workplace culture is alright. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is lunch.
bad,"Performed tasks for Online Grocery Pickup as a Personal Shopper."
bad,"I've been working there for the past 3 years ,it's a good place to work at , just temporary , but not a place where you can grow from. Management team is ok."
bad,"A typical day at work would be making sure that any special orders or ring sizing orders be processed during the morning because they are shipped off by UPS. Make sure that you have money in your register to start you shift. I then would check in any freight that may have come in on the Walmart truck from the night before. I would wait on customers, check in any freight that may arrive by FedEx and process the stolen merchandise and write up any defected merchandise. Working for the company it's diverse everyone is treated fairly and equal. The hardest part of the job would be sometimes when replacing a battery in a watch the backs be hard to come off and you have to work a little harder to get it off. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. Always treat the customer with respect."
bad,I have had a amazing experience working for Walmart. Get along and have amazing time working with my co workers. As a overall I find this job rated low on the income scale I find it hard to make ends meet on the minimum wage they pay.
bad,"The job was personally very stressful. This company did not take care of their employees or back them up on their policies. Benefits were the minimum, no sick days, no paid vacation. The company is unorganized and management was awful."
bad,Wal-Mart isn't a place that is easy. The manager I had at the time was inconsiderate. Didn't care about if you had a medical condition. Only how much work they could get from you. Only great thing was helping customers and new faces
bad,Its an ok place to work at . Do what your suppose to do to the managements expectations and you will do great . Be friendly and out spoken and you will move up very fast and have an open availability .
bad,"If you're looking for an honest employer that will offer a consistent paycheck and a basic set of routine goals to accomplish on a weekly basis, you've picked the right company."
bad,"Walmart is always short staffed on cashiers and doesn't give breaks on time. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and the customers, but not pushing customers to apply for company credit cards."
bad,The people that are on the same level as you at wal-mart are great and usually pretty friendly. Some of the managers were nice but others were definitely not.
bad,"Management here is awful. No organization or Management skills. Salary management needs to lead by example and get the proper training needed. Too many boss's and not enough leaders,"
bad,A very strong company that utilizes large buying power to provide goods for customers. A typical day at work starts at 8am-8pm or 8pm-8am.  I was well trained and gained much experience from the company. The culture is guided toward low end promotions low end raises for the hourly associates.
bad,Stock items as needed throughout the store. A fair amount of work is expected of associates. Day flies by because there is always something to on the sales floor or in the back room.
bad,You would have to be desperate to work there. Low pay not many hours. Our boss was hard to work for. They had very shady work policies not a good place to work..
bad,"I loved working here when I started, then Sam Walton died and all his values went with him. I learned a lot about the retail business. Management plays favoritism with their favorites. I loved the culture, people from everywhere. customer service was my favorite part of the job."
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of getting customers in and out in an orderly manner. I learned that you can't please all of the customers. Management is horrible. They don't seem like that they truly care about their employees and what they have going on in their lives. Workplace culture is relaxed but alot of times, it can be stressful due to management constantly getting onto their employees. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to talk with many different people from all walks of life."
bad,The potential to grow at Walmart is very minimual. Also harder as a women. They treat there associates rough with beniefits. It is a great starter job foe entry level cashier.
bad,"As an APM I was salary, my days off were split and almost every week my Manager (not the store manager) would schedule us for training on our days off.  Upper Asset Protection management was too concerned with corporate and would not allow any flexibility at the store level.  Corporate instituted a daily matrix to be followed down to your lunch break.  If you did not comply (even if there was a detention of a shoplifter) with the matrix you were written up."
bad,"Walmart hires people that are prone to violent crimes, addicts, are abusive, are passive aggressive, and that harass other employees.  There isn't a code of ethics at the store I work at.  Most employees are haters, unconvicted criminals, , gang/club members, and/or toxic.  A lot of people get paid when they aren't working, which affects the hours you get.  The abusive people victimize employees.  Then the abuser makes the victim think that they're, the victims, are the abusive one.  Walmart is a violent place to work. Physical intimidation, scapegoating, abuse,.lies, manipulation, and lazyness is what I deal with at work."
bad,"Working for Wal-Mart has never been very fun. The hours are flexible, which is about the only positive thing I can think of. It has been years since I've been here so maybe it has improved."
bad,"Hired for one area, but you better believe, you will work anywhere as needed each day you clock in and your rate of pay stays the same as you do so. Hourly wages alone didnt pay all my bills in a month, then hours were cut every quarter when it was time to receive a bonus, it was never extra money. I worked part time for almost 2 years always being told no full time positions were available (therefore I had no benefits). And store was under staffed."
bad,At Walmart the work environment was pretty good because got to meet new people and helping new people on a day-to-day basis manager  was a very unfairly
bad,"Under payed, under staffed, over worked, under appreciated. Constantly getting put down or yelled at through your walkie when you are in a management position. They make you do other associates jobs when they are understaffed instead of hiring more employees because Walmart will only allow management to give so many hours even if they are managing a high traffic store that requires a lot of employees. It can be extremely stressful to work at Walmart unless you're a cashier or door greeter."
bad,"Do not consider if you're coming out of gr.12, Only consider if you're in high school, people are trying to retire from this place and is upsetting to see them so trapped by this companies terrible benefits, and wages."
bad,Walmart is a great place for someone who is just starting off in the work environment. As for the drama it makes the workplace uncomfortable for a workplace that should be professional.
bad,I hate this place it is the worst place to work. They may not all be terrible but this one was. There was so much favoritism and also unprofessionalism it was insane. Absolutely terrible.
bad,"Sales floor tasks (daily routines)."
bad,"Its retail and customer service, you have to expect the varying hours and high stress environment when dealing with the public directly. Holidays and weekend are their busiest time, dont expect to get those days off."
bad,"It's a good area to start a part time job with. It's good f"
bad,I worked both walmart and sams club and the managers just didn't seem to care about their employees. it was high stress and they were not okay with overtime if you didn't finish your project you would get in trouble for not finishing.
bad,"Standing long hours"
bad,They don't care if you've been injured or subjected to a personal loss; the managers are rude to the employees and have no problem making you feel as though you will never advance unless you do your job and other people's jobs.
bad,"This is a great place to shop, but in experience this is the one of the worst companies to work for. They speak INTEGRITY, yet management doesn't apply this except for when it comes to firing associates. Management does not look out for you; they will throw you under the bus in order to rise for themselves. Ive never seen such a disgrace in my life."
bad,"management is horrible the cleanliness is horrible I have pictures to show they have bed bugs, roaches and rats that roam the store when their is a visit from corporate they hide everything in the empty trailers on the dock it is crazy associates get wrote up for going to lunch late even if it is from helping a customer they say they don't care. don't care about the health of associates. under pay use but want us to do your job plus management job"
bad,"Walmart starts out making you think its the greatest company in the world, and then you find out it's not what it's made out to be.  When the original owners had the company it was so much more interesting and now it's just another bottom line is the only thing that matters."
bad,management doesn't follow company policy and they play favorites. advancements is hard to get at Walmart. employees are great and you learn a lot about product and how to fix things. hardest part of working at Walmart is having to stay on management to fix things and how they look down on you. most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers and talking about products and servies with my fellow employees. over all Walmart pays ok and good people to work with but management sucks all around.
bad,"You will typically be stocking inventory, cleaning, or checking people out at the point of sale. Occasionally someone will ask for your opinion but normally, with it being Walmart, they already have a good idea of exactly what they want before coming in to buy something and only need help finding it."
bad,"work as team ,smile, safety,take care of cutomer, work hard, in time,do your best ,be your self, hard time ... return item . joyful holly day party!!!"
bad,they were not to friendly after I was told to move back to Fl then they refused to take me in.  When I first started working there it was a great place to work.  Management started to change and things went down hill.  Its sad because it started out like family.
bad,The work itself isn't hard at all its just the dealing of other employee's and management. It'shard to get the off days and vacations. You'll be able to pick up way more hours around Christmas.
bad,constantly being berated by management. Do tasks multiple times just to undo them.  constantly being chewed out for not getting your department responsibilities done and then getting chewed out for not doing the neighboring departments responsibilities.  Spending hours on a register do to being short staffed without being register trained.
bad,Management was very unhelpful my time there and didn't care about the employees. They only cared about the completion of the job and when corporate came to visit. nothing special happening here
bad,"The management is terrible. Supervisors try to take breaks before cashiers get theirs even though cashiers are suppose to get theirs first. You also have to wait for a supervisor to relieve from register or until another cashier replaces you, some times that will not be till 15 minutes after you should have clocked out. Only one cashier on third shift at a time, some times two or even none. Depending on what store you are working at, there tends to be a lot of customers at night during the first half of the month. Once my knee had swelled to the size of a soft ball and was in very excruciating pain. Tried to go home and they talked me into going to ER. After words I was treated like I lied, even though they talked me into going to the ER. They brought it up not me. Stores are also generally filthy."
bad,Wasn't able to use the policies as directed when difficulties did arise with management. Employees were nice and some weren't. Also wasn't given enough proper time to finish classes which were required
bad,"Walmart has terrific opportunities to develop better relationships with customers and employees through creating an atmosphere that is good for communication.   "
bad,"la empresa es buena para continuar estudiando ya que te apoyan con los horarios."
bad,Good company to work for. A lot of hours with fair wages. 10% walmart gift card . No benefits if you are part time. A lot of standing and walking. Managers can be friendly some are a power trip.
bad,"Though it is easy to get promoted, but, you are not given the proper training that you were promoted for. Basically, you will fail and held responsible for your actions"
bad,Walmart was laid back and easy. I worked in frozen dairy and had a list of tasks to do when I got there that usually didn't differ too much. The management was kind for the most part but I think even after a year of working there most managers still didn't even know my name.
bad,"Walmart can be a mundane thankless job or a rewarding place to work, its really a roll of the dice."
bad,i enjoy the company of all the customers who would come up and conversate with all of us. I also enjoy the crew i work with. i learn how to be patient with the job at task. the pharmacy manager was great. i love her and hate to leave her. the hardest part of my job was when we would have a customer to die or get really sick. and the best part was when we could help someone save money on there script
bad,"I have worked as a pharmacist with this company for 9 years, and have worked with them for a total of 11 years.  I had to take a leave of absence due to a serious health issue.  Supposed to have one year of job protection. Now hours are cut and no job to bring me back.  My DM is horrible and takes weeks to call me back.  Complete lack of empathy from this company."
bad,"The job its self was fine, I actually like the demanding physical part of it all I didn't mind working with costumers. "
bad,"As an optician I get payed very well but management is awful because no one wants to do their job. Extreme attitudes. And corporate is only focused on making money, not the wellbeing of employees."
bad,Walmart gives jobs to people who need it and the way jobs are hard to find if your looking for a permanent job it's a great place to start learning to work with customers and Learning stock and how to work as a team and helping customers !
bad,"Spend a great deal of time ensuring proper operations in the front of the store. Provides change for cashiers, prepares cash registers and performs register audits. When customers have a concern regarding the price of an item or an advertisement, address their concern according to Wal-Mart's policies. Approve bank cards or checks, address any register shortage concerns and train employees. Additionally, sets an example for other employees by practicing proper safety protocol, such as proper lifting techniques and removal of spills and debris from register areas"
bad,"The benefits were amazing they truly were, now depending on which manager you had really determined what kind of day you would have, you had some manager's who would allow you to finish one task at a time and then you had other's that would make you stop every 5 min to start on a new one and god for bid you opened your mouth about it."
bad,Walmart overall is a good company....but it has alot of work to do on the store side.  Alot of changes happening all the time....sometimes hard to keep up.   Need more consistency in the workplace.
bad,Walmart is a decent place to work as long as there aren't a lot of responsibilities outside of work. Trying to balance a large family and working overtime doesn't work well.
bad,"I have a disability and my CSM continually harassed me and numerous other associates. Management did nothing, despite complaints against said CSM. The store was also painstakingly hot with customers and associates complaining everyday. Some of which would get sick. Management did nothing to fix it. Apparently it has been an ongoing problem for about 7 years. Corporate was contacted and turned it over to the store to handle instead of handling it themselves. Of course, the store did not handle it."
bad,"I really enjoyed working there but after being promoted, I saw that there was no organization in the management department. It was upsetting, seeing as how hard I worked to get to where I was positioned. I am a team player and their attitudes were not the same."
bad,Working at Wal-Mart can earn you spot of money but there are many politics within the company also. It doesn't matter how much education or experience you have you will get overlooked if you don't know the right people. The work load is too heavy and eventually you will have to choose between sacrificing your home life for the money you can possibly make.
bad,I like working here but I don't see myself making a career here. I would like to do something in the field that I am studying which is medical off assistant.
bad,"Definitivamente desarrollas el sentido de urgencia en tomo momento, ante todas las situaciones adversas aprendes a ver el como si de los resultados positivos y no lo contrario."
bad,"On a good day, we are fully staffed and able to achieve the company goals set for us. On our usual days we lack in staffing, management is available occasionally to help, the remaining time is spent attempting to make up for our lack off staff meant to be stocking. Our direct supervisors, while good at their jobs are used for tasks indirect with our prioritized tasks. The job is physically exhausting, and for the lack of healthcare provided, feels unsatisfying for the lack of pay to make up for the lack of care."
bad,At first it was okay working for Walmart. But then it started feeling like I was going to high school again. People were spreading rumors and making things up about other people. And I don't think the problem ever got solved. That's why I left.
bad,"-A typical day of work at Walmart for me varied from day to day. Usually I would start off by doing my normal job which consisted of going around my areas, which was assigned to me by my Support Manager, and making sure everything on the shelves were in order and pulled forward along with making sure nothing hazardous was on the floor or on the shelves themselves while also putting merchandise back where it belonged and of course making sure every customer was finding what they were looking for. Usually either at the beginning or halfway through my shift I would be called on my walkie talkie to come up and help cashier when the lines were getting long, I would usually be up there for about 4 or 5 hours if not more out of my 9 hour shift which sometimes was very upsetting to me because most of the time I would never be left with enough time to go back and finish the zones my Support Manager gave me often leaving me with either having to stay late or go home leaving an unfinished job. "
bad,overall good work environment and the days go by very quickly.the sanitation of the work spaces could be better. most of the management was nice and fair.
bad,"Been a manager at Walmart for years now and it is only getting worse. They preach work life balance to new hires, but fully expect management to make miracles from nothing. Limited management in stores are running around all day, unlocking doors, talking to customers, overriding transactions, holding meetings, listening to conference calls... given very little time in their assigned departments to actually do what they need to, then reprimanded when things are not complete as should be. The pay seems great, but not for what you put in! Management will work at MINIMUM 10 hour days 5x per week, with never a chance to sit and take an hour lunch as promised in orientation. Management is forced to make their associates happy and bend over backwards for everything they want, yet no one above the assistant managers are looking out for their level."
bad,Working there for 5 years I was working hard for advancement but very tough to go higher than what I was as a support manager. Management team  I worked was not very professional and treated most employees unfairly
bad,"I can't say a whole lot of what I liked about Walmart, but I will say this, they taught me how to decorate cakes. That was something I had always wanted to learn.I liked the people and management at the store I worked at, however when I transferred to a different store, I was not happy at all. You have absolutely no life when you work at a Walmart store. They pretty much control how your life goes. I will say though, the benefits are excellent and the pay is really good, and you do get regular raises, and plenty of opportunities to advance."
bad,I work in so many places in the store. There was so much to do all over the store. I enjoyed being a manager for a little while. It was so much fun! Management was not so good back then.
bad,"If Wal-Mart were the alphabet, then they would be letter a. Not because they are necessarily awesome, but because it's 'first job' type place with no diverse career prospects."
bad,working at walmart is like any other job you have good days and bad days it was what you made of it. Very stressful at times when higher management are not up to speed.The hardest part of the job is everyone being on the same schedule an handle the correct business.
bad,"Easy to move around within the company, not easy if time off is needed. Everyone is so kind to work with personally, but corporate is a big issue, store level is nice though."
bad,only reason i leaving or would love to leave is because they are not willing to work with my avaibility and its only something tempoary but still wont work with me
bad,"Wal-Mart managers pick and choose who they look out for, even if the employee is horrible, they'll get a promotion and have you work their way, and when their way fails, you are terminated, and another ant is hired to replace you."
bad,This job as a night time stocker was ok. It was more of a job I needed to get to pass the time. The hours were flexible so that was one of the pros I like.
bad,"A fast paced job.Assist customers. Ring up and bag customers merchandise. I learned customer Service.  Hardest Part of job, rude customers.Enjoyable part of job new merchandise that helps store acquire more business."
bad,"You're incredibly under appreciated and valued. The company has some horrendous business practices like cutting benefits even to people who worked 10+ years for ""ensuring reduced prices"". It's a company that cares little for it's employees and cares more about maximizing profit margins."
bad,"A typical day was long, stressful and unorganized. "
bad,"A typical day at work was hectic and unreliable. Horribly understaffed  to the point that customers could not be served to the best of our ability, as there were simply not enough workers to help. Management was flawed, and was hard to contact for means to serve customers. Beneficial as an entry level job and to gain experience in customer service, however."
bad,"hours are good you work 4 10 hour days Tuesday-Friday everything else is bad. I asked my manager, my managers manager, HR manager AND assistant general manager for help with my current job over the course of 4  months and I was told its not there problem."
bad,Customer service to help customers get what they need.  Job was not hard.  Making customers happy with their shopping experience.  Meet people and have a productive day.
bad,"The management personnel are good and responsive."
bad,Your average day it was always  a busy hectic day especially on sales or special and holidays. I enjoyed helping customers with their needs. Learning the newest trend in technology in tvs and mobile devices.
bad,"Every workday is a stressful one. Whether it's because of too many customers or because there is nothing to do and management gives you mundane tasks to do. Some of my co-workers are great while some are very negative and make it a sad work environment. "
bad,"very appreciative for the job; however, the management and employees could be a lil more professional. i work hard and do as i ma told but i am read to explore other options and seek better employment."
bad,"Employee's are friendly, Fast paced work environment. Management slacks. Customer service very helpful. Customer service managers willing to help. Very strict on attendance."
bad,Learned a lot of social and customer service skills. Really got to work on time management  and work on my multitasking under a certain time frame too.
bad,"Good company to work for. Very structured, very strick. The pay should be higher since many workers are required to do more than one position. An overall great place to work"
bad,"Worked here as a minor, worked without a store manager for months, no opportunity to change to cashier while they kept hiring new cashiers, too strict on meal regulations. Managers played favoritism and the gossip everywhere controlled everything. Didn't enjoy working here as a minor"
bad,"Wal-mart is not the company to work for if you want advancement or relocate. They find reasons to coach you and fill that the customer is always right. They tell us to go by one rule, but if a customer complains just to get something at a lower price, or no charge at all they will do it."
bad,Management have favorites and if you are not in their list..good luck..because they will look at any reason to fire you. They treat people as they feel like. Not as a profesional management way. They dont follow rules. And with no body else backing you up. Its not a good feelings.
bad,Its a fine place to work. Challenging and exciting and associates are good to work with. Very busy and keeps you thinking all the time. Learned alot about supervising associates.
bad,"A experiencia na empresa agregou meu conhecimento sobre processos logisticos e um bom lugar pra trabalhar mas não oferece crescimento profissional,há muitas coisas pregadas que não é empregada a cultura da empresa. "
bad,Management stumbles over each other telling the worker bees to do different things at the same times. There is little to no organization and there is no job security at all. Workers have no voice when it comes to anything and management stinks at scheduling.
bad,"I worked long hours, running back and forth for customers. I was on my feet all day. I don't usually have a problem, but I never really felt appreciated. I was thrown up front into the CSS position and never felt fully educated on the process and all of the responsibilities that come with the front end."
bad,"My last day they put me in a department I didnt know once again. Told me nothing and left me to figure it out. Which would be fine but it was makeup and all of the makeup looked the same. Turns out there was a code on every box which helps you find its home. I only figured this out a hour later. Right around when my shift ends they pull me in to a office and tell me im fired. For apparently being late to many times. They said I was apparently only allowed to be 7mins late. Even tho when I started working they told me and the others 10mins. Not only that, many other people had done no call no shows and had not been punished and I worked either harder or just like they did and just fired."
bad,"It's alright, worked there for a while and it was okay, didnt mind it getting busy all the time but just felt that there weren't much benefits ......."
bad,"clear floor of stock from overnight inventory and bin the cap and pull any item that shows it will go onto the floor learned how to use MC40 and printer how to change labels. Learned how to build a mod for new products, cashier and maintenance also deli"
bad,"Walmart is a great environment to work in, all of the co-workers are great people, but the actual job and corporation is stressful due to expectations and lowered benefits over time. Over the years, expect your 'benefits' to slowly disappear. "
bad,"Good job, has lots of expectations from workers. Will always be given shifts, at a consistent rate. Stock merchandise, according to the daily plan. Would often be required to work at different sections that i wasn't hired for."
bad,"Great people work there, I made great friends. Walmart is flexible with your schedule but they are making many changes in the company. I dont recommend working at Walmart."
bad,"Wal-Mart needs to learn and practice the butterfly effect. It's like a row of dominoes you knock down one and they all fall. If your manager is having a bad day I guarantee they will take it out on you. It will go all the way down the line until it reaches the customer. My 7 years there I learned that Wal-Mart doesn't appreciate and undervalues hard workers. For the most part I enjoyed most my time there but that can quickly change depending on who your taking orders from. The pay is not all that great. I feel if workers were treated fairly there, that they would have a more successful business and associates would stay longer."
bad,I enjoyed working with the people at the store but Wal-Mart wasn't for me. Very boring and low pay. I did gain valuable customer service experience though.
bad,"not a great place to work, work you over your scheduled time, but don't want to pay you overtime compensation, rather for you to take an extended lunch break."
bad,You have to work all the time. They don't care if you have a family emergency or get ill. If you become ill and have a doctors excuse it will still count against your attendance.
bad,Es un buen empleo para comenzar pero el ambiente laboral es muy fustrante y en lo personal existe mucha mediocridad en ese wmpleo ya que exigen demasiado y pagan poco
bad,"depending on the department you work in, if you're cash or on the front end you will hate it because the management is awful and trying to get time off is hard. if your work as a sales floor associate stocking and doing mods, you'll love your slack job and cool co-workers. if you're a female applying, they automatically put you on cash, if you're a male they stick you on store standards."
bad,In the section I worked in the manager never had any plans of what to do throughout the work day. They never had enough of the supplies that the costumers needed and wanted.
bad,Some workers was good and worked good but the manegers in charge some had there head up their butts i worked over 40 hours and was denied insurance and they dont have much of a mind
bad,"Walmart has great stock and benefit options, so long term employment can really pay off.  Having said this, the immediate pay is on the low side.  Unfortunately the company does have a propensity to cut employee hours in order to maximize company profits.  However, if you can work around this, their stock options can be quite lucrative for long term planning."
bad,"Typically, the management tells people what they want done. unfortunately, they do not allocate people to compensate for two person jobs. The management often switches duties from one to the other causing them to be at odds on what the entry level employees need to be doing. The conflict causes the different departments to have a disrupted flow of productivity. The only good thing about the job is that there is so much to do that time flies by real fast."
bad,Productive and very outgoing work place very nice and friendly outspoken and a lot of smiling faces in a happy person with a great personality I love to work I been down for a lil while now but I know what I have to do in life to get where I'm trying to go I enjoy being around people and great sense of humor
bad,"Maquinarias en mal estado hace mucho tiempo, presentando un riesgo real para el trabajador, pero eso daba igual porque habia que vender sea como sea. Jefe no aporta en nada y por lo demás ejerce presiones para vender inclusive productos en mal estado. No se respetan los horarios y tampoco hay seguridad personal, ya que ocurrieron ciertos robos a personal del mismo local."
bad,i only worked here part time not really much to say but management waasnt really good but it really just depends on what you make of it i was only part time
bad,"atmosphere unprofessional at times"
bad,"We're all just numbers and the share holders have to get their money."
bad,"Weird work days , sometimes 4 hour days, best to work overnight there rather than the day. 15 minute breaks are closely monitored most of the time. Overall if you need a job and don't care what kind this is the place to go"
bad,"I faced shelves, stocked shelves, unloaded truck, and pulled freight. I liked the job and coworkers, but I didn't like the managers or the company itself. Walmart emphasizes on treating customers really well and I completely agree, But when it comes to the actual employees Walmart could care less."
bad,I worked for Walmart for nearly three years and received three raises during that time.  Immediate supervisors were very accommodating in terms of listening to ground level associates.
bad,I think they should get rid of their point system because the employees really could be sick or someone died and they still give them points. Its dumb
bad,"Second job I've ever had and I've applied to the job about a year or so ago until I got the job. Couple of months now and I thought Walmart was really somewhat of a decent store until I started working for them. Associates are given barely any tools to work with, store is also understaffed, wages are definitely not worth to what you're working for. I feel bad for people who have a five year, ten year, fifteen year badge from Walmart because it's NOT something to be proud of."
bad,"not well compensated, managers don't care about you're life outside of the store. All they want you to do is come to work, my wife was having contractions 5 minutes apart and they told me to come in or I would be fired. Not a great place to work at all."
bad,"Walmart is hated by most the community, they are unorganized and have terrible communication skills they do not have very good management and was overall just a poor place to work."
bad,I love it because I got to help people. See a lot of people of all kinds. Everybody was important. Liked the team work everybody really work as a team and got a lot done by doing so.
bad,Nothing much to say. Job was pretty much cut and dry. Great people to work with. Management was never really breathing down your back and allowed you to perform at your job.
bad,I've been working at Wal-Mart for two weeks. I've lacked the encouragement and direction needed from my coworkers but also my supervisors. I've been talked to disrespectfully by my supervisor despite trying my best to learn the job and trying to figure things out on my own. I've felt that I have had little help learning the process and am already unhappy with the job.
bad,Do your best because it's a job. Most enjoyable part of the job was lunch and breaks. The company doesn't seem to care as much about their employees as they once did.
bad,"On a typical day of work, I am running around trying to work out the clothing that comes in. Constantly working on paper work and attending meetings. Always helping customers. The hardest part of the job would be when the work of four people gets piled on to one person. The thing that I enjoy the most about my job is working out all of the hanging clothing and really owning what I do."
bad,Management there have no time to talk or train properly.  Great incentives to get extra pay.  Hard work people that is what I like about the company.Thank you
bad,"Clocking in, going to your station and signing in. Learned a lot on cashier and customer service. CSM were helpful if they were around. hardest was working late hours and standing in place all day."
bad,I'm a very productive person . I like to stick to the task that's give to me at had . Even if it's needed to be done in a timely manner I cause work my hardest to make sure it's don't and not incomplete . I'm willing to try new things in the work nature and open to meeting new people .
bad,For the most part the job was okay the people I worked with were great the hours were okay and the different duties made the day go fast. Trying to keep up with the ordering was a challenge some days and when the staff was sick it was hard to fill the spots but we managed to work through it.
bad,"A typical work day included doing more than our job description. The bonuses for our hard work wasn't the best, but it was a nice gesture. No matter what the employees became a family."
bad,"Perhaps it was just that particular Walmart or maybe the job wasn't a good fit, but I did learn some lessons about where I was at and where I wanted to go.  In addition, I picked up new skills"
bad,"The first week working at Walmart was great.  As time progressed people began to reveal their real character.  Again I love working with the public but arguments & petty fights only got worse over the next 7 months by the 7th month July a certain few turned on me.  Anytime management permits workers to argue, nick pick & point fingers on a daily basis eventually the work environment will sour.  Either a person takes on the same trait or suffer the consequences. I don't remember any of those people being my siblings so No I'm like any of them. Alberta was hired to do a job & to be compensated as Alberta. I don't come from that kinda work environment so things didn't go well by the 7th month."
bad,"Wal-mart is a good starter job for retail but the management at that particular location was a major factor in the high turnover rate. My favorite part of the job was going out to the parking lot and cleaning up all the trash and emptying the trash bins, then bringing in all the shopping carts."
bad,"I usually had an okay day, keeping in mind that customer is right and comes first.  Management helped out when needed, schedules were a complaint I heard a lot of."
bad,Wal~Mart has excellent pay but not full time employees and no benefits. They took away your vacation and personal time. Never enough help. Poor management.
bad,"When i first started at walmart, it was great the people were nice and everything was fine. but the longer i was there the more stressful it became. The mangament wouldnt help when my area needed it and it seemed like the co-workers didnt get along with each other. people would come to work with frowns. "
bad,empresa que exige muito do funcinário fazendo com que realize tarefas que não é de sua obrigação
bad,I have been working at this company for 3 years and so far I have seen that it has a high turnover rate and there is limited opportunity for career advancement.
bad,Walmart sucked as a place to work it is completely unorganized. The management team was not very knowledgable however still wanted you to know and perform
bad,Enjoyed working for this company. I learned a lot. I had a lot of hands on training in the bakery. I also got a chance to meet a lot of amazing people.
bad,Overall my experience at Walmart hasn't been that great.  For the past two years when raises have been given out I received a cost of living raise which nullified the great reviews I was getting.  Then as I was slowly working my way up the payscale suddenly I found my hours being cut to bare minimum for a full time associate for over a half a year.  Overall it's been a disappointing experience and has made me decide I need to look for a better job.
bad,"It's a first job for a kid. It shouldn't be a long term position. It teaches you to interact with customers and how to manage your time. Beyond that it's just a basic job, not a career."
bad,One of the most unorganized places I have ever been to or worked at ever in my life. They had me at cashier but then have me pushing carts doing stocking and a lot of other things. This is also a great place to meet new people and gain people skills.
bad,"alot of staff quit or get fired within 2 months only some managment want to do there job. associates do more work then a mangers position making 10.00 hr. there are alot of good things about working at walmart. you get good benefits, wages, and discounts."
bad,I really liked the job but management of meat department didnt listen to you and had a teenager that was there only 2 montha train me and walmart is a very busy store we sometimes had 2 people working in meat department and they always called my helper somewhere else and i got so far behind all the time
bad,I can confidently say that the time I spent at Walmart was almost nightmarish.  Management usually always held a better than you demeanor and expected you to do more than was humanly possible.  It was an all around terrible work experience.
bad,"A typical day included filling prescriptions, checking customers out, helping customers locate medications, and answering the phones. I learned many things including what some medications are used for, pronunciation of medicines, and started to learn how to input scripts in the computers. The hardest part of the job is seeing some customers not being able to afford their medications they need. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to help people out."
bad,"pay is reasonable to the work required. Training is something you have to seek out. Management is there for themselves and more than willing to throw you under the bus to save themselves. Culture was great 10 to 15 years ago when I 1st started slowly loosing that culture. hardest part of the job was getting up in the morning knowing you you were heading in to bust your rump and received little to no gratitude or respect. Veterans beware, Walmart's hire a Vet initiative is a PR stunt to make them look better to the public. yes they will hire you but that's as far as it goes. There is nothing they do to retain you. Take it from a Vet that worked for Walmart for 15 years with little to no growth (and I promise you its not because i didn't grow). You better know someone or be related to someone to get anywhere with this company"
bad,é o seguinte a empresa em si é boa mas existem muitas pessoa dentro dela que não se esforçam tanto quanto outra e são enxergadas ajudadas enquanto as que enxergão o que precisa ser feito e fazem mas abrem os olhos de quem não está fazendo nada passam por erradas houve várias negligências por partes e você tenta resolver tudo sózinho e outras partes não vêem então você se esforça por todos mas nunca foi reconhecido como aqueles que mais puxam saco que mesmo trabalham e vivem em grupos ao invés de se dar bem com todos é isso.
bad,My communication skills have most definitely progressed since working with Wal-Mart customers and employees. I done met a lot of great people. It take's great chemistry and team effort to get the job done at Wal-Mart.
bad,There are many things you will learn but expect to deal with many difficult individuals and situations because this company id full of them.
bad,"Your management does not care about you, they are straw bosses. You will work your rear end off and they will throw you under the boss when it is convenient. You are expected to be 100% committed, but they will never have your back. The pay is enticing...the conditions are terrible. This is literally 800 people out for themselves, with some hooking each other up at the expense of everyone else. 'Walmart Integrity' is preached, but the truth is, there is none."
bad,Stock shelves coolers check dates zone products i learned how to use mc40's and telson's some managers are ok others are not fully certified to be a manager the hardest part of the job is being short staffed the most enjoyable part of the job is truck nights
bad,"This company has invested a lot money on associates for them to have an opportunity at advancing with in the chain of command. The idea is great but its not enforced at store level ( at least 3 that i know). I mean the company is good, the pay is good, and the opportunities are great its just needs for corporate to focus more in the salary managers since some are missed informed and have outrageous power trips."
bad,I enjoyed Wal-Mart for a while. Its been quite stressful lately and very understaffed. If better management was available it would be a good place to work. Without good management everything else falls apart.
bad,"Most of the management there are alright to work with, although not without it's difficult people to work with. All together, however, a good place to work for."
bad,"Its your typical entry level retail position, it only depends what department youre in. The managers are quick to tell you what to do and never assist. They are forever understaffed, and the hardest workers are left to work the hardest while slackers are ignored."
bad,It an Ok job it paid the bills. Good coworker nice customer whenever you meet one. It was like my third job and it it was better then my previous jobs I had. So over all it was a good job.
bad,yeah dont know what to say it is what it is and its Walmart nothing special just a job no one really wants to work there at least not for long no time off.
bad,"When you first start its great, But over time you see the favoritism and everyone treats you differently. Management also is quick to want to get rid of you if you dont do what they say."
bad,"I liked working in the deli, I had the opportunity to learn about the different product and deli equipment that i hadn't worked with before. nice work environment that was very fast pace. as long as everybody worked as a team, the day when smoothly without much supervision. immediate deli manger was more like a friend then a manager in the way she corrected us for our mistakes and was interested in our home life."
bad,"a typical work day was the exact same everyday. I didn't learn too much here and the management was terrible. was never able to get to them when needed. they were always behind closed doors and if not they weren't on the clock, in a ""meeting"" or on ""break"""
bad,"The management were condescending and unprofessional, and expected lower-level associates to carry on managerial tasks...but without the due differential. Customers were very rude. Co-workers were very gossipy and were lazy overall (exempt of those whom have been working there for several years). I gave this job 2 stars because the pros outweigh the cons of accepting a job offer from this retail giant."
bad,"It was a job, and at the time I needed one. It is not a place for anyone that wants a career or wants to support a household. It is geared towards people looking for a part time job our highschool kids wanting to make some extra money."
bad,As much as I did not enjoy working at walmart it wasnt to bad of a job. Even though they over worked us there I do enjoy not running out of things that i can be doing because it makes my days go so much faster.
bad,"My typical workday starts with vendors bringing in products for the store I have to make sure the items they have on the invoice matches to what I have to check in along with the amount, I learn something new each day as for management that's a whole different ballgame. I get along with everyone there's no hard part and you get to learn how to correct a mistake that you made on your own"
bad,"Management at wal-mart is bothersome. a typical day consist of doing whatever management wants you to do wether its run cash registers, stock shelves, or set up displays."
bad,It was a good experience easy to move up in the company. Flexible schedule. Great co workers. Pay wasn't as great for the amount of work being done. Walmart
bad,"The job is not stressful but the management needs to improve especially in communicating to employees. When approached for information, managers hardly know what to say."
bad,I've had fun but its just the hours man always changing and you can almost never get the schedule you really need without losing something. I like my people I like most of my managers but theres a lot to be desired about this company.
bad,"walmart is a great place to learn how to work, learn how. but not a carree if you come in with out a degree. if you have a degree you can move up very quickly because of the high turn over rate."
bad,Walmart is not a productive workplace and management is not conducive. It was very unprofessional and a lot of favoritism was shown.
bad,"While working here, I felt as if everything was very chaotic and disorganized.  This was mainly due to management.  Throughout the night, I would be working on completing a task and was told that I could take a thirty minute break any time between two and three by my shift manager.  I wanted to get the task done and then head to break.  When I did this, I was reprimanded and made to feel like a complete idiot for not taking a break at 2 am on the dot like everyone else did.  I was not allowed to have any sort of beverage out on the sales floor which is a bad thing as I have blood sugar issues and need to keep my blood sugar level up to keep in top performance for the job.  Information I needed to know was convenietly being withheld from me and I was lied to several times on the job.  I absolutely hated how little the higher ups seemed to care about the people working there.  Tasks were to be completed within a rather unreasonable time table."
bad,"A typical day at work was fine . I didn't learn anything . management doesn't know how hard it is to do the position for 5 hours . co workers great people to work with . the hardest part of the job would be working a Saturday since it was the busiest day of the week."
bad,"I unload trailers, process stock pallets, hand stack cases on pallets,  well they put to much pressure on people to get their cases, people are to panic because the think they gonna to get fire."
bad,"What I Learned - merchandising, setting modulars, many different programs in the Gemini gun, different paperwork dealing with inventory and pricing, setting up for inventory and how to assume a leadership role. "
bad,In my opinion this would be an excellent place to work with proper management.  This was an great experience for me but due to poor management I wasn't able to fully experience Walmart
bad,"Rude Customers and Co-workers, long hours at unfavorable times. Management that didn't work to solve issues but would let them fester and get out of control, stiff regulations that didn't work well for the job."
bad,ive worked for this company for almost six years and let me say it does have job security and room for advancement but it seems to me that its favrortism
bad,"Working at Walmart has been quite the experience. Most of the employees and customers are nice, but it is management that is unfair to certain employees and they let their emotions get in the way of the job duties."
bad,A good place to work if you are in high school or retiring. Or maybe even going back to school. It can be fun if your interpersonal skills are good. Good place
bad,"Management is typically highly uninformed and sets unrealistic deadlines without ever actually having done or observe the work being done. Days are stressful, heavy lifting constantly, stores are always extremely understaffed. Sometimes there are supervisors who understand workloads and are realistic in terms of deadlines, but rarely. Coworkers are usually good people who want to help customers and other co-workers so job culture is good. Job advancement is almost entirely political and whoever is the favorite, not based on knowledge or work performance. The most enjoyable part of the job is customer interaction."
bad,I didn't like working there cause they kept scheduling me on my school days/ hours even though i told them my availability they would still schedule me. They also had me standing up by the door the whole time with out give me a chair to sit down sometimes.
bad,Walmart india is a very good multinational company for student...but salary is low and chances of promotion also low....
bad,"Its a Job that pays okay, Its not a fun place to work. A support Manager is a hourly lead that is over one whole side of the store."
bad,"The office I was apart of decided to hire a new risk management manager, He was very sexist and against women empowerment. the culture of the office was great until he arrived and completely demolished the associate moral"
bad,"While working in the electronics department, associates were expected to do tasks they were not hired or trained for. For example, activate prepaid cell phones and transfer information, operate the photo center, run layaway/pick up center as well as juggle normal tasks on top of waiting on customers and answering questions. Walmart no longer offers holiday pay and and working Thanksgiving is mandatory unless you take a PTO day. Call outs for funerals, family emergencies or any other serious incident is rarely excused.   Overall Walmart is an ok place to work, but needs help to be competitive with other retail establishments."
bad,Wal-Mart Corp can be a great company to work for if they were able to see good work ethics. Training and communication is a down side to this Corp. I think it depends on what market your in that you could def be successful.
bad,Overall its ok working there. No very fun i must say. Managers are not so bad they just expect the unexpected when it comes down to a heavey work day.
bad,"You can work on grocery, fresh produce,toys,electronics or even on a cash register. walmart has tons of positions along with shifts and benefits."
bad,"Hardest part of the job was working in a freezer for 9 hours, but the work was relatively easy. A typical day of work I would walk in complete my duties, clean necessary spills and help out my management. My co-workers were nice, but they came and left which made it hard to establish relationships with my team members. Overall I would have liked this job better if it was more outlined with rules and management was more engaged with our every night activities."
bad,Not an fun place to work. They expect too much and over works there employees. They standards of productivity level is too high..the demand of work is so high..
bad,"Not really a whole lot to say. Co-workers were great, management was confusing. I've never heard of a single position needing 6 managers. Harder to do a job when you get hired for one thing, but told to do 11 different jobs in in different departments."
bad,I enjoyed working at Wal mart because I am very organized and my job was to stock and organize the products. Every night was different depending on how much merchandise was received that day.
bad,New managment came in and cleaned house was even lied on a few times. advanced a few times but the walmart system of switching around mangment so often back fired on us
bad,Falta de compromiso con sus asocioados pero tiene buen abiemte laboral y las prestaciones son buenas
bad,I met many wonderful people but the management didn't seem to care. I was sexually harassed by one of my coworkers and when I reported it I was punished. They promoted the guy since he was friends with one of the managers.
bad,"I had a long employment with Walmart, and tho the advancement oppertunites were there, the stress that came along with the job is simply not worth it, with the pay they offer. The benefits are terrible, and the most difficult part of it all was the majority of people did not work very hard, and did not know much of anything and did not care to learn - they were there for a pay check and nothing more. The people who did know, care and work hard were the ones who does all the work, and gets held accountable. As a lead supervisor, I saw this far too often from my superiors."
bad,"you really have to have tough skin, the people are aggressive, however the associates are nice. There its good because you only do your job and your job only"
bad,That was an organized dirty just rude to but I managed to make it through just have to keep my head up and pretty much focus on the job that I came to do with the job
bad,Walmart was ok to work for.. more money and benefits would have been great.. lots of good people to work with..It was nice of them to put a Xmas dinner on for the workers.. The morning meetings were a little much but they were pretty fun..
bad,"When I worked here around 2014/2015 the management was terrible. I can't speak for now, but back then it was. The managers and supervisors weren't in sinc of proper procedures at the Providence location. The hours were great though, and they were very flexible with schedule changes/taking off. My coworkers were nice,and friendly as well."
bad,Fue muy grato pertenecer a una empresa de tal seriedad como walmart.
bad,Honestly the management at the Walmart was terrible I hated it and eventually I quit. I was threatened to get fired in front of numerous customers over calling in sick for having to work in the rain the day before because they didn't schedule enough people. So I'd say Walmart is the worst place you could ever work.
bad,"I loved my coworkers and the job was pretty tolerable for the most part. Basic tasks and I was able to accomplish most of them. However, management at my location was difficult to work with, were overly intimidating, and often made me nervous to speak with them, or not voice my concerns at all. I left voluntarily without two-weeks notice, and will never step foot back in that walmart."
bad,"Walmart was a fairly decent workplace, at least at the store that I worked at.  From other, more veteran employees who had worked at multiple locations, I understand that the overall experience depends heavily on which store you work at and the management at the store.  My store was high traffic, so there was a lot of work to be done on a day to day basis, but most of my managers and fellow employees were good people, with the exception of the store manager.  I worked in the stock room separating new freight by department so that it could be worked by the night shift, and almost every day was hard work in hot, cramped conditions.  The culture is heavily resistant to change and improvement, and most changes in the store layout and procedures come from corporate.  Maintenance on essential equipment (cardboard baler, trash compactor, floor scrubber, etc.) was slow to be implemented, in part because of inaction on the part of the management.  Essential maintenance supplies were slow to arrive.  For instance, we once waited almost six months for an order of mops to reach the store after they were presumably ordered.  Many departments within the store were understaffed, presumably to save money.  In my opinion, many of these shortcomings are because of a culture of cutting costs wherever possible, even when the associates and customer satisfaction suffer.  Job security is good, provided you show up to work on time and do your job.  Advancement is possible within the company, but it requires extensive dedication to the job at the expense of your personal life.  Managers routinely work"
bad,walamart managers suck  They don't work with your schedule . Managers wanted cashier to chase after shoplifters. need more hours base on your schedules
bad,Dealing and interacting with people every day is a great job. There was a very noticeable lack of management. My co-workers were great and made the day easy going.
bad,"With the roll-out of ""Just Culture"" October, 2015, Walmart has made all staff directly accountable for managerial errors. If the manager keeps breaking SOP (although informed by staff), staff are then required to call the manager's manager and report it. If you don't, you will be held accountable and written up for the manager's error if it's ramifications occur on your shift. So, plan on isolation, becoming ostracized and dreading your shifts if you have a poorly trained manager who Walmart is nurturing. They discriminate in favor of younger employees and those of native (Hawaiian) descent."
bad,"stressful fast past endless work to be done before shift ends,hard to keep shelves stock and looking good vs customer load and getting what the manager wants done also.good people,fair climate."
bad,"Having knowledge of being an unloader before the Cap teams were assigned, I do not approve whatsoever of the new changes made to being in Cap team 2 (or any team from that matter). The cap team 2 is expected to do the unexpected day in and day out such as to unload entire trucks in less than two hours or to have half the team stock while the other half brings out the items to the floor in a short amount of time (They cannot begin to pull anything to the floor until after 9:00) or staying 2-3 hours late every time at work to make sure things are finished. The Cap team 2 only pays 9 an hour for basically doing 3 jobs. Do not approve"
bad,es triste ver una empresa tan grande y exitosa que por estar tomando modos de dirección erróneos esta desaprovechando al factor humano
bad,"As a support manager, I get all the duties the management would like to slack off on and pass off, on top of trying to complete my day to day tasks and uphold a clean customer friendly store."
bad,"A typical day would be running a department, satisfying customers, stocking 2 areas, and zoning about 5 all between the hours of 10pm and 7am. I learned that I am good at managing my time and being able to perform multiple tasks. Managment was not all that great but they were tolerable, they expected too much and when you couldn't deliver you were ""fussed"" at. Many were also very rude when you messed up. I loved my co-workers, they were nice and everyone was pretty much friendly. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of my managers, to be honest. But, the most enjoyable part was knowing that I left my areas that I needed to zone looking nice, neat, and organized."
bad,Wal-Mart is a great company to work for. The experience is awesome & meeting diff people from diff places a great company to grow with wal-mart is great .
bad,I was in frozen and dairy and I hate working in bad temp places everyday but I was able to go though it the management was almost never there and when I would ask them for anything they would take it in offence.
bad,"Wal- Mart believes in working 3 different jobs at one time without compensation, I have witnessed customer service lacks, due to not having enough employees, they tend to work on a skeleton crew. I enjoyed working there, but managers are pulled so much by store manager they are unable to complete their tasks for the day."
bad,Assistant Store Managers are too busy setting up Department Managers to protect themselves that they do not have the company's best interest at heart.
bad,"I loved the actual job, but we had one co-worker that would schmooze with management and tattle to management about every mistake.  She made everyone walk on pins and needles in fear of losing their jobs.  She made a workday much more stressful than it needed to be.  Managers seemed to like that sort of behavior, because she got promoted several times in the last year.  All of the employees there are made by management to feel disposable and worthless."
bad,"NEEDS Union. This is the company thats racists to its core, they harp on immigrants like slaves, with minimum wage. They use and abuse staffs who have low self esteem or new commers with no choice. 90% staff are ""Others"" while upper management is opposite. Very few males on the floor. If you are a men, you have to do everything, for a minimum wage not worth it.  No room for growth as the company does not believe in promoting from within. No sucession plans for employees. I was told that I will be promoted within 6 months, based on my experience and education. They got me working hard, I was doing carts, building shelves/mods every 2 weeks, cleaning etc.  Was physically drained. You will be haressed by lazy managers, especially female ones."
bad,"Work at Walmart is very scheduled and routine, the store to store culture is favorable, however, Walmart culture is not as connected on the regional and international scale."
bad,"Although every corporation has its own issues a company that boasts ""our people make the difference"" should make sure they listen to their people. You should never make someone feel they are less then what they truly are. Rules should be straight across the board and not depending on who you prefer or do not prefer."
bad,"Walmart would be much of a better place to work if the management, store managers and home off took their employees more serious rather than abuse power."
bad,"This is a decent place to work, on occasion at least. Sometimes the management is ok, and they're good at giving flexible hours."
bad,"A typical work day at Walmart is generally unpredictable. The amount of work done every day was questionable at best. There were days where I could come in to my department and see no freight and a clean service desk, however, more often I would be greeted by pallets and a very messy service desk all which I would have to fix prior to started my actual duties. I was able to develop a lot of skills at Walmart from simple stocking to marketing merchandise. The management at Walmart was rather disappointing. While I was an overnight stocker the majority of higher level management was very detached, most of the overnight crew only knew of the assistant managers on overnights and the store manager. I specifically remember waving at a day manager when my shift was over and theirs was starting, the manager didn't even acknowledge. However, when promoted I was introduced to the management team and thrown into the position with virtually no training or direction. I was only able to learn through questioning other department managers as to what was required of me. I did make it as a department manager but it wasn't easy. The co-workers I had on overnights were generally lazy and it was nothing for me to stand out from the crowd as a harder worker. The day shift employees were more experienced and some were very good workers. I only met one other person who was willing to actually work as hard as me though. He no longer works there either. The hardest part of working for Walmart was easily the management. They were sometimes unrealistic with their goals and often would show no appreciation"
bad,"The company is a good place to work for but the management in this store sucks. If you refuse to suck up to them then they get rid of you, Co-workers are great and for the most part the customers are too. Just remember not to trust anyone with manager on their badge."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people everyday. You learn how to work-well under pressure and deal with multiple customer concerns. It makes me feel like I have accomplished a lot when I solve a customer's problem,it's like a job-well done."
bad,"Working in Photo Lab and Electronics, the days were usually very busy. However, fellow associates were mostly hardworking, friendly and concientious."
bad,"changing oil and tires"
bad,"Hello  if you shot up, suck up ,and if you're one of the team  you'll be able to go up in the company. And so will your family. And to get hired faster is who you know."
bad,"Management was all over the place, schedules were never complete and weren't out in time making employees late or a no show due to not having good schedules."
bad,clock in go to my locker go to my department manger to see what's the work for today. like fright or new mods or doing the work from the bins
bad,"I liked my co-workers, but all in all I did not like working for Walmart.  I don't think there is enough leniency or compassion for their employees. I believe the company is too big."
bad,It was good working there if I was aloud to work autonomously but the management from other departments go out of their way to ruin your day by making you do their stuff for them. If management actually cared about their employees I would enjoy working there.
bad,The hardest part of the job is trying to find help from your management when you need their authority in a situation. Sometimes it's hard to get your work done when multiple areas of the store is short staffed.
bad,enjoyed the people I worked with very understandable when you have personal things going on in your life long as you communicate with your manager
bad,"This Job Has Its Up And Downs, But There Is Room For Advancement, But Dont Get Too Excited, Its Still Walmart. More Of A ""I Just Became The Legal Age To Work For Most Companies"" Kind Of Job"
bad,I really didn't appreciate the way I was treated by senior management. They didn't want to treat middle managers such as myself with the same respect they demanded us to give them and all the other associates.
bad,"I like working at walmart but management made me do duties i wasn't suppose to do. I loved my co-workers and my supervisors, but they just never worked with my school schedule"
bad,normal 9-5 standing all day.i learned patience working in the customer serivice department.Management was not always there when i needed for overrides.Hardest part was teaching new cashiers the way.The most enjoyable part was getting regular customers.
bad,it's basically  job where you learn how big management group working and taking knowledge how to made growth and take costumer attractive to sell item.
bad,"i was able to advance out of the position due to an exceptional work ethic."
bad,"días complicados por la mala administración. "
bad,"just pay my bill and learning new "
bad,"This was by far the most disorganized place I have ever worked. Their training was abysmal, the turnover rate immense, the rate of pay, it seemed, designed to keep people slaving at well below poverty level, and their management was in constant chaos. At work I would typically be called away from my position to fill in at the front desk, deli, or stock room. I was happy to be of service, but it was always so erratic. Customer issues were frequently met with disinterest, and co~workers were often untrained."
bad,Not exactly a dream job... It is something to do for money. Met some nice people. Free muffins and coffee every other Friday not too bad.
bad,"if you enjoy loosing your family, and are made to feel obligated to work 24/7 this is the place for you.  you are not aloud to call out given any situation.  management enjoys applying pressure to senseless projects in order to break yo, then publicly makes fun of you.  told your terrible every day regardless of proven improvement in sales.  threatened to not leave the store. told to do illegal things involving holding associates accountable for no reason. or firing people for no reason. forced to cut hours of long term full time associates more than the legal limit.  under threat of loosing your job, give associates an evaluation that does not increase their pay. all of this is ignored of all levels of out of store management regardless of testimonies given. and finally retaliation from management store, market ,district, regional."
bad,"Managers tend to to talk down to associates as well overwork them by tasking them individually to work freight that is really a job for two or three other people. When the work isn't performed the way they see fit they'll will talk down to you and when you do accomplish your tasks in an orderly fashion they sometimes won't even acknowledge it."
bad,"•	Oversee multiple areas of the store, maintaining and executing visual & merchandise standards along with meeting project objectives"
bad,A job is a job. I came in as temporary with a promise to be made part time after 90 days and well that didn't happen. So i missed out on all paid holidays and was working 40 hours a week. If you requested a day off they would make you would 5-6 days straight and it sucked.
bad,"Managers can be a hassle, work life can be stressful at times but it is a place to start and you can work your way up also the benefits are decent you can work on a 401k plan as well as become a shareholder i made $100 over the cousre of about a year"
bad,everyday was fast paced. lots of customer interaction a lot of energy was used daily. scheduling could have been a lot better
bad,"Senior management turnover was terrible, managers bad work culture, unsafe work place worked employees hard, all about the numbers"
bad,se nao fosse pela gerencia a empresa seria otima mesmo pagando pouco mas a liderança decha a desejar
bad,Although our actual job is okay we don't really get paid with how much work we do. Even when we aren't finished with our actual job or if we are in the middle of it they will oftentimes take someone away even though we are short staffed to do work in another department because they needed help there leaving us to do even more work than necessary.
bad,"I learned why product goes on sale, the rollbacks, I learned how to deal with angry customers, I managed to work as a team with my co-workers."
bad,so working at walmart these days means the job you sign up for is not the job you truly get. I myself worked wireless and got pulled every day for at least 4 hours of the day then you are pulling pallets past your department and you just see the pain and sadness on customers as they cant find anyone to help them. you will also have a manager yelling at you to get something done that isnt your department while another manager is rushing you so they can steal you to do the project they want you to do you get back to your department with just enough time to rush and scramble your stuff to look passable but really the shelf straightening and stocking looks rushed and you have to ignore customers to get that done. my co-workers were amazing and are some of the best friends i keep today. as far as the management goes i am pretty sure they pick these people based on how capable they are of dishing out punishment and not based off how skilled they are as leader of people
bad,"A typical work day at Walmart for me was clocking in at 7am and heading over to my assigned register. while working at the check out lines I was able to meet various types of people from different walks of life, on a day to day basis. I enjoyed being able to work with my co-workers and laugh and talk about different experiences we've had with the customers. the hardest part about this job is having to accept the fact that Walmart doesn't hire fulltime cashiers."
bad,"Back breaking labor. Not for people over 30. HR runs that place and the managers are pretty clueless.  They scared you during orientation about getting written up for every little thing and your'e so scared when you actually DO get to work, its insane.  What they tell you in orientation will change the moment you get to work.  Production based pay, so you have to destroy your body for minimal reward.  Small group of bun boys as per every job that can get away with murder and nothing happens.  Liked the 3 days and 4 days off, but the cons outweighed the pluses."
bad,You get to work and you have a 10-15 minute meeting and you are assigned which isles to stock. Walmart is not a union job so some things that go on are very different and seem unfair such as a machine telling you how fast you should do your job not considering if you have 20-50 pounds boxes to pick up from the ground onto a 5 foot shelf.
bad,"The workplace in general is fine. You do your work and can listen to music if you're on the night shift. You can talk with people all you like as long as the work gets done. But sometimes they will decide that you are seasonal even though you were hired as a normal employee. Then when you ask why you don't have any hours scheduled, the manager will tell you that it's a problem with the program. For two weeks."
bad,"You would stretch and go straight to work after that. I learned you have to keep working no matter what. Management was a very bad one if you hurt yourself, you will most likely be a very common person to be picked out and be seen as the weak link. The co-workers will talk about you even when they don't know you and don't care to get to know you. They hardest part of the job was not getting hurt on the job due to you have to pick stuff up weighting from and up to 50lbs. - 200lbs. by yourself and no one will help even when you ask for help. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how big warehouses work."
bad,"A typical day for me would be punching in, usually waiting 15 to 20 minutes for our meeting to start, then being told to go bust out grocery so that we can hit the GM side before one. Then, from around three on, working on whatever we can before five so that we can clean up and get all of our unworked or worked pallets back before moving on to two hours' worth of zoning."
bad,"They say its opportunities to grow in the company, but it depends on your mangers in the store. Work ethic is ignored and not appreciated when you go over and beyond. Good benefits and 401 plan and stock plans. Management team needs a lot of help seem to be a little crooked."
bad,"Good place to work out of high school but for a long term career, not so much. Every few months we get a new manager overnight. I was thinking about moving up with a company but the managers are telling me its a bad idea. I cant say to much about my co- workers because so many have come and gone. The hardest part of my job is having to pick up my speed when other co workers are slacking so I can help them out. I'm a hard worker so I'm usually done early. The most enjoyable part of my job is unloading the truck and helping out customers."
bad,a lot of work but had no help during my medical condition. very painful experience. worked with good people. management not caring  about employee needs.
bad,"era un trabajo bueno aprendí mucho a capturar datos, trato al cliente, gráficas lo malo era el pago que era muy poco"
bad,"I really like my employees and the fast pace, never a boring moment and that is what I like. It was challenging and always learning new things."
bad,Before I got fired they had wonderful management after we gone from regular store to super center they got new management that I didn't get along with.
bad,"Unload truck, organize product for each department, pull product to stock shelves.Stock the shelf's. Costomer help when needed, coworkers are very friendly."
bad,A big part of working there is the very nice employees and managers who want you to be successful. The problem is the backwards policies and schedules they have you do.
bad,It was alright. The management could care less about how you are doing and give less time than is necessary to get certain things done. Some managers follow rules and some don't leaving what is right really unrecognizable.
bad,"A typical night working at Wal-mart I stocked freight and Helped customers if needed."
bad,"You work hard, get paid nothing. everyone complains about everyone else, but not really realizing they do the same things that they are complaining about.  there is a reason people say ""what do you expect...its walmart""."
bad,I cooked different foods like  a lot of fried items like chicken and fries. I worked at the slicer cutting different types of meats and cheese. I like working with my coworkers.We would fight and make up. we got to know each others family and help one another when needed. The hardest part of the job was the beginning of the month when food stamps came out I never like it because we didn't get help all the time we needed it. The management wasn't really their for the coworkers.
bad,"Hardly any support from management.  Horrible work coverage and understaffed departments.  Unprofessional management but, there is a lot of room to grow and skill to gain from here."
bad,The management is okay.  Some managers are way better than others.  The hours were okay as well.  I learned a lot more about electronics working in that department.
bad,"I took this job to broaden my customer service experience, and while I learned a lot about all of the different departments, the management team left a lot to be desired."
bad,Typical day was unloading trucks and running freight. The people I worked with were great. The hardest part of the job was trying to talk to management.
bad,"I got along well with those that I worked with directly, but had issues with those on the other shifts not pulling their weight. Things that they had to do would go undone and make the work of stocking more difficult. "
bad,great people to work with. great environment. liked my job but it didn't fit with my family's health at the time. It was boring when it was slow but I really like chatting with the customers when we had them.
bad,they would work me full time hours but only have me on part time and only would pay minimum wage. They didn't work much with moving up in the company.
bad,"This is a company that rarely makes good on their word, even if you have something in writing. I have seen hard working co-workers (Assistant Managers) lose their jobs over petty politics, standing up for what was right, and clueless Store Managers that take credit for the ASM's work."
bad,"Extremamente focada em normas e processos. Tratando-se de uma empresa multinacional, os processos ainda passam por pendências de implantações concluídas.Os resultados certamente serão de grande eficácia após a conclusão das implantações. "
bad,Love the people but it's hard to advance and the pay makes it very hard to live. Management often expects more then possible.
bad,"Co-workers are great to work with and talk with."
bad,I was responsible for everything in the absence of management including helping out in other departments allowed me to act on my ethics of duty and smooth running department. So many satisfied customers gave me confidence and an appreciation for hard work.
bad,"I basically was outside in the heat all day gathering carts from the parking lot. I was getting paid minimum wage for a job with hazards such as extreme heat, potential vehichle accidents and lack of equipment essential to job duties."
bad,"aprendes a trabajar en equipo, y de forma individual en pro de un objetivo, aprender a ser pasiente con las personas que trabajas y los clientes, desarrollas abilidades para vender, y en caso de querer crecer tienes la facilidad de acomodarte en puestos mas elevados poco a poco escalando ."
bad,"As a walmart employee, you have one job title but you have to be everything in a neighborhood walmart. Employees are like family though."
bad,"Before going over my resume in the 2nd interview I put off on sundays because of church and they still had me down. Second I put 35 Hours because I have school. They put me down for 50+ hours. Management was horrible! I worked in the bakery and sometimes we didnt have soap to wash dishes, Hose to wash floors had a hole in it so water sprayed everywhere. Manager would schedule two people to get off at the same time with no one to close the bakery. It was just too much work in general for only $8 a hour. Plus on top of that I was working there for 2 weeks and no one trained me properly. For someone who have no background in baking I believe they should be trained."
bad,At one time this store was great to work for but in the last few years they have lost respect for there people and there customers...it in now not run by family so they just don't seem to care it is very sad and unhappy place to work any more.
bad,"Walmart was not the job I thought it was going to be. My job title was unloader but I'm doing my job title plus 75% of overnight stockers work, which was not what I signed up for. If I'm going to do 75% if their job then i should have been paid more than them."
bad,"unloaded trucks in receiving office put products on shelves inventory products and train new employees  "
bad,Walmart lacks good management and the communication is very poor in the store. There is a shortage of associates and it is hard to keep people.
bad,"The CAP program of Walmart is to be done everyday to ensure that products are always available for the consumer. The way to do that is to first go to the area where your inventory is kept. Reverse scan the items which means that all items should be scanned to see what can be stocked to the sales floor. Stock the items to the selves, fix the shelf on hands and shelf caps. This ensures that the item will not be picked again if the item can not go out to the sales floor. Take items that can not go to shelf and rebin them. Then work the negative on hand report, which means that we get a inventory paper that tells us the negative on hands, we are to locate the items or if we don't have them register this on the hand held devise. This starts the day and is to be done with in the first half of the shift. Second half is for price changes and Mod changes."
bad,"*I enjoy helping customers each and everyday"
bad,I didn't like working there no hours the manger are no help at all and not to many employees and walmart dont care about there employees
bad,"Wal-Mart was a great place for me to work at I enjoyed it !"
bad,Management acts like they a stick up there butt. Customers are general happy until management tries to put the blame on you. Other employees actually can make your day the best.
bad,"Lack of communication between managers. No one knows what the other has told you to do. "
bad,"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love working for Wal-Mart on account of my cashiers and customer service associates who make my days there wonderful, but the way all associates are treated there by management and its rules is not professional."
bad,Very underpaid but it is steady work. Management is very demanding and give you a bad oppression feel. Lowes is much better with a better culture towards employees.
bad,"I did not like my job at all when I worked here. Management was terrible and so were the associates. Hard work did not pay off in that store. The store managers values were certainly off.  Now, that store has a new store manager and it is very successful."
bad,"I enjoyed being around everyone and helping people."
bad,Deve desenvolver maior direcionamento ao bem estar e qualidade de  vida dos funcionários
bad,"You know you will always have work to do. Unloading trucks usually took up the first half of the day. The second half was pulling out pallets, doing picks and cleaning up the back room. Working here taught me a lot about working as a team and being productive. "
bad,"Typically, although I work in a specific department of the store, I am moved throughout the entire store experiencing all the jobs that others should be doing. The management are experienced in ""Walmart politics."" They argue very little with what is wrong, and blame the associates for anything that is wrong with the department they are supposed to work in. It is, however, good for a college student with always changing availability."
bad,My typical day at work was always busy. Thursdays and Fridays were the most fun. We would have id say at least 100 customers. I lerarned how to handle money and pay bills. the best part of my job was my co workers. I did not like the company as a whole and felt like workers were taken advantage of. I met my husband there. He was asked numerous times to work off the clock to avoid over time. My felow co workers were amazing i mmade some very meaningfull friendships there. I felt i was treated very poorly while i was pregnant and while other parts of management did nothing when i came to them about my conserns Kelly a front end supervisor really helped and worked with me and my issues that came with my pregnancy. She waas amazing. I did get great expirence from the money center.
bad,was decent job terrible pay and terrible hours good people work their and met alot of friends. Some managers had power trips and though they owned the walmart
bad,"Fun work place, very fast pace and challenging."
bad,I went to work daily to provide for me and my family. The work environment was okay. I have nothing to complained about. It was a okay employer. Walmart benefits sucks and the hours do to.
bad,"Working there was alright, the managers didn't seem to enjoy their jobs and any questions you had to ask them were treated like it wasn't their problem"
bad,the management yelled at and talked down to employees on a regular basis. my co-worker were friendly but unhappy. They expected goals to be done despite the time restriction.
bad,"Since the first day i started working the management did not listen, thy had you running around like a chicken with their head cut off, and expect things to be done when the workers and the management themselves know it is not going to get done."
bad,"Just a place to come in and get the job done, unacceptably unorganized. Management works under a lot of pressure and doesn't know how to treat or talk to employees."
bad,Working in the bakery was always an exciting adventure.  I love to learn new things and it was never a dull moment!  I learned how to prepare and cook the bread and baked goods.  I also learned how to decorate cake by just watching and it has turned in to a hobby and skill I never knew I had! I met some life long friend while working in the bakery.  Most days the hardest part of the job was keeping the shelves stocked with product once it was purchased  I loved working with the customers and learning a bit about them while I was helping them.
bad,Good environment for getting stated out of college. The city is fun and continues to grow on a daily basis. I really enjoyed working here the past 9 years but looking for new opportunities now.
bad,"Not the best place to work. Over worked, Under Payed and short staffed throughout the store. Rather than hiring new people with good work ethics, they would rather over burden the employees that do work hard with too much work. Many great employees including myself resigned because of this."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is the last day of the work week. Often time we were required to work mandatory overtime for several days. There is a huge disconnect between the associates and the managers which makes it very difficult to do the work at hand.
bad,"fun place to work, the pay isn't very good, with 5 mangers you get instructions from 5 different people who often have different ideas on how they want a job done, can get very frustrating."
bad,A typical day at work is very stressful. It consists of associates constantly coming into the office asking questions and expressing their concerns. Reports are ran and reviewed in the morning. I learned how to manage associates. My co- workers are very family oriented. The hardest part of my job is trying to get support from the management team. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with associates and potential new associates.
bad,Experienced in loss prevention monitor all in coming calls and out going calls working for walmart has its highs and lows point but i have learn alot from working for this company u meet some friendly and out going people i love bringing customers service to the community
bad,"Cashiered, bussed tables, stock condiments, clean. I enjoyed bussing tables the most, and I hated cashiereing at fast food."
bad,God please at times management don't know what in the world to  do and deal with people store manager shows and leaves when wants to
bad,"Clean if needed, help customers when needed, organize any work space in different areas, also unloading truck and working in the diary/frozen areas."
bad,"It is an acceptable place to work if you are going to school, but I recommend you keep looking for something better. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the public, but if you can deal with them, the job is easy"
bad,Typical day of work included performing various maintenance jobs. Management and other employees acted very unprofessional.
bad,"The Wal-mart position typically involves hard labor and long hours for little appreciation, the position does provide great work experience if you are starting out, however I would not recommend it as your only option for work, as the turn over rate fro employees is very high, and few manage to stay with the company for long. "
bad,"Day begins with clocking and going to your respective department. Answer questions for customers, give them details on products, inventory control, product placement, cashier, stocking, warehouse."
bad,"Walmart demanded too much from its workers and hold there pay over there heads when they think the workers are not working hard enough, treated like slaves all day long, management is horrible, really the best way to describe working at a Walmart DC is slave labor"
bad,"over the years, the working environment has deteriorated from good to bad to worse.  it has respect for individuals as one of its priorities, but now it is just a memory as workers are being overworked and paid less than what is appropriate."
bad,"This is a great place to work, but management needed some work. The building itself is in great shape, as of it being clean, well, that needed a lot of work. The janitor needs to be on top it."
bad,"i worked my tail off for six and a half years, and was shown very little appreciation for my efforts. although the associates were nice to work with, management was not."
bad,"I can't say enough about this company.Having never worked there before , it was quite an experience to see there concepts first hand."
bad,"This company isn't even half as flexible as they expect their employees to be and they dole out minimal compensation while constantly increasing their own expectations. "
bad,"I would read my email. Complete the task in the email. I would check to see who was working and created tasks for the associates. Merchandise that was received the night before I would put away either on the sales floor or in the backroom. The management team would assign me tasks. If I had question they would answer them in a timely manner. I would only talk to co-worker about work information. When help was needed in other area of the store I would go an help. The hardest part of the job was having the 2 shift managers and 2 assassinate mangers giving me different directions.Helping others succeeded was the best part of the job,"
bad,"Communication between managers is almost non existent. Lack of support when it comes to needs of the store and lower supervisors. Not enough workers in store to do tasks, team of 4 when 8 are needed. After task is done and takes twice as long management yells at supervisors and associates."
bad,Fast pace work which requires a strong physical strength. Boring repetitive music which is not uplifting to keep working during overnight. Shorter lunch break compared to date time employees.
bad,"Cashing out, bagging items, price matching customer items, applying coupons when applicable. Zoning areas, processing payments and applying money to walmart cards."
bad,"I've worked at Walmart for several years, most of it as a Sales Associate."
bad,"There wasn't communication between management missed everyone up. Schedules got changed without notice, Never any coverage, Managers didn't help, when needed. Schedules kept getting changed before or after availability."
bad,A typical day at work consist of fixing old issues so that i could start on task for that day. There was always a lack communication between upper management which causes a lack of clear instructions for Assistant Managers.
bad,"A typical night at the job was we would have our meeting before we start out work and got assgined our areas then we would unload our pallets and stock shelves in a timely manner and at the end our shift we would takr back wherever overstock was left."
bad,"A great company to start off with. Great Customer service, depending on management and depending on the store. Overall multi billionaire company, a awesome job to start your career off."
bad,"Rang up customers and took their money in exchange for Walmart products. This would include day, night, weekends and various hours from 4-8 hours.  They would work cashiers up to 36 hours so they wouldn't have to pay full time benefits."
bad,"What else can I say I think the ratings say it all. However I will say when I had started there I got full time within 2 months when I transferred to a Walmart in Paducah I kept my status but my pay rate was dropped, when moving back to Springfield - that's when it got bad. I transferred to another Walmart that I hadn't worked at before, they dropped me back to part time and I believe forced me out of the company with unfair practices. I was more then treated wrong I felt completely degraded by this place of employment and don't suggest Walmart to anyone."
bad,"heavy lifting. shipping and recieving, unloading trucks and packing boxes on top a skid. when the store closes we bring the skids on to the floor for stocking"
bad,"Walmart is a great company to work for, although the management team is not always on the same page. At any given time one manager can tell you to work on one project and another manager can come and have you work on another. Often projects last a whole shift so if you don't get your original project done your managers get very angry."
bad,"My particular Walmart is one of the lowest rated stores in the district  from both customers and employees. I've learned through my management team to always expect the worst and be glad if it's better. I learned to work hard. I love to work with the other associates. Because of how diverse the job positions are, it is always interesting to learn a new job and other associates are normally willing to teach you their positions when you get pulled to help. The only thing that is enjoyable about this Walmart is seeing and talking to another associate who is always happy which makes me happy, but most of the time it sucks the life out of you."
bad,"Walmart is a cool place to work for, if you are in need of some extra cash. There is no serious money being made unless you are in management. The policies and management are not the best. This place needs a union!!!! This is not a company that seems to listen to its workers."
bad,"Walmart is good place to start learning.  The environment is tough, fun and challenging.  You are immediately exposed to new technology and situations that will grow you.  The IT promotions narrow quickly after Senior Programmer Analyst, so having a deep network to help push your promotions is a must.  If several people two positions above you are not pushing for your promotion, it will not happen."
bad,"I had a good time working for this company, up until the management decided that my hard work wasn't hard enough, and tried to push for more than I was obligated to do."
bad,"not a good place to work if you want a personal life.  long hours working on your days off required to ""volunteer"" for civic functions"
bad,"This being my first job, it started out fantastic, my co-workers were great, the job was new and exciting and the manager was helpful and supportive. "
bad,"Started as a stock boy and moved up to Dept manager of various departments. Not a bad gig if you can get into management. I gave this company 4 years of my life and I do not regret it, but I do encourage anyone wishing to work for Wal Mart to focus on getting into management. This will make the ride much more enjoyable."
bad,"a typical day changes from day to day but I can say that the experience here has improved my people skills and managing people and meeting deadlines. The management team oversees that the company objectives are met and co-workers work hard to meet the expectations that are at times very difficult . The hardest part of the job is corporate constantly changing the daily routine and not really talking with the workers for there opinion, they are sitting in a chair at cooperate level not really knowing what is going on at store level. Mr Walton believed in talking with his workers and I believe that has been lost.  enjoyable part, helping people choose the right product for them and walking away a happy customer."
bad,Nice friendly people you work with but management has no idea what they want most of the time and contradict each other a lot.
bad,"During my time at Walmart I was subject to several incidents of questionable management practices. On more than one occasion I was directed to deliberately perform my duties in an incorrect manner to speed up productivity, which in the long run just made my tasks for the next night all the more difficult, as well as interfering with the ability of the daytime shifts to work with the inventory."
bad,"Could high pay for overnight stocker, because we do alot to get the store to where it needs to be for the next day of service for our customers tp make sure they our in a clean places to shop in"
bad,I worked her for a year and it wasn't until I hit my year mark that I found out I was eligible for health insurance through them way before my year mark approached. There is a serious lack of communication going on and every manager seems to want to step on toes just because they feel what they have to say is more important then the next.
bad,"I always enjoyed my time at Walmart pharmacy. The day was always extremely busy which made the day go by fast. The job also taught me humility and compassion which you wouldn't necessarily think you would get from just ""typing and counting pills."" As a company, Walmart was, for the most part, good to work at. In the pharmacy, you're kind of left to do your own thing. The only problem I had was at the last store I worked at, the store manager put patient satisfaction over state law. He made the pharmacy override, fill, and sell a controlled drug that was too soon because the patient was not happy. I left soon after."
bad,Walmart is a great starter job. I wouldn't suggest for anybody too settle for this is a career. Benefits are good but for the work there should be much more.
bad,"I am a merchandise supervisor for Walmart.  A typical day in my routine is: working reports, eliminating shrink, p.o.s., providing excellent customer service, overlooking several different associates and making sure they stay on task, keeping track of inventory levels, ordering, making sure polanagrams are up to date.  The upper management in my store is very uneducated.  The hardest part of my job is trying to change the moral of the store for the better.  The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customer with what ever their needs may be."
bad,A typical day at Walmart could be fun at times when there is a lot to do. I learned how to do lots of new things from my department manager but higher management didn't even show interest in teaching me anything. My co-workers where very interesting energetic and helpful everyday. For the most part there wasn't anything hard about the job it all was easy to me. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers find any item they came looking for.
bad,the average day was tough work outdoors not very difficult after awhile but not many options to going up in the company. but a secure job.
bad,"I worked in the auto dept. doing basic stuff oil changes, tire work, battery work... etc. I got the chance to work with some very open minded, fun guys, who were always jumping at the chance to learn something new and find ways to bring in more customers for the whole store. The hardest part of the job was that during my time there the turn over rate was and as i know currently still is very high. Mostly because benefits aren't offered unless full time and they make sure that only supervisors or management are the ones who can receive full time. I did apply for a full time job was full time for 3 wks and then got bumped to part time hrs much like others within my store. I felt like in a sense that company is neglecting their workers that are willing to put in the time and that may need the benefits by making sure that those workers can't receive any. "
bad,"I worked with Wal-Mart for 5 years. During that time, the employees were friendly and a joy to be around and work with. The direct staff above me was understanding and worked with me at all times. The upper management were a nightmare to speak to and had little consideration for anyone but themselves."
bad,"Uma empresa de excelentes benefícios,com carga horaria acessível,colegas de trabalho com muita sintonia e respeito."
bad,"• Experienced in interacting with thousands of customers"
bad,"A typical night at work includes a 15 minute meeting before the shift to tell us where in the store we are going to be working. After the meeting we get started stocking our freight for the night, and if we finish our section early, we go and help someone else finish theirs. Every night around 5:30 we go outside and round up the buggies."
bad,started my day as a accountant ended up doing inventory stocker and doing other odd and ends .
bad,"As an ASM for Walmart, each morning starts with a meeting with all ASMs, ZMs and DMs.  However, this routine has not been consistent storewide.  Therefore, as an ASM for the Apparel and Homelines, which consists of 10 departments, I make sure to conduct meetings with ZoneManagers and Department Managers in order to keep them apprised of sales trends, price changes due and upcoming modular.  In addition, to notify them of amount of freight to expect.  This will allow them to manage their tasks efficiently and execute flawlessly.  The hardest part of the job, currently, is having sales support.  This is the team that supports all DMs to accomplish tasks.  Because of low wages, it is difficult to on board sales associates, therefore, the team becomes overloaded and feel pressed for time.  This becomes a domino effect and has a negative reflection on the visual merchandising of our department.  The most enjoyable part of my job, is the team effort my DMs put into getting the tasks done.  Although, exhausted, they feel appreciated."
bad,"Decent co-workers, some benfits, low pay, poor management at times."
bad,"At Walmart, I would stock the fresh and frozen meat. Out of all of my co workers I would work the hardest. My Department Manager was a great worker which is why I was so successful. However, Management was lacking in leadership and training, We were always understaffed and over filled with stock. The shelves would be empty and the stockroom would be full. I enjoyed talking with all the customers, and showing my coworkers how fast I could get the job done."
bad,"While I may have enjoyed working in the bakery I did not enjoy the very little hours I was given for the job I had to do. Every time I got up to par with finishing by closing time they cut another half hour or hour. I ended up having to package, label, and distribute several dozen loafs of bread and rolls, take cake orders, write on cakes, assists customers, and clean the bakery within 4 hours by myself 5 days of the week before I quit. I tried to get changed out of he job but with getting off of work a couple hours after the bakery was supposed to be closed I felt I like i was going to get fired before I got my help."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart was very hetic and exciting. Working in the retail field has helped me build character, selfesteem and patience. Whenever you work in a public spectrum there is always drama and confussion. The customer is always right has been the motto for most retail companies. Having the patience to listen to complaints and keep a smile on your face is creative. Working at Walmart has taught me to look towards the brighter side of the problelm. Always keep a positive attitude and never let your emotions get the best of you."
bad,It is an acceptable stepping stone if you have no plans of getting into the management program. I would not recommend Wal-Mart for long term employment. They do offer tuition assistance for some degree programs for those employed who desire to further their education.
bad,"I worked in the ice cream freezer as a lift operator and order filler and work sat-mon 11-16 hour shifts depending on workload. The benefits weren't terribly good. I would've had 10,000 out of pocker before anything else was paid.  I made almost 18 an hour, which was nice, but not worth the work. Definitely a bust your back job. I injured my lower back, but they denied it heppened at work so I would've had to take them to work in able to get a dime of compensation."
bad,"Although I managed to have this job for over 5 years, after that time I still made under $10 an hour, was only allowed Part Time with no hope for a Full Time position (unless a Full-Timer left, which they never did, much easier for them to just hire a hundred part-timers so they didn't have to pay them more benefits), the environment was full of other dissatisfied employees which made it even more difficult to work in as they didn't put forth effort. Otherwise, management treated me well to the best of their ability for the most part."
bad,scanned work badge that would assigned register to work at.  Make sure cash register prepared
bad,"Would not work at Walmart again, barely any benefits, pay was horrible, company does not appreciate employees."
bad,"Freight Flow and Instock"
bad,"That Walmart was the busiest one in the country. I would work at customer service and train new workers to run it. Plus cashier, and give breaks. I would help customers with send and pick up money, cash checks, returns, and questions. The hardest part was getting your breaks. The enjoyable part was the co-workers."
bad,I have worked at many different stores in my time with walmart. Some are great others are terrible. The culture that the store manager perpetuates drastically affects everything in the store.
bad,"When I went in I thought I could handle it, but by the end of the night I realized that I could not. I tried my best to keep up with the pace, but I had been off a good week before that night. When I asked for more hours I was told that my hours would be based off what I did that night. I also asked to switch positions since I was not doing so well at the one I was in and was denied."
bad,"stocking products."
bad,the co-workers are fun to be around. Management needs a lot of improvement.
bad,"typical work day: long hours, random store events (set by corporate), getting carts, paperwork, employee issues, random policy changes (set by corporate), unloading trucks, gathering carts."
bad,"Walmart seems to be good as a start off job, you learn a lot of useful skills that you can implement in every work field you decide to go forth with. Communication skills, and productivity is just two of the many skills you learn working there. As a cashier, I stand at the register and cash out many customers. The hardest part of the job is getting blamed for things you can't control, while understanding a customers frustration, it was not your fault bananas were priced wrong. It's not easy to move up in the business, it's not impossible, but it's rare in my opinion. The best part of the job is meeting new people and making connections with regular customers. Sometimes dealing with customers can be a blessing and a curse, I know how to understand and work with every customer that walks through the Walmart doors."
bad,Keep your head down and do work and you'll be fine. Advancement is reserved for only the most dedicated butt kissing. Pay is not worth the work the majority of the time.
bad,"Walmart used to be a great company to work for way back when. They cared about employees who had families, were sick, needed time off, etc."
bad,"10 hour days"
bad,Management is terrible all they do is sit in there office.I worked there 10 years and if they want to fire you they will for anything. Only a 4 day work week and they sometimes hire managers off the street. Things get broke a lot and they don't get fixed unless visitors are coming. Management lies when they want and act like they are not.
bad,"Some of the employees were helpful and nice, but for the most part, management wasn't very helpful or accessible, morale was very low! This company has a habit of not replacing employees as they leave the company, which makes it hard to be as productive as you need to be."
bad,"My typical day at work consisted of me interacting with people all day, and I loved it I learned how to use a cash register with is I was excited about that. I just never did understand why they didn't give me a fair chance me or my trainer never understood that because I was a great worker with an positive attitude. I never had a hard part with this job. the most enjoyable though was meeting all different kinds of people."
bad,"managers seemed to enjoy trying to make associates feel bad about themselves, no help when needing assistance to get work done"
bad,"work day began around 11 pm, after clocking in, straight to the work floor to begin stocking the shelves with consumer merchandise. During my time there i learned how to provide better customer service and be a more effective stocker  by getting merchandise on the the floor fast to generate more sales, as well as work as a team with fellow co-workers. The hardest part of my job was working with team member not as motivated as myself but i really enjoyed face to face interactions with co-workers and customers."
bad,Temporary job while pursuing other interests. Enjoy the people and get along with all co-workers and management.
bad,"Hectic days."
bad,it was an ohkay place to work I loved meeting new people but management was not always the best
bad,There isnt much to say about my experience at Wal-mart I was only there for a month. The pay was great! co-workers not so much they were rude to their customers most of the time and the store was always dirty..
bad,"management compensation needs to get better and bonus sturcture"
bad,"Horrible management very mean and aggressive, very tempered and they take advantage of many foreign employees."
bad,This was a bad area to work at Walmart. The managers were just not good people to work for. They expected for us to work ourselves into the ground.
bad,my co-workers was good before new people came and was slacking. Overall when we work together we get the job done.
bad,"Productive and very busy working in receiving area. I learned how load and unload trucks, drive forklift and stock freight."
bad,Wal-Mart is a great company. There are many pros and cons working for this company. They have flexible hours and work with their associates from time to time.
bad,This job had poor management. I ended up working my job AND many of my coworkers many days. Poor pay.
bad,the job is good and laid back but its the people that work there think they run the store not all but some that think that the hardest part of the job is getting along with the store manger
bad,I stocked the produce section nightly it was a nice job that I enjoyed doing.
bad,"Most of management acts like they at are all mighty, It take the CSM way to long to help the cashiers with anything. As a sales associate i was hired in to be in one department and they have had me work in every department in the store. On a positive note the personnel manager is the greatest. It can be fun at times depending on who is working. They are very eco friendly."
bad,Employee compensation need major improvements and company doesn't provide you full time to avoid paying employees benefits.
bad,A typical day would consist of me working in multiple department to suffice for the lack of employees that the company had.  I learn that I am somebody that management my has faith and trust in when its something to get done I'm the one to learned how to do it and get it done by the time its needed to be. Management  wasn't the best no one was on one accord and the business was just out of whack in a since such as the organization. As well as the lack of pay for the duties that I did on a daily basis.
bad,"easy, frequent breaks, learned to work well with people, learned alot about customer service and how to run the cash register"
bad,"I just lost my job at this position,and you will to!!!! Work is hard,the managers don't care about if you lose your job or not....... The production is impossible to get.i suggest you go to order filling or Fid"
bad,"I did the job well enough to earn three raises in pay during the time that I worked there.  Long hours, but worth it as far as that goes.  However, in return for that they do not treat their employees well and were unnecessarily difficult.  There is no need to express a 'live in fear' attitude towards good people who did everything they were told and then some only to be fired or forced to quit (usually before their benefits kicked in).  Now again, I do not like to speak out of school -- I leave the past in the past -- but I do not like it when good people are treated unfairly.  You can not tell them that you need them one minute then threaten to fire them over the simplest thing the next.  There is no job security there and I would not recommend working there unless you have a backup plan.  I enjoyed working with about 90% of the people there.  My favorite part was dealing directly with customers, especially with those who had children, who would often times complement me on my willingness to put up with them.  Many customers who I dealt with on a daily basis would ask for my help -- knowing that I would not steer them wrong."
bad,This was a rough job that mostly consisted of running product and a bit of prep room cleaning. Not really a challenging job which left more to be desired. The people in my department were nice. Management then was tricky because they would extend your lunches to prevent overtime.
bad,"Some of lower level management are not ones to lead by example. If your an associate then people drop work loads on you and run regardless of what you were assigned to do. Other associates, for the most part, are polite as it is their job, supervisors are good to you as long as you do what is expected of you, while there are those managers that establish a pecking order among their so called ""Wal-Mart Family"", and then there are others more seemingly more experienced, informative, great leaders, and professionals. For example, people who work in frozen department are assigned with the company jacket to work inside the freezer, which is -7F, do not get nearly enough insulation to provide for the body to retain it's heat for the periods of time associates or supervisors spend in there, and managers who DO NOT spend much time in there, look down upon the people who wear anything else but a blue shirt and beige khakis. Other than that, It is a good environment to develop great customer service."
bad,hostile work environment at times. difficult to speak to management. over-all easy to work with co-workers and other associates of same management level
bad,"Mucho trabajo pero no esta bien pagado a mi criterio."
bad,"Worked after class for some extra money, did not like the people i was working with, and I was treated like I didn't matter"
bad,I had wonderful managers and loved working there. The problem I had was low pay and could not afford to live off what I made each week.
bad,"I love working with a group of people's. Some days I have my good days, and some times I have my bad days. Everyday is a learning experience with different people. You have some people with nice, productive attitudes. Then there's days where you can have someone come in with a nasty attitude, but all around you are going to have to have self-control to be able to know how to deal with that one person to brighten up their day."
bad,"I would not work for this company again, unless I was in dire need of a job."
bad,"Managed jewelry inventory, built jewelry displays, organized jewelry department and straightened merchandise.  Assisted customers with jewelry selections and answered questions regarding jewelry.  Checked out customers making purchases.  Counted register drawer at the end of shift for accuracy."
bad,"opportunity of advancement is limited, management mistreats workers"
bad,"Walmart was an interesting place to work where management chose to use fear, intimidation, and lack of ethics as a motivator."
bad,At walmart there was always new people for me to train so that kind of slowed up the day if someone wasnt paying attention to wat was taught that day cause they would come back the next day and it was the same training all over again.a few hands on manergers.
bad,"Did inventory, took customers orders, decorated cakes, baked bread, fried doughnuts, sliced lunch meats and cheese, ordered inventory, and restocked departments."
bad,"Most of the days I never talked to my associates and my day consisted of nearly eight hours of sweeping the floor. Management was alright, but they hardly talked to new people. The hardest part was that I rarely talked to any of my associates and never got to know anyone. The most enjoyable part was that I had an hour lunch break."
bad,"Decent pay, just understand you will not have a life outside of it.  Management needs improvement"
bad,"A great place to work if you don't have small children under 10, or have to share your children with an ex. It's not the people there that didn't care, it's the corporation. My co-workers and managers were great, and if it wasn't for them I probably would have quit long ago. However, the corporation doesn't care if you're sick or if your kids or fiancee is sick. They still want you there, working, despite you being sick."
bad,A typical Day at work consists of many things. Everyday is different. From learning new computer programs to helping customers and dealing with every circumstance that is presented. My co-workers are a joy to work with and I have learned from each and every one of them. The most enjoyable part of my  job is helping people. Interacting. Although the Management is sometimes unhelpful in their positions. A Enjoyable place to work.
bad,"Helping customer with any questions or concerns!"
bad,I reported in to the deli department and prepared the food and waited on customers while cooking the food and slicing the deli meat for the customers. There was no management when I worked there at the time due to the lack of managers and that was the biggest problem I had with the job.
bad,"working at walmart was a great advantage of meeting new people, making friends with associates and helping a lot with customers, I enjoyed meeting people from around the world and enjoyed most of the management, they were very helpful in situations, treated everyone with respect and fairly, I had always tried to lighten things up with humor and tried to make people laugh, at least 10 a day, that made for an easier day and sent the customers away with a smile"
bad,"Diária corrida onde aprendemos de tudo um pouco por executar as mesmas sempre com a supervisão do chefe direto , pouca interação com os colegas por falta de tempo, a parte mais difícil foi conxiliar a regra do pôr do sol ( nunca deixe para amanhã o q ue você pode fazer hoje ) com a regra de banco de horas zero , pois a demanda de solicitação era muito grande para poucos funcinários na área e a mais agrádavel era no final do dia quando zerávamos todas solicitações diárias sentimento de dever cumprido , muito satisfatório para um profissional ."
bad,Walmart is a fast paced work envirement but unfortunately doesnt pay their employees very well for their hard work and loyalty.
bad,"walmart is exactly what you make it, they offer you to work all over but have little pay"
bad,There is no real action taken for things done wrong by different people. its more less who you know type of job. Also they dont care about home life or if something goes worng. There answer is this is retail and you need to deal with that. The pay is good for the job that you do. The raises are horrible.
bad,Good environment to work in. Learned about receiving and stocking.
bad,Walmart will typically choose someone with an education for advancement than someone with experience and qualifications which leads to a management team with no experience.
bad,"llego y nos ponemos a checar la mercancia que esta en piso y la recivimos ,despues  checamos las etiquetas que coincidan con la mercancia , llenamos unos formatos para darle recivo y despues reciving para ver en que hubicacion  donde quedo la mercancia "
bad,"I have had to take this job due to lack of jobs in my line of work. I do not plan on ever working here again if I can help it. They push their employees to their limits while offering very little compensation, the job task itself is monotonous and dull, and the managment and employees are childish and unprofessional. Despite these faults, Walmart has provided the job security I needed as well as yearly raises. There are also ample opportunities to move to better paying departments."
bad,they will screw you some way and how  don't matter if you been there one year or 20 years. I would never go back no matter what they say
bad,"Long overworked , had to learn most of job responsibilities on your own , Management inconsistent."
bad,"Every day you come in same routine clock in then you push carts till the garage is full and you keep it that way after your done keeping it full and staying it full your not allowed to catch a breath or get a drink they send you back outside in the hot or cold and clean the area, pick up trash, clean the garbage, etc while you still have to keep the garage full of carts."
bad,Each day I would run a cash register and assist customers. I learned how to run a cash register very efficiently. There was quite a bit of head butting with the management amongst themselves but I usually dealt with a select few each day. The coworkers usually got along and helped each other out. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and did not enjoy the holes in the management.
bad,Working at walmart is fun. Interacting with customers and associates are also entertaining.
bad,The only issue at Walmart our Manager did not know how to talk to staff and/or customers.
bad,"My job as a cashier involved long hours standing at the front checkouts attending customers paying for their merchandise. I learnt engaging with customers by smiling and helping them with any questions or concerns. I also learned how to efficiently run a cash register and balancing cash registers accurately at the end of evry shift."
bad,"Very fast paced, customer focused, big box retailer so a ton of responsibility, great chance to move up fast"
bad,"The managers, for the most part, are very nice, however they do push you beyond your limits. So many people aren't able to make the quotas and they continue to raise them to better their numbers. Nobody really enjoyed their job they just enjoyed the pay, including myself."
bad,Where I worked at the some a few of managment staff was nice but overall they care about moving up and try to screw you alot of issues with this so called taskmanagement and telling you to doing multitasking and wrong times on how its supposed to be done...I used to work downstacking cold chain merch so staying in cooler was fine with me ..Working with others was a good plus some was doing less and getting away with but they as far as management put more on the other workers
bad,If you do not mind working all hours of the day then no problem.  To get further up into management you sacrifice time with your family and friends.
bad,"The people i worked with in electronics were great but the management was not the best. We were understaffed due to hour cuts, and finally i left due to the hour cuts with low wages because it was more expensive to drive there than the money i was making."
bad,"Its not the greatest job in the world. Great co-workers, terrible management, and terrible customers, not all though. Very busy long shifts, the co-workers make it go by fast. Not all co-workers are reliable most call off every week and most don't last long here."
bad,"This may have been limited to my store - 1031, Trainyards, Ottawa, Ontario - so this is not representative of the entire franchise:"
bad,"First thing is we had to try to figure out what was done during the day because there was no notes left to inform us what was done and what was left to be done."
bad,A typical day at work I would clock in and immediately go water the plants than take of customers as I take care of the store needs at the same time. I learned a lot about different types of plants and the things they need to survive. My managers where not that great they didn't do their jobs well ill just say that. My co workers where awesome. The hardest part of the job was trying to do the things I didn't know how to do because we were so under staffed at my store. The most enjoyable part of my job was hearing the different stories people who came by and needed help would tell me while I was helping them.
bad,"I was on overnights, first as a stocker and then as a cashier.  for 4 years it was a great place to work, then we got all new mgrs. on overnights and it became a place that no one wanted to be at."
bad,The hours were great but the pay didn't reflect what u worked. The bonus were great. The 401 K was a plus.
bad,"i learned that the Costumer Is Always Right even wen they are wrong and its on you if a problem gets out of hand."
bad,"I would check customers out which included bagging their grocery's, doing wic items, and making sure the customer was well taken care of."
bad,"They tell any and everybody business, they cant stop gossiping also management tell other workers about different workers business."
bad,Walmart is very unorganized and unsure of what their priorities are. they are also very unappreciative and disrespectful to their employees.
bad,"una relacion buena con maestros."
bad,Cashing and bagging customer items. I hate dealing with the customers that was rude. They always try to get you in trouble. They always complaining about the prices. The supervisor always gave attitude when you did something wrong. the other cashiers so cool. we always had fun when we could.
bad,"Walmart returns. If more than one item needs to be returned from one orer that was delivered, you have to print a label for each of those items. That is ludicrous!! You have take the time and click on each item, go to printer and print(using your ribbon) Each item individually. They did not send it to you that way. Sent in all one package. But, they expect their customers to do it. 21st century, people. come up with a better method. Get out of the discount mentality. You talk but do not deliver. And, by the way, some of your prices are not discount prices. Sent an email"
bad,Ringing up sales and talking to customers. Going home to relax was my second job.
bad,"ok job, just hard to move up . Good job for college people. It was a ok job but not a job i would stay forever."
bad,its just a job to get you by. management was easy to work with and the ladies in hr are nice
bad,"typical day, expect the day to go by fast, you are always in a rush, got written up for not going to lunch!!! really??!!!1"
bad,"•Provide excellent customer service by helping the customer find the products they’re interested in. "
bad,"Before leaving Wal-Mart, I worked as an Unloader in the back room. It was the job I'd wanted from the start of my time employed there. The job itself was enjoyable. I prefer jobs that have me moving around and performing physical labor. "
bad,People here play to much and leave all the work to the ones who go there to work.
bad,"Answering store calls, helping them with problem sales. Shipping up to 9500 complete glassed per day with 2 shifts, changed schedules to train other shift management, sometimes help a tech work on a machine, willing to answer any and all questions, built A/R rooms and installed equipment, re-engineered failed systems, a go to guy...etc.etc."
bad,"la verdad yo aprendi mucho en la empresa pero las personas con un puesto auno mas elevado eran muy prepotentes nos trataban "
bad,"It was not all that fun to work for Walmart, I stuck with it though because it helped pay the bills and I could not find anything better at the time."
bad,"Just got on a register, dealt with unruly customers, and moved efficiently. I learned patience and working well under pressure."
bad,claims out damage merchandise that was return to the store I enjoy working with my supervisor and co worker
bad,Work is fun because of my coworkers. Management does not hold employees accountable for complaints or concerns that have been made and do not take them seriously in my opinion. I also believe the pay is way too low for most jobs that are performed and for the things employees go through on a daily basis
bad,"viewed the daily tasks of an assistant manager as in following up on"
bad,it was a ok job the hrs where good and the pay was good as well..friendly people
bad,"There is no typical day....any and everything can happen you have to be prepared for busy or slow moments of customer service & tasks, constant change from manager to manager,customer service issues and questions as well as management problems & helping fellow employee on various tasks.I have learned to be versatile,a team oriented employee and multi-task constantly...The hardest part of job is management.The most enjoyable part of job is the re-pore you build with customers."
bad,"stock shelves and run register, stock again. Upper management no where to be found"
bad,values have changed for walmart...hard to support a family with the wages they offer ..
bad,was very hard work had to take care of customers need and wants trying to make everyone happy really loved it. mangers couldnt keep one back there so we hardly had one
bad,"Responsible to count and balance all cash flow and checks and coupons to each cashier each time they cashed out their drawer. All cash had to balance to the penny and entered into the computer properly to make all bank deposits. Management was good and friendly. My co-workers were excellent. They were honest, and dedicated and fun to be with. The hardest thing was sometimes balancing to the penny or ten cents for a 500,000 dollar day. Checking and rechecking to find the ten cents at times. The most enjoyable thing was the office environment and the fast pace and the camaraderie within the office and humor between us."
bad,They try hard to provide us with some of our wants. They are safe based.
bad,"Management is very uptight with hours of availability due to schooling. They do not often show consideration to cashiers, and working on till causes a lot of back pain and nobody listens to how things can change."
bad,"I can't say that I haven't learned alot from Walmart, but I will say that it is a terrible company. I can't say that I have a most enjoyable part or a hardest part, the year and a half that I've worked there I've just managed to get by to make an income."
bad,"i started at walmart after being let go from another job, it pays very poorly, but it is better that staying unemployed"
bad,Wal-mart is a huge company and gives out bonus at the end of the year with its profit sharing program they have with the company. However Wal-mart is know to take advantage of there employees and lie about positions in the company to try to keep you working there.
bad,"After my probationary period, I was promoted to Customer Service Manager - not exactly anything to boast about as I only received a $0.30 pay increase. Most of the CSMs were part-time at my store (they do this so they don't have to pay out company benefits i.e. health and dental) yet they require you to have a nearly open schedule, work you as though you are a full-time employee and dump as much work on you as they possibly can. When looking for direction from upper management, there was hardly ever any consistency (one said one thing while the other said something else). This just made the job a thousand times more frustrating especially when it came to decision making.  You need to practically live there in order to make a decent living leaving you drained with no social life to speak of. "
bad,"no straight schedule, all hours that bounce back and forth from 5am start today to 11am start tomorrow to 9am start the next day. time constraints on daily basis. love the job, don't like the management. "
bad,Everyday is different. Some are better than others but most of the time its pretty stressful. Only having 4 cashiers (including me) is not that easy to work with to make sure everything gets done that needs done. The hardest part of the job is to make sure the return carts get done. We cant control how busy we get at night. We can stay busy up til 2 a.m. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people who come through. Always have a smile on their face when they see me. best feeling in the world.
bad,terrific job for an fresh out of school student with no responsibilitues
bad,"This is a company that makes billions of dollars a year and yet can barely give associates the tools necessary to complete their job. They do not hire enough people to work in these departments either. They've now combined many departments together to save on paying department managers. When I was hired in 2008 I worked in the Hardware department, that was it. Now I work in Hardware, Domestics, Housewares, and Furniture. I'm often asked to cover other departments like Sporting Goods because they won't hire enough coverage. Add that on to unloading trucks and having to help with carts and other odd jobs. They combined all of these departments and nobody was compensated fairly for the added work load and responsibility. Also, there is absolutely no accountability for work that is not done the right way. All complaints about these issues fall on def ears. I can accomplish a lot of work during the day and I don't mind a big work load. I like to stay busy but I also like to be compensated for extra work and more responsibility. It all comes down to Wal Mart cutting corners as they normally do to make extra money in spite of their associates. I work very hard there and I can't even get the highest pay raise every year of $.60 an hour. They'll say nobody can get it, and their reasoning, because you have to be pretty much perfect to get it. Though oddly enough my first pay raise was $.60 when I first started. So that's just them taking more money from people. So they can stuff the pockets of the suits working back in Bentonville. Yeah you can get quarterly bonuses, but the key word"
bad,"My experience with Walmart is not positive.  While employed there I found an erratic system of everyone everywhere.  While it was still a manageable job, it required a true commitment to a Walmart system."
bad,Constantly on your feet with not enough compensation for the job you do. Management can be helpful but hard to find at times and mostly the co-workers are fun to be around. 
bad,"This job wasn't bad because of the customers, in fact most of the customers were nice, it was bad because of the management. It is hard to like your job when you feel like you managers don't even like being there, or care about the people who work under them. "
bad,"The people I work with is what makes Wal-Mart great.  Otherwise, I don't appreciate how they treat me as an individual.  I am unhappy here.  I've been working for this company for more than 5 years and I am not making much money.  Looking for a company that will appreciate my hard working ethics and with great pay."
bad,"I liked working there but I also did not.I loved checking people out on my lane because I am great at multitasking and I could be very polite and make small talk with them all at the same time ringing them up in a great timely manor.I was so great at checking customers up that they even referred me to be either in the express lanes or in the Customer Service desk.What I didnt like about this place was the Manager's they had there at the time.We were denied restroom breaks unless it was our break time.If we were busy we would go as far as 3 hours past our break time before we would get one.I also started to have medical issues at the time and I was calling in sick there for awhile and The doctors didnt know at the time what was wrong and Wal-Mart thought I was lying and just calling in just to do so.So they ended up firing me for missing to many days.I was an amazing worker for them.When it got busy on days they always would come to me to help at the check out lanes,or at the Customer service desk because I can be so polite and move quick all at the same time.I have never had any customers complain about me at any job."
bad,"My night of work at WalMart was to stock the the shelves in the store,and zone the shelves after I was done stocking and at the same time maintain customer service. The working enviornment was great I worked well with anyone on of my co-workers on night shift."
bad,"The store i was at was culture oriented.   First  store to cater to middle eastern culture,  It worked well for the first 6 months then the managment all changed and the store went downhill.  Not kept up,  dirty, whole new atmosphere."
bad,"The work is not bad at all however, the lack of basic communication skills among themselves in management is horrific."
bad,"Watch the movie, ""High Cost of Low Prices.""  I appreicate the change to move around without loosing my employment, usually with a ""price on family"" "
bad,"Overworked and underpaid.  May work 2 or 3 different departments without notice.  Hours will fluctuate---first shift one day, second shift second day, third shift the next.  Unpredictable.  Management pretends to care....not interested in training staff with personal experience or knowledge.  "
bad,"Typical large scale grocery store."
bad,Overall this was not my best experience. I always saw people getting their hours cut without explanation and never got straight answers to my questions about it. A typical day of work consisted of us being told that we couldn't interact between each other. I learned how to interact with the customers. My co workers were ok. I enjoyed working with them for the most part. The management wasnt that great with me though. the hardest part of my job was keeping my department full especially on a busy day. Some days I would be left alone and had to keep the area clean and at the same time I would still have to keep that area full of product. for the most part I didnt enjoy working there. It ended up just being a job and not a career and thats not what I am looking for.
bad,"My experience from working at Wal-Mart I found out that this company is not the best at providing customer service, from working at companies like Kroger and Publix, in which both of these companies pride themselves for customer service it is a total opposite at Wal-Mart. I seen associates catch attitudes with customers, some would not show a customer where a certain item they were looking for was. Wal-Mart follows a 10 feet rule which means that if you are within 10 feet of a customer you are suppose to greet them and smile. But from working there I could easily say that maybe 10% of the employees actually even speak to customers. And Wal-Mart also has very poor management, managers who talk down on you, some may yell or curse at you. And some of their managers even gossiped about certain associates to others. A very unprofessional environment to work."
bad,"I was going to college and working full time. I work in the deli, meat department and grocery. In the begining they would work with my schedule but at the end they fired me for accedently breeching policy."
bad,"I loved the benefits and while it was a great company to work for, there were a few flaws which left me no choice but to resign. In the specific store I worked for, it was probably one of the few Walmarts that closed at midnight instead of the usual 24 hours. The biggest flaw with the store was the management, they seemed to prefer favoritism over an employee's actual work ability. There were employees, who after just two weeks of the start of their employment, developed a romantic relationship with a department manager and was thus given special treatment. Also, there were employees who would just flat out refuse to work and chose to gossip their entire 7-8 hour shift, which left the employees who actually came in and worked to pick up their slack. Management, even those higher up than the store manager, refused to remedy the situation despite numerous complaints. I have asked for a transfer and the reason they gave me for not allowing me to transfer was that I was an exceptional employee and the store would go to shambles without me."
bad,This company does not appreciate there employees like they should but most of the managers are great to work with.
bad,"Managers do not respect you, you are a sacrificial pawn to them."
bad,"It is a fast past job that keeps you very busy at all times (which I loved). It is very hands on, people skills are a big must have. Management need to put a stop to employee abuse. The employer abuse is that the different shifts think they do more then other shifts and that let it be known. Employees of the different shifts are rude to each other as if one were better then the other not a fun environment to work in because of that."
bad,"A typical day at work is working and keeping myself busy, engaging with customers on a daily basis and making sure I meet their needs. This job has taught me customer service skills,how to operate register software and how to be a problem solver. Management is not always open to listen to the associates needs but sometimes they do. The hardest part of my job its standing for a very long period of time. The most enjoyable part of my day is knowing that I did a great job."
bad,Working at walmart is a plce where you have to be a people's person. It is all about customers and helping them find what they need. The co-workers there were ok it is just that it takes alot for everyone doing their part for you to have a balanced day. The hardest part was unloading trucks and the enjoyable part was customer service helping people where they needed you.
bad,"responsible for invertory and customer services, Made sure that store was clean and in order and that all customer were services to the best of our ability"
bad,the job itself was not bad just am not an over night person. needed to see the sun more often.
bad,I worked for the electronics department. I would work one on one with all the customers that came back to purchase anything having to do with electronics. I was able to watch videos on the different products that we sold so I had a lot of knowledge on the products I was trying to sell. I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the hours and not being able to spend the time i needed to with my kids.
bad,i appreciated my job. but i was treated very badly by management to the point that i had to leave.
bad,"while it may be a job, i applied to work with people. the job not only took me away from people, it took me out of my home life other than sleeping and eating. with split off days and no day time hours, i was out of energy for anything but work. i was supposed to be getting ready for college, but the job demanded more of me than i had mentally. granted it was easy work and i respect those who can do it but i need to work with people in order to be happy with my job."
bad,If you are able to work hard with severe staffing problems then Walmart can be a viable place of employement.
bad,management only cares about making money. They do not care about their employees and they are not treated good.
bad,I was an overnight customer service manager that loved my job and enjoyed making everyone smile.I worked with some great people that i miss dearly and most of all my customers.Staying productive and alert was my biggest task.My hardest of part of my job was staying awake some nights.Being a manager for so long gave me strength and motivation to do anything.
bad,"Managers had to high expectations, managers wouldn't thank us on the hard work that we did, instead told us that we didn't do good enough and to work harder and faster, even though the work was well over 10 hours and we did most of it in 7 hours."
bad,"The management here is awful at least at my store it was, they trained you for one job, but you did several only getting paid for the lowest job. I started out as a cashier but then got to working customer service which is like .50 more I never got the raise or the title working up there. Then they accused me of stealing money, which I never did, drilled me for a few hours & then sent me back to work, but nothing ever became of it & they apologized for harassing me they way they did when I never stole anything. I work hard for my money & I would NEVER steal from my job or anywhere for that matter."
bad,"El ambiente de trabajo era motivador para los asociados puesto que se regala café y pan dulce cada mañana, lejos de eso es dificil la promoción y los salarios son muy bajos."
bad,"As a Cashier and Back-Up Customer Service Manager (CSM) at Wal-Mart my typical duties included providing basic check-out devices to customers in the front end of the store, making problem resolution decisions for for other cashiers, managing cashier breaks and lunches, and taking any other action necessary for the smooth operation for the front-end of the store. In a management position I learned how to make decisions based on cost vs. customer satisfaction as well as how to manage a pre-determined employee schedule. The hardest part of the job was trying to please customers while working with the often insufficient resources supplied by upper-management. Accordingly, management-employee relationships could be ""strained"" at times. Likewise, my co-workers were a mix of newer, high-turnover risk people and longtime employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that my actions prevented the front-end from deteriorating into chaos."
bad,This company was okay to work for as a job but not much for making a career out of. Pay was low and work was high.
bad,"I worked at Sam's Club. I was at the membership desk, so I answered phones, set-up memberships and credit cards, returns/exchanges, tax exemptions etc. My co-workers made the job better. Dealing with irate members was a definite low point."
bad,"This was my first real job at the age of 17. I do not believe that the management worked with employees in the way that taught them the skills needed to advance and make them a better employee. I worked with about 4-5 guys, ages 17-18 years. We were expected to work things out for ourselves, which at times did not work out. This is where I feel management should have been responsible for helping build us and help mold us into better and productive workers. I enjoyed my fellow employees and enjoy helping people."
bad,"Enjoyed being sales associate for the com[pany .Liked working cash, and interacting with the public on a daily bases."
bad,"A review of a day at Walmart is kind of a wild card, especially if you're working on the salesfloor, the backroom is generally straightforward but if you're anywhere on the salesfloor, expect to be pulled out of your department to work in another place in the store to cover gaps in employment at least once per day, multiple times per day if you're good at your job. I've spoken with many associates who have transferred from other stores across the country and locally, there are a lot of problems here, profiteering has driven wages into the ground for an excessive amount of work, on the Inventory Control Team, pay is minimal for back-breaking labor oftentimes the lack of appropriate staffing and intense pressure to get your work done at faster than the already robotically high truck completion speeds make for a high-risk environment for injury, directly in contradiction of their policies towards heavy lifting, on the salesfloor you can get in trouble for not finding a second associate to lift a heavy box, while in the backroom you can get chewed out for taking the extra moment to try and save your back from lifting entertainment centers by yourself. Coworkers run the whole gamut, I've seen people with their masters degree, and people who dropped out of high school in the same environment, same pay, same respect. Prior knowledge from across the company, is rarely rewarded, and hiring is completely arbitrary. Management isn't incompetent, though, corporate rides management so hard that they barely have an oppportunity to truly manage in a way that they'd like to, I've seen lots"
bad,"A typical day at work would be picking out merchandise, and sending them out to the sales floored to be stocked by sales floor associates. Some days I would do sales floor counts on merchandise. I've learned over the years how to maintain, implement & use a backroom storage system to track merchandise. The hardest part of the job would be to deliver items on time, as multiple departments had multiple items to be picked at the same time. That created a lot of stress, having to figure out which departments to get merchandise out first, and thus letting other departments wait to get their stuff. Co-Workers were decent enough to deal with, but management would often times be unreasonable or couldn't figure out ways to better improve binning conditions."
bad,"Cashiering as usual, if not busy stocked shelves near your register. Learned all the cashiering knowledge I have. Management was adequate. Co-workers were great. Lifting heavy articles. Visiting with the people I worked with."
bad,"I was the opening CSM, I got the podium money in the drawers, counted and set. I made sure the money center and customer service desk was set with loan money so they were ready for business and customers wouldn't have to wait. I set the schedule board and made sure all breaks and lunches were covered and the amount of registers were opened as required by head office per hour. Gave job duties to cashiers and made sure department 82 freight (candy and gum) was filled and all carts of freight worked by 10 am and the front end kept clean and organized. I made sure the stock-man kept the lot clear of carts and help was given to him when needed to keep carts in the store ready for our customers use. I communicated with maintenance to make sure he helped when needed with the carts and to cover the stock-mans lunch and any concerns and where we needed him to start his cleaning first if a particular restroom was excessively dirty. I answered calls on the palm pilot, did register over rides and regularly signed off customer service desk returns. Helped at customer service as needed. Handled customer and associates complaints usually without having to call a manager higher up to confirm what I said was true and store policy. Helped at the money center or on register when they were busy as needed and gave loans to the money center and change orders to cashiers as they were requested. The best part of the job was working with such great people as my cashiers and most of the sales floor associates I worked with and helping our customers. The hardest part of my job was the new managers who"
bad,"Walmart is a pretty alright place to work at.. if you are a managers favorite. They play very favoritism (mostly between other managers or other above associate employees or full-time associates). Hours are fare, if you ask for a day off, 80% of the time, you'll get it(if you don't ask for more than two days in a row, otherwise, they'll give you split days). Managers have too high expectations of employees, usually getting onto you even if the job is done right. Only disciplines the employees that they don't care for, anyone else can get away with almost anything. But at least the pay is above minimum wage."
bad,unload gm trucks then pull pallets to the floor. unload grocery truck. pick merchandise from the bins. clean up the backroom and then clock out.
bad,Work culture and values are not passed onto all employees. Work done one day may be changed the next depending on which manager is calling the shots. (To many cooks in the kitchen.) Co-works are fun to work with. Job skills are not demanding but work load is very hi due to lack of employees.
bad,Walmart in la was better than GA learned there needs to be more competive with pay and not cut hrs
bad,"Após ser vendida (bompreço) ao grupo americano os dias de trabalho no grupo wal-mart passaram a ser bem agitados e stressantes,os aprendizados que obtive numa jornada de 7 anos de empresa foram:confiança nas pessoas certas,seriedade no que faz,apoio a colegas sempre e obstinação,sobre gerencia fica um pouco complicado pois eles eram substituidos constantemente,aos colegas de trabalho aprendi que devemos ter cuidados em quem confiamos e não devemos nos entregar a uma amizade sincera logo de princípio e nunca abandona-los numa necessidade profissional,a parte mais dificil do trabalho com certeza é tentar agradar quem não gosta de você e a mais agradável é ser reconhecido ou elogiado pelo seu trabalho,depois de um dia arduo de trabalho...Não tem preço...É muito gratificante mesmo."
bad,"talvez a parte mais complicada seja a administração de direção ou gerencia,que ocorre muito dentro do wal-mart,sendo efetuada várias mudanças na realização do mesmo serviço para que atenda as opniões pessoais de cada gerente ,diretor ou distrital"
bad,"- Answers customer/client requests or inquiries concerning services, products, billing, equipment, claims, and reports problem areas."
bad,"Wal-mart was one of my least favorite jobs. There truly was opportunity for advancement and there were a lot of great benefits. Wal-mart has way too many chiefs. It seemed everyone in charge of me had an order that contradicted the orders of their peers. I was so confused about what I was supposed to be doing, I feel I spent a lot of my time trying to track the managers down to get a consensus of opinion."
bad,"When I first started to work at wal-mart I was hoping that, all the stuff people were saying about it being such a bad place wouldn't be true once I actually started working there..."
bad,"Trabalhar no WalMart Brasil atendendo as lojas Bompreço foi muito importante para o desenvolvimento pessoal, pois os funcionários eram de fácil compreensão, desde gerente a caixa. A parte mais dificil era dispor de recursos para a compra de materiais necessários à manutenção elétrica. No WalMart dava para conciliar Universidade-Trabalho. Saí do WalMart pela oportunidade salarial que o Estaleiro propunha."
bad,"A typical day at work is standing on your feet for two to three hours at a time. At Wal-mart you've learn to manage your time and money lol because its not a good paying job, your co-workers are nice people at time. overall Wal-mart was a ok job"
bad,"Even though the customers have attitudes sometime, I still manage to smile. I've learned a lot within the 2 months while I was an employee at Walmart. People look out for you. They help you when you need it. I was making a good bit a money for me and my baby. My co-workers was very nice to me. When I didn't have a ride home, someone brought me. We always looked out for each other. The hardest part of the day was at the end of the day. When you're about to get off, that's when it seen to be longer. The most enjoyable part of the day was, my lunch break. I enjoyed that because I got a chance to talk to my family. I loved hearing their voices."
bad,"I worked in a great department where the people helped each other with each other jobs and special schedualing. My coworkers were very respectful and it was easy to coordinate work hours and dept. inventory with them. The training is done hand on, on the job. I worked very hard and learn almost everything on my own. The middle management changed all the time and it was hard to keep up with who was who. Problems with refrigeration and things like broken shelves or lack of carts to pull the product into the floor was very hard to resolve or get any action done. I think the main problem was that the top management all changed and they were also learning on the job. Consistancy was not a priority and there was a lack support."
bad,"you run from the beginning of your shift to end, it was exciting and frustrating at the same time, the associates and other managers make life at Wal Mart fun and pleasant. I learned to cope with customers that will never be happy, and always want something for nothing. my co workers, both in Pueblo, Co. and Brooksville, Fl, were wonderful, I am still friends with most of them. the hardest part was customers who tried to swindle, steal and cheat the company. The best part was children and older regular customers you got to know by name, and the associates."
bad,"Average work days consisting of keeping busy on the register or maintaining the aisle. Enjoyable part of work are the costumers, they all come different and some even make an impact on your whole life. The hardest part of the job was dealing with css people. My co-workers were great but it was a matter of the upper management who made things difficult constantly. Although it wasnt my favorite job it did pay the bills, on top of meeting a lot of costumers that I will never forget."
bad,my co worker were very welcome into the store and helpful with information what folding run back and forth for jewelry re-turn thing to the self i learned how to deal with difficult customer
bad,it was an experience in optical and customer service. i sold fit and adjusted glasses
bad,I love the people that I work with. It makes the day go by so fast.
bad,"The day would start out with doing mark ups and mark downs then ordering merchandise, zoning and building end caps for products on sale that week and taking care of customers."
bad,"the co-workers were nice,the hardest part of the job was the commute, the most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers. a typical day at work is working as a cashier. i learned how to deal with customer."
bad,Provided customer service by completing sale transactions and promoting sales. Assist customers with information and handling packages as well.
bad,Wordl leader in retail on fast expansion in India. Too much process oriented often confusing and not applicable in India.
bad,My job consist of overseeing department managers of the stores consumable departments.
bad,"you work 8 hours but be there 9hrs, the co workers are good workers friendly, i learned how to fix tires"
bad,"this type of work is simple, albeit labor intensive. however, indecisive management and roundabout work practices made simple tasks tedious and way more laborious then was altogether required"
bad,"I worked in the garden department at Walmart. While there I established a forklift certification along with other equipment. Also when it came time to quit due to returning to college they tried to withhold approximently $250.00 from my last pay check, that didn't sit well with me. And management was horrible couldn't give any direction for a new employee."
bad,"•Perform cutting, weighing, packaging and pricing the products."
bad,Es una empresa que me senti muy a gusto trabajando por el gran equipo de trabajo
bad,I would say that it is a good a place to work if you want to learn things but if you are a hard worker beware they do not treat their hard workers the best
bad,"Work 5 days of the week,"
bad,managers are hard to work for. all they care about are their paychecks. managers are not the brightest either. after so many months working there the job becomes difficult on the body on the body.
bad,putting stock away. learned alot about the different technology used. direct coworkers were great.
bad,"Fiquei pouco tempo nessa empresa, pois o salário era baixo e não oferece oportunidades para subir dentro da empresa.O bom de dessa empresa, é que tive muitos amigos."
bad,"A typical day at work varied from day-to-day. It could include one person doing everything (Donut making, baking, pulling out-of-date products, packaging products, setting out newly dated products, cake decorating, etc) until the next associate was due. Or it could be so full of employees everything would be done early."
bad,"Es una empresa en donde pude crecer como persona, en conocimiento, poder liderar, proponerse mestas y sobre todo compartir con gran equipo de trabajo."
bad,I work at some pretty cool places there was alot of pro in cons but but i love interacting with people so the cons to me is really peos.
bad,El trabajo se basa en la atención al cliente y el acomodo de mercancía cuando eres un asociado de linea.
bad,"Wal-Mart is what you make it. You will be paid minimum wage and as long as you can endure with high school antics you will be fine. You will gain alot of patience and a better appreciation for good customer service. working for wal-mart will make you better understand why you are frustrate when you shop there. There is a high turn over rate and when you try to change your schedule or if you have an emergency you find everything is done by a computer. If you want to last in a postion at wal-mart communicate, communicate, communicate."
bad,"WalMart is controled by american influenced corporation and therefore decisions regarding employee compensation (wages) and treatment are based upon values that are not common in our ever-growing Alberta economy. I was seeking a career opportunity and found little reward for hard work, dedication, loyalty and drive."
bad,taking people threw cashing them out
bad,"I found most of the people I worked with at Walmart to be good coworkers. Walmart is good at highering an array of employees. From young adults to mature seniors. They also employ people with disabilities. I commend them for that. To many stores on the malls only seem to hire 20 somethings. They also occassionally provide morale boosters in the forn of Pizza parties and yearly bbq. I was the top producer(# of sales) in my dept every month for 3 years, I also won an employee of the month award(I worked at a super center with hundreds of emploees). I was always on time and only took 1 sick day while working there.On the monday after black friday ( a very busy day) I was terminated for not completing a cell phone inventory. They said it showed a lack of character. If I didnt open, the inventory was rarely ever taken not even by my dept manager. Nothing had ever been said before in the 3 yrs. i worked there. Just before this we got new store manager. I was making several dollars more per hour than my peers. I was hired at a higher rate and had gotten consistent raises. I believe I was let go to cut costs. I believe this because I was told I could come back in 6 mo. but I would have to reapply and I would be hired at new employee rate. Also, over the next month many other better paid employees were let go.For 3 years I had been a dependable highly productive emplotee who only got praise for my work and suddenly im terminated for missing 1 small morning routine on one of the busiest days of the year. Strange."
bad,"My typical day at work (as an inventory supervisor) went like this: Arrived at work an hour before unloaders to ""prepare"" for the day. Ha, big joke. Was supposed to be printing out paperwork and getting backroom ready to unload the trucks. I either spent that time moving pallets in the backroom so we would have room to unload the trucks, or spent it in the office with management talking about how my unloaders weren't unloading trucks fast enough and if I couldn't motivate them to move quicker, they would replace me with someone who would. Trust me, I tried. I tried bribing with soda and candy, i tried reason, I tried yelling and screaming. Hard to motivate workers, who get treated like dogs, to do anything. Management has unreasonable expectations for the unloaders and they kick them around like dogs. It was mostly upper management, I never had a problem with the ""working"" managers, i.e. support managers."
bad,"I dealt with customers qestions and isssues, answering the best I could. Packing the items that they had chosen throughout the store. I also worked at the return desk, where I did returnes, exchanges, helped with item issues. Performed services such as money orders, paid bills, money transfers. I was a hard job, that had to deal with many people their attaduies and all at a fast pace."
bad,"The london store managment is awfull rude people , they harasse you, pick on u and down grade u . Other employes are great and athe beniits are good.They are bad about not working with your schedule with out being punish"
bad,"I like working at walmart, with the exception of working nights."
bad,"The management let the employees do basically whatever, and they didnt manage and distribute the work very well. co workers were rude to customers, and rude to other employees cursing etc."
bad,- A typical day at work is constantly busy
bad,i learned while working at wal mart that they will give anybody a position as long as u havent been in any trouble.
bad,Just don't! There really is nothing else to say...
bad,Fun at times
bad,No a place to work if you value family.not a great company at all.
bad,The job itself is great but there is no growth if you want to move up.
bad,I did refill and new prescriptions
bad,It wasn't the people I always work with it's the policy of the corporation.
bad,every day it never failed you'd have 4 to 5 bosses you report to and 4 to 5 conflicting ways to do your job
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with the customers that came into the store. The regulars would look for you to help them.
bad,"A typical day at work I do inventory on all cell phones. I check counts to make sure they are correct on our inventory. I asset customers with deciding which company they want for cell phone service and what type of phone they want,And teach them how to use it. I enjoy seeing a pleased customer with the selection i have helped them make."
bad,"They don't pay well, the benefits aren't very good, and the managers almost seem detached from the employees. You have to wait a lot longer to qualify for a raise and benefits than you would for most companies. It isn't easy to schedule time off, and there's no guarantee you'll get the time off that you requested. Most of the people are pretty nice, but most of them don't seem to like their job either."
bad,liked being busy and doing my own thing when i worked in layaway. hardest part was around the holidays. and working multipple departments at the same time with no assistance. and you would be told off for the smallest things.
bad,I did learn the register and I was friendly as a greeter but the commute there took more time than I was at work actually.
bad,Having meetings with management team. Print out sales for departments and see were the improvement needs to be. Balance the accounting office. Sign paperwork. Set schedules for the store. Unload trucks and place a team to put freight out. Keep osha and K-chemical compliance up to date. Handle customer issues. Plan for upcoming events. Review job applications. The hardest part of the job is losing good associates to other companys. The most enjoyable part is customer service
bad,wal-mart is one of the most untruthful/discriminatory workplaces i have ever been unfortunate to work in but they do have good benefits package
bad,"Wal Mart has low pay for the amount of work to be done. Benifits are expensive for the low pay. Wal Mart doesn't like to hire full time employess to recieve benifits. Wal Mart also likes to run thier business very short handed, and has high expectations for thier employee to complete taskes in those areas with less people."
bad,"At Wal-mart you can make good money, but you have to be a brown noser just to be able to move up int the ranks. So if you are looking to advance quickly in a job do not work for Wal-mart"
bad,When I worked there the staff were nice and friendly and helpful.
bad,"Working for Walmart turned out to be an unsatisfying,inconsistant,place of employment with many communication problems within management."
bad,its ok unless you have been with the company over 10 years then they look for reasons to get rid of you.
bad,I felt this place has poor management. The enviroment there was very stressful.
bad,"i loved my co-workers and manager but the upper managment didnt defend their own. they abused the ""customer is always right"" logo. there return policy made it impossible for their stylist to succeed."
bad,"Honestly the hardest part was the management. They refused to supply me with the basic things that they said they would. They were required to supply me with water , a rain Pancho, and sunscreen. I had to fight for those 3 basic things they said they would supply, for almost my entire time there."
bad,Good benefits but sorry management at this location.  They tend to look out for certain employees and then they only hire people who don't want to work.
bad,"The time management is slacking to say the most and needs some work done. The management team is decent and are very concerned on your time. The point system is very small, you don’t have many day that you can miss. The worst thing is they don’t accept doctor's notes when your sick."
bad,I Iove working with my coworkers. I've ways been able to help customers with any complaints or general questions they may have. I'm always up for a challenge at work and can do all task that need to be taken care of.
bad,"Management doesn't care about or support they're employees at all., and they aren't hands on with us. We do all the work for little work. We're definitely overworked and under paid."
bad,"I clock in work freight that is left from overnight, scan bins, verify overstock, maintain shelves, and do price changes, all while stopping to help customers. I would love to work at Walmart  if i had the right equipment/ help  to get the job done. Sometimes i can't verify overstock and do everything that comes after that because my equipment was never returned to my locker and there's nothing management can do about that, so i have to wait til an associate goes to lunch or an associate is absent in order to do my job. My other coworkers are friendly and understand the hardships of working there as a manager. the most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers because you never know what they're going to ask you."
bad,"Your coworkers are usually great but management can be really unmotivated, it's not a happy place to work but they are super flexible with scheduling."
bad,It's a great first job to have. It's possible to make it to high levels by working very very hard.  Impossible to have a manageable work life balance.
bad,The co-workers are great most people try to help out when they are needed the managers don't seem to respect people's opinions or tend to help with work just sit back and give orders
bad,When I started at Walmart it was just to provide some kind of second income for my house which it did but I'm finding the job otherwise just isn't for me
bad,Job requires a good mental state of mind and also to be in shape. I am satisfied with this job but it’s rather more a temporary than a permanent job in my opinion.
bad,Walmart use to be a great company to work for but now they have cut to much payroll you can’t get tasks completed and you spend most of your time running all over the store  the customers are always upset because there is no one to help them
bad,"All "
bad,"Almost everyone there are always hard at work. Associates here treat you like family. "
bad,I worked the overnight shift and it was very tiring. The managers would just walk around the store and act like their doing something but I would catch them playing around in the store. My supervisor was lazy and put all the hard work on everyone else so he didn’t have to do it. He had no knowledge of the job and would complain about work not being done when he could do it himself.
bad,Too many changes and not enough training. Managers had their favorites and associates would go from manager to manager to find someone to give into them. Upper management would seem to pick on certain people over others.
bad,"3 co workers and i stopped a shoplifter and then a few days later all 3 of us were called into the AP Office, we all were fired for breaking protocol. I will not work there ever again! Trying to save the store merchandise just to get fired for it."
bad,It's ok to work there bot if you're looking for a job that could take care of a big family with only one working it's not convenient do to the fact that most likely you will start part time
bad,"The best part about working here was just talking to the other associates. The hardest part of this job was coming in every single day, having to finish the other team's job for them, and then getting to do your own."
bad,Company is alright however managers/supervisors were unhelpful a majority of the time and would often upset customers. It’s a good job to clock in and out of but if you’re looking for something with more involvement I wouldn’t recommend.
bad,you get your hours which is good for a retail job. everyone there was miserable. sometimes the workload was stressful on busier nights but for the most part it wasn't that bad.
bad,"It’s a busy job and it takes a lot out of you, customers can be quite demanding, rude, and mean. It’s fast-paced, you have to be able to keep up. The hours are really random and they’ll often schedule you too much or too little."
bad,"It was an okay experience, didnt like it much, some mangers could be a bit harsh for new comers. Couldnt take off when sick after being told you could."
bad,It was very hard. I trained for my position but nothing was organized. I had a very hard time trying to learn my role because I was basically teaching myself
bad,"I worked there for about a year, and I got really sick at one point. They fired me because I was out for too long. I had pneumonia oh, and I even had a doctor's note to prove it. The manager just wanted me gone. It was the Hampstead Walmart. She's not there anymore, and everyone was really upset when I was fired because they knew it was wrong."
bad,"Very management dependent, if you don't have an assigned assistant manager over you, you're pretty much on your own until a crisis happens in your department."
bad,"At Walmart I got my job done in a time frame that was always over what was expected of me. So when I continued to do my job even at a faster pace and could not complete it in time, that gave me dismay."
bad,"I was so excited to work at Walmart,  things was going great in training/orientation . I was hired as a cashier but the manager put me where he needed me at . I didnt have a good experience working at walmart."
bad,"The reality is that your employers don't actually care. About their job or about you. You will run into a few fantastic people, managers or otherwise, but the overwhelming majority are lower-class people who got the job because the threshold is so low. Don't get me wrong, many of the people currently employed by Wal-mart are amazing, hard-working people, but because of how the hierarchy and policies work, you really just show up for the paycheck, or not at all. As an entry level job, Wal-mart is a fantastic place to show that you can work hard, but don't stay for more than a year or two. You will feel trapped."
bad,"I have worked for Wal-Mart twice now and both times the job itself was what I expected, but the management was horrible. Problems never got solved and rules were not followed at both locations I worked at."
bad,"The typical day at Walmart was good, normally there wasn't an issue with the work itself. I learned a fair amount about maintenance work there and began security work because I was good at observation, I was fairly good at my job and wanted to stay longer. However, I wound up quitting because of exceedingly poor management. No manager in the maintenance team because he wound up quitting because of arguments with management above him ( a manager never replaced him by the way). Other maintenance members wound up quitting because nobody was around to talk about disagreements and other rising issues. Machines used to clean the floors kept breaking down and would be broken for weeks and couldn't be used. I was given a job in security, only to be constantly pulled back to maintenance which was severely understaffed, when I left there was 2 people left for the entire store on third shift to do maintenance. The work itself was good, pay was good, and the people I worked with were great. I did not want to leave, but I wasn't going to do the work of 2 and a half people with improper tools and equipment. Oh, and my store didn't recycle which I am pretty sure is a violation."
bad,had issues with supervisors. one desired he would sweep and buff one spot in the grocery department for half if not more of the night. new people were coming in at 12 a hour and when asked for a raise was told they couldn't afford it. I was doing more then most and they could afford paying more to people who wouldn't have stayed longer then 2 months.
bad,"Starting out working ar Walmart was fun and I had a great time , but soon i started to notice everything in the background. When I moved into a higher paying position people started gunning for me, I had people send in reports."
bad,"I would walk around the store and pick walmart.com orders, and assist customers with whatever they may need. The hardest part was all the heavy lifting and dealing with upset customers. I enjoyed helping the customers and putting together a repore with the regular customers."
bad,"This job didn't needed to be 9 hours a day (especially since I didn't get paid for 1 hour) most of the employees were irritable or tolerable at best. Some were really trying but others were to depressing. The managers rarely seemed to care. It was not a job I enjoyed."
bad,Hopefully I never have to return to that company! gave that place nine years of my life and they screwed me over every chance they could get. will never go back
bad,It's okay to work in Walmart  warehouse I enjoyed the labor. And they kept plenty  water power aid and Air Fans for all employers. Production was must for all Employers Fast pasting Abilities are Enforceable When Need overall I enjoyed Walmart Distribution.
bad,"While working at Walmart I had to stock merchandise onto the shelves in an orderly fashion and make sure the isles were presentable to the customers, made sure the area I worked in was kept clean and clear of Devi’s from the boxes I had to unpack"
bad,"Learned to multitask and learn all departments. Customers always come first. I would go above and beyond to help customers. Always do what was asked. From unloading trucks,stocking shelves ,zoning ,cashiering, mixing paint, making keys, etc. Pretty flexiable with hours. They prefer part time workers."
bad,"I learned how to be a better person , control my attitude, an how to manage co-workers."
bad,Walmart was a good place to work for I work both cashier and Deli I love my job and my managers were decent I worked as cashier and then went to Delhi hot foods
bad,"muito extressante trabalhar com o walmart, nao vale a pena"
bad,Previously employed as only female maintenance personnel for majority of my period of employment.  Constantly felt like I was being ridden about not doing my job enough or well enough.  Felt like I could not measure up.  Not able to be say much of benefits if there were any that I could have been eligible for.
bad,"The customers act entitled, walmart's management expects way to much from their employees and their attendance policy is a five point strict guideline."
bad,The management  was even quitting left and right even though they were the cause for the friction . A lot of misconduct  was performed so it just wasn't the type of workplace that I needed to be in
bad,"Expectations are high, but achievable in theory. My store in particular has a stressful management team that fails to set their associates up for success."
bad,"Great place to learn and grow. A learned a lot by working with this company, it was a great experience and later down the road I would like to go back"
bad,"They have great benefits, but they don't care about the people that work for them.  They pretend that they do, they will use you for all your worth..."
bad,Good place to find a job quick I really need a job I hope they help me find a good paying job I’m a hard worker I’m good with it Customers I get along with  coworkers
bad,I loved working there it was just a few guys that have been there longer then me that had cocky attitudes for no reason. So i thought it was best that i leave.
bad,Typical work day would be clocking in washing your hands getting ready to serve customers. It has poor management management harass me since I've been there. Work environment is okay not very good. The hardest part of my job is dealing with angry customers. But the most enjoyable moment of my job would be serving the customers.
bad,I enjoyed the job I had but was not happy with the management or how they treated and dealt with associates and they’re problems. The job had great benefits and was understanding when situations arose that couldn’t be helped.
bad,"Working in Walmart is stressful and tears you down quickly if you can't keep up. The company is far from the original vision Sam Walton had laid out. All the company cares about is profit, and the employees suffer because of it. With super strict attendance policies, you have little breathing room if you get sick or have an emergency. They do not accept doctor's notes for missed days due to illness. Seems they would rather you come in with the flu than excuse absences due to the flu."
bad,"I view Wal-Mart as a stepping stone job. That being said, if it wasn't for self entitled customers and disrespectful management it would be a fine place to work. Hours and pay are okay, especially compared to similar jobs."
bad,walmart is a good place to work we worked as a team.The only thing about walmart is your not a full time worker and you dont get 40 hrs. I loved meeting new people and work friends .
bad,You must not get caught in the small mentality world in that D.C. Its not Walmart it's just the alachua DC. Lots of others that work at the D.C will agree that other DCs aren't like this one. Alachua D.C has so many unsafe practices. And rats and no one has done anything yet. People are always getting seriously injured here.
bad,"Personally Walmart wasn't the worst job. The biggest concern is that the management was poor. Scheduling wasnt the greatest, was made to offend others if you had emergencies pop up and had to leave. The pay was pretty good, and at times certain managers were good to work with. As far as I am concerned, I don't think it's terrible. I think that it will become tiring and stressful but it definitely pays your bills. It shows you what you want in life and to grow. For that I am grateful for Walmart and all the life lessons I've learned, but I would call this a beginner job or to get you by a few months type of job."
bad,"Over the last 8 years I have worked at Walmart in a few different positions. I have spent a large portion of my life working here and I'm still getting paid the same as somebody off the street, regardless of my performance being largly greater than thiers. The annual raid is only 2% of your wage. My PTO accumulates at a snail's pace. I could go on..."
bad,"as a department manager you have a lot to do. get to work at 7am zone, returns, clean up department, then go to the backroom and take care of your bins and carts. you also have to do price changes and handle inventory."
bad,"Your just a number, they fire many employee's every week and are always hiring. You are always worry if today is the day your fired? Not a relaxing feeling."
bad,"They will pretty much hire anyone.  Not a lot of accountability.  Not much room for advancement.  It's a job though, you can also make your own schedule for the most part."
bad,"It's an awesome job. The company is going in the right direction. Also,from my experience the workers,managers,and customers are very nice. As a Walmart family we all stick together."
bad,"I worked quite hard for this company and put all my effort into trying to better myself through advancement. Managers were understanding, but some had their favorites, it was undeniable. If you have a real medical problem, don't expect sympathy if the paper work isn't perfect, they'll fire you in a heartbeat and replace you with the next peon no matter how well you did there. The work is fast paced and can sometimes be overwhelming, but as a starter job cashiering, I suppose it's not too bad."
bad,"The benefits weren't all that great and you get only a few sick days. Low staff so I worked more than one area and became stressful, management wasn't all that great either."
bad,"Management really doesn’t care about you and your schedule. All they really care about is the customer service and the sales, you yourself are just a number to them. The Walmart I work for in Escondido #05996 the store manager plays favorites and if she does not like you, you will not have the hours or the respect, as the favorites here your royalty  and treats the other managers like dirt."
bad,Woking at Walmart was okay. The salary for the job should have been higher. Management was okay. The hours were good but they would over work their Employees.
bad,I worked there for almost 20 yrs.  They took away all incentives for retirement. No family life balance for salaried managers.  I and many others sometimes spent 12 -15 hours a day there.
bad,"The pay is great, the place is also great. But if it wasn't for terrible management Walmart would be a great work environment but however, the work environment is terrible with how they deal with problems with other associates even more so if the associate is a supervisor. They also claim they understand that customer comes first but still want employee's to finish the tasks that are given before the end of the shift."
bad,Not a good job if you are looking for s work life balance. Constantly getting told to stay or come in day off. Vacation is hard to take and it feel like you will lose it just because vacations can’t overlap
bad,They expected you to work like you were 10 people and got upset if you didnt get all that work done.  They expected you to work short handed and/or by yourself on the busiest days.
bad,The job force is growing rapidly especially in Pharmacy.  This company has yet to show the want to retain loyal employees. Incentives are too few and far between. when all others see pay raises because of wage increases the rest of the store sees pay increases. Pharmacy technicians see no part of it.
bad,The managers were rude and didn;t know how to talk to people.  I liked the people I worked with.  I knew my job and what was expected of me every day.
bad,Easy job great people I had personal issues going on which made it hard for me to continue working there I would recommend it to a friend it's a decent job
bad,"Walmart is well on it's way to be the next Kmart. They don't want to spend any extra money on their company. And they want one employee to do the job of six. But if you go in there and show up as your supposed to and you work even somewhat hard you'll advance. "
bad,The work itself wasn't bad mostly slow-paced and boring. the daily list was very broad and not really clear on what needed to be done. management was basically non-existent other than the department managers which was great and actually gave some direction as to what needed to be done. the daily group sessions they had for revenue and such was just a waste of time not really giving information as to how well anyone was doing.
bad,"as pregnant woman working there.."
bad,"To much favoritisms to move up "
bad,How to work more efficiently the hardest part of the job is unloading the trucks but it gets done. I personally think the management could be a bit more helpful
bad,Management sets unrealistic deadlines and sets unattainable goals. There are many tasks requiring a managers approval while management is hard to get assistance from.
bad,"Walmart definitely has potential to be a good place to work but please do yourself a favor and leave if the following occurs. If you report harassment at your store, and that member of management is undeterred enough to continue their behavior it's not going to change. That is not to say that Walmart is all negative, there are great people that deserve recognition as they are invaluable to the company. Take note Walmart, if you treat employees right there will always be a benefit to customers and the company. "
bad,"Management sucks, no opportunity to move up even though I was consistently the fastest cashier for years. Because I excelled at my job, they forced me to stay as a cashier even after applying to other positions and asking to be moved multiple times. Only got to move up after switching stores. This job taught me a lot of patience because customers are impatient, hard to deal with, and angry 99% of the time. They push you hard to sell the Walmart Mastercard with little incentive and also expect you to scan a certain amount of items per hour to the point of becoming injured (i.e. carpal tunnel) which many of my fellow cashiers started to develop after the new push to increase speeds.A good starting point for a teenager's first job, but would not recommend working here for over a year unless you wanna deal with favoritism by the managers and lots of politics."
bad,"Management is biased, associates are slow, customers aren't being helped, Point of sale is seldom open, trucks arrive late, deadlines are missed due to poor team efforts."
bad,"While I was compensated well after having been there for 15 years, I can tell you it wasn't roses. The ""attendance policy"" allowed for a manager to single people he/she liked out and approve theirs, while others were held accountable for the exact same concerns."
bad,"Has gotten worse and demanding with more metrics they want you to achieve. Also, plans are in place to change management job structure so don’t know day to day if I’ll have a job"
bad,"Was fun at times but became very stressful due to lack of employees not being hired after leaving. Was always work too do , but Walmart always has raised their standards over and over again"
bad,I worked there 18yrs and did whatever they asked me to do and more I feel I mistreated and under paid while working there I loved what I did and didnt wanna leave but wasnt going anywhere in that store
bad,Walmart needs to pay their workers more money.  And treat them better than how they treat them. Better leave options when workers needs to take off and schedule people right.
bad,"I loved my job when I worked at Walmart. I enjoyed the people I worked with, and there was always an opportunity for advancement if you showed the right attitude and work ethic. However, when our former Store manager retired and we received the manager that is currently there, things started to change at our store. Advancement opportunities were given to people based on their social relationship with the manager rather than their qualifications or work ethic. The store began to feel more stressful and the feeling of family that was there began to fade. Now that Walmart is making changes toward ecommerce as a company, it is even less of a decent place to work. Sure, the company raised the wages, but they slashed the hours of their associates. They are no longer understanding of familial situations, even if you are a single parent with no outside resources to help in the event of a child illness. Absences are counted against you, even with doctor's notes, except for in a few situations. Entire positions are being deleted to make room for their gravitation toward online shopping. As a whole, the company and the store that I worked at have become stressful and basically not worth it."
bad,I really feel like it wasn’t a place to make a career. Because the managers were sometimes unfair and we would sometimes have to figure things out on our own from nothing.
bad,My experience was ok some of the people at Walmart very unprofessional they had people they liked more then other some of the bigger associates were Very childish
bad,while working at Walmart i've learned the workplace culture but also the most enjoyable parts of working there. at the Walmart in Benton harbor is that is was hard to work with supervisors and to talk to managers with out having favor. i was kind if dysfunctional without the managers noticing that job schedule being changed frequently and hey will blame it on the computers for changing schedules.
bad,"Managers did a very poor job instructing associates and were constantly giving terrible instructions. The pay was well, and the mandatory hour long lunch break was enjoyable."
bad,"Not friendly environment. A lot of shady business. Just overall poor schedule making, always switching days and a lot of call ins. It was a very poor work environment and management was actually pretty decent."
bad,"Nice work environment. Not a plasce I would want to work for over 2 years. It definitely has its pros and cons, I want go into detail because I am bias a bit."
bad,"Les clients sont extrêmement désagréable. Ils peuvent se fâcher parce qu'ils n'ont pas eu de sac, ils portent plainte pour rien, bref, ils sont mal élevés. "
bad,"Walmart would be a great place to work if the structure they have in place was used correctly. Department  managers are only stockers."
bad,"Typical day includes completing multiple tasks."
bad,"Walmart was a temporary job to begin with and then all of a sudden I've been there for two years being a cashier there was really soul draining I don't miss it, staying in one spot for hours was just not for me."
bad,"The job was a typical job as I was a sophomore in high school however, they seemed as if they didn't care what I wanted my schedule to be and they overloaded me with hours when I had school the very next morning."
bad,"Walmart is a great first job if you don't mind working under people who still think they're in high school. It's a very cliquey place to work, and management likes to play favorites."
bad,"Basically I work in the automotive center & i have to ring customers out , check customers in for their cars & etc & have to zone and stock frate but if I don’t have the isles zoned I hear the manager mouth or what they call it “coached”"
bad,"Day in Day out there was almost Always a Problem with equipment. Supervisor that was put in charge pulls people out from deli to Bakery so there will be 6 people working and nothing got done in the bakery while there all laughing and gigging leaving 1 or 2 people in the deli then comes over and asks why are we not getting anything done so when night falls the deli has to pick up the Slack for Bakery since no one is there to finish Breakout and make new bread Ect."
bad,"The town I was in made working there difficult because of the cliental. However, I had a great manager who taught me every step of the way. It was a rad stressful at times though."
bad,"Walmart did not give me my right pay because I was working over night , they kept telling me they were gonna fix it and never did. They didn’t train me either"
bad,"I have the best coworkers that anyone could ask for.  My customers are wonderful as well. I am being laid off because of restructuring and my name was just ""picked out of a hat"""
bad,My coworkers and customers are the only reason i stayed at long. They all have great personalities and was fun interacting with. Management on the other was terrible and expected me to cover other positions even tho mine is already a handful. Also no help in my department when needed.
bad,"Doing the tasks that are assigned, learning to cashier and reading barcodes. The hardest was pleasing customers and doing WIC checks when doing the registers and the enjoyable part is helping co-workers and customers find products."
bad,You will often individually be given reasonable work loads as a day to day but do not expect to get all the departments your cap 2 team is supposed to finish.
bad,"they had no tolerance for people who are different and disabled, you had to be a robot just doing the work, never saying anything, have no tolerance for people with disabilities"
bad,The job I had was fast paced and my tasks were timed but everyone barely if not made the time. They based there time off of a computer which isn’t relevant and they don’t include how many times customers ask for something and you having to show them where things are.
bad,I was losing my passion for my capabilities and pride I put into my job. You are not given time or help to do the job properly. There should have been 4 people for the job during the shift and several days a week only 1 person to do the job of 4. The supervisor and assist management didn't even try to uphold Walmart standards and policys. My immediate supervisor would go help other departments and leave me to work alone saying he trusted my capabilities and knowing 1 person could not do the job. Every time I questioned procedures or policy I was blown off and told other departments were priorty or it was someone else's job. They say you can transfer positions if available after 6 months but I was repeatedly told I could not transfer because they would not have anyone to do the job I was doing and were not going to hire in that position. I was told they had people working in other departments under maintenance title to up their quota and that left no availability to hire.
bad,"Walmart can be a nice place to work: However the management plays favorites, ignores standard operating procedures and don't know how to delegate tasks properly"
bad,"It is clear that corporate leaders do not care about their associates as people. Every time a new policy or protocol is added, it seems like they want us to be overly, perpetually optimistic drones who can do more work than is humanly possible or reasonable if we want to keep good customer service. Coworkers get along nicely, but Walmart doesn't care where the money comes from as long as they can make as much as possible as fast as possible."
bad,"Too many bad stories to tell about working there. From horrible customers to poor managers (not all of them). I could write a book about how bad it was. Though there were some good things, like good coworkers (usually) and stories that are funny in retrospect. It was the corporate side that made it soo bad."
bad,They have began pushing those of us who have been with the company for years and have benefits out the door.  Managers have double standards. They are offering buy outs to the ones who are in the 20 yr bracket. Those of us who didn’t want to take it. They find a way to get you out the door.
bad,Entras a la hora indicada y los horarios son flexibles el trabajo a veces era mas físico pero siempre estuve aprendiendo acerca de papelería de cajeros y como atender a la gente de forma respetuosa la parte mas difícil supongo que es acostumbrarte a como se trabaja
bad,Salary was a little on the low side. Good job if you are high school student looking for part time employment. Advancement was easy but the reward for advancement was in my opinion not worth it.
bad,Walmart is always changing things and it's not about family like they said. If you find a good manager then it makes the job better.  Judge for yourself.
bad,I enjoyed working in TN but here in Biloxi it was terrible! They expected me to throw cases of water and chemicals on my first night even though I had never worked in stock before. Workers were rude and they said I was a no call no show on one of the days I was told I had off so they fired me for their lack of communication.
bad,"You’re just another number in this company. If the warehouse or building is doing good, it’s fine. If it’s not, you’re not. A company that looks at you as a statistic rather than a human being."
bad,"On my first day out on the floor, while another employee was supposed to be training me, my manager came by with HR and asked what i was doing because i wasnt sure what to do after i had stocked the bananas. I had already been all over the back of the store to look for him and he had just dissapeared. My manager was understanding and told my to go take my lunch while she looked for him."
bad,Management tends to choose favorites and would never hold anyone accountable when things didn't get done. The pay was ok but the management team did not appreciate hard work.
bad,It’s cool for a starting job. Not all managers are bad. Way to meet new people and work in a pretty decent atmosphere. Learn how to work in retail it’s fast passed and really busy.
bad,"No one cares about you or your problems. They will let you go in a second. Regional Manager of HR is clueless and lies to you. Regional  Manager of the Buffalo market, is useless, and only cares about how he is seen by his boss and not about the problems of the store. They both made bad choices about who they selected with restructuring the CO-Managers. Since then they have put inept people in their place, and the ones we had before were knowledgeable and caring.You continue to take away some of your best people and only make it harder to get things done. Congratulations you have ruined one of the best stores in Buffalo."
bad,they cut hours to make up for giving out bonus on checks. they refuse to recognize that they have few people doing certain jobs in an area. management makes poor decisions.
bad,"Cool and all. You don’t get raises really. For example I worked there for 2 years and didn’t get one. We are supposed to get a annual raise, well then moving us up to 11$ a hour was considered that raise. Walmart is cheap af too."
bad,"The co workers were great, the managers were terrible. I am a hard worker and they were just unprofessional! I came on time I did whatever I was told."
bad,I was repeatedly harassed and bullied by the same coworker multiple times and management did nothing to resolve it. I ended up having to quit or that lady would have surely caused me to commit suicide...
bad,I do not wish to elaborate on this as I am not certain I could comment in a way that it would be complimentary. I learned how to hold my tongue when facing angry public.
bad,"Walmart is like a corrupt father who is always thinking to cut cost from his children(worker).  If you are good on your job, do not work at Walmart.  You will have 4 points to get fired. if you leave 2 hours before the scheduled time, you will get 1 point. You wil get point if you are sick too......  Store management are full of stupids who only got promoted for working long time, not by talent."
bad,"They give the opportunity to go up en the positions, they post every position available and every body have the same opportunity to apply and getting the positions"
bad,Pretty laid-back place to work the job itself is pretty easy management helps you as much as they can with any problems that you might have have pretty flexible hours
bad,"Management wouldn't work with you if needed to switch hours. Hrs would even get cut like a punishment. Management played favorites and wasn't consistent with anything.  Some training stores, while manager (store) would be there a year, some that stayed, if didn't like, tried to get rid of. Some got fired for doing what's right, and making known about problems; took retaliation"
bad,"My ex husband worked for Walmart when Sam Walton was still alive and it was a great place to work. Since it went corporate, it's not about the employee anymore. It's all about the sales and money. And the ""training"", or lack thereof, SUCKS! I've pretty much had to train myself for my job."
bad,"the pay is good & the benefits are great...only bad thing is that they dont stand by there word...its never enough for them & they always want more even after production is made, they keep pushing"
bad,"Be able to work weekends and evenings. If not, lose hours. Expected to take absolutely whatever horribleness customers dish out. Management spotty, some good, some totally incompetent."
bad,Okay place to work.Does not stand on the principle & policies that made company great.No appreciation for going above & beyond.Hours are often cut.Short staffed.
bad,"Working at this comany is a gamble that you keep rolling on. If you get the right position at the right store at right time with the right management, you could have a fufilling job that you take pride in. It does happen. It doesn't last, though. Managers are pushed to either promote or get out, and the average time you get with a single boss is about 4 months."
bad,"Managers are always complaining when they don’t have associates to help but  they werent very nice , wasnt motivating or very helpful themselves. Injust did my job and went home."
bad,The people yu work with are very disrespectful also they do not provide overtime which i feel is not and good thing because there if you go over your time yu get in trouble for it
bad,Have never seen a store meeting walmart expectations. There is always something that your boss can come in rip you up for so even though they say they will not micro manage your schedule what they really mean is if your not in your store then you will be held accountable. In 6 years with Walmart only had one good manager that taught and trained and developed.
bad,"I worked there for awhile, and was thankful that God aloud me a job there. Im also very thankful and blessed that God aloud me the job that i have now."
bad,"Walmart is a place for people who don't want to do anything with their lives. (obviously this depends on the person) This job is easy. All you do is check receipts and greet customers."
bad,"The managers at Walmart pick favorites. My supervisor had gotten me pulled into the office for things I didn’t do, and is constantly on my back when I’m doing my job, but when a different associate isn’t doing theirs nothing is said. Occasionally we get free food in the break room, just about once every quarter.  The associates are put to more work than what’s in their job code and sometimes won’t even be able to go back to what they need to do and be behind the next day."
bad,They ask you to do a ton of work for low pay. The regular associates do more work than managers and the managers get paid to just watch. They offer good benefits of full time.
bad,Wal-mart the name can speak for its self They can try to pro vide Stuff the customers local and out of state visitors one stop store lots of parking open 24 hrs.You can go on-line to find what you need.
bad,"Management never knew what was going on and would sweep anything inappropriate their favorite employees did under the rug, while over punishing employees they did not like."
bad,"Can be great, or not. Depends on the management, some just push without considering the lives they are pushing, while others lift you up."
bad,Hours are inconvenient and management would not help me change that because it wasn’t convenient for them so I got to the point where I had enough of it and that’s why I’m leaving
bad,"it was okay there I didn't mind it the work was pretty easy, and it was laid back, but the management and the employees are super nosey and messy. rumors get around fast there"
bad,extremely unorganized no one is on the same page. Management makes you do your job along with everything else as well all on top of meeting your very unrealistic times and very unnecessarily stressful every single day.
bad,"Pretty much what you would expect from a big box store. You have to fight tooth and nail to advance, they are more likely to hire an external candidate with leadership experience then promote a tenured employee without it. They offer some leadership development training but the programs come and go so often that they do not count for much. Pay was sub par even at a manager level and benefits were bottom of the barrel."
bad,"Working for Walmart was an amazing experience especially working in the Loss Prevention field. However, management did have their favorites and I was not one of them for what ever reason. I was terminated from Walmart for reaching the threshold for points before you were terminated. With this, I was sick, throwing up at work, and had to leave to go to the doctors. With excuse in hand putting me out of work for a period of 1 week, I came back to work and tried to hand them my doctors note. They did not accept it and would not remove the 7 points (1 point per day) from my record. After I came back from being sick, I worked one day, was off the next and I was terminated on my day off. I went to work the following day thinking I had a job, but they did not bother to call me saying to not come to work. So after showing up, I found out I was terminated and had to turn right back around and drive 45 minutes home. Circling back to the point system, I know for a fact they could have taken those points off. As asset protection, we get notified every time a change is made where points were taken off, or attendance times were adjusted. There were certain people that would constantly have their points removed and were able to keep their job but not me."
bad,It's a not bad job the people are fun and chill. But the manger there they need more training and a chill pill. They are the people they try to make other feel like bad and they are stuck there. Other then that its a fun job just you need to do your job
bad,During the first couple of months the job was fun I worked hard and got out on time daily. My job was easy didnt have to push myself as hard as I did but I did to show that I was willing to do the job.
bad,"When my husband passed away I was only given three days off. It resulted in me taking a day off work, going back to work for two days, and then using the second and third days for his service and memorial."
bad,Stress free workplace. Fast pace. Be respectful towards customers. Help customers understand what food is what and how long its been sitting in the heater.
bad,Most of the time you work the same area when you work . At the end of my time there managers would come out and make sure the over stock was really over stock . They checked almost all the over stock that went to the backroom .
bad,"Way too many managers, being directed to preform different task by each manager, no communication, not schedule friendly, does not talk or treat employees well as they once did several years ago"
bad,I worked 12 hrs and didn’t get a lunch break! They also was making us work over 2 extra days! Plus no holiday pay ! The production there is ridiculous. Pay is good but not worth it to me!
bad,"Workers were great, but there were few workers for so much work, management likes to play around and distract people that are supposed to be working. And leaving other people to do their work"
bad,I do not recommend this place for a job. I'm sorry but i used to love it thier now i feel like im some kind of criminal when i leave because they make a huge deal about walmart policy to show receipt lol=) Also some managers are no good but some are awesome people.
bad,The managers need lead by example they tell you one thing and do another. Like example. You can't be on your phone but they are on the phone taking to family/ friends/ other half.
bad,Needs better management. Also they show offer full time  positions other than for management positions. Less showing favoritism towards certain individuals.
bad,"Take care of your associate, there the one's who bust their backs to make the store keep going. Don't take your associate for granted. Without your associate, the store can't progress."
bad,"It’s a lot of managers in the company that only look out for certain people to succeed, the hard workers earn nothing in return compared to the slackers. Hours gets cut Often forcing a lot of full time workers to be put in as part time due to the hours given to match the cost of living."
bad,My whole day is just facing and straightening aisles and keeping them clean. I assist customers in locating items or suggesting different items if we're out of stock.
bad,Always trying something new at any cost to make more money. All changes benefit the greedy not the needy. Pay is decent but you earn every cent thru hard work and stressful environment.
bad,"Is place to grow,but it has turn in to greedy company with bad management. Only the favorites move up the ladder. No matter your skills you will be overlooked."
bad,"The employees at the Roswell store are toxic. It’s no wonder that store is the way it is. Very poor management for the most part, there are few actual good managers. Hostile work environment."
bad,"very busy"
bad,I would recommend working here for anybody who is new to the job field. There is a strict time and attendance policy that must be adhered to and some managers are better than others but this is at most jobs. All in all work is work.
bad,"As a cart associate, I did more work than 90% of the store, and yet, we receive the lowest wages. They did *NOT* provide adequate tools; the one mule (cart machine) broke down often, and it would often take several months to fix. We are often the LAST to hear about any changes in the store (mostly understandable since we work outside). Management was almost always on our case about how we did our job (even though we did things the right way). Very rarely would we see any salaried member of management help out, even though they were the ones that got onto us the most."
bad,"Not very fair, they keep changing my days of being off, they dont give me enough hours, and i have been there almost two years and have never had a weekend off."
bad,It’s a pretty good job to have if you’re a younger person and it’s not holiday season. When holiday season comes then get ready for everyone’s BS. Even your own coworkers and management. They make you do stupid jobs that you didn’t sign up to do
bad,"Most stressful job, retail depends on product being placed correctly and quickly.  Newer generation has 0 concept of work ethics and is only concerened with pay"
bad,Very stressful workplace where being a favorite gets you ahead.  The job itself is not difficult but it is made difficult by the expectations of management.
bad,Friendly people but management is horrible. Would not recommend starting a career here. The company does not care about your success and can lay you off at a moment's notice just to pocket more money.
bad,"I love that Walmart offered  me my best paying job as a pharmacy tech but, they seem to be looking for a reason to fire new hires. If it isn’t the insane attendance/sick leave policy(which they may change from a 9 point to 6 point system) or the meal exception they try and fire you over when you are just trying to finish your work. They give you a 30 min lunch in the pharmacy. Practically no complaints about my department management but store management was awful."
bad,"The store you work at is directly responsible on whether or not you're going to have a positive work experience - specifically your management team. If you have a bad management team, you're going to have a bad time, especially if you plan on making Walmart a career. That being said, working at Walmart CAN be a great thing. The pay is fair and competitive, the benefits are good, and there's quarterly bonuses. I wouldn't recommend anyone that takes holidays and family time seriously work here as there isn't much of a work-life balance because it is retail. Again, though, it really depends on your  management team."
bad,"While I worked hard other slacked and got paid better than I did."
bad,"A typical work day at Walmart, some workers like myself, get treated unfairly. The communication there is very poor. Although, I’ve become more organized with my time at Walmart. Overall, the job is fairly easy, you just have to know how to handle certain things like, being cold in the freezer, and how to deal with angry coworkers and customers."
bad,"I think the biggest thing I've learned is respect for everyone. The next thing is know your products procedures,and polices. The more you can relate to the customers they will appreciate the knowledge that is available to them."
bad,"When corporate took over scheduling customer service suffered tremendously which is my number one priority.Their new school "
bad,"Good place to work, hard to move up."
bad,A typical day is coming to work and usually finishing what the other crew should have finished before my crew arrives. Helping multiple customers constantly when on the floor. Trying to find space and make space for pallets and freight in a overcrowded store. Most managers don't help associates work.  Unloading the truck is relaxing and working in the back is better. The hardest part of the job is just moving the pallets around the small store and so many customers are oblivious and rude and in the way all the time.
bad,"Not a good enviroment to have a quality life outside of job.  With the workplace now saturated with pharmacist, there is an increasing demand of tasks to be dealt with each day and even your days off."
bad,"una empresa que forma personas para cualquier trabajo, capacita constantemente a su personal, disciplina y honrrades"
bad,"I started out good at Walmart, but since a lot of people stayed over their schedule time unpunished. So most everyone’s hours were cut. I had to go to school and make a living so I briefly chose school"
bad,Fun place but management is poor not a career oriented job and a lot of favoritism at all levels of the company. Hard to move up even though u are a good worker.
bad,walmart is a decent place to work just have to ignore the drama created by others around you. they listen when you are needing help to make payments on your house. they went out of the way. friendly environment.
bad,"Walmart is a great company to work for, but management can run away your best workers away. The pay is great!!! Its not the associate its the managements the drive the associates to run away."
bad,Walmart isn’t the best place to but it’s a job. I left because of the management. I’ve worked in three different stores and the problem is usually a terrible store manager. If you’re lucky you’ll get a direct manager who is actually good.
bad,working at walmart  was a good job for me it was my first time ever working in a place like that.. my surrondings was different and they people was different the mangerment was good to
bad,Being a Cap Team 2 member we had to unload the truck and place each box neatly in the department that they belong to. After we got done unloading the truck would go to the department that we were assigned and started to stock until it was time to get off at 11pm.
bad,You are always told/asked to do things one way and 5 minutes later they change the way you're doing it. The Walmart in Greencastle was a little confusing to work for.
bad,"Typical day always starts off very stressful due to that for months we where under staffed and over worked for months, however for what i have learned from my time there are the proper communication skills and social skills to help drive sales."
bad,"I liked the customers and being of their assistance. Was just too unstable for me. Looking for consistency, and fast pace work environment. Sometimes customers were a bit over whelming."
bad,Managers are disrespectful. Stay to yourself and just do your job. Friends are not a priority at this job. Treat it as if your in high school all over again.
bad,"It's pretty easy to do. But if you have a family emergency they will fire you and tell you that you ""Put family over work.""  Even though you called out first and told them on the phone that there was a death in the family. And you never missed a day before having that one family emergency."
bad,"I was there for two years, and regarding my two years of employment there, I was yelled at, cursed, and degraded by management. I eventually had to leave the job as the environment there was becoming too toxic and was causing me more stress than I could handle as I am also balancing going to school."
bad,"It is a fast paced environment, management has no regard for associates health or well being. They change everything, and make your job harder than it needs to be. Everyone gets paid the same amount. You are asked to do things that are not in your job description. No communication between managers."
bad,"Worked there for almost 30 years. Walmart worked well with my personal life and was flexible for my family for many years. The company no longer seems to care what else you have going on in your life and wants you to be available all the time. If you're not, you wont get the hours you need, even when you've been there as long as I have been. Too bad. Used to be a decent company to work for."
bad,I truely loved my job at Walmart but the company itself is really bad.  The personal touch with the managers slowly went away.  Once we got the raises the started getting rid of positions and adding the work load to other dept.  The hardest was watching all the younger kids get the positions that I had been trying to get for along time.
bad,"en el día a dia se maneja la competencia lo que te da muchas ideas de como mejorar las cosas, puedes aprender del mundo laboral pero no es un lugar para quedarse toda la vida, salarios como los precios que manejan."
bad,When I started at Wal-Mart 14+ years ago it was a wonderful place to work. It has gotten real bad with moral and work expectations. They have cut the associates down by half and expect the associates left to complete all the work.
bad,"I wasn't very pleased with how Walmart treated there employees or there customers. I wouldn't recommend anyone for a job at Walmart, it was one of the worst jobs you could work in my opinion besides the benefits and pay they could care less about you."
bad,"Hard and fast paced work day. Given a certain/set amount of time in order to complete tasks and if those task times are not met several times since you start working, your head is on the chopping block. They will gladly cut someone out if they are not meeting the manager's personal feeling of how the job should be done."
bad,"Poor scheduling, management doesn't look out for staff, customer always wins, no support for workers, good luck with time-off. Shifts range from minimum 4 hrs with one 15min break, to 12+ with 2 15min breaks and 1-hr lunch, though its up to you to find replacements overall if the supervisors aren't around."
bad,"Excelente ambiente con compañeros y compañeras"
bad,"Employees are underpaid for the amount of responsibility they have. Most leads/Department Managers do the bulk of working, while managers sit in their back offices socializing."
bad,I would not have had a problem working here if it was not for management. And the pay could be way better for all the work they want you to do and the customers we have to deal with. Its a starting job but I would not make it into a career.
bad,This job gave me an opportunity to go to different places/travel. meet new people. This job enhanced my skills as a sells person. Got a chance to create a company from scratch
bad,"My day at work included scanning bins in backroom,and anything that would work to sales floor,I would work.Price changes need to be done early along with section work. Learned a lot about how sale and demand works.How accurate onhand  is the way to eliminate shrinkage,and basically make job easier.  But,in doing a good job,management have to cooperate and understand that not having the manpower to run your department effiencently ,only causes more stress and animosity in the company,and turn over to be less.Most of the working culture was great.The workers were just trying to earn money to raise families,a lot of wonderful people!  The hardest thing about my job,was the heat in summertime .You could be outdoors in very hot weather for hours! There are so many good things about working with friends and other hard working people.I still have a lot of friends from working there."
bad,"I've learned alot of the business side. my department Manager has taught me alot of the job tasks. a typical day consists of putting up products on the shelves, cleaning dusting, zoning, and binning/labling freight. We do many more odds and ins, and help out in various departments as well. work culture is good, we like to have fun, and most all employees get along well. hardest part of the job is being on feet all day, and having to deal with irate customers from time to time. also working every holiday is hard when you have a family. best part is having fun with work friends, cookouts, and possible bonuses."
bad,"the average work is difficult to keep up with the constant flow or freight to stock each day, it is rewarding to see people coming and going constantly, cause they know we are likely to have what they need on the shlf in one store. It is also nice to see a lot of a charity work  the store helps, especially the Children Miracle Network where wo sponsor a young child and the family through their difficult time."
bad,Overall the pay is good and I loved my customers but the management here sucks.. Sad to say but it is very unprofessional there VERY. Managers aren't even qualified to be managers it was pretty surprising that they hold the position they do.
bad,"Aprendía bastantes cosas en este empleo, pero la administración era muy mala. Los pasillos de los que cada quien estaba encargado eran un caos, ya que se cambiaban básicamente cada semana. Eso sí, cuando llegaba el gerente distrital era hora de ponerse a trabajar lo que no se había hecho y todo, desde los jefes de área hasta los gerentes de la tienda, se ponían en un humor insoportable."
bad,"unfortunately you never get a weekend off unless you have a certain amount of years of seniority, working nights with no weekends off is a problem, I am not reviewing all stores only the one I work at 3007."
bad,Okay first time job. Management didn't seem to handle problems very well. Most employees are not happy to work there. Required to take 15 minute payed breaks but the management team rarely lets you take them. Can get in big trouble if you hit 5 hours without a lunch break but management seems to think that's okay. Am looking for a place where people actually care about the mental and physical status of their employees.
bad,I learned from Walmart not to be like some of the mangers there. The hardest part of this job was when I lost 2 kids and they really didn't care they wanted me to go back to work while I was still having the miscarriage.
bad,I understand change it has become the biggest tuner over rate I have ever seen.  Managers have left after investing over 15 years or more & employees.
bad,"Management is consistently losing the company money as well as losing great employees. They wonder why they are losing employees but yet continue to treat their employees like a dog. Go here, come back, don't do that, do that, constant contradiction."
bad,Great Job...Very Busy Job....Great Shifts nice employees to work with..Discount with Walmart on different products....Can Advance in Walmart in A Few Months....
bad,It wasnt the easiest job but it was a great job with really good pay. Coworkers are great the problem with working there is the higher up managers. Some of them you cant state the the grass is green with out getting yelled at.
bad,Most days working were stressful. Too much work and not enough time or people to help when needed. Management was slow when making decisions. Some of Walmarts policys are in question.
bad,"Management should follow company policy by forcing the one best way, instead of doing things their way! That cause so much stress! Management also show to much favoritism and the hardest workers are the most mistreated ones"
bad,Wal-Mart is not to bad of a place to work but management does not care about their associates or their associates' needs. I use to enjoy working there until they stopped caring.
bad,"Okay place to work would not recommend. Unloading trucks, stocking freight, management can belittle associates. Modular integrity isnt something that's of importance anymore."
bad,"Type of work day was very stressful. I learn working in the deli how to prepare fresh foods and temps to different foods. Management at Walmart does not care about their employee. Work place culture was good. Hardest part of my job was dealing with the stress of what management didn't do for us to make work better, such as making sure that we had supplies at all times."
bad,"Many reviews have been written about working at walmart at all different levels.  I think the main systemic issue at the logistics level are multi layered.  First, every non management receives the same pay increase regardless of work ethic, contribution, skill and ability.  Understandably, it may be difficult to review thousands of people, but this can lead to dissatisfaction amongst the best workers and a systemic morale issue."
bad,This  company is for high school kids that does not have bills. Hours are always cut even if you are a fulltime employee. They make you cut anything of 40 hours.
bad,Bad management good associates to orderfill with ops and gm both were horrible pay is okay hours sucked signed up for 4x 10 hour days end up working manditory 5x 10-12hr days. Cut throat will get rid of you in a blink of a eye
bad,"typical retail job, good benefits, very fast pace, poor management, company is easy to work for, would recommend job to others, good job function skills and customer service skills"
bad,this walmart is awesome i loved my job while there it was like a family . But now its too far. If I were to move i would definetly go back.management was awesome an the customers were nice.
bad,A typical day at work would starts off with a meeting.  Followed by unloading a Wal-mart Semi Truck of store merchandise.  Processing the merchandise to be worked onto the sales floor.  Then to finally stock freight on store shelves.
bad,It was stressful putting up with managers that don’t care about their employees. Especially ones that don’t explain simple rules/sick days to their employees.
bad,"As a Walmart Manager, you are paid well. However, the stress and the politics at the home office are very trying. Found it hard to take all my days off because of the demands of a manager in the home office."
bad,"It was an okay place to work just stressful and very hard work, the management is poor. Most enjoyable part was the people and my coworkers. I miss the job but will never go back."
bad,"To be honest, I'm leaving on fairly bad terms.  I really like most of my coworkers, and much of my management team.  I don't like my store manager, whom has decided that because he personally dislikes me, he needs to remove me from my job and gift the position to someone he does like.  The story is a long one, but would only be anonymously well-backed by many coworkers, over the last 14 months or so."
bad,"There is no telling where you're going to work.  Hardware dept. i liked working learned a lot in this department, Tools, light bulbs, filters and color matching."
bad,"At Walmart, you have the opportunity to advance quickly within the company and your store. However, the management needs re-training. They need to understand the difference between achievable expectations and unachievable expectations. The management has their favorites that can get away with anything, then they have their people who they like to pick on. If your on the receiving  end of their hostility, be ready to be set up to fail. Overall the company is customer-oriented and it depends all on the store that you work in as to what your experience will be like. I love my job, if management would leave you alone and let you do your job, it would be fantastic and I would be able to get so much more done than all of the things I do already."
bad,Solo somos un número más dónde te reemplazan fácil
bad,The job it self was okay but stressful.  Enjoined  my coworkers more than anything.  But I  do enjoy working independently so I did like that. I worked overnight so that was kind of a fall back.
bad,"Working at Walmart for about 10 months was alright. I was a high school althlete looking for extra money. So I wasn’t really complaining, it was worth it let’s just say."
bad,"I provided customer service to Walmart customers and some employees on their vehicles. I changed oil, tires,batterys and bulbs. The hardest part of this job was not having enough help to do these jobs in a reasonable amount of time. but sometimes I got the opportunity to help someone who really needed it."
bad,"I have been at this store for over ten years. I have seen the changes for the Store Manager go from near complete control over operations to micromanagement. This has been a terrible flip. Our staffing is cut, the supplies are cut, needed positions are denied, the ordering is limited, and overall moral has suffered tremendously. We have a horrible turnover rate and the staff we are hiring today are pretty much bottom barrel. We have so many accidents in our store that our bonuses are near minimal (again, training). The Home Office has all but destroyed our sales and customer service approach, and our ability to succeed due to following the scheduling and training of our Associates. There was a time when we were proud to do our jobs. Now, we do what we can to avoid getting yelled at or ""coached"". It is so sad that it's come to this. Most of us want to succeed in our work and customer service, but the limits that are put on us prevent this from fruition. Arkansas, let us do what we do. Sam Walton once said, let your associates run the company because they are on the front line. Vote in a new CEO."
bad,"I personally have gotten sick of working at Walmart. It has been 2 years for me working as a cashier, and I opened my availability thinking I'd get better hours, or even more hours, but I started getting less hours. The pay is okay, but I don't get holidays off, and I have children. I'd like to spend time with my family, not be forced to work on Black ""Friday"", which is now on Thanksgiving at Walmart. I find this ridiculous. Make it actually Black Friday again. Let us spend time with our families."
bad,"Once Wal-Mart upped their minimum wage and bonus, the cut every employees hours significantly. This company is forcing people out and forcing people to find second jobs."
bad,"The company is constantly changing, especially in the past year.  The company will often throw the term ""fit for the future"" around to justify decisions that lack concern for the associate.  The company has eliminated and redefined positions at a faster pace this year than in any other year I have been in the company.  The company does make efforts to help associates find another position in the company, but makes no guarantee of similar compensation."
bad,Basically walmart is a hate your life kind of job. its a corporate organization that only really cares about its members at the top. employees walk around like zombies. you can tell there is just no morale while working there.
bad,"good enough place to work for a steady paycheck"
bad,Busy retail company where customer demand fluctuates. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you're able to help someone find what they were looking for.
bad,"a typical day at work would be our employee morning meetings and what our objectives would be for the day. I learned leadership, different job descriptions, and many more life and work skills. Walmart is a company that is filled with diversity and so much culture. The hardest part of the job was staying patient with strategic projects. The most enjoyable part about working for this company is the opportunities, skills, and the network you build with different people from all over the world."
bad,"They keep wanting u to work and do this and that but give u no more for doing it. except they keep taking your hours from u.  Their going to be putting in more self checkouts and taking the cashier away but they say no thats not what were doing but us as cashier will say yes they are.  And they gave us this big $1.00 raise but didn't put in the small print they were cutting our hours.  So the raise didn't mean a thing.  They have screwed with the scheduling too, its a big mess maybe someday they will go bad to the old way and assoicaties will have more hours."
bad,"I would have given Walmart a much better rating if they didn't have the schedule change. This new schedule change is called Customers first. The worst part about this is that seeing as the changed everything up they're less associates to help our customers. Which means customers get upset. Before this change, i would have given my Walmart 5 STARS. Everything was great and running smoothly. Now its just one big screw up  of store and management."
bad,"It was non-stop and hard work. They put multiple tasks on me and expected me to finish them all alone before my shift ended, even if it was 28 hours worth of work."
bad,"Long hours, Competitive pay, Management team nice, training is amazing. Knowledge of associates is very helpful. DMS very nice. Work life vs. Home life is very hard to balance."
bad,If the managers there cared more about the associates then I wouldn't leave my job and would love to move up in it. When it comes to the people you become family with them and care for them alot
bad,"Teamwork was never given to staff. Management was disrespectful to employees. You're able to have your breaks, two-15 minute breaks and hour lunch break."
bad,"Not the most exciting place to work, but that doesn't mean you can't learn anything from it. I personally learned how to deal with -- for lack of a better term, ""tough"" people. And to do so in a proper and respectful manner."
bad,"I was terribly underpaid for the job I was doing. When I said I deserved another dollar an hour, they brushed it off. When I said I was quitting because of my salary, they offered me another position instead of giving me the salary I deserved."
bad,"Quite stressful, worked as frozen/dairy stocker and couldn't have hated it more. The environment was disgusting and the workload was stressful, esepecially if coworkers didn't do their job"
bad,"A typical day? No such thing, everyday is different. NEVER Expect consistency."
bad,"On the bright side, I have learned a lot from Walmart and from a few of my fellow Associates. People skills mostly and how to solve customer service issues. Lot's of those."
bad,"Even though they'll ask you for your ACTUAL availability. If you list any thing other than Open, you won't get many hours and they'll blame it on the scheduling computer.  When you have a open schedule they'll schedule you one day from 4pm - 1am then the very next day  from 9am - 5pm. With an open availability, you would rarely get consecutive days off. Many employees feel they are treated like robots, not humans."
bad,"I learned a lot from my employement at Wal Mart. I was able to move up in management very easy. Although there were a lot of aspects of the company that could be changed to help keep faithful employees. The main mangement could have been less political and worked more with the employees . I enjoyed everything about my job, working  with my crew and learning was amazing. Excelling in customer service was very gratifying."
bad,"The benefits that Walmart offered, and consistent hours are probably about the only good things that my time at Walmart had going for it. Managers were unfriendly and looked down upon other workers. The systems were outdated and in serious need of an upgrade. The word I would use to describe my time there would be ""joyless."""
bad,It's a job that will teach you to constantly stay on your toes and to expect the unexpected when you are in the work environment. You will encounter a variety of unique people within a day and depending non how you it can build for the best of character.
bad,A typical work day is waiting on 100 or more customers who most of them ignore your very existence. But there are the regulars who make the day worthwhile.
bad,"I had a poor experience in the store I worked at, but it really depends on the location and who your managers are. For me, I had issues going on in the department I was working at and despite speaking to two different co-managers, they hadn't done anything about it within the last three months I worked there. I enjoyed the position I worked in, but the more pressing issues made it hard to work out there without stress, and it had gotten to a point where I couldn't handle it anymore. "
bad,"I did enjoy working at Walmart. Pay could've been better and hours could've been better. It was honestly an easy job as long as everyone showed up and focused on what they needed to do. I enjoyed working with everyone and built great relationships with majority of people. The other downside to working was if a certain amount of people would call out on any particular day it would make things difficult for the rest of everyone, by having to pick up the slack for those missed people."
bad,I was a overnight cashier applied for overnight customer service manager/stocker. Then went to days had to be trained on financial services and still learning as I go.
bad,"Management was awful. (Note: Felt personally victimized almost everyday by my own manager) Besides that, the photo lab was a very fun and fast paced job. I enjoyed working with the printing devices and creating some of the products such as canvases and mounted photos. I made a lot of customer relationships along the way. I got to work with an amazing group of people, which made my days at Walmart go a lot smoother than they would have if I didn't have many friends."
bad,Unloading Freight and stocking dairy and frozen. Using pallet jack to unload pulling across the store. Filling ice compartments in the store. Providing great customer service in the process.
bad,"everyday was always busy. However i learned how to treat the customer and how to work in sales. Management is tough but understanding, and the most enjoyable part of the job is the friendly customers you tend to meet."
bad,I cannot stand the fact that they do not accept doctors notes when out ill and that you can loose your job. Communication is not good at all at the store that I worked in. Once you are hired the higher ups dont even speak to you. While you are in the hiring process they are very nice to you. The most enjoyable part was getting to know your regular customers.
bad,"The work is okay need more benefits and a strong and good teacher employee. And more time trainings."
bad,"Good pay and benefits but you will be worked like a Mule. Once you are no longer able to perform how you used to over time, PEACE. And once to get up in pay rate they'll be looking for reason to let you go"
bad,"unorganized company, very hard to get full time and if you don""t you'll get very little hours. As a supervisor my responsibilities outweighed the amount they paid to me. pros are paid time off and vacation. Good job if you really need one."
bad,Considered very expendable and they let you know it. Moved up quickly but the compensation to responsibility ratio doesn't add up. The pace makes the day go fast.
bad,"It lacks of discipline, after your initial 90 days its a free for all. Some managers have their pet pigs.  Many employees work between 32 and 40 hours but are only considered part-time.  There is not a set type of schedule or set days off unless you put it in your availability however it is frowned at. Don't offer to learn anything because you will not see the difference in pay, nor will your job code change.  Overall the employees keep a great attitude and store atmosphere."
bad,"The best thing about Walmart NOC is that you get experience in Cisco networking Cisco/switches, Cisco and Motorola.  Down fall, directive is never direct and changes daily, no path for a career path.  Level 3 NOC has always hired outside and only twice in the the two years I've been with Walmart hired within the company.  Other than that, it is high paced and a good starting point for anyone looking for an entry level position for experience in networking."
bad,Very busy place difficulty finding management when needed but very enjoyable meeting all the people who shop there there are employees from a all walks of life which makes it very interesting  there are employees that have been there for  20 years or more and it's fun listening to their stories of the good old days
bad,Walmart is a good place to work. Just looking for other opportunities with more steady hours. Walmart recently made some management position changes that I did not agree with.
bad,I learned was I can have work/life balance. You need to have that to be successful. It did take me a long time to get there. It was always work and I miss out on many things at home.
bad,"I was hired to work in women's clothing but rarely was put there.I was moved to different departments daily. I was unhappy with how unorganized such a large Company was run. I was extremely disappointed with several of the support managers constantly playing and texting on their phones. Also was appalled at how they talked on workroom floor.I saw management making fun of people that were mentally challenged ,their weight etc. I watched a support manager take merchandise and put in wrong place because he simply didn't want to continue looking for where it belonged."
bad,"Great place to start working for a kid out of high school, but in my store if your not a certain race forget advancement. Basically the individual would have to leave for any promotions."
bad,if your studying to go back to school this is a perfect job but to actually live off this would be very difficult. also all your money goes directly back to the company since you'll be shopping there for sure
bad,Great place to work really wish I was still would look forward to more time there wish nothing but the best for the people that I worked with great environment for the most part
bad,"Check out keys,hand held terminal,and get money for register. Stock shelves,price and label changes.My customers have kept me with this company. Sales associate."
bad,"if you can find a wal-mart that treats there employees fairly then you are in good standing. The place I worked the managers if they do not like you ,they figure a way to get you out of there. they have  to much favortism in the store .I have learned a lot being there just do not understand the way it is ran,The best part of the job is the employees they are mostly all really nice and that helps the day go by even better if you are having a tuff day.It is a great job if you are only there for a little while but not long term"
bad,"I don't think ive learned much here. I had a experience working for walmart. I was bullied, Other co workers were mean. I worked my butt off felt like I never got anywhere. My brother passed away from being Iraq and they wouldn't let have the day off for my brothers funeral. never again."
bad,"Management seems to have an unrealistic approach to ""fixing"" issues within the store. There are ""favorites"", that management will make exceptions for, while others are not allowed the same benefit. All new ""policies"" that they don't want to take responsibility for are blamed on ""home office"". Entire corporation has a reputation for being ""family oriented"", but in my experience, that only applies if it makes the company look good. Will not take personal experiences into account when dealing with their employees. I loved working there because of my co-workers, I miss a lot of them, but I hated working for such an unfair, two faced company."
bad,"It was a good expeirence to advance English lahnguage skills , to understand Canaian way of customer service. The most useful part is an ability to understand medication dispensing process in Canada."
bad,"to many csm in one day and they love to call in. No respect for co-workers. I did not like working at walmart. I love the customers."
bad,"Typical day is just work on register, or help with customer service, clean up the department. Help other departments in the store. Did not ask anything else beyond that."
bad,"I worked there for almost a year when a recurring leg injury crept back into my life. At first they seemed completely willing to accommodate for my injury but when it came time for me to come back to work they completely dropped me. I faxed my paperwork to return to work and they would just tell me ""We didn't receive your paperwork. Fax it to (number) and we will contact you again."" Well I faxed it about 8 times and they still said they never received the paperwork. If you're in perfect health by all means apply there but if you have past injuries look somewhere else."
bad,Management that's been working there for a longer time need to go through some new training. Supervisors are lazy management is rude and un-motivating. I learned that I have to teach myself if I want to learn anything. Hardest part of the job is keeping myself from getting angry at co-workers lack luster attitudes. Most enjoyable part is seeing friends and serving customer satisfaction. A typical day at work is frustrating.
bad,"Lacks in communication, very clicky. I enjoyed working with public and the cashiers. Management was very unsupportive in Kingman, Az. Elko, Nv was a great work enviroment"
bad,"Nice managers on second shift(night shift) Cafeteria area doesn’t offer fresh food options, only vending machine options. Was a temp. treated fairly, just paid less through agency."
bad,Walmart was a good environment to work in my day went by smooth .   Had a department manager that advised us of daily required tasks of the day. At the time my son was diagnosed with autism which required a lot of medical attention and they would not give me consistent schedule some days they would have me scheduled for nights then mornings at the time it was very difficult for me to maintain that along with attending to my sons needs at the time.
bad,the associates are great. The workplace culture is enjoyable and the associates really care. there is a disconnect between the managers at the store level and the managers at the home office
bad,The management could care less about a open door issue regarding anything that happens in a work place. There is multiple cases of wrongful termination.
bad,I had worked this job for about 8 months and it started off ok. The job was easy and hard at times. The management was bad and did not do anything. The store was very understaffed and they would move employees all over the store to fill in the spots.
bad,Over the past two years that I have worked there it was fun until we got new management and the started to keep the sheep and get rid of everyone else if you know what I mean. Its hard to work in a place were managers work above you and not with you.
bad,"Overall, this isn't a terrible place to work. Helping customers was the number one priority always. The job does get boring most days because it's always doing the same thing, there isn't much variation in tasks."
bad,"I don't want to give a negative review since the store was in transition. That said, it's hard to say how the department would have been operated had it been fully transitioned"
bad,"you are second to the freight, injuries were basically your own fault. If you were to get sick and had to leave during your shift, you were written up."
bad,"The employees there were great and some of the management staff were as well but there's always some sour apples. It was like a new team came in and got rid of the ""old timers"" and kept the new people who didn't work as hard or did as much as the old staff."
bad,"Walmart makes plenty of money to treat their employees fairly. Unfortunately that is not the case. Had to work for black Friday, No overtime  No time and a 1/2 nor holiday pay. All we got was an additional 15% off on discounts.  That's very disappointing. To me it felt like if I was working at a high school."
bad,"doing my job and everyone who was behind on work "
bad,Assocites have fun actitvites every month. Managment as it changes become rigid and hard to convience. Walmart is interfering to get more and more without thinking of others personal life.
bad,It was a great place to work. But like all thing. Things changed and not for the best. The people that worked there are great but the people above don't think about the people below them.
bad,It’s a okay place to work they don’t really care about there workers I lost everything when we had the flood and they fired me did talk to me are nothing
bad,"Limited hours with varying shifts. This was hard to plan anything and makes finding a daycare impossible, While the managers are nice and the people are friendly the hours and low wages prevent it from being a desirable job."
bad,"Good enough for first job, just to hard to work overnight, had to work with people who didnt know how to work hard. did get paid decent and made some friends"
bad,Managers pushed for work with perhaps the lowest I have been paid in most of my jobs in the past 15 twenty years. I heard they improved but I am not so sure. I learned about electronics devices.
bad,"The work itself and the pace is fine, nothing major.  The managers do not know how to speak to people, they only yell.  We were told several times in meetings that yelling is what gets a job done.  Not true.  Just not true at all."
bad,the shift managers try to break up the monotony by having karaoke and different games. they do try to lift the morale of the associates and have nightly meetings to let keep you up to date with what is happening in the work place.
bad,"Walmart is fast paced. Management needs to organize and plan the schedules better, normally they do not schedule enough employees and all of the extra work falls on the employees that are scheduled."
bad,"Company needs to be more organized with training and ordering parts. Rude managers, a lot of unexpected work asked of techs and no compensation for extra work."
bad,"I would review team schedule and assign tasks nightly"
bad,I don't really remember my time at Walmart. but what I do remember it was a great starting job! Youre able to get a feel for the working world. And you could take advantage of learning about stocks.
bad,"I worked there for ten years, and if you are looking to make good pay quickly, this is the place to work. It is very intense, and very hard, but as 'Make some real and fast cash' it is good. The benefits were pretty good, the management really depended on who it was. "
bad,"Nice place to work,  not enough days a week offered but pay is OK to start. "
bad,Overall a decent place to work but the management needs some training on how to treat their employees with respect. Also working every single weekend is ridiculous.
bad,"Could be a great place to work but don't listen to their employees.  Great benefits. You get vision, dental, life insurance, paid vacations, and able to buy company  stock."
bad,"Everyone there does not have the same agenda and while you may be working hard, other associates that should be doing the same thing as you are roaming around."
bad,"i didn't like working at Walmart. the management was mean, the pay was not good and the schedule was never good because it changes every week and my days off were never consecutive and always random."
bad,"Walmart can be a company you can advance in, but only if you submit yourself to the brutal and disrespectful atmosphere managers push on the associates under them. Your work experience is dictated by far too many things to accurately estimate what YOUR experience will be. Fellow associates, managers, and even neighboring departments can affect how enjoyable or stressful your job can be. However, considering the kind of people they hire regularly just to keep the place running it can take 6 months to a year to finally gather a group of associates worth keeping in your department."
bad,They claim to be an associate based company but when it comes time to truly show appreciation when it matters most they fall through every time. If I had the choice to start a new and work for them again I would not do it no matter how well they pay.
bad,"While the work environment and people are nice, the lack of leadership make it difficult to do your job. Too many outdated tools and processes that make the work feel like a quagmire. Leadership should invest more time in what really matters and less time on meetings and inclusion events."
bad,"All in all a generally great job. My time with Walmart has been pleasant, however when it comes to aspects of the job other than the tasks themselves things get a little hairy. For example after meeting the qualifications for benefits I was quickly transferred so that my time in the position would negate the potential benefits I needed to get and now no longer receive. The hours I receive are OK, not what I requested to work, as well as not the number of hours I was hired to work, this caused friction between me and my management who just act like nothing happened so all in all its a decently beneficial job if your trying to stay in the same tax bracket doing the same things the rest of your life."
bad,Worked long term an loved my job.  Changes were made that I did not feel benefited the associates.  The company is not as family oriented as it was in the past.
bad,At walmart there are a lot of new opportunities that opens up after being with the company for so long. I've known and seen a lot of families and friends that have gone that road.
bad,Some managers where amazing but if your sick and in the hospital expect it to count against you. If you have problems with coworkers expect nothing to be done about it. And if you call corporate and they find out expect to be gone.
bad,i worked very hard to become management with this company only to have them terminate me for false reasons. They do not compensate their employees for the work that they actually do including managers.
bad,"If you are not to hung up on pay Walmart can have a lot of possibilities for students or a second income for families. The discount is handy since we all have to shop at some time. They have decent benefits but if you don't plan to move into management your ""career"" there may not go where you want it to. The environment is mostly reasonable (excluding certain times of the year christmas,black friday,etc) Even though not ever job will be the ""greatest"" walmart is a decent start to gain some experience and learn about retail, customer service and being an employee."
bad,"The job was more stress than the pay allowed, I did not like the work flow too much, the managers were very cool, but I needed to have surgery and take care of my health so I couldn't stay."
bad,"Walmart is not a difficult job but there are many cons to working there. Most associates are not knowledgeable outside of their job title. In other retail chains I have been with, people know a bit or have worked in another area of the store. At Walmart people tend not to want to get their hands dirty in another department. The management favors a few associates and the work load is put on others. Many associates lack skill in their own department as well. It's interesting how such a large retail store is run so poorly. I'm glad I was able to see behind the scenes."
bad,The employees are good to work with. Overnight management was for the most part able to work with you. I mostly worked in the appreal department. They bring out pallets and you had to unload and separate and stock them in there apporaite areas. Whatever you don't stock you have to put it in the back in their right areas. When you apply make sure you know what days you are available. Don't ever put that your available any days unless that's how you really feel. They give you pretty much fixed days and hours to work.
bad,"I am sincere worker, I did very hard work over there. I worked for six months. People who worked for long time, company appreciate them. It was good experience to work in retail."
bad,"I Love working with all the associates in my job as Training Coordinator.  However, there doesn't seem to be any structure a lot of the time. We are so busy doing other jobs that we find it hard to get our regular work finished each day. We end up staying overtime to complete tasks and then we can't keep the overtime. We have to cut it by the end of the pay week.  Overall it can be stressful at times but it has many rewards, like being able to help associates with questions they may have about benefits, payroll, discounts, etc. And training new associates is also a great plus. On a positive note, my position as Training Coordinator is fulfilling as,long as I can focus on that job. On a,typical day, our office is very busy. People are,always coming in and out. When we have orientation for the new associates, we post a sign on our door letting the other associates know not to come in unless it is absolutely necessary. They rarely pay attention to the sign and just barge right in. I have had to be strict with them sometimes and,ask them to come back when the new associates go to lunch or break. I have learned quite a bit since working there. Some examples: How to find answers for associates about payroll, job openings internally, how to read their pays tub and also how to apply for benefits and explain what each one means."
bad,"A typical day at wal-mart clock in scan product that needs stocking make sure my employees new what their job was to do for the day, scan empty slots put an ordered for product. organized department"
bad,"Management does no training. They put you with another employee. They demand more then required. We were given times by headquarters, but management would adjust those times and lie about it or tell us they aren't correct to begin with. Sometimes blamed for lack of proper equipment. Best aspect was the rest of the crew. Benefits were decent and would match up to 6% for 401k."
bad,Workplace was OK. The pay was to low. The management need better  communication skills. The hardest part of the job was not have everything you need to do your job.
bad,"Even though I was an employee at Walmart for a extended period of time, it was not an ideal work environment. The treatment of employees was not ideal."
bad,they care you through h e l l  and expect you to do all their dirty work and work that was left behind from their previous shift instead of making them clear their jobs out
bad,at first i loved working at Walmart but then store manager quit and it all went down hill from that. People from other Walmart started to come help there way helped a little but then again another store manager and change again workers were frustrated
bad,"Pay not fair, not much discount, manager is dumb and not reasonable and logical sometimes better offer high discount for associate all year round paid better go up"
bad,I would recommend Wal-Mart Distribution Center to anyone needing a job if they are either desperate or prepared for intense physicality. For someone interested in more white collar work like sales or business I would definitely say stay away from it.
bad,"The management is trash and it seems like none of them graduated high school because they're all literally so stupid. I would not recommend working for Walmart in London ONT, especially not Argyle Walmart because it will make you hate your life. Your coworkers are perfect and so sweet, the only thing wrong with the place is the management because they are literally the most incompetent people I have ever met. They don't know how to run a business and they sit around all day in the connected McDonald's. Even customers notice that they're always in there, like you ain't slick, just do your job like you've been hired to do."
bad,Always something to do to stay busy i love staying busy.the atmosphere is a very friendly atmospher.ive made friends with alot og my regular customers.
bad,"Often times your duties will be decisions you shouldn't have to make and to solve problems that are way above your responsibility, however you are expected to do them without complaint. The management team does not communicate with each other and many of the managers are only there for themselves, without any regard for the well being of the people that are working for them. Many of the practices at WalMart are ethically questionable."
bad,"When I first started, it was not that bad. When my supervisors changed, it all went down hill.  Our co-managers started wanting more from us, as well as our store managers. If we did not finish, he would say that we were failures and would just get discouraged. Recently, we have been being screamed at and just threatened. It just recently does not feel like a safe work environment. It is just recently feeling like a bad mental and physical place to work.  It is actually hurting me physically and mentally."
bad,"Working here was not a good time, I was barely trained and thrown on to a register, I often was the only register open and while most CSMs would be very helpful and come if I ever had a problem, there were a few who would treat me like dirt. All the cashiers I talked to hated their job (Which is expected) however it made working there not fun at all."
bad,"I was moved around quite often and wasn't given breaks on time. I went from a full time employee to a part time employee without notice. I also had monthly drills to attend and with my schedule in hand, I was still not paid for the drill weekends I was suppose to be on schedule."
bad,I love working too much to call less than 20 hours a week a job. I got terminated due to a circumstance that was beyond my control. I was not even in the state at the time when my identical twin sister who lived with me at the time did some crazy stuff at work under my badge number and I got fired and put as non rehirable by management! This was not my fault as I was in another state with my child who was having a life saving surgery. This company is unfair by far!
bad,I worked there for 9 years and my job was at risk 4 different times before I was finally laid off with such a big group I was not able to find another position in the company leaving me jobless for a year before I could find anything.
bad,"Rather than drag Walmart through the mud, I can say that it is certainly a good starting point in employment. As far as careers go, though, I could not honestly recommend it. While I may not have had the best experience with the company, I could not say that will be the case at other locations. If you get a job with Walmart, try to make the best of it."
bad,"been working their for 5 years. started in the TLE, changing oil. after 1 year went to nights as a stocker and a year later went to janitior work and help clean the store."
bad,Customers are great. Co-workers its 50/50. Due to the ability to advance some co-workers  are all for you and the other half are very childish and petty. They will do anything and everything to cut your throat especially if they feel you might get promoted or have been promoted and they feel they should have been.
bad,"Basically the job is what you'd expect. You come in, throw your aisles and leave. The biggest issue I have with the store is they are now removing my position so I'd have to go to daytime which is the reason for me looking outside the job since in 2 years I have gotten 1 raise due to the minimum wage increase nullifying my first 1. I've tried staying as I like my coworkers which is why I've given the store 1 last chance to promote me to a customer service manager but if that falls through I will 100% be finding a job elsewhere."
bad,A typical day at work I skipped a break and had to stand at the register for 4 hours. I got sick at work and got wrote up. Working at Wal-Mart is not the way to go in North Platte
bad,the Management favors certain people over others and gives special treatment and attention to them. their is little room for advancement. they have problems Accommodating for people with back problems and push them beyond their limitation.
bad,i had good time working there the customers was not that bad .the management was really bad especially when you need to switch shift with someone . i enjoy working there  i just go to work do my job and go home
bad,"The upper management in Walmart was not impartial and treats you differently based on how much they like you, not how well you do. There is also a lot of reverse racism in the distribution center. If you are not Spanish or Latino you are treated like a second class citizen, no matter your race."
bad,"At the time I worked two jobs the other job was Sherwin-Williams, Sherwin-Williams was kind enough to be flexible, breaks were few and far apart and short. The work was fast paced and stressful at times. Asking for days off was like pulling teeth. The best part about the job were the discount and stock options. The hardest part of the job were getting products on the shelve within the managers time frame."
bad,"Walmart is a cutthroat place to work and if you do not advance within the first year or so you are there, you will rarely be promoted.  In fact, if you don't go higher before your year is done, you might as well quit because you will be stuck in the job you are in for a long time.  Walmart only cares about the almighty dollar and tries hard to get people to move up since so many managers end up quitting or getting fired there.  It is a stressful place to work for a manager and for a associate.  Time is very critical and somehow they expect you to get 9 hours of work done and make the store look pretty in the 7.5 hours you are there.  Sometimes it can be done, but mostly it cannot and something suffers.  The managers take heat from the store manager, and then the managers put more pressure on the workers to somehow go faster, like we can somehow slow down time and space to make such a thing happen.  If you are just out of high school and want a part time thing, then walmart is good for you.  Others need not apply."
bad,"I never enjoyed working at Walmart, but it kept a roof over our head, and it was preferable to working at a fast food place. It's not terrible if you just need something to get you by."
bad,"Wal-Mart is a good company to work for if you don't have young children, best for students . Working in retail you have to work every holiday and not request days off."
bad,Walmart needs to really stop what they are doing and take a step back and re-evaluate what they are doing to the people who work there. They seem to think everyone can move faster than there bodies allow them to. They also think you should be able to do the work of 10 people in eight hours.
bad,it was tuff being a student and working at walmart but do to the hours it was also really fast paced but the benfits are good compared to other jobs i had
bad,I enjoyed the fast pace of this job as well as the constant change. I did not like the corporate structure and how the lack of morale seemed to stem from the top and trickle down.
bad,"From the moment you are hired, they look to get something over you. Expectations are high, too high but, don't worry; too high for management too. Wal-Mart's culture is to get as much out of everyone as they possibly can. Sad thing is they don't train properly and discipline at the drop of a hat. Attendance policy unfairly executed. 9 points in 6 months leads to termination. Some fired at 9, others have 18 and still have a job. They don't care if you have to leave for work 2 hours before your shift begins to get a bus or if delayed by traffic due to accidents."
bad,"fast paced work place "
bad,I just stocked from 10pm -7am . With 3 breaks . Two 15min breaks and one 1 hour break. Job was a lot of work an physical on hand work. I just needed to find a different job that fit me.
bad,Had mangent every one was trying to one up the.other they had slot of shot cashier drawers thwunhad a Lot of the store Manger dating the employees. Only thing In can say I'm glad  I'm   not there anymore
bad,"If I could provide a positive review I would as the company itself is good, however my work experience at the store I was employed by was nothing but negative. While the pay was good, the expectations and communication with management was completely horrible."
bad,"Working conditions were nice with an emphasis on safety. Break schedules were well adhered to. Personnel, however, were very cliquey and sensitive, going to management with trumped up complains against other employees. Management was also biased and judgemental."
bad,It's good if your in need of a job asap or just starting your first job. I can't say much about them really caring about their employees when they're sick or injured..
bad,I like Walmart as a company and the benefits they provided.  I think they need to have there managers work on communication skills. I liked my job as a Department Manager and being able to provide sales for my Department on a daily basis.
bad,Enjoyed working with the customers and most of the employees. But if you have health issues they find a away to get rid of you. No job protection there. Can be fired for mistakes and given other reasons in order for you to fight for unemployment which I received.
bad,"As long as the management team likes you you are ok, but if you do not kiss butt to some of the managers then they will talk to others about you.  The management team will make sure you do not do a good job, if they want someone else in your job. They will pull off price tag and move thing and tell you to fix it for the second or third time."
bad,Their is always room for advancement. Sometimes store would be short staffed and you were expected to finish a two person job. Management was helpful at times.
bad,"well needed breaks and clock in system was not a problem but, the rush hour after 5 p.m. and the thefts that took place in the store was dangerous and nerve wrecking"
bad,"Working freight"
bad,"For one person, you are expected to do the work of 10 due to scheduling, call-offs and other associates not working.  The company is great for the customer but not for the associate.  It was a job and it pays the bills but for a career, if you don't want to be happy, seek other positions elsewhere."
bad,"Walmart maybe its not a bad company to work but depends on store management."
bad,"I first went into Walmart thinking that it could not possibly be as bad as it was, and for the most part I was correct. After a while however, management started to shift around and I was informed that this was a regular thing, as Corporate did not really like keeping some managers working the same places or shifts for too long. Shortly after, the Academy was established, and everything went downhill. The academy stressed the managers out, and they stressed the associates out. With everyone stressed, hardly anyone wanted to work and some of the managers would instead have their associates go above and beyond their normal duties to make up for an issue the academy presented. ""One Best Way"" also caused issues as some of the decisions would go against common sense and seemed anti-consumer, however it kept being hammered home that ""One Best Way"" must be followed."
bad,A decent place to work.  Do your job and follow company guidelines. Opportunity to advance in the company is quickly attainable.  Very involved in the community.
bad,"Overnights was life or death to management. Co Workers were fun great people to work with. Most nights were basic, you knew what to expect. Turnover is crazy."
bad,when you clock in you are to go directly to your department for instance if your a cashier You have to report to A customer Service Manager and see what break or lunch needs to be covered or lunch. If we need to open more registers to help assist customers with a fast and friendly check out.
bad,"Good pay for a first job, also includes benifits so it was great to start here, the management changed that, there is no accountablility for the workers when they dont follow policies, people are often slaking or lazing through the day and it makes it so hard workers struggle to find motivation when they arent rewarded for the extra effort"
bad,"Walmart was my job for almost eleven years I enjoyed my time there, the is very competitive & fast paced which I like the pay was pretty good. The associates are fun to work with."
bad,"Working can be Stressful, Yet better organized. its time constricting & allows for more time to be geared into deliberate acts such as Mopping, sweeping & Waxing."
bad,I didn't work for Walmart that long it was a fun place to work gets me a lot of people and interact with them and it was not a very fast Place work environment
bad,Walmart is a good job if you are a teen or working your way through school. It can be stressful but nothing over whelming. the pay is not good. It's a job for single people.
bad,You have a few good mangers but for the most part all they really care about is getting the product out not the employees.  Yes i do understand that the that we would be there if it wasn't  for the customers but don't  about the customers than the employees
bad,a lot of ungrateful managers. they make you hate going in to work but I'm only speaking for the one I work at. the associate are easy to get along with.
bad,Wal-Mart is an okay place to work but I feel they can improve on their management. My time with Wal-Mart the employees was like family we all work together as a tem.
bad,"The work was fast paced, if not a bit teious and extremely repetitive. The company overall is friendly and dedicayed to customer service and fulfillment. The breaks were reasonable and lunches were appropriate in regard to scheduled hours. The manager in charge of scheduling had just started this duty when I was added to the team and he was not very helpful in working with schedules and many employees had difficulty scheduling any days off due to school, family, and medical purposes. He had to be told several times of an upcoming scheduling conflict before adding it to the system and often times would switch scheduled days and hours without contact."
bad,"Speedway is good for a first job to gain experience and that is it.I don't pay well, and you're expected to do every single thing in the store From cleaning and wiping down walls to just waiting on customers making food stocking cleaning wiping down pumps Cleaning up the mulch painting. Doing everything"
bad,"This is a good place to work if you don't have a family to attend to. The pay is great, but the point system is not fair. They will work you to death, but they will pay you."
bad,a very busy place to work . I learned how to balance working with many different people in different ways . management was amazing very respectful and reliable people . the hardest part of the job was standing in one place for hours not moving at all . the most enjoyable part was helping people save money and showing them other products that could give them more of what there looking for .
bad,Walmart have it's balanced days everything moves in a pacefully in manner order. You are to smile in greet customers in and out of the store thanking them after giving off great customer service and asking them to return again.
bad,"Job is overbearing and underpaid...,Managers will CUT your time if you have more than 40 only if its just 2 or 3 minutes  The 4 point system is ridiculous at bestv"
bad,This place is not a great place to work. The management doesn't value the employees work. It has a very large turnover rate and the pay sucks greatly.
bad,Hard to say much about it since some like to work hard and others pass the work to others. The one in charge of the deptment I am in treats us like we are kids.
bad,Walmart is a friendly place for the customers to go. There are  a lot of friendly people that work there and a lot of people that do good at their jobs however there needs to be more respect shown toward managers and associates. Other then that there really isn't much that I can say.
bad,"It was okay working for Wal - Mart. They didn't pay you enough for the amount of work that you'll put in daily. It was fast paced. If they were short handed you'll get pulled sometimes your area would get backed up and you couldn't get your daily duties done. Sometimes it could get overwhelming because they give you so many things to do at once, get pulled by another manager and fall behind in the other manager assigned task as well."
bad,Not one of my best career choices at all. Overall benefits are amazing but the higher level management tend to dictate the facility and do not properly and thoroughly train individuals.
bad,I like to stock over night it no noses I get my work done I zone good never came to work late I like working by myself my and da managers got alone good
bad,Its a sink or swim environment. Can be extremely fast past at times. The turnover rate is awful.The system for finding merchandise could be a little more simple Like that of Target.
bad,"This was a productive fast pace working environment.  You had to work as a team. the most enjoyable part of the job was the people. "
bad,Trabalaha na empresa e muito bom pessoas competentes e tem disposicao em ensina que esta precisando de trabalho..
bad,"Bom ambiente entre funcionários ,mais organização do depósito ."
bad,Very hectic place to work. People always coming and going. Worked in the electronics center doing cell phone contracts. although I liked the work i was doing the politics at Walmart will drive you insane.
bad,The company is always understaffed and because of this it causes one associate to take on several job responsibilities. Many members of management showed favoritism to certain associates.
bad,"I personally hated this job, the work itself was not that difficult, but the management had and strictly adhered to extremely unrealistic standards. Nothing was ever good enough and the pay was not even worth having the job."
bad,work is hard pay is good. management is lacking in integrity which is one of the basic principals. they will basically tell you what you want to hear to get you to leave them alone.
bad,i enjoyed working with the customers. managers showed favoritism worked other employees more then others. Most of the company was in drama but  enjoyed the work i was doing extremely ! I would work for walmart again just a different location.
bad,"I worked there for a month and was fired because I didn't have any sick time yet, and then after being fire they paid me for my vacation and sick time that wasn't used."
bad,Management and HR  forced me to quit while I was pregnant..the location I worked at was not that good.  Horrible management team. Fellow employees was good.
bad,"Obsession with low-cost led to poor service and mistreatment of hourly-paid workers. Minus the staff discount and competitive pension scheme, benefits were essentially nonexistent. Culture was positive but not supportive and in the UK head office there was a big problem with presenteeism which led to poor work-life balance."
bad,"I enjoyed the paperwork that was constantly expected to be correct and on time along with the team work. I liked the responsibility of payroll, dealing with the Walmart mgrs. to ensure proper shipping to their stores."
bad,i was accused several times of removing items from customers vehicles because i was an 18 dark skinned man and that was very insulting even after proving that nothing was removed we still were discriminated against we meaning me and another guy
bad,"wal-mart was okay its just that some of the staff can be unprofessional. "
bad,The management there were not always understanding though I'm sure they did but always seemed to be under a lot of stress. The Co-workers were very nice but did not always speak English or only knew a few words. They are very strict and seem to have a very long probation period.
bad,Must always be working and do not take longer breaks then what your suppose to. If you miss days due to health even if calling out they will not take doctors excuse and could come to termination.
bad,I have worked here several times and it hasn't changed. Management constantly changes their mind and get irritated when you don't know what they are on about. They just flip flop constantly.
bad,"Unprofessional, unfair, and lazy. I recommend this job only if you have to. I worked at 2 different stores. The first store wasn't as bad but the level of respect for employees was very high as where my next store didn't care about their employees."
bad,"It was a great place to work at first then we got a new manager . she liked the younger workers they did not know much and started harassing the rest we lost 8 technicians in 6 months including myself "
bad,Doesnt care about you personally. Very long hours per day. Very difficult to advance.  You can get wrote up for everything. You feel like you are just a number to them.
bad,"Another week another scheme that doesn't deliver because the ""leadership"" just doesn't get it. Hire today, fire or eliminate positions tomorrow, meanwhile noting really changes in the stores."
bad,Me gusta mucho la atención a clientes ya que prendo mucho
bad,"Just wish management was better than what it is. Things would run more effective and honest. People need to be treated with respect. "
bad,Just was a job to get me through school. If you try just a little more than the next person it's pretty simple to get promotions. A lot of things depends on how a location is ran. Some people have a great experience working for Walmart & others don't.
bad,"very fast paced worked,learned a variety of people skills and how to deal with many different people needs dislikes and likes,"
bad,"Wasn't really trained to start with. Just basics then tossed in. So all registers would be having issues, and it'd be for ever till help arrived. Making clients upset. "
bad,Walmart allowed me to work part time and gain working experience as a young adult trying to make my way into the adult world.  They were good about working around my school and sports schedule so I didn't miss out on my high school career while gaining work experience.
bad,"I do not like to look back on former jobs and critique them. I will always appreciate getting to work there as an summer job but, I do not have much to really say after that."
bad,very productive place to work. Lower management very unpleasant. Upper management not so much. Young worker will be taken advantage. Job environment very friendly when working as a team.
bad,Came in one day and found I had no job as a result of Walmart changing there system. My.self and the most senior manager was let go. I have newborn twins and now have to find a way to survive
bad,"The work always kept you busy. Hours dragged and pay was not that bad. Benefits made it even better. Great place to work for anyone starting out, or even going back to a smooth paced work place."
bad,"Days are tough, rare to do normal job without additional things added, no focus on job area, jump around a lot to take care of customers, with fewer people on staff than needed to complete work effectively and efficiently."
bad,The job is not that bad.The management is just very inexperienced.I loved the customers and the job security. I also did not like the way management blamed us for everything that went wrong and never took responsibility for their downfalls.
bad,The manager of the walmart i worked at was very mean. It seemed like they did not care about the employees. I've done a lot for the company but i have nothing to show for it
bad,"Busy, Fast-Paced, Customer Service Based, Thinking on Your Feet, the hardest part of my position has to be Upset Customers, Most enjoyable part of the job has to be knowing my Customers leave the auto shop happy."
bad,"If you need a job, anyone can get a job at Wal-Mart, and you will advance position fast if you are a brown-noser."
bad,"High turnover rate they make very haste decisions that don't always benefit the business. The culture is amazing and you will love the people you work with. However, the high turn over rate and unprofessional-ism shown from management will definitely deter you from the company. If you can overcome that then you should be fine."
bad,"The workplace is a stressful one, not because the work is difficult itself but because those working there over complicate it. We worked as a team for improvement of current technology processes, the problem we run into is an acute fear of any sort of change to a process. The organization doesn't evolve and would prefer to never have to. It's an archaic workplace that is destined to fall with the times and become a forgotten and useless relic."
bad,"There wasn't always time to get assigned jobs for the day done realistically between set tasks that already had to be done, plus regular duties and helping customers. Could use a better system of organization throughout the day."
bad,clock in at 2 o'clock  head to the back room to go over what is our objective is. learned how to work at a fast pace. The management could use a little work on how to talk to the workers. Workplace culture is OK beside the management could use a little more improvement
bad,"Overall, it can be very stressful. We are always short handed and management does help at times, depending on management. Policy are always changing and hard to keep up. There a lot paperwork for managers. However, there are good parts, like the people you met at store or your department."
bad,"Store managers have much say in the operations of the store. I worked under a manager who was conspiring with the district manager. They froze hiring to allow for a greater profit margin. There were nights where we would work the entire store with less than 20 active employees. We spent the entire year, including Black Friday severely understaffed. At a certain point, there was no room to cut non-contributing employees so it became commonplace for employees to avoid coming to work on labor-intensive days without penalty. The pay was grossly inadequate, and there were penalties for overtime such as being forced to take 4 hour lunch breaks or being made to work for an hour, take a 6 hour lunch break, and return for an hour."
bad,Do not look for advancement because there is not room to grow in this company. They will tell you to look forward to being employed by them and it isn't what it seems.
bad,"A typical work day is all about catering to the customer, even if they are wrong, I have tried to handle difficult customers the correct way but a manager will step in and make it out to be that I am wrong and the customer walks away with a $25 gift card. "
bad,"Easy work, but management would belittle you. I learned nothing more than how to stock efficiently. The culture set high exceptions that are easily exceeded. Hardest part of the job was to unload and ship out the trucks, while the most enjoyable is your fellow coworkers."
bad,I enjoyed working there the pay is awesome environment was wonderful my duties was customer service  working with the public I had to leave due to a family emergency
bad,"I worked as a cashier for a small Walmart Neighborhood Market for about three months and the only complaints I can make are about their online training program that you literally have to graduate from. The employees are nice people, the managers are nice as well. It's pretty unorganized and chaotic, but it's a grocery store."
bad,"Hours aren't flexible enough to attend school. Most customers are rude and management is hardly ever around. The store is very short staffed, and because of that breaks and lunches are often taken late."
bad,"un día puede ser muy malo por l;a administración de quienes llevan el control de la empresa."
bad,They had me pushing carts through the snow and the cart pushing machine they had did not function. They also didn't pay me enough to get proper things to wear in that weather and didn't give me enough hours.
bad,I really enjoyed working for this company because I  felt like it was a company I could really grow with. The managers were really difficult to come talk to weather it be for asking a question or about scheduling
bad,"Company-pushed ""Safety Culture"" seems insincere as it's impossible to meet production goals without ignoring parts of safety protocol. Management looks the other way as employees rush and overexert themselves, then every shift begins with a supervisor reading down the list of yesterday's injuries."
bad,"Walmart grocery distribution is a fast-paced environment.  If you have a good manager, life is good.  The hours are unpredictable.  Life can be pretty hectic.  Regional DCs are way better."
bad,"There were no typical days. Everyday was different and challenging."
bad,Good for a first time job but needs to pay employees more money. Management seems to only care about having someone on the clock. Have to have a robot attitude to consider this job .
bad,"The experience was great! Met new people, I enjoyed the company as a stocker. Things has been tough for me because of my hearing impairment sometimes."
bad,"No hay comunicación entre compañeros y no hay buena distribución de tareas, no hay exigencia en asistencia ni puntualidad."
bad,Management constantly yelled and got other associates in trouble over every little thing. They were too power hungry and did not appreciate the hard workers they had.
bad,Customer service skills can be worked on with team members. Need to have more employees to be able to return phone calls to potential employees. Need more work available.
bad,"Great work environment. However, there is Just no advancement in company. Company hires 90% contracted work for below average compensation. Loves to hire fresh out of college kids to pay lower salaries."
bad,The management was great when I worked for Wal-mart. I really enjoyed my direct manager. There was a lot of politics throughout the store and pay isn't great.
bad,"As I was working for Walmart, it was a horrible place to work for. The managers are so rude and unprofessional. It's always about them, never there employees."
bad,"I loved what I did, I just wish the management was more respectful. My coworkers and associates were amazing. There was plenty of room for advancement but it's not a company I'll work for again."
bad,"When you work at walmart, you have to donate your life to them,or you wont make it. I worked there for almost 11 years, when I had children and wanted a little time off, they looked down on it."
bad,They did not care about their employees and openly mocked their employees in front of customers.They also tried to make me do cashier even though i wasn't train on it and he threatened to fire me
bad,"I learned responsablility as a teenager there, the managent was alwasy helpfull. I was resonsable for gathering the carts in the parking lot and returning them back to the indoor area for customers."
bad,This job requires extensive patience and understanding for all walks of life and situations that may arise. There is nothing you wont encounter while working at this company. You have to be prepared for the unexpected.
bad,"Great for starting job."
bad,"A typical day at work includes just going through your routine whatever your job title is. Management doesnt communicate with each other or other associates which makes the job stressful. There is a lack of training in most departments, such as becoming a department manager, they  just throw you into the position and are supposed to figure it out."
bad,"I would start my day by opening up the customer service area, turning on the registers. Then I would check to see if there were any go-backs that I could replace them back on the selves."
bad,I learned lots of skills and how to push myself but found this was not the right job for me.But on a positive note my first store manager was such  nice person and was always available for any issues.
bad,"Overall it was okay, but there could definitely be better management. Another goood thing is there were a lot of people and very large work spaces. I also had two offices so i always got a lot of exercise."
bad,In my opinion there is too many people in charge and not enough typical workers.  The benifits were some of the best since I started working. It started as a fun workplace but changed into a place that we were not even allowed to talk.
bad,"Not a bad company, but it does employ some not so great people. Does not hold the associates in very high regard, or does it hold management in high regard. Always changing sometimes so fast you don't have time to learn the process before it changes. Does not show the proper appreciation for employees."
bad,Walmart co managers in Forrest city at are very unprofessional and unethical . You are not able to work without favoritism  being shown. It is a great place to work but the co managers create problems such as stress and frustrations.
bad,"We all know what this company fails at. Their grocery side is in need of better direction. Customer service is bad, pay is terrible and control in the stores is bad. They hire anybody, that's the problem. they don't train these people the way they should. The new employees are destine to fail through the lack of good training. they seem to think CBL's is their training, WRONG! What you see on You Tube what happens in their stores is totally unacceptable."
bad,The pay was so horrible it made you work less as hard. The company is worth more than what the pay would make you think. Needs a better CEO.
bad,"typical day-slave drive"
bad,"Work at Walmart in Burnsville, MN was messy and unorganized. It was always super stressful because the store was extremely understaffed and management did not seem to care about their associates. The store manager was rude and seemed extremely unqualified for his position. Most of the assistant managers were also very rude. At this job, I dealt with discrimination quite frequently. I was also put down and underestimated often by management. Lastly, I was expected to do the work of a department manager at the pay of a sales associate. My coworkers were very fun to be around and easy to work with."
bad,"although the benefits were ok and there was room to advance and the coworkers were fabulous, management was not approachable there was no training except on paper they under staffed on purpose and make it impossible to get the job of 4 people done due to no support Great place to shop very poor place to work :("
bad,"Helping others help what they need to find and keeping them satisfied as usual everyday, all days and keep them coming back to shop and loving the products that we sell"
bad,My experience at walmart was okay. Most of my co workers were cool and my direct manager was cool as well along with very few other managers. The managers though at the top like the store director and other department managers were very rude and unable to listen. They also will lie when it seems best for them
bad,The pay is awesome but the Hours suck. I hate the management. The people who have worked there ten plus years act like they run the place and they are rude!!!! But if your don't mind being disrespected this is the place to work!
bad,"I believe if one is to be successful, that person has to be taught and trained. Talking is good but hands on experience is better. Spending quality time with the person for at least two weeks is good. That way the person is trained and taught and if he/she has any questions, it's one week in the whole to get everything answered."
bad,Hard work An time spent like your whole life then it should pay off with an small mangement positions after like five years you may become manger in three years
bad,Walmart is ok to work for but Walmart is another company that doesn't understand when you have family emergencies or you get ill they will get rid of you .
bad,A typical day at work is helping customers and cleaning the deli. The management was okay but their is a lot of drama in the deli. The hardest part of the job was dealing with all the drama with the other workers.
bad,Management not organized communication is a null but the employees were very helpful if needed help. Learned about customer service in a retail store. Equipment was in very bad shape and place was filhy things were always breaking down which was hard if were busy and Supervisors couldn't handle the pressure a lot of the time
bad,"It was okay to work with Walmart.Good benefits but they didn't understand or respect you health and restrictions.That's all that I can say , they also didn't want to pay what they should have for all od the work that was mandatory."
bad,They paid well but the work was hard. It didn't feel like you were appreciatedoing enough. With it being retail I had to work weekends and holidays. A lot was expected of you  and it was very stressful.  To me the good pay wasn't worth the stress they put me under.
bad,if you worked over night the work could be very hard on your body and management was not always supportive. However you were always paid for your time.
bad,"Prepare medications under the direction of a pharmacist. May measure, mix, count out, label, and record amounts and dosages of medications according to prescription orders."
bad,"I started here as a cashier and quickly moved up from there to the photo department within 2 months. I did inventory, photo processing/printing, cleaned machines, ran the register, and customer service & sales. My manager moved up and they hired on a new manager who terminated me when I called off for a week due to being hospitalized."
bad,The pay here is decent but for what you're doing i feel like Walmart employees should make more. Coworkers at this location are great but management could be better.
bad,"My job is to stock shelves.  I have a foot problem they were aware of upon my hiring.  I'm in ridiculous pain and limping by the end of my shifts (which they refuse to shorten), so I don't recommend this for anyone in a similar situation.   They won't let you switch to a different position in the store until you've been there for 6 months.  You don't get a discount card until you've been there for 90 days. My coworkers are just miserable, no one smiles."
bad,It's a ok company to work for if you dont have a family . If you are providing for yourself or one child then Its durable.  Its really not much to say but you need another job while working at walmart unless you are  high up in management.  They have fun events that involves the employees and they try to be nice but at rhen end of thr day nice don't pay bills.
bad,"A typical work day, never enough help, I usually stocked two departments. Learned how to use the gemini and used the hand held ones a couple of times. Also, worked in the backroom, learned how to bin the overstock.  Management isn't like it use to be, they don't take care of the problems when they pop up. they all have to many pets. To many not doing their jobs some areas to much drama. Hardest part of the job is trying to get your department done so you can go do another one. Enjoyed working with some of the co-workers."
bad,"Always a lot to do"
bad,"rebajas internas "
bad,Management in my opinion were not on the same page which caused tension through the store. I was tossed to work in departments that I was open to but had little to no knowledge of.
bad,"Otima empresa pena que quase nao tinhamos beneficios."
bad,"I enjoyed the work because I like to work with my hands. Unfortunately, there wasn't any advancement within the company."
bad,"a empresa é ótima pois tem um plano de carreira muito bom, porem a gestão é horrível, pelo menos na loja  que atuei. Possui acumulo abusivos de funções e não da o suporte devido ao funcionário, fazendo com que se sinta desmotivado. Os interesses pessoais tbm atrapalham muito, visto que a empresa prega um trabalho coletivo. Há falta de profissionalismo na gestão."
bad,"It was an overall good job. I was okay with the different time schedules. We were able to get at least three breaks in between the hours of working. I just had a few issues with the managers and supervisors. I learned different areas of the store and what merchandise is where. Co-workers are somewhat good to communicate, but some are not so good. The most enjoyable part of the job was the breaks. The hardest part of the job is when I'm put in a section with a lot of merchandise that needs to be stock at a certain time limit."
bad,Interesting place to work. Really rather not share information.  Indeed will not let me move on unless I type text in this box. i am choosing not to review walmart.
bad,Management was a mess and could never reconcile their plans with each other. The employees were almost constantly at war with each other.
bad,Was literally thrown into the fire. I worked electronics and didn't know much more than the average shopper. Management didn't teach me a thing. Anything I learned was from other employees in the electronics department. The modules you have do on the computer for to work for walmart don't really help at all when you actually get on a register. I had no idea or my direct supervisor was or where there were all day.
bad,I love working with others. I am a quick learner who can follow instructions. I love to be safe and have a clean work environment.
bad,I worked at walmart for 8 months. Got my first write up 3 weeks later for not having a poolhook and stepping on a pallet to reach a box which i was new couldnt give me a warning. Everytime i would miss a day i would always call in for some reason to them they never found a call i made to them but when i told them i could show you guys my phone history to show the calls i made which where over 10+ they werent interested to both manager and Ops. My badge never worked for the vending machines to get a pair of gloves or a pen i would tell my managers yet none did something about it but say i got you and would help me out my using there own badge but not once did they take care of my situation. On Orientation they told us steps are removed 6 months yet mine took up to a whole year i worked both weekdays and weekends i worked friday thru sunday confusing schedule sometimes weekdays managers rules were different from weekends causing me to get alot of write ups managers didnt really care about peoples situations unless you were in their level. I was starting to get tired of DC until i didnt show up for 2-3 weeks because i got all my wisdom teeth removed called in everyday when i finally went back the following week they called me to the office and wrote me up for all the days i missed which led me to a step 4 got a saftey and was terminated on the spot when i told them i had paper work they just kept nodding there heads like if they were blocking what i had to say out of there ears then decided to go along with the termination then said they would give me a call 3 weeks passed by no
bad,Pay was low made minimum wage. Co-workers easy to get along with but a lot of them not very good worker probably due to low pay. Company will avoid overtime at all cost. Did have an excellent manager over our department.
bad,"The management couldn't handle the workload and productivity of Walmart which made it difficult to work, I had to handle too many different jobs at once."
bad,"salary managers hide in an office all day avoiding work,  there are two levels of management completely not needed to run the store, need one opinion or note and you get them from different levels of management that don't help anyone especially not the customer."
bad,Well i will say it started off good but after a couple of months it started going down hill . employees think they are managers and the managers let them think that . so it causes a lot of confusion in the work environment all the time . some of the managers do no know any positions that they are managing which to me how can lead a team if u haven't worked the position ? so yea it was alright as far as the scheduling goes but everything starts with management . Im just talking about the one particular store I'm working at not all stores are like that I'm sure.
bad,"Wal-mart as a company is more-or-less fine. Individual stores however can be horrible and the store I happened to work at was going through a rough period. Hard hours, low managment interaction, unclear directions and guidelines, dis-organization running rampant."
bad,it a nice place to work i really like it there i did find out the hard way there is no job sacurity. u could be fired any time with no notice.
bad,"I absolutely loved the customers and the job itself, but the environment and the management is what made me dread going to work every single day.  A typical day would just be so stressful because they didn't treat their employees very well. It never felt like the management cared very well so it became very hard. I did really love the job itself though, and the customers I had the pleasure to meet."
bad,Wal-MArt is just like most places. unless you absolutely love your job it is horrible. They didn't pay as well as they should have for the work I did.
bad,I was ok. My co workers were fun to work with!. The job itself was ok. Did not like the scheduling too much. Overall enviroment was good.
bad,management really it makes it hard to work for them. they leave out a lot of details when it comes to how you get paid and are very rude.
bad,"Walmart is a very high paced workplace. I learned a lot of management skills here. The area is high theft, so there was a lot to do for an asset protection associate."
bad,empresa con buen ambientede trabajo buena opcion de trabajo
bad,"when it comes to a typical day inside of Wal-Mart it can be very stressful at times, some of the co-workers you can manage to get along with and will help you with out giving lip as far as others you just speak and keep going. It becomes very hard when you aren't able to stay in your area to get your job done due to being pulled but you just keep going smile and do your very best."
bad,"Somehow, it seem that people act differently when they're at Walmart. You get rougher, angrier customers than one would see anywhere else. It is like a switch is flipped and you as an associate get the brute end of everything."
bad,"Help Customers to find their needs effectively"
bad,Management is terrible. Hourly workers follow managers lead and are not usually very helpful to customers of coworkers. Good workers go unnoticed and bad workers go unchecked. Only positive I have is that it is a stress free work environment as most workers have just given up and don't care anymore.
bad,simply job making sure cashier are working taking breaks and meal breaks at the correct time. processing returns running the money center and just making sure every customer has an enjoyable experience at walmart.
bad,"Management does not follow procedure, they are rude, the customers are sometimes rude as well, the management has you do tasks that are not in your job description. They do give you a lot of hours though."
bad,"co workers were ok to work with but the store manager was no good at what he did, if you want a fast pas job then work there, they can be to pushy and like to change things way to much"
bad,i liked the job but the staff was very rude and management didnt do anything so i chose not to continue on in that company for seasonal work but the job it sealf was great sutch a shame
bad,"Walmart is supposed to be a structured store. My day at work as a Department Manager would consume of scanning my outs, scanning my backroom, price changes, negatives, any mods I have due that current week, and every Monday and Thursday there is a new process called Shelf Availability that takes up almost a whole day, and on Tuesday and Friday department managers are supposed to work their Reports which take quite a while as well. The Good things about Walmart is being able to train and gain more skills, like receiving trucks, vendor receipts, claiming out damaged items, and top stock."
bad,"Most of the management was great, as you find in any company some are not the most fun to be around but for the most part the company is better then its reputation, the biggest down side is the pay but you do learn a lot while working there. The experience I gained has helped me move forward a lot in life thus far."
bad,If you like riding forklifts and micro managing people then this is the company. Great bonus and hours. You have to really believe in the walmart culture
bad,es buena empresa solo lo unico que es muy bajo el sueldo pero por lo otro esta bien el trabajo
bad,"Wal-Mart doesn't provide any type of management training, it all boils down to whether or not you have enough experience for the job."
bad,"I had to find out what department to work in when I got to work was hired for the garden center but did not work there much I did learn a lot about how retail works,management needs to get together and get on the same issues in  what and where  a person is to do I did get along with the co-workers"
bad,Really enjoyed working with most of the guys out in the garage and at the automotive counter.  I also liked helping the customers pick out the right tires and other misc. parts that was available at Wal-Mart for their vehicles.
bad,Everyday you're yelled at for something or another. They were constantly cutting my hours and did not respect my availability. Most of the management staff was very rude and it took along time to get help from when there was a problem.
bad,"Walmart is ok to work at but the management is horrible. No consideration for employees. Good for a starter job out of high school, but would definetely not make it a career."
bad,"I, have worked at Wal-mart almost a year now and the management isn't very good at their job. All of them tell you something different to do and there is no communication,often resulting in a task not getting completed."
bad,Well things were good tell everything started changing and management didnt know how to do there job. Alway was just sitting down and not doing anything. Other than that my department manager was awesome. My days working there were great.
bad,Walmart seems great on the surface but backstage politics and other things like managers not liking you will quickly expose the darkness that is walmart.
bad,"I spend my day loading grocery delivery trucks, there is not much to it.The job its self is fine, ive been there over a year and would like to learn new skills out side of retail."
bad,"Very Productive Work, Not a job for everyone you have to have great people skills as well as enjoy what it is that your doing"
bad,gostei muito de trabalhar no walmart aprendi muitas coisa.
bad,"Sweep and mop floors."
bad,Its a great place to work if your a fast paced person & truly can handling packages & your stacking skills are on point to place items on pallets and moving them to sales floor
bad,Company can be awesome to work for but in another since they can be really vindictive. Retaliation is completely illegal but is used along with intimidation on a regular basis
bad,Not flexible with scheduling. The higher management looked down on everyone. The pay wasn't great. The raises were worse.
bad,"good place to meet people"
bad,wal-mart cares more for sales and less for employees they drive off of making sure customers are so happy that they forget that the employees are important.
bad,"was a key holder at A buck or Two and would start the day doing the books, would open the store, did cash, orders stocked shelves. "
bad,"Full time employee here yet every employee there is getting their hours cut due to the ""wage increase"". I'm working part time hours but under full time status."
bad,"worse company i have ever worked for , terrible hours nad even worse pay as well as benefits and management i wouldnt suggest anyone work for this company"
bad,"I worked as a stocker and lifted boxes in health and bauty I liked working with my co-workers I'm a people person, the hard part was not having any help when you needed it. the most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customer."
bad,"Start my day by reviewing any pick up today orders from the internet, activate, fix, and configure any customers' phones that needs help. Answer customers' questions pertaining to any electronic device. Help stock merchandise, log in inventory, and run to customer service to verify any merchandise getting returned. Hardest part is getting everything done but also most enjoyable as it brings up challenges and working together as a team. My co workers are wonderful and ask me any questions that pertain to technology."
bad,Walmart was a terrible company too work for. They underpay there employees for the work that we have to do. Most of the time we had to proceed duties that where not part of our job descriptions.
bad,"as much as i enjoyed working for this job there was not a lot that i can say that was a good part of the job. A typical day at work was a face paced environment, rude and some appreciated customers and security had very good adversity."
bad,store 3156 really needs new management on the overnight shift. some of them are rude and belittle you in front of other coworkers which isn't right and they don't treat you well.
bad,"un dia en el trabajo era muy movido no parabas hasta tu hora de salida y con el tiempo aprendí muchas cosas me volvi mas rapido y capas de resolver problemas cotidianos y dar solución pronta, la gerencia es un poco pesada todo el tiempo estan detras de uno, mis compañeros son los mejores compañeros que pude haber tenido te ayudaban en lo que necesitaras,la parte mas dificil del trabajo era cada año que nos tocaba el inventario anual de tienda pero eso me gusto mucho por que aprendes sobre el acomodo y compacta miento de bodegas."
bad,"Walmart as a company is a good company. They want to invest in their associates. This on a whole is true, however you can have a vastly different experience depending on what store you work at.  The store I worked at was extremely understaffed when I arrived and still is over 6 months later.  We are told to hire but not given time to do so.  Because of the staffing issue, management is doing a lot of physical labor.  This in itself is not a problem but it becomes one when the amount of that labor far exceeds the time required to do the management tasks.  I end up having to stay 3 or 4 hours late each day or come in on my off day to catch up on work I am not allowed to do any other time."
bad,I worked very hard from the time I got in to the time I left. I learned the ins and outs of retail. My staff was the best part of my job.
bad,The hours were bad so did the pay. management doesn't like to help out but I loved the people I worked with they were all helpful and they were friendly.
bad,"A typical day at work included unpacking grocery items and placing them on the correct shelves to be purchased by the customers.  Continuous breaking opening of many boxes. Looking at stock numbers and placing them in their proper location.  I mainly worked the pharmacy section of the store.  This consisted of 7 isles. "
bad,"My time with Walmart wasn't always an easy one. I did however, learn quite a bit about customer service. Management at this particular store were hard to work for as they always zeroed in on the bad rather than your good of their workers. The most enjoyable part of working there, was making friends with co workers and meeting some of the most amazing customers."
bad,"ambiente de trabajo bueno. muchas horas, poco descanso para almorzar, la parte mas dificil: trabajar los domingos, la parte que mas me gusto:el trabajo de telefonista"
bad,Walmart was a very productive environment. The only problem came where employees were put in other departments that had nothing to do with their job description. Management was poor and extremely confusing.
bad,Management was not organized and rude to employees. Employees were in tears most of time from being treated unfairly. Work load that was assigned for one employee was all most near impossible.
bad,"I have worked for Wal-Mart for a couple of years now, and I can say that my first day on the job was the highlight of my career with them. Over the course of years, there was a lot of turnover. Most of my friends leaving or left, and a lot of good managers replaced with idiots. At the beginning, job was hard, a lot was expected out of you but once you got the hang of it you really start to notice that the managers have nothing better to do but throw their own work onto your shoulders. Managing your space, your work, and your area is simple, handling your space and your work doubled-up by your manager who simply does not want to do their work is insanely stressful. On the flip side of the workload, it does take a good 4-5 months for Wal-Mart to notice you did anything wrong, and put you in the spotlight to tell you how badly you messed up 200 some odd days ago."
bad,"I usually slice meats, fry foods, and clean and shut down the deli. It was a new experience for me and I learned how the deli is operated throughout the day. The managers were alright, but my boss was very unprofessional. The hardest part of my job was the environment and trying to do things alone. The enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers."
bad,"Wal-Mart is a decent option if you just need some income, because they are constantly hiring. Of course, the reason they're constantly hiring is due to people leaving because working there is not the best of experiences."
bad,Working at Walmart is not a positive experience. The management stinks and there is tons of drama. I would never want to work there again.
bad,My experience was awful here. The management here is unprofessional and are not truthful at all. I worked in a department that paid more and I never got my pay raises even after going to higher up management.
bad,"This company does not provide healthcare and is a very fast pace company with low compensation, Management is very organized and very goal oriented.  I like the company but very low compensation."
bad,"Management need improvement, growth depends on who you know, pay is very low. not enough hours to be a dependable job. Need improvement."
bad,"Yo aprendi en el empleo muchas cosas como saber un ambiente de trabajo , recibir la mercancia , entrada y salida de la misma , acomodo de la mercancia tener acomodad la bodega etc.."
bad,Worked to hard for the pay. Upper  Management and HR staff are very understanding. I got sick. The most hardest part was leaving my staff.  The best part was going home.
bad,"Work is decent, start off with three to six pallets, depending what the truck carries on a daily basis. i learned where all the merchandises belong and I also work at the cash register."
bad,"Met lots of nice customers.  Had good managers for the most part.  Nice, steady pace of work.  (90% of customers were fine folks).  Made some good friends from steady customers."
bad,"7 years in retail environment, advanced to department manager quickly. Lots of customer service experience,busy work environment. It was fun."
bad,"The people that I worked with are very good people who know what we have to do get the job done, but the management is very poor  because they all have different ways of doing things. They are not all on the same page because they don't want to be responsible for things that go wrong, only things that go right. The worst thing there is communication all of   the time, no one knows what's going on, ever."
bad,"As for walmart here a typical day was never really constant it was unpredictable. One day it could be nice, CSM would be there when needed, breaks given on time. But other days it could be near chaos such as, no CSM to help on time leaving myself and, a customer to wait for almost an hour until the problem could be fixed. As well as breaks could be given out super over due or even early. I remember one time I had a break coming soon and it took them almost 2 hours for them to finally give it to me. I even told them about it a bit before because it was getting busy. I even reminded them 7 minutes before it was actually my break. This was one of the hardest things to deal with. To be honest other than being a cashier I was excepted to: put non-bought items back on the shelf, return hangers to the clothing department, organize my register lane, and put away garbage. Sometimes I was brought back to other departments to help out with them. One time I was asked to help the toy department put clearance prices on items that were going on sale. As well i was also asked to help organize shelves in the home goods department and toys as well. I don't recall ever being told this on my job description. But I am too nice I hate not helping others out. But I was doing more than excepted and they in my opinion weren't giving me a fair payment. Thankfully I had some employees who would help me put items back on the shelf if I was putting away an overly filled cart. Not only this but if I ever had a problem with a small thing some co-workers were nice enough to help me. The most enjoyable thing"
bad,Es buen lugar para trabajar solo que presumen mucho de su cultura laboral y no se respeta. ademas de que niegan las prestaciones por ley.
bad,"Great co workers, but management didn't care at all. Was great learning on how to work on cars but they didn't really do much training."
bad,It was a student job. It was more about assisting customers with electronic products and cell phone contracts.I had to do several projects that dealt with electronic products.
bad,"When we were not short staffed, which was rare, everything ran smoothly.  Most of the management team were easy to get along with until they were under pressure."
bad,"Walmart has some pros. but many cons. "
bad,"The work wasn't too hard and most of my coworkers were fairly friendly but most of the managers are hateful and rude. Scheduling was terrible, I specifically told them when hired I had college classes on Tuesday and Thursday and they told me they could work around it although at least once a month I got scheduled for one of those days and when I would tell someone they usually got mad and acted like I scheduled myself. Also my hours varied so bad that I once worked a 32 hour week and then the next week I only got 7 hours."
bad,"i was an overnight stocker at wal-mart on john ben shepard for almost 2 years, the over night team was weak when i worked there. the job is very team work depended because if your co-workers didn't finish their task in time they depended on others to help finish. the management was very weak they let some get away with tom foolery and didn't lift a hand to help at the end of the shift even though it's their fault for being to lenient on some and dependent on others to finish the work. the most enjoyable part of the job was just that it was very social and the hardest part was just the stress that was put on you by multiple managers trying to make you do what each one of them wanted contradicting the other managers. the store is ran by multiple managers and there is no real cooperation between managers to make decisions they just all want to pretend each of themselves are the main boss."
bad,"Enjoyed working with the management team."
bad,"A typical day at Wal-Mart would consist of Doing returns, stocking shelves, binning merchandise, customer service, unloading trucks, cashier, and covering other departments. Upper Management never thank you for anything and never even greeted you by name or greeted you period. Hours are always being cut to point where you had to sign up. Co-workers were great everybody got along with everybody and helped each other. Hardest part of the job was taking the unruly criticism from upper management. they treated you like you were stupid. the most enjoyable was going to work and working with the co-workers and having fun."
bad,"The associates are great people done their in Nogales, The customers can be a bit challenging due to the fact that most of them want a discount on everything that they purchase."
bad,"Never a dull or boring moment in the Deli at Wal-Mart with activities never-ending; from slicing meat and cheese for customers to cooking food in the fryers and serving customers from the hot or cold bar, each and every day is filled, leaving one with little to no time for boredom. A great deal of patience is needed for servicing the public and handling co-workers, along with a handle of optimizing multitasking abilities."
bad,Working for Walmart is OK on a personal level and does offer benefits such as medical that are otherwise difficult for people to get but offers little to those of us that have leadership experience and/or a higher education. Walmart has shown me that they are all about running their associates and management ragged for minimal compensation. Like most retailers these days Walmart talks about how they hire veterans what they don't talk about is how they insult veterans & especially educated veterans by offering minimum wage or just above minimum wage to start which does not pay the bills for anyone!!!
bad,"All employees would be required to run all parts of stores regardless of their job position. Store managers (all levels) would on any given day have to stock shelves, run cash, perform customer service duties, perform maintenance duties, along with their own daily required daily work duties. "
bad,not a lot of motivated workers didn't learn much employees will do as much work as they felt like unorganized atmosphere nothing was ever organized benefits were terrible definitely not the greatest retail store to work with
bad,"Good benefits and compensation but they ask a lot from you and take away weekends, evenings, overnight shifts and holidays."
bad,I feel the company don't take care of there associates any longer they no longer communicate or listen to the  associates so they will be able to do there jobs.
bad,"A typical day working at Walmart is basically assisting customers.  I've learned how to grow within the company, co-workers are all mentalities.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with different mentalities of management and co-workers.  The most enjoyable part is learning different aspects of retail and positions."
bad,falta de funcionários gerencia negligente e falha mas a cultura da empresa e boa quando aplicado .
bad,Meet new people and friendly faces daily. There is also promotion from within and very easy to move up the ladder with hard work and determination!
bad,I am very hardworking and love a fast paced environment. I always go the extra mile for my customers and employees. The store is very busy at times but I smile and treat everyone like there my first customer of the day.
bad,"I like working with my associates.  I have a hard time with management.  They seem to not communicate well.  And they make things so stressful sometimes it wasn't necessary.  At my work I go see what needs to be done if my truck came in and then I go see management to see which direction they want.  If I am working seasonal candy or regular candy.  Management is the hardest part for me.  They have their favorites and they harass me sometimes.  This manager I have was doing that to me for awhile.  I feel like their trying to get rid of me.  I like when management leaves me a lone.  When I can work with my co workers it's always fun.  I have my favorite customers that come in and look for me.  I look for them too, they give me excitement about how they like how I work and how much of a friend they have become over the years.  It's the best part of my day."
bad,Lot's of intense mult-tasking is expected.  I really enjoyed helping the Service desk customers who arrived with complaints and returns and felt that I made a positive differance when I helped to enhance their WalMart experience.
bad,"I did not like working here. I did like my team members, but the upper management were never on the same page. It was always something different they were picking at. They had a severe lack of communication between each other. The pay was horrible and they expected much more from the staff than they could give at times."
bad,"Satisfying all upper management within the entire store is virtually impossible."
bad,I worked during the holiday season so it was very busy. I got along with my co-workers.
bad,Decent place to work. Hours were ok and pay was ok. Not a place to make a career
bad,"Deadlines and job duties without the staffing and resources to set up for success. More work for less pay. Non flexible hours, and lack respect for the individual."
bad,"Recepcion de mercancia manejo de inventario, cobro de mercancia,"
bad,"A normal day at work for me felt like I was on an assembly line most of the time, which is good in certain aspects but not all. I liked knowing if there were particular and important tasks that needed done within the course of a day and my bosses were usually good about letting me know such things. I always enjoyed getting compliment from patrons both on my positive attitude given my personal circumstances. My co-works, a few in particular, were REALLY fun to be around since we were constantly talking and laughing.    "
bad,a typical work day would be I arrive at work we have a 10pm meeting every one goes and task in to see what their duties are for that night then we would go get trash bags so we could disgard our trash. amd start on whatever frate they've put out for us. I think the hardest part of the job for me would be zoning.
bad,"This was an excellent college job with a very flexible schedule. However, this is not a good career choice."
bad,"waited on customers, sold cell phones and accessories. Helped on register when needed"
bad,"If your young and like a fast pace workplace this is for you."
bad,My years at Wal-Mart where good. I learned a lot about the company. I worked with most amazing team and what I consider friends. There was nothing hard about my job. The hardest thing is moving up in the company. I loved My job.
bad,"the staff wasn't knowledgeable"
bad,"Learning modules,  loved making customers happy, fast pace, great co-workers, hardest part was keeping customers happy."
bad,"The Job Itself is Fine, the work is Simple Enough to understand and Little changes from Day to Day. Unloading the Trailers is not the Easiest job in the store, but it is Rewarding to see our job well done. However, At times Dealing with the various other parts of the store can be a bit of a trail, as there is little consistency in terms of skill and attitude among the various Associates and, Most Importantly, the Management. They Managers Don't seem to always be on the same page, One saying to do this, and another Saying to ignore that order and do this, with the Associate being the one to be reprimanded For said Orders. Having an Entire hour for lunch is a slight bonus.  Overall the Job itself is a good job for those entering the workforce, but has little in the way of Long-Term Personal Satisfaction."
bad,"Job duties can become overwhelming for close to minimum wage."
bad,"I have enjoyed working at Wal Mart solely because of my co-workers. The benefits with the company take too long to achieve. However, aside from that, Wal Mart overall is not a bad place to work if you are looking for job security. "
bad,"A typical day is we would start work at seven in the morning. I would gather that days schedules, workload, notes, recalls and objective from the store tour. I would then delegates the jobs that needed to be done to the merchandise supervisors. Then I would do schedules, hiring, evaluations and any other administration tasks that needed to be done. From this point I would follow up with my shift supervisors on the conclusion of the notes or tasks. I would then follow up with customer experiences and any other complaints that need to be address. From there we would have a 2 pm planning meeting. We would plan for the next day so the night shift would have a easy shift. From there I would spend the rest of the night following up today's notes, cleaning up the stores and handling customer complaints. Usually a managers day will end at 10 or 11 and night."
bad,"I loved working with my fellow associates and helping customers in any way I could. I constantly learned something new everyday."
bad,"I get to work about 10 Pm and start the night. The store is disorganized, and chaotic No one can really seem to get along as I try to just get my job done. Management is about fifty fifty, half I really do like and enjoy working with, while the other half is constantly talked about in a permanent negative light. I learned a good hard work ethic, and to ignore distractions in the work place around you."
bad,"I work the typical 5 nights/week, with 2 days off.  Wal-Mart has taught me various parts of the job, such as customer service, stocking, and inventory.  I have a lot of co-workers, ranging from stockers to cashiers to fellow inventory associates.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with various amounts of change.  The most enjoyable part about my job is working with customers who have the same qualities as me."
bad,I got no training on how to do my job right. I learned how to talk and help customers. Food safety. No all the management was overly friendly. Hard to work up in the company. The coworkers where nice and made friends easily
bad,"I was a cashier, customer service, and door greeter at Walmart. The management were horrible. The hardest part of my job was the shortage of hours. The most enjoyable was the customers I've met."
bad,I would go to work and get straight to working the register. I learned how to operate a register and how to make work relationships. Management some of them were nice and other members of management acted like the employee's were just numbers. I absolutely loved my co-workers! They were awesome and nice they were also very patient with me while I learned the register. The hardest part of the job was getting time off for school related activities that meant half of my grade if I did not show up. I would have to say that my most enjoyable parts of the job were when I went to lunch and was able to converse with others in the break room.
bad,Good work experience but pay is not adequate for the amount of work expected of you.
bad,"It is almost like working for fast food except that it is retail. As a cashier you work in a fast-paced, repetitive environment where days are pretty much starting to blend real fast. Not much actually changes around the store except the prices and when they do change the cashiers seem to not know about it till last minute. Some of their rules for customers should be more stricter and actually have some decent security around to prevent the loss of money. They leave it all up to people who are barely trained as it is to catch shoplifters. So if you do not mind working in this type of environment then I say go ahead. It is a good experience to as least have for future reference."
bad,"My expertise cashier position quickly advanced to a member of the service desk team. Not only held responsible for all monetary transactions, processing claims and returns also merchandising. Management could have been better although very professional. A variety of co-workers normally generated an exceptional teamwork. The hardest part of the job was the lack of cashiers. The most enjoyable was the opportunity."
bad,"The day at work will be very hectic as we always have a lack of staff. A lack of staff means that the department managers have to pick up the slack plus have your own work done, plus any extras that are given to you. "
bad,"Good place to work,meet alot of people,good co-workers. I learned how to price,cull,and crisp product.I would cull tables and wet wall then refill with fresh product."
bad,"The hardest part of my job is being able to be in multiple different places while still being pulled to this side and that.  It is especially difficult during the holiday hours when staffing isn't as great as it could be.  Management are nice, engaging, and try their best to make it a better work environment, though sometimes it is hard to find them.  This job is great when making certain displays in which a variety of management and coworkers get involved, and also during CMN events where everyone tries to pitch in and have fun.  The largest downsides are pay and scheduling.  It takes a while for you to make enough for it to really make a difference and electronic scheduling is unable to appropriately schedule people for coverage and at some points you really don't get a personal life with what it gives you."
bad,"I would clock in, go to an assigned register,work for 2 hours then take a 15 minute break then, work 2  more hours then take an hour lunch break, then work  2 hours take another 15 minute break then work my final 2 hours then clock out and go home. I enjoyed this job. standing up for so long was hard but bearable."
bad,The managers at this shop are very very poor and have no idea what they are doing half the time nd have made my time there very stressful.
bad,"Fast paced place to work in, meet a lot of interesting people."
bad,Processed transactions and returned accurate change; provided friendly customer service. I learned how to used cash machine ;cash process; improve customer service skill .Our co-worker help each other. The hardest part of the job is memorized the product code. The most enjoyable part of the job is we help each other .
bad,"Walmarts are supposed to keep a certain number of cart associates on staff at any given time. The Walmart I worked at kept a little less than half the required number of part time cart associates, and no full time associates. As a result, cart associates could very well find themselves working an entire parking lot alone. On top of that, they get paid two/three grades under other entry-level positions for what could easily pass as more strenuous and stressful labor."
bad,they  dont like to pay there employees and they cut hours they make you come in and cover other departments because they want to cut hours
bad,"A typical day at Wal-Mart, as a shoe associate consisted of cleaning up shoes that customers left all over the floor, making sure all the shoe displays were tied and proper and making sure the shoe boxes were lined up properly. In addition, the job consisted of helping customers find the right shoes they wanted in their price range. As well as, keeping the shoes clean and customers happy, we had to make sure to be everywhere, since theft was a common problem. Furthermore, if we did not have a shoe that the customer wanted, part of the job consisted of calling other Wal-Marts to get the item in, as well as taking in returns from the front."
bad,As a cashier you meet lots of new people. Some people are really great and they come back to you on a regular basis if they seen you. I learned my register skills here. Some managers were really nice and understanding and always worked with you if you needed them to. Coworkers were always so nice and helpful. Hardest part was dealing with the difficult customers you encounter everyday. Most enjoyable is meeting some really cool new people that always tried to make you smile.
bad,Great Place To Work enjoyed working there very organized would refer
bad,It wasn't too bad. It really depends on the store and the stores condition as to how well you like your job there.
bad,"Although I was not with the company too long I was around long enough to get the feel of the atmosphere. I enjoyed the experience and took in everything I could learn to better equip myself for the future. However, I would not recommend this to be a long-term job for anyone if they had the choice. The company made you feel very unimportant and didn't appreciate the hard work, quality, time and efforts of your duties. It is very fast paced. Corners were cut everywhere. From the time I started working in the company to the time I finished, I was working in a different area, doing a different job, at the pay and title of what I was originally hired. All employees were shuffled around like this. Working more demanding jobs at lower pay and cutting hours without notice."
bad,"Many night stock workers at wal mart are constantly being written up by non-working supervisors. They have an  absurd sys. Where as an employee must run to a clock to punch in to their timing clock , some every 15 min., 20 Min, etc. All  night, causing the workers to constantly fall behind on their stocking task assigned to them. What a waste of man power. Management is aware of this ridiculous procedure, and uses this as a way to write up even the best of shelf stockers.This explains such a high turn over of employees a wal mart."
bad,"my experience was really good i learn and discover that i really can work in very high pressure and i can do long hour "
bad,while it was fun to work at walmart there were some down sides co-workers that did not have any work ethic were seemingly treated with more respect then associates who always tried to do there best while management on nights were helpful they did not seem to help past anything other then nights even when there need to be more communicated between shifts though this i learned very good communication skills very quickly since it was left to lower associates to communicate between the shifts
bad,"My typical day at work consist of tendering customers, customer service, customer relations, stocking and zoning registers. I have learned a lot of new things from the different areas of the store since I have worked there. I have worked in clothing merchandising, cashiering, accounting and stocking within the 15 years. It was a awesome opportunity to get to work with amazing people. I don't think I have experienced a hard part of the job because I'm always up for a challenge. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customer satisfied."
bad,Walmart is a good company that has many things to offer its associates such as benefits and healthcare. Walmart also tries to find there associates to be self motivated and be ready to work really hard. All in all Walmart was a good company
bad,Need more benefits and pay workers better wages.Good environment  for the most part enjoyed my coworkers
bad,"I worked there for many years. When it was ""Sam Walton's"" vision. Then it turned into more of a ""Profit"" issue. We were expected to do more with less. "
bad,every night you clock in and start stocking or setting modular it is based on a time table set by Wal-Mart. Management is ok. I made friends with a lot of coworkers. The hardest part of the job was always getting done in the time task It seemed like the harder you worked the more they gave you to do. The most enjoyable is just meeting people and becoming friends.
bad,"In the beginning of my job at Wal Mart, I typically stood at a register for 8 hours and scanned customers purchases.  I enjoyed the actual physical job of scanning and without even realizing it, I picked up the 10 key in record time.  After some time there, I was then taught layaway, and clothing depts, and was moved where needed.  I was then taught to be a back up customer service manager, and I learned to fix register errors, deal with unhappy customers, and get the money the cashiers needed when they were running low.  Additionally, I learned how to become a member of the hiring committee, and interviewed potential new hires, took on the safety committee, and was training. I also went and learned new store set ups. Management at the particular store I worked at was mostly unavailable, and often temperamental.  Eager to let me learn and work in multiple positions, including higher paying ones, but unwilling to pay me for my knowledge and willingness.  Sadly, the co -workers, though most were very nice, were unhappy with the job and their treatment by management, so it showed in the store and to the customers.  I think that giving 100% for so long, getting extra responsibility and trust, yet not being compensated was the hardest part of my job. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning how to interview potential employees, and knowing my opinion was important."
bad,"There was no way to get bored. If you found as position getting repetitive and wanted more challenging task, you could always switch departments"
bad,Hard to get the job don in the alotted time with the amount of peaple alotted.
bad,they have positiobs im not making the pay im hoping pay changes soon
bad,"co-workers were afraid of loosing their jobs"
bad,"mal ambiente de trabajo,envidias,mala organización,personas prepotentes."
bad,Work usually goes by pretty fast but could be a better review in Service and employment respect.
bad,this was a typical day at work  alot of communicating with customers and co workers overworked for not enough pay
bad,"Customer walks into the store very agiated. She had gone to another store the night before and bought a pack of chicken wings. What she hadn't done was looked at the date and of course it was out of date. Not only that but it was wasn't any good. Well, the cashier was telling her that she needed to take it back to the store where she got it. She, the customer was on her way to work and didn't have time to go all the way to that store and was giving the cashier the what for. I took the liberty and walk over to find out what was going on. Told the cashier in a calm manner that I would handle it. I apologized to the customer as the cashier was new, took care of the customer, gave her a $10 gift card, sent her on her way, went back to the cashier and explained the procedure to her and everything went well.  At least until the next hour."
bad,it was good environment and my co-work was very helpful. i really enjoyed working there.
bad,"cook, clean, and serve food all day. I learned how to cook certain type of foods. My co-workers was elderly and slow moving. hardest part was filling out all the orders everyday. management showed favoritism."
bad,"Treat pharmacist okay, but terrible watching how they treat other associates. I got no vacation/benefits for a year"
bad,i go in and read the t mat to see what im doing  for the day.i have learn that people are all different in the styles they like and how much help they want.my co-works are good people and try hard.the hardest  part of my job is trying to help a customer with the phone ringing and trying to write a message at the same time.meeting new people is the best part of my job and making a customer smile.and my management is the best in the world. i will miss all of them. but i have my G E D Now and i must have a better job and more money. Walmart is a great place to work but it does not pay enough.i just need a chance Walmart gave me one and i know some one is willing to let me come to be a team member.
bad,just learning how the team works and what they expected from you. I truly had a ball.
bad,"stocking"
bad,"Good place to work and you're surrounded by good people, but how Wal-Mart is now compared too ten years ago is different with unreasonable policies and a terrible absent policy thats handled by a computer that generates a booting system with kicking ot employees with no notice at all."
bad,"Usually work holidays."
bad,I worked with a lot  nice people and there was a lot of team work. that was the best thing even for holiday's.
bad,"con las personas que trabaje fue un ambiente agradable con los compañeros de otros departamento, el cotoreo con las muchachas con los hombres pero lo único que no me gusto de tanto tiempo es de que el sueldo no era lo justo asta que me sali de ai."
bad,"Walmart is all about customer service and making sure people pay less and to live better. As an employee, I've learned a lot about retail and what it means to be a part of a team. A typical day at work involves a lot of physical strength and to keep up with a fast pace work environment. There are many levels of management that work side by side with each other and makes sure the store is up to par with what standards are for Walmart. The hardest part of the job, is to maintain and balance the time we are tasked and expected to start and finish a job. In order to accomplish a goal, time management is the key. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with a great set of people who are passionate about working and is determined to get the job done. Many of my co-workers are very good at meeting the standards that are expected of our team, and also knows how to maintain a stress free environment. Overall Walmart is a good  place to learn."
bad,"Stock material, operate forklift, cashier, help customers typical day."
bad,"Overnight stocker, processed freight and filled shelves with merchandise"
bad,"Reuniões de piso "
bad,Was not used to the physical work involved. But after a little while i got used to it. alot of walking. Lost 30 pounds doing the work which made me feel good. Time sensitive work was really hard to do at first. Took a long time to figure out the short cuts.
bad,The Job was typical overnight stocker. the work was exciting and challenging. I enjoyed the work but not the culture. Management was great but the overall company was poor in customer service.
bad,"el ambiente se puede considerar bueno, como en todo hay problemas con los empleados pero nada que no se pueda solucionar, lo jefes son accesibles me refiero a los gerentes, el jefe de mi departamento era accesible cuando así lo consideraba aunque casi siempre era con las mismas personas"
bad,"The place is awful to work for; managers are usually at one end of the good/bad spectrum, and the bad always outweigh the good. Never fully staffed, so you are expected to pick up the slack. Pay was nice and yearly increases were a little bit of a positive."
bad,"stressful and hard putting clothes back on the right shelfs even when there was no where to fit."
bad,when I first started working there in 2004 it was great they would work with you with your scheduling. then it got to where they didn't really care about their employees. they gave employees who did not work as hard a higher position than the ones who did
bad,Eu aprendi que o conhecimento é importante e que a cada dia aprendemos á lidar com as pessoas.
bad,To much work and when me working there it was in overnight and that time I have 2 kids the 13 & 15 I have a problem with the school and me quick. Me star in $10.20 and the end $12.40 that good but can't continue working here
bad,I started overnights in my younger years as a merchandiser refilling the shelves with merchandise and spent most of my days in the electronics department. I got my first advancement by my manager not wanting to wait in line for his break and asked if anyone ever offered a electronics associate position which not only made me a merchandiser but a cashier. Wal Mart then started a new POS system which required more work load which I did not mind I learned how to operate a forklift no Receiving Lead so me and other employees rotated between job so was not required to pay for position but held all the responsibility. The hardest part of this job was the employee over work and mistreatment but the co workers were one big family and stuck together which made it worth while at times
bad,A typical Day at work i have learned that you have to be very patience in what you doing on the job. Management I learned that they sometimes do not care about your concerns. Working with my co workers i learned that a lot of them just work on off how they feel and the do very little work but yet and still the load falls on me and I yet strive to get the job done.  The hardest part about working on my job is trying to get help and work as a team. The most enjoyable part to me is completing the task even when its hard.
bad,"The store that I worked at (Benton Harbor, MI) has many very dedicated employees and managers within it.  The major problem with Walmart is corporate not scheduling enough man hours to finish your tasks.  This in turn effects customer service and creates out of stock situations where the product is in the building (stockroom) but with a lack of employees it is not put on the sales floor.  Hopefully this will someday change a bit for the better, as it is getting to the point where it is affecting sales and vendors may not give the bottom prices due to the fact that their products are not being stocked."
bad,"A high tempo work place where a lot is expected from all. The turn over rate is very high, presure is very high."
bad,"I joined Wal-Mart with both them and myself assuming I'd quickly advance into management.  After a few months I knew I could never be a manger at Wal-Mart."
bad,Can be a great job for the right person in the right time/right situation. Lots of upward mobility if you are willing to travel/transfer to difference stores.
bad,"typical day at work I stocked shelves "
bad,"Clock in to work, talk to the nearest manager to your department for any information you may need to get your assignments done. You learn that not all people that get promoted are as intelligent as they would need to be to cover certain areas, nor do they actually try to learn anything they don't know.  Management is difficult and may not actually have any knowledge of the departments the are over. hardest part is doing everything you possibly can and not getting any recognition for doing your job, let alone when we go above and beyond the description of our job. The enjoyable thing is to be familiar with your peers and finding the enjoyment to return every day and continue your work. "
bad,management sucks but since they switch them out so often you barely know whose who?
bad,Worked on the register so I met a lot of people. Heard lots of stories & enjoyed meeting new people. I learned not to be as shy which helped my customer serice skills.
bad,"Worst company I worked for."
bad,"Grupo de trabajo directo y colegas sin problemas y en ambiente de trabajo de buena relación. El problemas se suscita en poco apoyo de parte de la gerencia, y oportunidades de desarrollo."
bad,"Good management, busy work space, and a lot of different types of individuals one must deal with on a customer service basis."
bad,Typical day at work requires each minute to be occupied.  I have nothing else to provide remarks for.
bad,"I enjoyed my job as a cashier and deli worker. It was always exciting to meet new people and get to know them, so when they came back I could address them by their names. And it was nice to see what new products we sold by what customers bought"
bad,"i learn to help others no matter what, i have learn to love one another u never know who u may need "
bad,I can't say a lot of good things about Walmart. The experience varies from store to store but my experience was pretty negative.
bad,"as an overnight stocker we had meetings every night before work began which is nice so you always know whats going on you never feel lost or not know what to do. every min. of your shift is planned out. co-workers were great, for the most part everyone worked together as a team which was important."
bad,"Nice environment, you have all the necessary supplies to get your work done. Get benefits if you can tough it out to get them."
bad,"Walmart is a very interesting place to work, This job enhances my customer service skills. It is a great a experience for working with retail. During this experience I've learned how to deal and interact with people. My days at work are routine. My job is to take care of customers providing them with the right merchandise they need. The hardest part of the job is dealing with an angry customer. I've learned that even though the customer may be wrong just do whatever it takes to keep them happy. My co workers are easy to get along with they look at me as a team leader. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people because I'm a people person and I love working with people. Management team thinks im a hard worker because I do my best and always complete my task at a timely matter."
bad,my manager was very good to work for easy to talk to.
bad,once you got in as an employee. everything stood still. i had mamagement experence and i made 11.00 hour for the running around you are required to do its not worth it.
bad,overall WALMART is a very good company but now its become a BIG BAZAAR because most of the higher management team is from BIG BAZAAR... they run WALMART business like BIG BAZAAR...
bad,"hard work, good learning environment. Management ok. Co workers are great. Do not make employees feel pride or ownership. Working with well trained people."
bad,"organize the cds, dvds. Clean up the aisles. Check out customers at the check out stands. How to be patient with the customers. Management always around. Co workers were helpful. Check out the customers."
bad,Good co-workers and management typical day consists of unloading trucks and freight to sales floor hardest part of job is handling large volumes of customers.What i take from past employment is a great sense of accomplishment.
bad,This is a horrible place to work the managers are rude an disrespectful treat u like u are beneath them u work like a slave doing everything thats not in your job title they allow customers to disrespectful to you an dont take up for there workers by asking the customers to leave
bad,In Walmart you are a number not a name. I was a cashier and I was always busy. I always had to work overtime and it took away from my personal life. it;s very stressful.
bad,parte dificil no tuve m adapto muy bien a los numeros!!soy muy buena manejando cajas haciendo cierres m gustan los numeros!!los colegas buena gente!!la gerencia gente desonesta!! la empresa no valora tus capacidades!!
bad,"Un boxing stuff, putting stuff on shelves, mainly cleaning u and Zoning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"Adorava o que eu fazia, trabalhava com entusiasmo, aprendi muito ser compreensiva, paciente, e amadureci bastante, não tinha nada que eu achasse difícil, pois aprendo muito rápido as coisas, adoro meus colegas de trabalho, uma coisa que me irritou foi a gerência eram muito políticos e eu não concordo, ou você fala a verdade ou então não ande falando o que não deve isso desmotiva os funcionários.Um lugar que eu adorava era a minha sala..."
bad,"working together, things will get right but people does not understand each other"
bad,The management was not on the same page. It was always stressful there.
bad,"i was a stocker, cleaning,and giving good customer service,"
bad,"Os funcionários ajudam uns aos outros, muitas funções das quais muitas delas nem são do seu setor, gerencia mediana, muita troca de horário do expediente, salario baixo se comparado as inúmeras funções que são realizadas."
bad,Start offby checkin in with the management to see what i will be doing for the day. After my job is given to me thats what I do all day.
bad,"The most enjoyable part about my job is customer service and meeting the customers needs. The hardest part about the was the days we were busy because sometimes we were short of staff or sometimes orders would get messed up. My co- workers were enjoyable we all got along. A typical day at work would be easy it consist of taking orders,Answering the phone ,preparing food or condiments."
bad,"E ambiente en general es agradable en cuanto a la relaciones con los compañeros , lo negativo es que es una empresa la cual tiene mucho flujo de clientes y eso implica que como trabajador tienes mucha presión y debes aprender a trabajar rápido y contra el tiempo"
bad,"Fiquei pouco tempo lá.Saia muito tarde,mas aprendi sobre trabalhar com caixa."
bad,Yes it is a job but they do not make you feel important. They are not family oriented like they claim to be. They give supervisors and certain associates special treatment.
bad,"On a normal day of work at Wal-Mart I had customer interaction all day. I dealt with angry, happy, sad types of customers. The management was ok, but they had some scheduling issues, alot. Most of my co-workers were wonderful to work with, but you have co-workers every where you go that slack on the job every once in a while. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customers."
bad,"Il y avait trop de poussière la bas,c'est seulement ça qui plaisait pas."
bad,"I have worked for my current employer for the past 5 years. I use to love my job for years until one day the company knocked from a fulltime position to part time.It has been a real struggle for me and my family,Especially with me being a single parent.It has disrupted our lives tremendously.I am willing to relocate to have a fresh start."
bad,its not fun and they fire the people that accually does thier jobs and shows up on time so you have to watch your back
bad,"I liked meeting people while I worked there and all of the new skills that I learned. I did not like management lying to me. I did meet some great co-workers and liked the interaction with the public most of the time. They do not have a good training program, they just throw you in and expect you to learn it."
bad,I loved the benifits of working at walmart but the work policy is very bad. you can work your hardest and one little mistake and your let go
bad,"You walk into work and clock in. Wait patiently near the key box for management to give you the keys for a CSM. You walk to the front of the store, however on the way you will be asked where an obscure item is located by a customer. You find the item by actually looking for it because you work on the front end and do not know where magnetic poster borders are located. When you get to the front end you will be approached by a manager who will inquire as to why the lines are so long. Telling them of your recent arrival on the scene won't help so you just say that you will fix it. Pull associates from other areas to check. They take a minimum of five minutes to arrive at a register despite the short distance. You will receive a call from management asking why you are using associates on registers when there is no line. You send those associates back to their departments. Prepare for angry customers to ask you ""why walmart has all of these registers and no cashiers"" which happens daily, and you tend to ask yourself the same question. Be ready to send four breaks per hour despite only having six cashiers, and be further ready for cashiers to take double their allotted break time to return to their register. Be prepared for customers to be attempting to return stolen merchandise at the service desk constantly, and also be ready to approve such returns as long as they provide a valid drivers license. Beyond all be ready to tip-toe around what you say to people despite their blatant disregard for walmart employees because they do not believe that checkouts should have lines."
bad,"Granted you always had fun at work and always had fun coworkers, there were some issues in management when I worked there that made life difficult. For instance, plastic shopping bags were almost never ordered on time, as a cashier this made shifts very difficult as you often had to give customers large objects to carry from the store loose. This was inefficient and embarrassing at times."
bad,had a meeting in the beginning.Unloaded trailers as they came in.
bad,"Well a typical day was to maintain my department. take care of all freight, get the guys in were they need to be.My co-workers i just loved, we worked just well together., some of the people I've ever been incontacted with. The hardest part was some coustmers would come in and try you, and you have to bite your tounge, but it was ok.. just keep it moving.. Everything, the people, and my job..."
bad,"I would come in and zone shelves, order merchandise, stock the department, and assist customers."
bad,"Daily Workload was usually busy. Somedays were very busy, depending on how much research may be"
bad,The first few years I worked there I loved it until new management everything changed and they became very impossible almost to work with.
bad,I enjoyed working at Wally World!! This company was where I gained my first work experience. I would definetely apply there again if I wanted to remain in retail.
bad,Enjoyed working for Wal-Mart because I got to learn new things but how they handle somethings were very distasteful.
bad,"At first the job was pretty nice, the work was very cold and busy but enjoyable and hard work was appropriately recognized and rewarded. My coworkers were nice to me but no so much to each other. There was a little drama to be had within our department but not so much as to affect our work. After the holiday season a simple chance in assistant managers brought everything to a 180. Our hard work was met with baseless criticism and impossible demands. The management refused to see reason or logic and were content with barking orders regardless of our situation. To make matters worse, managers would often fight with one another, using us as the weapons and putting us in situations where we would be working on a project under one manager's orders only to get barked at by another for not doing what they wanted. What could have been a good job I would have been contented to stay in turned into a stressful daily nightmare."
bad,"Did not care for this job. Nobody I worked for was personable, the managers didn't help out, and hours were bad because I was still in school."
bad,On a typical day I stock merchandise. The hardest part of the job is stocking the merchandise in the time frame you're given. The most enjoyable part of the job was I got an hour lunch break when I worked overnights.
bad,I was the Manager of the Electronics Department and then promoted to Market Analyst or Marketing Manager in charge of ordering stock and returns. If you worked a minute over the 40 hours they made you leave early or come back from lunch early.
bad,"I worked for a distribution center, and at the one I was at they didnt seem to care much for the associates concerns or conditions. They only care about the numbers and how to get them higher no matter how it affects the bottom hourly worker. Before I separated from wal mart the quarterly bonus incentive was gone. Also management shows a great deal of nepotism to some. And 80% of the time you couldn't get anyone to relieve you of your work for breaks and even lunches. Your work load would be pushed onto someone else, who already had a full work load."
bad,"Como deve ser um profissional de qualidade.Nota 10,bem elevada,de nivel que mostra um gradeza enoreme,por está emopresa é totalmentea segunda mais concorrida por redes de hipermercados."
bad,"Typical day required searching for potential thieves by watching the surveillance cameras or on foot in the store (undercover). We also locked up merchandise on the floor and high priced merchandise that came in daily. We also were in charge of safety issues in the store (inspecting fire doors, fire extinguishers and clear aisles). My co workers were always very helpful and we assisted each other during investigations. The most enjoyable part was working as a team and helping out my co workers with apprehensions. My management was horrible. I felt uncomfortable to speak to them about issues. They had horrible communication skills. That was the hardest part at there."
bad,The deli is busy and very monitored. People are slow to remember everthing needed but the constant training helps. Closing when customers still want something is hard to say no when your cleaning. People are funto get to know there likes and dislikes.
bad,To many people want to lead and not be team players and work with each other to get the job done. Also there are too much favoritism. Other than that great company to work for with great benefits.
bad,"Not many people are cut out to deal with liability claims. You deal with the scum of the Earth. Terrible people looking to make a buck of Wal-Mart. Management was helpful and nice, however I can recall a few coworkers who got way behind on their claims and we would be expected to help get them caught up. That only works for so long when you get paid the same. And the pay should probably be higher for such a stressful job."
bad,"i love working with different people and helping out the customers. overall, walmart is a great place to work."
bad,I always felt as thought there were never enough cashiers working so the line ups were always very long and customers would get very agitated. The main upside to working at Walmart was that i loved most of the people I worked with. I felt as thought i had worked with a family more than just co-workers. I gained a lot of great friends working there and will never forget most of them.
bad,Didn't like how the management didn't care about the employees and I always got picked on by the jewelry manager non stop.
bad,"Although the environment and benefits were very good. The management, need a little employee skill. The Power trip is off the roof. They will remind you is boss every day."
bad,I like the fact that its a safe place to work at but I do not like the enviornment. I don't like how the schedule up and down. Other then that they have nice friendly people and the management team could be better.
bad,"The company management need to focused on it employees values by working with them on the hours, Learning how to schedules more cashiers through out the day by not having 4 or 5 registers open. The company need to focus on customer services and have the training classes for new employees are entering the company. Management need to learn how to showing respect to good hard working associates, No more showing favortism, and stop working associates as slaves and for those who transfer store to store should able to keep their full-time position and not able go part-time."
bad,"I was trying to raise my daughter, go to school, and work but Wal-Mart made it impossible because they couldn't get my schedule right for 3 months."
bad,"As a cashier, CSM’s (Customer Service Managers) we’re always helpful, and willing to do anything to make a transition move quicker. There were times that I didn’t get breaks, because they were to busy talking amongst each other or simply no where to be found. The Front end manager, always took a long time to do the things he said he would do, and I always had to consistently remind him what I needed. Also, the manager would randomly change my schedule... like the night before my shift or a couple hours before. Honestly, the management could use a little work up front."
bad,"I enjoyed the job at times but it was a typical retail job. Unrewarding pay, poor management, no benefits, poor scheduling, and staffing issues. No room for professional growth."
bad,Getting an answer to any question is next to impossible because everyone of your direct reports have no idea what your job entails.  They constantly have to be reminded what is legal and what is not.
bad,"everyone I worked with is no longer there. So I can't speak of management. But from recent experiences as a customer, it seems like the store is going in the right direction. Increased pay, better benefits/incentives, better hours, and more flexibility for associates. It seems like they are listening to the associates finally"
bad,"It really just depends on which store you work in. The environment is stressful and always changing. They do have benefits, but they are slowly changing also."
bad,"While walmart is a great place to shop for things, its not always a pleasant place to work. The managers really push their employees hard, for example, an entire pallet full of chemicals such as laundry detergent, cleaning supplies, etc, oftentimes these pallets are tall, im 6 foot 3, and these pallets are almost as tall as me and managers expect that pallet to be cleared in 25 mins, which is pretty much unrealistic and would take usain bolt to do but not the rest of us non-fast human beings, and they really dont care if the employees are unhappy or in pain, one manager told me to ""man up"" when my lower back was cramping. Another told me to quit going to the bathroom to blow my nose because of allergies. They care about the customers while us associates are having a difficult time. i feel like they could offer a better pay for how theyre treating the employees. also, the HR coordinator, basically lied to me at orientation, i had applied for full time, after 3 months of working and being told i would be eligible for health insurance, so when i tried to, i wasnt eligible, i have to wait one year to get insurance, and i am in need of contact lenses and i cant see very well without new contacts, which interfered with my ability to do my job. The job on its own helps pays the bills but they really dont treat anyone good enough."
bad,It’s a job that pays the bills and allows me to have somewhat time with family  wish they would have more family events company picnics outside of the building  I mean the company is making billions of dollars  could appreciate the employees
bad,"This job was very repetitive and time went by slow. After you get a hang of things the work becomes mindless. The work environment was a test of patience especially since they played the same 2 songs for 10 hours a day, three weeks straight."
bad,"Its all nice when you first start."
bad,"Very picky managers, no one’s got your back so worry about yourself, be safe, benefits are good but compensation is only ok, too strict, held accountable if day is missed, cant take sick days off unless you use your accumulated vacation hours, fear of losing your job because you cant take a day off is real, people want to know your business, a lot of gossiping going on"
bad,"Walmart is an extremely demanding job. If you are the type of person who likes the thrill of an engaging challenge and you believe in overcoming great adversity, then this is the job for you. I acquired many skills from working at Walmart, notoriously how to handle stress. Though I'll never regret working for the company, I wouldn't recommend this company to the faint of heart."
bad,Management is in constant flux.  Difficult work environment. Hours and days are constantly changing - you are to be available from 5:00am -11:00pm Monday- Sunday for varying shifts.
bad,Cooperate expects more out of what is available. Holidays are basically cologofied shopping days. They also do not pay holiday pay. The customers will range from nice to ridiculous.
bad,Walmart is ok but it’s a big company so they really don’t have time to talk to employees so it makes it kinda hard to work in there business but it was fun
bad,"Always busy ,learn how to communicate, management was not very good, hardest part of the job was working as a team,most enjoyable was being around new people and helping."
bad,Will not give full time easily not bad job for beginners ok hours would never want to work there again says there’s advancing available but only if your there a minimum of three years probably
bad,"Regular work days, super busy weekends "
bad,Managers are not always there when needed and it upsets and frustrates customers because they have to wait for long periods of time. Taking leave is stressful and difficult and extremely unorganized.
bad,"For a retail enterprise based in Florida, it pays above what most employers do.  Florida has a very low minimum wage and most jobs in this state won't pay you much above minimum.  Walmart starts at $11.00 an hour - still not enough to live on in Florida but well above the minimum of $8.56."
bad,"It was a great job while I was working there. Flexible hours. They made the job great. The customers made the day even better. But the problem with managers is, I was in the hospital for 7 days and had a hospital note. My husband also worked for the company. They fired us both because we missed the 7 days, even with hospital note. They said doctors notes don’t matter to them. I should have came in anyways and my husband should have came in anyways."
bad,"Walmart wasn’t the best of places to work, the asset protection team was great but other then that the managers really never made sure you were treated fairly."
bad,"If you want routine, boring, and mind numbing work then Walmart is perfect. It was one of the most numbing places I have ever worked at and other then a good start job I wouldn't recommend it."
bad,"Walmart was not the worst job, but it's not far from it. Bare minimum pay and unreachable expectations. Many employees feel trapped as if there is no other option. Management has been more disconnected with the staff. No benefits unless you work 40+ hours, so they only schedule you 36 hours. It's not really a mystery why Walmart has a high turnover rate."
bad,"Not too many customers or managers bugging you on the overnight shift, they work with you to find an appropriate stocking area, moderate pressure, slightly higher pay than day workers."
bad,Pay was ok but they dont care about their employees. As long as you do what they feel needs to be done your ok but if your trying to do best by the customer forget you are always wrong in their eyes.
bad,"They change policy by the day."
bad,Managers are always highly critical of the workers who actually work and the opposite to those who don't...never have enough staff to get through a night. Managers running around everywhere given you different tasks from what your supervisor originally told you to do.
bad,"Fair pay, fair hours.  Leaders/ Coach'ss are hired based solely off of college degree instead of leadership capabilities and experience. Specific example was a ""coach"" was late multiple times her first month in our department with no repercussions.  Certain Team members/ T-3s (trainers) filled in for her with no consideration for advancement to a coach job."
bad,Walmart is a good job when you first start off but as you get more and more experience they try to throw ever different places then when new people hire in the expect you to train them the when you the most experience on the team the try to take advantage of your
bad,Breaks were never at reasonable times. Managers weren't helpful to employees. Time off requests were never considered during the time frame of the new schedules.
bad,"The job itself is good the medical insurance is expensive and does not pay for anything, Raises are few and far between. You ask for help from someone but you never get it. You are pretty much on your own even for serious problems."
bad,"I didn't hate working for them but management wasn't that great. I wasn't there very long due to being ill and hospitalized, I was still new so my absences weren't approved even with hospital paper work so I left to avoid being terminated."
bad,I loved working in sporting goods and I loved what I did there. Unfortunately for me Walmart does not love their employees. I was treated as if my life and bills did not matter! the final straw for me was when I checked the new schedule a had 0 hours at all. I had to leave.
bad,"Management does not pass information on. As an employee, you can expect to have your concerns taken care of only after telling every single manager in the store repeatedly and then district manager repeatedly. It's best to figure out a solution on your own."
bad,Walmart is not the greatest workplace in the world but neither is it worst. Having too many managers would probably have to be one the cons here other than that the work itself is not difficult and the pay is decent.
bad,in my experience you are really just a number to walmart who can replace you at anytime if you dont work hard enough. Customers also do not appreciate you're help and even if one employee tells them something about an item and they get mad at you for it them it's becomes your mess to fix from the ignorance of another coworker.
bad,Too many changes going on.. No information with what is going on with jobs. No communication between management  to associates. Overall just not a happy place to work.
bad,Didn’t like the job it was too many hours and I didn’t like the staff it was a good customer service experience but not for me. I liked the environment but it was too fast paced
bad,Great place to make friends and easy place to work. Management needs help though. Management would not give me part-time when I was beginning school in the fall.
bad,"Not only was my manager extremely sexist and rude and manipulative, they worked me like a dog and under paid me greatly. The customers are horrible and the manager staff has no interest in making the working experience pleasant. I couldn't get my last two weeks done quick enough"
bad,"Get out of school, get home, then start walking to work. Get to work, clock in, then go to a supervisor to get placed at a register. Sign in and start handling customer products. Scan each and very item. Handle customer transactions, provide excellent customer service."
bad,To me it's not exactly what you would expect from walmart. You'll find yourself going through things that just shouldn't be in a work environment. But overall it's a comfortable place to work besides petty drama you could easily be a part of without knowing.
bad,Working at walmart I've learned and now familiar with stocking... Unloading the truck is the easy part. The culture of the place is off balance though.
bad,A great job but doesn't pay enough for the work that you have to do everyday. You get bonus but it not worth it. You have protected pto and you get looked down on when you use it.
bad,"Te capacitan a realizar varias actividades es lo que mas me gusto aparte de que cuentan con diferentes actividades durante el año, un día de trabajo no es ni difícil ni fácil yo diría que lo normal, gerencia son buena gente claro se hablamos del cedía que se encuentra en cuautitlan"
bad,Ok company works with you to a limited apoint. Compqny became very laid back on new hires will pushing harder the ones that have been there awhile. Ok starting job
bad,The overall mental stress working there is difficult. The expectations and workload is constantly being raised to an unmanageable level and upper management doesn’t appreciate a job well done even if the task is complete.
bad,"I had some problems, they were not respectful of their workers. I really enjoyed the work I did and the people I associated with each day but the way I was treated from the staff was not healthy."
bad,"The workers were very mean and self-centered. They liked to blame everyone for everything very childish and immature also they pretend to be your friend no matter what you do NEVER tell your business, no one is cool there. Except John."
bad,"Can be bumpy most of the time. Employee turn over ratio is really high."
bad,"Great Job, just left alone a lot. The Toy department at the store that I woeked in I was forced to work enough for 3 people by myself. great job when you have help."
bad,"I would not recommend Wal-Mart for anyone that gets sick a lot, has kids, or has a busy life outside of work. They only allow 4 days of being sick in a year before getting fired. The only school programs they help you to advance in is business or business related programs."
bad,"Management is unreliable. Trained for deli and got my food handlers license, did all of the online training courses to be put in a completely different section of the store without the proper training I needed."
bad,Your basic entry level job with not to bad pay. no real benefits. bad hours. quality of job depends on management in charge. They dont work with you very well.
bad,i like staying busy in a fun workplace give respect to others ask question that im not sure of i like learned from others give my all while im there .
bad,"All the cashiers i worked with were pretty great to work with... it was an awesome atmosphere to be in,  most of the time... they dont have your back when it come to not being about to be there because your child is at home sick"
bad,A decent place to have a job during college in the little town I was located in.  It gave me the opportunity to earn extra money and taught me valuable skills that I was able to carry over to other jobs.
bad,"The workplace was not fun nor safe, the employees that did work at the end i was they were always rude and none considering for the stock team, everyone is for them self here."
bad,"In the Linden Walmart, most of the store only communicates when it comes to gossip. The managers are no exemption. I wonder how the new store will run. As a cashier you'll never truly feel appreciated. Managers (mostly CSMs) take the customer's words or their side in pricing issues or complaints. That takes a toll on the person after a while. Nothing is ever organized, communication is key. If the company as well as the management starting from the very top learned to do so effectively, things would change for the better. The new store manager is a rude individual. He rarely greets employees or acts professionally. While the new building is set to open on November 13th, communication and proper management must be the top priority, not just sales. Listening to the ""little people"" like cashiers is key to sales, overall. Customer's tend to get over way too much. I pray things get better next month! Lastly, the company is fraudulent with the pitiful 10% ""discount"" they give you after about 90 days. You don't realize at first but they tax you and say it's earned income when you use it and it only covers certain things. They have to do better!"
bad,The walmart I was employed at was a hard place to work for. Thick skin required! Can never have personal/devastating issues come between you and your shift. No leeway what so ever.  Caring about employees is not their strong suit.
bad,My workplace I would say was fairly okay but cleaning was very nasty. I just didn’t wanna scrubb toilets all shift and Walmart gets really Boring at times too
bad,It's not a place I reccomend but it could be worse. It had it's good days and it has alot of bad days. If you just need a job it will work but if you can find someplace better I would reccomend that.
bad,when i walk in i would clock in put my belongings away and go grab a til ( cash draw) i would open my register at customer service. I would help customers with any and all returns and exchanges or any complaints. i would than put all returns away in the correct department.
bad,So in the beginning it was great I enjoyed everyone I worked the job and all. Then at some point when one of the assistant managers was telling I had a chance to move up the ladder and get a managers spot to hustle more I began to see that it was to just get me to do more and not get it.
bad,"Management was poor and all around attitudes and moral were low. Employees were expected to do twice the work in half the time, and to never call in or be sick for any reason."
bad,"There isn't much to this job. You kind of know what to expect. It's customer service, you check people out, handle card readers, cash tenders, etc. It's a good job if you're in school and need cash for the weekend"
bad,I didnt mind working at Wal-Mart.. The department I was in had way to much drama. They wrote me up for something another employee started and was extremely rude about it.
bad,"I loved having 4 days off every week! Unless you're weekdays it's 3 days off, either way it was nice. Pay is also very high considering you don't even need HS Diploma, starting at least $16 wk day & $19 wk end. Overtime available almost all year around."
bad,"Store is disorganized all the time, no one ever knows what’s going on, managers don’t know how to use their people effectively, always drama caused by an associate, managers don’t seem to care about anyone . A lot of employees are leaving the store due to the stressful environment and lack of respect . I am also looking for a new career myself ."
bad,"So personally I have been working for Walmart for 9 months now. And I will say it doesn't matter what Walmart u go to, most management is going to suck. Now the one I'm currently working for has more managers in it that are good than bad but I still met a good handful who really aren't kind to me or other workers and even to customers. Hours are good. Pay is good. But what makes this job suck so much is the lack of communication."
bad,A typical day at walmart is Stressful. I learned how do Freight really quickly. The Management is good. The hardest part is that trying to do something that u dont like doing. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my friends. The workplace culture Sucks.
bad,Hard-working outgoing can multitask I'm looking for an opportunity to grow and expand my skills honest can multitask have office to skills and management skills as well as payroll skills in medical office as well and reception 7 years administrative assistants as well great people skills inability to communicate with others in a professional kind manner
bad,The manager was nice but the Walmart brand is not helping make jobs for Canada only cutting hours and not able to help paying people. I would never work here again.
bad,Many parents need every other weekend and Walmart does not accomodate with scheduling. attendance policy goes on a point system It is otherwise a great work work place
bad,"Spanaway Walmart is an ok place to work. It is very fast paced but retail can be very stressful. Sometimes the environment we experience in Spanaway, can be very dangerous. I do enjoy most of our daily customer's as most people in this world are good. Walmart eliminated most of their office positions to centralize everything in Arkansas. They offered me a severance package or another position. I decided to stay as a Customer Service Manager, but staying in the Accounting Office doing the same thing I had been doing. The new Title/Position offered me more money and I was happy to help my new Management Team learn the office they knew nothing about. I cared about my office and did not want to see it crumble. Customer Service Manager is a much more fast paced and stressful position. We are responsible for running the entire front end of the store. I enjoyed my responsibility of training new management team members and new associates to work in the accounting office. I am ready for a change and new opportunities to grow as an individual"
bad,"I liked my coworkers at Walmart and my manager, but the pay, rules, and environment was not pleasant. They promise all these benefits, but never give them to you. They FIRE you if you hit overtime. No warning, no second chances."
bad,"As a cashier, it can be very fast past especially on weekends. Employees have to run everything (such as breaks, lunch, canceling a transaction) through CSM's. You hardly get to go on breaks and lunch on time and will have to ask managers to go on breaks. If I didn't need the money so badly, I would've left a long time ago. Management will not work with your schedule unless you are a part timer. You will get benefits for both full and part time.HR will hire anyone and everyone You can advance quickly if you do your job. The easiest part of cashiering is ringing up items but the hardest part is that the register is so old that you don't have full access of what you are ringing up. Walmart needs to update their registers. CSM's need to learn about time management. Management need to cross train everyone in all areas.  Finally, there's not enough employees (or cashiers anyways) working at this location. Sometimes, there will be 2 or 3 cashiers when there are 10 registers."
bad,"You work five days a week, but only work five hour days. Only paid minimum wage. You have to work twenty-four hours minimum to be liable to be under their insurance."
bad,"never going back. my least favorite job ever, would not go back if they begged me. some management can suck a big toe. we were under staffed and i have"
bad,"A Typical Day Working For Walmart Distribution Center Was Very Fast Paced , Terrible Work Conditions , Open Dock Performance Based Job , Rat Infested Warehouse. Very Hot In The Summer And Freezing In The Winter"
bad,The people you work with personally are awesome . The management is very awful and they do not pay us enough or give anyone enough credit for accomplishments that we make !
bad,Deli worker cleaning catering making sure everyone is happy being the best I could be as a worker I cleaned I cut meat on a machine  stocking packing  every day was a good day I put my all in into everything I had to do so that my job would malee.happy at the.end of the day
bad,not much to say about it honestly. It pays pretty well I guess that all I have to say so yeah that is a ll the review is making me do 150 words bye now
bad,They don’t know how to run a store at all. My current store managers are not good. There is no communication whatsoever. They seem to play favorites and the shifts are not treated as one team.
bad,"Stocking meat shelves, communicating with costumers, helping costumers, keeping up beat, and out going, reliable, responsible, training employees, working freight, also working as a cashier, helping with inventory, stocking grocery shelves, weighing and dating meats, stocking freezer, team work, and being professional ..."
bad,I don't recommend working at walmart for anyone unless you looking for a starter job where you gonna be used and overwork understaff all day because management denies hiring new employees.
bad,"I enjoyed my dept, it was my home there. I enjoyed interacting with the customers of which we had many repeat, with no recognition from management. Which seemed to only think of themselves."
bad,Management does everything to make sure you do not get 40 hours so they do not have to pay you benefits . I would not recommend this place to anyone ever.
bad,Coworkers not held accountable and just walked around. barely worked and just collected a check. they did not earn it and always blamed others for why tasks were not done.
bad,"the staff is semi unprofessional, the workplace is a great environment. a typical day at work is easygoing and simple, management is strict but firm and fair."
bad,Poor management. Lack of communication. Basically too many chiefs not enough associates. Want one associate doing the task of 3. Including doing dept management work.
bad,"Retail associate charged with the handling of store merchandise and quality inspection."
bad,"Working in frozen/dairy is one the hardest positions there. The time it takes to down stack products was understood but never taken into consideration. I worked alone more often than not and their expectations were way too high. Plus, the support manager constantly micromanaged constantly. This is the first Walmart I’ve worked at and I do not recommend this store for employment. However, I will give other Walmart stores throughout the country the benefit of the doubt because, not all Walmart stores are ran the same way based on management and following the ideology written years ago by the founder of the company.."
bad,"As a employee Walmart doesn't take care of their workers and they really care. At the workplace it's lots of favoritism and family ties. They refuse to move the their best workers,but always move up the ones with lack of productivity. The management works against whether than with the associates. I'm a firm believer that this will never change and only get worst. I've brrn"
bad,Too stressful!! Awful Management!!! Store manager doesn't know what she's doing and Management taking test for associate making them department managers.. Alot of racism going on 🖕
bad,Walmart c’est une compagnie internationale mais elle traite ses employés comme des esclavages cause on doit travailler de lundi à dimanche et à des heures pas possible.
bad,I enjoyed all the training and career opportunities.I had the opportunity of working with a great time . Every job has its ups and downs .My only downside was i needed to make more money and I was given a better opportunity.
bad,The job wasn't worth the pay and the customers were extremely rude and loud. Co-workers were not helpful and management was a disaster they were always all over the place
bad,its a decent place to work some people were rude but you'll have that. the manager was excellent.the next shift people were really rude. the hours were alright.
bad,It's not easy not easy not a lot of team work too many returns too many customers stealing every night customers sometimes are difficult if we don't have merchandise needed lunches are too long with all the freight needed to put out not a lot of support from managers.
bad,Unload trucks properly place on the pallet in orderly fashion while conducting great customer service also place in its aisles in correct area including operating pallet jacks
bad,"Unhappy with management, not good with employee advancement. I enjoyed working with customers and other associates. Management should have better incentives for advancement."
bad,"Walmart was a fun place to work as long as you were not being annoyed by the management, and it is very common for management to be annoying employee's. The management isn't supposed to work, so it seems as if their job is to make the employee's work as hard as possible, and I think that is O.K., but they expect the impossible and are very stressful. This may not be true for all Walmarts, but it was for the one I worked at. It was nice to make new friends and to help the customers and fellow employee's."
bad,"Horrible company to work for "
bad,"Lamentablemente a pesar de que walmart tiene una política de diversidad e inclusión. Los líderes no la respetan. Ya que en mi caso particularmente. Me dieron de baja argumentando que en la auditoría no me había rasurado, a pesar de que yo no tocaba el producto."
bad,Walmart is not  for  me some stay most  leave they watch everyone like a police officer and is not fair makes me not wanting to be  apart of there team
bad,"At the store I work at, management has their moments. They can be very helpful, or not care about you at all. The store manager is pleasant, approachable, and willing to work with you."
bad,clock in check for carry-outs then go outside and push the carts for 2 hours the take a 15 minute break the work for another 2 hours take an hour lunch then work for another 2 hours then take one last 15 minute break then work until time to clock out
bad,An experience worth trying not where I would look to advance quickly as you will burn yourself out. Spending at least one year in every position before moving up is highly suggested.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone work at Walmart, too much favortism, gossiping. Allow customers to return item's that were damaged by customer, used by customer, or stolen, allowed too much shady thing's happen."
bad,"I enjoy working however, Walmart is very fast and you don’t revive  adequate training and are thrown straight into the flow of things. I am a quick learner however even if you can catch on quickly you will be thrown under the bus."
bad,"Not organized, bad management, never work the times with your availability "
bad,The warehouse is horrible. I did not enjoy working there but I will say the pay is awesome as long as you’re getting hours. Keep to yourself. Go there to make your money and that’s it.
bad,"Not a nice place to work at, not only do you have to do your job you have to do everyone else’s. And not get paid for it. Terrible management terrible pay. All around awful."
bad,"working there is very fun .I enjoy helping the costomer .I like what I m doing there,because I learn a lot by helping the costomer .I m very exited with them."
bad,"Working for Walmart is a bit difficult because some of the management don't understand what it's like to work in the departments, or don't work with their coworkers very well."
bad,"working in the warehouse is fine,just that it's not organized at the least. day could go by really quick when working and not worrying all the time. money is great but it needs a plan to come with it"
bad,"Working there was okay, they didn’t work very well with my schedule and they weren’t very nice all together. If you do one thing wrong everyone pretty much doesn’t like you"
bad,"I live in a small town where Walmart is one of the only places you can easily get a job. I worked there for a year until I found something better. The pay was just above minimum wage, which it is hard to raise a family on."
bad,Maintain a clean safe work environment help the customer if needed and make sure all  adjectives are met by the end of your shift  maintain to stay on time And keep a positive attitude
bad,"Ganhei muita experiência onde eu trabalhei!! Trabalhava como caixa mais fui pra padaria, frambreria e corredores!"
bad,At first it wasn't bad but after awhile you started to see all the drama and chaos. Every manager told you a different way to do something so it was very confusing. The employees in the bakery/deli were always fighting.
bad,started off at $11.50/hr which i didn’t mind since it is such an easy job however was expected to do a lot of work and ended up doing way more than my coworkers who i later found out got paid more (which is fine but one person and i started on the same day and they got paid a dollar more and didn’t do ANYTHING) easy money however its biweekly pay so i would run out of my paycheck at the end of the second week very secure hours and went around my schedule management was very nice store manager was ehh
bad,Walmart is Walmart it is always busy day and night. Everyone comes to Walmart regular retail work. Hours are not bad. Very busy during holidays. Pay could be better
bad,"If you're OK with working at night, this is a great job for you. If not, don't take it. I did not feel a great amount of good regard for employees from management- sometimes it felt like it was us vs. them. "
bad,"Friendly place to work"
bad,"Not the best place to have a ""carrier"" but it’s kinda good start, you’ll have enough hours but probably not enough respect for you doing but hey, a job is a job🤷🏽‍♂️"
bad,"they wasn't fair to females over 21. under that age you got wat you wanted , occurrences disappeared ,if they got to flirt .they did have some fair managers but they usually didn't come to deli much depends who was working they would choose who got to go sign the logs and inspections , but if store boss was mad she would take it out on the employee ."
bad,Management will often write you up if they don't like you. And usually being the hardest worker means getting in trouble for other coworkers lacking in your department.
bad,"Typical day at wal-mart is checking customers out ,dealing with customers and customer service issues. Zoning my area and whatever else i am asked to do"
bad,"Empresa de muita rotatividade, funcionários insatisfeitos..."
bad,"La mejor empresa para aprender, buen ambiente de trabajo."
bad,the management is very rude to everyone and expect unreasonable amounts of work to be completed. no set plan in place for who works where. co workers help train more than the management does
bad,"Honestly, working as a cashier is about as fun as you would think. Constantly scanning items from people with huge carts and dealing with the occasional rude customer. Not that fun, but is pretty chill all things considered."
bad,"Upper management was hard to get a hold of when needed for complaints/problems. No matter how hard of a worker you are everone would receive same 2% raise, including your coworkers who would just show up and did as little as possible."
bad,"I worked Cap 2 which is where you receive and stock the midday truck. It is very easy to learn but hard work and you stand/walk for 8 hours straight while unloading boxes or stocking merchandise. There was a lot of personal drama there and people not showing up for work so you're short handed and still expected to do the same amount of work with less people."
bad,I'm not even sure I can muster the 150 character minimum without this filler. I felt underappreciated and overworked with not much pay or respect. More filler.
bad,What I’ve learned from working at Walmart is that looks are definitely deceiving. Being an overnight stocker you see a lot of missing handling of things.
bad,not bad benefits and holiday pay but they have stupid high expectations and make employees feel useless when they don't reach these unrealistic goals.
bad,"go to work, look at your assignment and don't get help or changes when your doing more than you should be able to."
bad,"so much drama during the truck.. too much people lacking. arguing, everything that we won't get the truck done. please don't work on the truck it gonna many drams and lacking"
bad,Decent pay but the hours are inconsistent. There is new person who was hired to be csm but does not know how to speak to employees she is very disrespectful.  The discount isn't on everything only certain items in the store. They also hire from outside instead of within to fill positions in management.
bad,"Walmart is not family friendly,. They don't care if you have kids or not, sick, or other life happens problems. You miss days whether you have proof or not, they simply don't care. Also they want you to work at a super fast pace."
bad,Long hard hours and not enough staff...would be a great place if there was more staff to make the production line steady and running smoothly. The pay sould be better for the amount of work you do.
bad,I really enjoyed working at Walmart. I was good at my job. I was Ill and had to give up my job. I have reapplied on line since I have relocated to Monroe.
bad,Walmart was a great place to work until changes made the work life balance more difficult in leadership roles.  The inconsistent schedule made it difficult to focus on family as well as work.
bad,its an ok place to work if you are single and don't have a family that you need to take care of. they say they are for you but they truly are not with getting rid of jobs. not fair to the long term workers
bad,The company is very good but its depend on the managent. In some stores like bhopal1 and bhopal 2 the management have good behave for the worker but some atores are completley defferent.
bad,There are managers that make it worth it are great but there's not many of them there are quite a few of them that are disrespectful and just don't care not to mention they will expect you to stay after and help but then kill your over time they play favoritism and they expect you to finish a whole department by yourself and be dont by lunch which is half way through your shift
bad,"Management was poor and rude,never trained me an expected a faster pace.Sensed a little rasisim,on management,kept me doing the same job whermost of the heavy ’lifting was located._never switched me in another department like everyone else.But daughter was in car accident wrecked my transportation ._other wise just stuck it out"
bad,The hours I worked varied from days to evenings some of both. Sometimes worked a few hours a day and sometimes 7 hours a day.  Didn't like the inconsistency. The pay is not that good either. I worked for 8.25 an hour.
bad,"Easy money and fgiid training. Their you will"
bad,"Maintaining and fulfilling budget, meeting the goals and seeing the associates reap the rewards of a bonus every quarter, being involved with the community and events"
bad,Walmart is a good place to work but it has certain people in certain positions that don't take care of what should be for their associates. They are quick to fire you with no warning and they want you to do certain task without the right tools.
bad,I like Walmart when I started to over the years Walmart has changed and not for the better Sam had a good idea but is dead he thought you company get better if your employees were happyi and would work hard for you but that is gone n
bad,Coworkers where I worked were amazing always willing to help and great attitude. Management not so much. the management could be rude and sometimes so could other departments.
bad,"Manangement and human resources prejudice!"
bad,Shifts were long. Poor staffing. Trying to work solo for a whole department. No access to the proper tools for the job. Poor training.No empathy for their employees.
bad,"Help customers, stock freight, scan merchandise, get told 20 things to do within 20min by 4 different managers, and get yelled at by each for doing what the previous manager told you to do."
bad,It’s a fun and stressful place to work at. Well it depends on the coworkers and management. Sometimes a person can move up in the company but some others like where they are or other just leave the company as myself. If you ain’t a family person then the job is for you other than that my honest opinion stay away.
bad,This company will work you to death with no thank yous or appreciation for the sacrifices you make. Would not recommend working here money is great but you pay a price
bad,Loved the people I worked with for the most part but sometimes on really busy days the management wasn’t the greatest when needed.  Hours can be long.
bad,horrible place to work mgrs dont treat u right the associates run the store. everybody has a attitude. no team work certain people get away with telling mangers what they wont and will do.
bad,Worked for this company for over 13 years at first it was nice. Then things really changed. All they actually care about is numbers not their associates .
bad,Its a job. It pays ok. Just not enough to live off of. management was great. other staff was terrible. nothing provided for workers who worked in the freezers.
bad,Worked the over night shift easy money if ypu dont like sleeping at night quiet fast passed didnt have to deal with customers great job for young adults
bad,"As a cashier, the job wasn't terrible for a couple months or so. But after a while, customers become the hurdle that you just can't jump. Most of them treat you terribly because they can, none of them care enough to appreciate how fast or how hard you work, so there was not much incentive to stay with average hourly pay. The managers also never seemed to notice when you put in the extra effort or stayed late to help close down."
bad,"There are too many mangers telling you to do different things at the same time while they stand around doing nothing. "
bad,"They cut my position after working there for 9 years and told me I had to take another I had no interest in or take a pay cut or I could leave, plus the store's management was terrible. Store Manager has left recently I think but the company is making many changes and not to benefit it's employees."
bad,U hafta work like a robot non stop and make a production rate thats insane. I worked nonstop and still couldnt make production. The other employees rarely helped and the supervisors just sit at their desks
bad,"Overall it was harder work than worth the pay. I felt I was constantly being micromanaged despite the managers having a “Do as I say, not as I do” style in their own work. I was expected to do ten things at once and was chastised for things far beyond my control. Closing was grueling due to the openers shirking their responsibilities for the night shift to take care of, and in the two months I worked there management never rectified the situation even when proof was given or taken to even higher management."
bad,I was fired due to irresponsible management messing up my schedule on accident and then when i went to corporate about the loss of my job they were told to hire me back but only had a cashier position. I worked Walmart for 4yrs to get to the position i was at with the hours i liked. I wasn't going to start all over again not at the Jupiter store. They are extremely unorganized and horrible management with mostly lazy associates with no customer service skills or the want to have the skills. I was a do all kind of associate i could work any position. There were many issues i faced at this store not just messed up scheduling. I recommend walmart as a company to work for just not this location!
bad,Walmart was a very poor place to work. They did not treat their employees with respect. The managers expected too much out of their employees but wanted us to remain happy while stressing us about our job.
bad,The work experience that I got was great. The new direction in which the company is going in is not for the better of it's employees. The moral of the company seems to really be going down hill.
bad,Working at Wal-mart Management was very poor and did not any help what-so-ever. They only think of themselves and put more money in their pockets. The only part worth getting up and going to work for is how badly your co-workers need the help.
bad,When I first started working for Walmart it was great. Then everything started changing and the managers stopped caring about their employees. Some assistant managers didn’t get along with the head manager and the head manager didn’t get along with some of the assistant managers.
bad,Walmart is a wonderful place to work for I have top skills for the deli position and bakery cross training I have helped management to the best of my ability when they had to leave and wasn’t able to do things they are a good company to work for but there are some Things that could be better
bad,The managers are snooty and most of them are not helpful in helping employees to exceed. They are lazy and hide from us most of the time. the management expects too much from their employees without giving us the proper amount of help and cooperation we need to suceed at our job.
bad,Management has lost touch with reality. Not focused on customers or employees. They have gotten away from the basic needs to take care of our customers. Customers are forts and sales cures all! Get back to serving the customers!
bad,If you're looking for a job too just pay bill and nothing more then this is that job. The hours are inconsistent with weeks of any where to just ten hours to just under forty with no reason. Moral is nonexistent in the the store with managers hideing away in there offices unless they are forced out on too the floor and even then it is just till the can retreat to there hole in the wall. There is absolutely no commencation with home office and little thought is put in too how the changes they make impact the store.
bad,"When the Online Pickup launched, there were a bunch of problems. The management didn't do much to help and improve the app and or with disgruntled customers."
bad,If you can deal with the management Treating you like sh** being pulled in 500 directions  never been able to get your job done being screamed out because you can’t get your job done the attendance policy is very harsh you have to earn sick time before you’re able to get sick they do not except doctors notes for no reason. The pay benefits and work hours for supervisors and above are great
bad,"I started working there as a temp for the remodel and then got worked into the staff once the remodel was finished. It started out ok, but my schedule was very inconsistent, my days off were never together or the same. My shifts were always changing and I was always pulled from my department and then was coached because my work wasn't done."
bad,"typical day at work was pretty much the same. Come and clock in, take out inventory and put them on the shelves, help customers with any inquires and helped out with the checkouts if needed. Mangement was not the greatest but was not expecting that much coming from them. They really didn't care about their employees and some of them made some comments which no manager should make to their employees. The Gen Manager was always out or on vacation and the bonuses... if you have been working there for 15 years.... is not even worth it and was probably given the majority to the general manager. People went and go like it was the plague but what is new. It was a place to get paid to barely scrape the bills. I would always ask for more hours and got denied since they didn't want to pay me full time to which then they would have to pay me in benefits, which at that point I wouldn't care. The lunches were 1 hour long.. which to me is not worth it, and if you clocked in even a minute early, the yell at you. Not a place to work long time due to management and pay/benefits from what I saw."
bad,A typical day working at Walmart would be stressful yet wonderful somedays. You get the slackers so of course you have to fix it but its not bad at all.
bad,The culture is one of who can put down  whom. How can I keep from being fired because my manager doesn’t like me today. The management seeks to glorify itself at the cost of those beneath them.
bad,If you don't mind slips seating and switching trucks almost everyday and having to clean them out thoroughly then this is your company good luck... also get used to working every weekend...
bad,Great benifits and below decent wage if you get past 91st days to recieve your benifits. Extremely high turn over rate of 97% as well as management with no communication.
bad,good place to work for. great career advancements. when they changed rules about being sick or calling off is when they got screwey. a lot of people had complaints about that system. after I left they changed the policy
bad,I would not recommend any one to work for Walmart. The management and the way it works is something that needs to be looked into and overhauled there is no support for any of the hourly associates
bad,Walmart could care less about there employees they make you feel like they do but they don’t . They no longer have flexible hours if you need to work certain hours chances are you will get no hours at all . The higher up you go with the company assistant manager etc.... the leaders above you treat you like a dog and have no respect for you . All in all the day to day is like a big high school and management is like the hall monitors . The pay is really good but that’s because nobody wants to work there anymore .
bad,Walmart was a very fast paced extremely busy environment. I can say this was one of my least jobs. With the constant stealing an having to chase people out the door.I can say u have to really come to work an be prepared for anything
bad,"The job itself I enjoyed but very strict on the attendance,managment you have and team leads not so great, I worked there for a year got 40 plus hours a week which was great but on paper I was part time so I was unable to get the health benefits through the company and they would not change me from part time to full time on paper."
bad,"Good job to a start and create experience with costumer for other kind of jobs in the future. Friendly associates of different culture,  one of the biggest marketing in America"
bad,"I learned to maneuver heavy rows of carts around cars. The hardest parts would be avoiding to hit anything and trying to stay fast on the lot, the management at the store I worked at was absolutely terrible, they did nothing to help customers or associates."
bad,Very demanding and worth the money job. just you are treated as nothing but a number. Very good benefits and pay. Good people to work with overall good.
bad,Can be great if you do not have a family. never want one or dont like spending time with the one you have. Also great if you dont care if you have a life outside of work. If you stay out of management life can be a little easier.
bad,i cant say that i enjoyed working here but at least it was a job when i needed work. the management seemed like they actually cared about the employees but they were forced to keep hours low.
bad,The worst part of this job is that they take advantage of you. Managers don’t do their job & cashiers are to blame for everything. It’s toxic & stressful
bad,Terrible place to work I was working three or four different job codes. Hours were cut regularly and management was extremely incompetent at running the store.
bad,"La empresa en si es muy buena, solamente que hay ambientes muy toxicos, no te dan motivacion alguna, puedes mantener una vida laboralmente estable, pero te consume tu vida personal y social, se ponen en peros cuando tenes una cita, cuando quieres estudiar."
bad,Walmart needs to pay employees fairly especially with the lack of work life balance. Higher Management will get weekends off yet employees would rarely have a chance to. The only positive was working with some cool coworkers and having free food in break room every so often.
bad,"It is a crazy place to work, but it is decent if it's just temporary. Being a cashier, I got the blunt force of ""I want to speak to your manager"" Karens. All because she 'found' pants in the 'clearance' bin for a dollar, when they are priced at 20. *sigh* Retail life was just not for me"
bad,"For a first job wal-mart was fine. It's quick pace and stressful work environment got me use to working with others under adverse conditions. However, with lack of  advancement and low-pay. Staying there long term simply wasen't an option."
bad,"Inequity of pay for doing the same job was frustrating. An incoming new person can and often does have a higher starting pay than more experienced associates with many years of service. They give a 2% pay raise a year and give you a review after. An (exceeds all expectations review) gets you nothing, the raise is always the same 2%"
bad,Over work low pay and disrespected for service.  Lack of trust from level of bosses. Kept changing policies to catch people to fire. Don't listen to hype about family oriented they don't care.
bad,The management team didn’t always take the situations serious and didn’t always handle it properly! They do work with you flexibility and they do give you a good amount of hours
bad,This place likes to throw you into the fire with little to no training. they eventually will send you to a training store if you are in management but if you are an associate then you have to learn on the fly. You will be expected to work in multiple areas an a daily basis. The store is seriously undermanned and you will be moved around a lot.
bad,"Salaried Managers are required to do everything to fill the gaps by Corporate cutting back jobs and hours for hourly employees. The upper management of the company has lost site of the worker and making it good for the worker to be employed by Walmart. Most workers are unhappy with it just being a job, not a career."
bad,They have no respect for their employees and unless you are the managers favorite.  The customers look down on you with no respect.  This is a good place for teens looking fit their first job.
bad,"The employees are not treated the way the customers are treated therefore the employees treat the customers with the same disrespect that they are receiving from management. There are very few who go over above or beyond to help customers. They are just there making a check. I worked the Toy dept for a year and liked my job, i did a 100 percent and they wanted 101 percent. I couldnt deal with that anymore, meanwhile the slackers were never coached or talked to when the were getting half of their work done bacause they were talking while on the floor. Walmart lost a good employee in me.."
bad,"Job isn't hard, but it is understaffed. The csms    are very nice, but do not expect career advancement or to transfer to another position. It won't happen."
bad,"This job was great at the beginning. Just had to get all my stock put up. But near the end they had some people promote to Asst. Manager. Most of them were great, then you have the others who get promoted and it goes to their heads. They try and hang it over your head. I had a problem with one, she demanded respect and I did not give it to her. With me people have to earn respect.Other then that I really enjoyed my job."
bad,"They always talking to somebody in a angry tone , they’ll make you work in a department that you didn’t put on your application , I’m not comfortable at this job"
bad,"I’m a bicycle assembler and I enjoy my job. It’s fast-paced and I’m always busy. However, since corporate has instituted, if you’re not available to work the weekend, you won’t be scheduled at all policy, I’m looking for a new job. Also you are not able to claim unfilled shifts, management deletes them. After four weeks of not being on the schedule you’re automatically terminated."
bad,Was just a means of making money the over work you with no reflection on your pay. Had decent benefits but management never agreed with each other. The place gave me just stress
bad,Walmart has a lot of freight coming in but not enough people to help out . People have left the job fast when asked if they going to hire new people they said there is no payroll for new hires
bad,there are managers at every corner and no one really knows what is going on. Most of the time if you do your job they will leave you alone just don't breath the wrong way. Maybe it has changed over the years but not that way 5 years ago.
bad,My first 6 months working were fine then they replaced the majority of our managers with complete aholes who took all the fun out of work and did not diserve mine or my coworkers respect.
bad,I just didn’t care for this job. It was too much standing in one spot for hours on end. Break times were never consistent. The managers were good though.
bad,Techs are underpaid and overworked.  very busy work environment and some days are very short staffed.  Management can be very negligent to the needs of the employees.
bad,"It is a good place to work but if you get sick there attendance policy is ridiculous, they expect you to come in when you have a 105 degree fever. It isn’t safe"
bad,"Walmart's management has blatant favoritism and the management gets off task. Cashiers are stationed at every other cash register, making it too far to socialize when it is slow. Employees are scheduled with either too many at slow times or too little at busy times."
bad,There was some very friendly people but others were awful and hateful. The ones in charge of the cashier pick favorites and are very hatful and rude to the other cashiers they don’t like.
bad,"Wal marts managers weren't always on the same page"
bad,The initial start went smooth but as time went by I didn't like the working atmosphere.  At times there was too much drama and I was constantly being blamed for stuff I didn't do.  Other workers were constantly abusing their breaks and somehow I was still getting yelled at.  This may depend on location but this was not the best environment to work in.
bad,"I go to work at 3AM, have to watch the clock to be sure I don't punch in too early (which can get you in just as much trouble as not showing up), extremely demanding work environment where employees are encouraged to work through their legally mandated breaks, but cutting it too close to your unpaid lunch hour is cause for a write up because the company can get in trouble. Be careful if you have to use the bathroom, they don't like that."
bad,the days at walmart started off long being that orientation lasted 12 hrs on the first three days. most of the work given was easy and we usually always finished.
bad,It was a career step for me and i am looking to progress my skills. To have better opportunities. As a young professional it awarded me with a challenge to better my skills.
bad,My experience has not been pleasant due to the management. They do not value their employees. The management is always changing and not all mangers are on the same page.
bad,"If you are lazy, you get the easiest jobs and can boss other co-workers around. Complaints never get investigated, God forbid if you get pregnant or hurt/sick and need time off. Walmart puts the biggest idiots in charge of their stores. Rarely you'll find a good one that treats people LIKE PEOPLE!"
bad,Gain a lot of knowledge in the customer service feel.  Greeting customers and interacting with customer daily.  Very good knowledge to use in any other job.
bad,"With the time spent at Walmart, I found it hard being there due to bad management. There were other area of work which I enjoyed; Working with costumers, stocking, and working truck."
bad,Must be willing to work in different departments and help others daily.  Work in various temps.  Some managers are easy going while others think they are better than others.  Not enough holiday time with family.
bad,The managers made it stressful because I would always work the evening including weekends with only one other person and he never did his job. The managers were aware of this but still expected me to get everything done and still go help other departments. To me and other coworkers they seemed indifferent about other associates.
bad,"Typical day at work consisted of me unloading and processing freight, I learned a lot about supply chain management while working for this organization. Top leadership at this organization lacked many qualities including integrity and empathy. The workplace culture at this firm was very anti-Walmart. Many of the employees disliked working for the company and only did so because of the pay, schedule, and location of the distribution center."
bad,There is plenty of room for growth.but there was no teamwork as well as management is not supportive at all.They are under a lot of stress so they do not have time to support you.
bad,"Decent job, mostly for younger applicants. Good advancement opportunities and convenient scheduling. Transferring for when I moved was super easy! Poor management and disorganized management tactics."
bad,"They made baseless accusations. They give you four chances. "
bad,"Management sucks due to NO EMPATHY!"
bad,"required to work more than I wanted as a college student, and made to work outside when the cart pushers did not show up, which was always. managers were not helpful and hard to talk to"
bad,"Walmart loves to show happy cheerful workers on their commercials, but that is not what it is really like. The managers are more like tyrants. The employees are really mistreated."
bad,The job itself was fine. The work was good and steady but it was a struggle to get full time status. They do not seem to want full time employees working at this business. The employees were excellent and the managers were nice but the pay was lacking
bad,"Between 1995 and 2002, management wasn't exactly great."
bad,Not a good work place culture. Management did not seem to care about the associates. I enjoyed the basic job. Picking stocking and binning was good. The constant pressure to produce more with fewer employees made the job unenjoyable
bad,The benefits is really why I hung on at Walmart. The managers really don't care about you outside of work and they always move you up in the company but as soon as you have your own ideas they make you step down.
bad,"Helping the customer and being nice , you can ask how they say was and can ask do you need your things tooken to the car . You smile and can laugh with them"
bad,"Nous avons de bonnes périodes d'apprentissage couramment"
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work here or at any Walmart. I have worked at 3 different Walmart stores and had the same thing happen at each store. You work there for 6 months until you're eligible for benefits and they start cutting your hours.
bad,Doesn’t care about associates that come to the facility and work hard everyday.We have no one to stand up for us in any situation. Feel very unappreciated with this company
bad,Not bad hot as all get out and too short. Some team leads were lazy and or bossy letting the others do all the work but thats anywhere you go. Dont remember too much
bad,"I Believe This Company was Raised In a Strict Management Process, I Mean It Can Improve Somewhat Based On How They Treat Their Employees. I Just Think That Certain Managers can Be Fair To Every Employee That Works For Them That's something That can get Better at The Time Goes On"
bad,"The people who worked there were nice, but the overall work experience was pretty awful. Nothing was consistent, and policies could change at any given time."
bad,This wouldn't be the company to join if you wish to be full time on a full time basis.. they may promise you full time but you wont stay full time.. on a whim you may get 40 hours for 4 weeks but then you get 23 or 16 hours the next. Its bound to happen with the market changes. Its the ups and downs of the retail world.  I found most of the management I work with to be wonderful and very ambitious.  Some maybe a little more stressed then others but overall they were great to work with!
bad,Worked here as a college student and it was a decent job. The hiring and starting process was extremely smooth but there seemed to be a disconnect of communication between levels of management.
bad,They treat their employees like trash the mangers are even worse they literally dont care about you I dont recommend nobody working there unless you need health insurance but that takes a year.
bad,"The hardest part of the job was making sure customers weren't stealing. You needed to check receipts for high ticketed items, learning to keep your cool while customers hurled insults at you was a must."
bad,"não se tem estabilidade, o diretor nem sempre é justo e não tem mecanismo de se identificar quando há uma injustiça."
bad,"The workplace culture was not the best, not very team based although there are team meetings. I did learn great customer service skills and how to interact with customers and meet there needs."
bad,Cette compagnie immense ne se préoccupe pas de leurs employés.
bad,"Realistically it wasn't that bad, I've had worse jobs. They could do more to accommodate their employees, but the jobs aren't that hard and the coworkers usually aren't too bad."
bad,"You’re going to work, it’s a bit stressful sometimes a lot stressful buy you’ll make it! A lot of people feel we’re over worked and underpaid  and I guess just depending on who you’re working with makes the job fun or not"
bad,I love working at Walmart and I would go back if there was ever a change and there Management. It is really a great job to have and would recommend my friends to work there
bad,"Its walmart, As you see when you walk in, it is a high paced stressful work environment. The management support isnt the best but you can handle things on your own."
bad,The management struggles to keep up with the demand of the cashiers and other areas. Our manager is no where to be found or is stretched too thin. There are many issues that need to be resolved.
bad,"Hectic is the daily routine with no work life balance. It is retail and should be expected. This job has taught me to be patient and to value your associates. The culture is not what is once was, it use to be about customer service, striving for excellence and respect for the individual now it seems to be about doing more with less everyday."
bad,"I was hired as Cart gather. I was moved to meat department, then two cart gathers were fire in a week and I was moved back and able to keep up for both of them. then I was moved to garden center. after a while I was moved back to carts. Eventually I was able to become a cashier and cart gather. There were days when I was cart gathering half the day and cashiering the other half. If you ask for days off make sure they put them in the system or they will but one day in three times even if it is for a funeral you let them know about one month before hand."
bad,I enjoyed working and interacting with customers. I ran the front end of the store and handled money on a daily basis. I needed to find a better paying job.
bad,"The pay is competitive, they take your previous work experience into consideration when deciding your beginning pay. Insurance is offered to both full and part time employees. You can make some life long friends and memories. Management needs work! You can not move up into any higher paying position unless they favor you over the other candidates. Attendance points gets taken off for favored employees while others get fired immediately. There is a main group of certain managers and if your not “in” with them then you will never go anywhere within the company."
bad,"i liked the job. wasnt anything wrong with it. i had fun. co workers was nice and respectful, it was a simple job. i would prefer anyone looking for a job to work there."
bad,very very busy and fast paced. Management isn't very professional in the way they speak to employees. When you request a manager no one ever comes to help.
bad,not a fun place to work. management is horrible. always changing policy.pay is not competitive with other business inthe area.would not recommend walmart as a good place to work
bad,I went to work and put my coat on the rack and placed my personal stuff in a combination locked locker. I clocked in and went to the room where the manager decided where everyone was going to be that night
bad,"Walmart is great and all but online shopping is so much easier and safer, not to mention no rude service by cashiers, they might be better off just selling groceries honestly. Plus the clothing section alone is become so ghetto in style it's hard to find anything professional and appropriate no a da"
bad,"I did not like dealing with the managers there because they actually played the favoritism card a lot.  Also, they held people responsible for certain jobs that did not get done and that person went through chain of command to show that the job was not being done adequately by another team member."
bad,It's stressful. The People are mean. Management doesn't seem to know what they're doing. Work ANYWHERE else. please. I'm begging you. Don't do it. This is not the job you want.
bad,"The job itself would have been easy, but the night and day shifts wouldnt communicate with each other, so night shift would end up leaving thier supplies in the wrong areas, or reversing changes made on day shift, only for day shift to reverse those changes again. A lot of work mainly repeating yourself, while the managers argued on who's vision is better. The pay is good, paid lunch and breaks too, but not worth all the hassle of aching back, feet, and head."
bad,"A typical day at work was monotonous and long. I did not enjoy being a cashier. At the store I worked at, the managers were extremely uptight. We were not allowed much individuality appearance wise."
bad,"Learned a lot about time management and task delegation. "
bad,Bom ambiente para se trabalhar porém muitos (Chefes) o que acaba dificultando problemas que poderiam ser resolvidos rapidamente.
bad,The job was okay but i didnt find some things fun nor funny the people had to many race jokes and never to help with anything they just watch when you working and struggling
bad,"Always changing schedule hours and days. Hardly work with school schedule even though they state they do. A lot of favoritism. The longer you work there, company will eventually start trying to look for an opportunity to let you go to not pay benefits"
bad,Walmart doesn’t know how to pay their employees that have been there over years. I been with the company 6 years and it could take less that 6 months for a new associate to make the same pay I make that I earned In 6 years. Giving my best that I could possibly do and make a true difference to the company
bad,Typical work day is busy front open till close especially by the afternoon. Management is not reliable enough to ask even to look into the simplest of things. Unless your best friends with them they seem to work against you. Fellow employees are responsible and willing to help each other out most of the time. Hardest part of the job was often expected to multitask various jobs at once especially since hours around the holidays was almost non-existent to a point you'd think the store was closing for good after 2 years of being open. The most enjoyable part of the job was hearing how thankful the customers were about what you were doing to help them.
bad,It was a job when I needed one. The pay should have been a lot more for the price of living in that area. Also the management needed to check on the workers more to make sure they were doing there job.
bad,"Ran the stockroom, which was the only reason I stayed as long as I did.  "
bad,"I work in the optical department now and that is a less stressful place to be. "
bad,It can be a decent place to work and best to advance if you want to make a career out of it. Cashiering can become rather repetitive therefore being able to transfer departments to keep it interesting is a plus.
bad,Walmart was a great company to work for at first but then policies changed and they became to focused on the wrong things. I will not return unless absolutely necessary.
bad,Existe un ambiente pesado ya que las encargadas del área de cajas son demasiado déspotas
bad,They have poor management skills we ask for help and they dnt help us at all they have a attitude and rude. I don’t get my breaks on time and they treat me wrong. And show favoritism
bad,Hard work. Fast paced. Good benefits. Poor management. Not paid hour break. Two paid fifteen minute breaks. Great co-workers. Money could have been a lot more.
bad,"It is very stressful, especially when no one shows up for their job. The management doesn't care about their workers, and they never are there when needed."
bad,"Worked in the wine and spirits store, where sometime's felt unsecured due to the theft and lack of security and lack of response from management when calling in a 911 occurrence."
bad,Ambiente Bajo Presión Donde Trabajas Sobre Ordenes y Planes Que Trae La Empresa Para Hacer Un Incremento En Ventas
bad,the most chaotic and simultaneously lackadaisical place i have ever worked.  its like 80% of the employees are being paid to sleepwalk. a sort of purgatory for ambition.
bad,Work life balance can be horrible. It's hard to even try to eat lunch without someone stopping you to ask questions or needing something.   You are constantly pulled into many directions at once.
bad,Production rate is very high and very difficult to meet. Almost never get the 36 hours promised. Very stressful and difficult work environment and exhausting.
bad,"It is a good place to start when you don't have any prior work experience.  They have raised wages recently to be above minimum wage. When I was there, people called off all the time."
bad,The experience just wasn't for me. I didnt like the environment or other staff members. I wasnt really comfortable with many of them. Really demanding workplace culture.
bad,"Working as a cashier at Walmart was very interesting. I worked on 2nd shift and had to stay over a lot of nights. At the end of my shift, I had to do stock work."
bad,"As a female manager, I was paid $4 less an hour than male counterparts with less experience and qualifications.  When this was brought up to upper management, I was fired."
bad,"While the coworkers and the work was fine, managers were either lazy or incompetent. Multiple managers wasted time talking about non-work subjects, or finding ways to do as little work as possible. They also reprimanded employees for clocking out past their shift end even when the employee had no choice but to clock out late."
bad,I don't feel I was trained properly my management and most times I had no clue what I should be doing unless in was something I learn along the way. I was never given the chance to truly develop my skills.
bad,"A typical day at work would require lots of walking, and stocking. Helping customers, managing dates on food. Heavy lifting, and bending.  Managing price labels."
bad,"The experience you gain from working here doesn't translate to other companies nearly as well as you'd hope, and I saw too many people afraid to leave their jobs at Walmart because if they had, they'd lose a significant amount of monthly income because they wouldn't get paid that elsewhere."
bad,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, the pay and insurance was good too, the management... not so much. I really loved my job and the hours, as well as really everything honestly. My only issue, which was a big one, was the management. I wasn't correctly trained, my training was cut short by a week, and I was being penalized for my ineffective training and not able to correctly do my work. So after a few weeks of everything going horridly wrong and tipping over the edge of being fired for not being able to perform my job correctly, I quit and gave them notice beforehand."
bad,I did not like the Walmart in Lancaster. I did my job well and as I was told but they would take advantage of that and keep me later to finish the jobs of other people. I did not mind that but they also kind of made it a habit
bad,"There is a lot to learn from the different departments. It can be an interesting place work in. Though the company seems unsure of the direction to take on certain subjects. The company culture of getting ahead of the changing markets seems slightly bent on ""change for the sake of change."""
bad,"This is a horrible company to work for, They under pay associates and will not hire anyone full time. Management is rude and unfair when it comes to certain issues."
bad,"I was there for almost a year and was a cashier, online pickup, and a backroom associate. I was moved quite often because of how hard I worked so a lot of the managers wanted me working for them. I was then doing their jobs on top of mine but still only being paid minimum wage for it. Co management was basis against me because I would get things done faster than what she wanted me to."
bad,"Work environment was professional. Mostly for those looking for a summer job during school years. Management looked to get work done fast as inventory turnover was high, creating pressure to get work done in a timely manner."
bad,"I didn’t care to work here, the environment wasn’t good. Place itself was never really clean. Co workers were rude. Not a job I liked much. I found a new job fast"
bad,working at Wal-Mart was a learning experience. most days the work environment was negative in nature. the ASM management  experienced many difficulties in organizing the team.
bad,"Generally, my day was show up at 11, help unload a truck if there was one scheduled for that day, and then proceed to stock shelves the rest of the shift."
bad,The only redeemable part about working at Walmart were the coworkers I met at my level. The management and even some of the supervisors were very much riddled with disagreements among the ranks.
bad,I wasn't happy working at Walmart. The pharmacy is so busy and the boss had a way of talking to you that was very demeaning. I don't think Walmart is the best company to work for anymore.
bad,"Working at Walmart is great, just need to be under new management. All of the managers there do not treat their employees the way they should be treated."
bad,"If y''all wanna work at a bootcamp this walmart is just for you. Poor management and got no respect whatsoever. Cash manager pressures you to give more hours despite not caring as much about your student life. Floor manager brings negative personal opinions and emotions towards employees into the business, judges, and obviously lies a LOT to the employees as well as customers. The production/stocking manager is ALWAYS unhappy and yells disrespectfully at some employees, I mean not even their own mothers yells at them like that. So much for diversity, all three of them are arabs and probably talking smack in their language about employees. The big boss automatically assumes you did something bad without having proof and doesn't even confront you about it, but instead go tells your manager. They all talk smack behind your back. Buncha fakes!"
bad,This is a very stressful fast-paced environment. Customers are rude all day long. The rate of pay is low and never enough hours. Only enforce the rules for certain associates. Advancement is difficult and scheduling is not flexible at all.
bad,"Successfully completed the Customer Service Manager Training program."
bad,"My typical day was maintaining cart inventory, assisting customers loading merchandise in their vehicles and store maintenance as needed. It was not a match for my skills and experience, but ok as a place to work as a student."
bad,"I worked as a CSM and my job was to oversee the other cashiers for their breaks, handle money, work at customer service. The hours were not consistent and the pay wasn't very good."
bad,When I first started with the company  enjoyed it . But as the years went on not so much. A person earns a bonus every quarter but then they cut your hours to work. Their benefits are not that great for that big of a company.
bad,Often times the Assistant Managers and Co-Managers were not fair and consistent.  Previous Store Manager created hardship for others because he was having an inappropriate affair with a girl in claims.
bad,"I worked there a while, but i don't have anything good or bad to say. The most hardest part of the job was being responsible for lazy employees. The most enjoyable was having Christmas off."
bad,"It's a  Safe environment constable, fun caring hardworking,  Equal right - we have to work hard and be friendly we have to help with everything we can ."
bad,"Manager is definitely a JOKE. None are of professional manner. The manager is almost never there and just wasn't the best manager an employee could have, overall."
bad,"It was a alright place to work. If you are a hard worker you tended to have to do most of the work. Management had its days, like most places. Easy money for easy work."
bad,"If you ever want to see the worst side of people, work in retail.  Customers are rude beyond belief, and you will never be able to do enough for them."
bad,"this was my first security job i Guarded main entrance to Walmart which created and maintained a secure and effective work environment for customers and associates "
bad,I love working at walmart the co-workers was nice and friendly to me. The mangement is a good team to work with. The service there is nice they on every friday where give u free lunch.
bad,Overall I didn't much care for Walmart. I started in a small Alaskan town then moved to Tennessee for awhile to a superwalmart.  The environment was so much more different from what I was used to. Management was horrible and I always felt so stressed out. I transferred back to my store in Alaska which was so small that our new store manager knew everyone's name in two weeks with out us having a name tag on.
bad,"I am no longer employed at walmart canada, however during my time there i did enjoy working with both co workers and management. I would recommend this place for a first time job."
bad,If anyone is in your way or someone is restocking a slot they effect your time. Also 15 minutes to build 2 8 foot tall pallets of potatoes cucumbers tomatoes in plastic crates boxed items and somehow at the end of it all trying to put 15 giant pails of frosting on top of it all isn't enough time. Eapecually when the majority of your trips consist of these and your expected to keep moving as fast at the end of the 12 hour shift as your are at the beginning. How do they not expect you to get worn out? Or lift 40 to 80 pounds 8 feet in the air for the full shift and meet the short time expectations of those trips?
bad,NO communication and management isn't that great good benefits but you really gotta work for your money. Not to mant diffent shifts unless you are a cashier
bad,i stated the day off at 4am to come in to do other people jobs because night time worker never did anything than by 8am i statred working on my job till the upper managment came in have us move some where els. all and all this place is not a good place to work
bad,"I was an overnight mod crewman and at first I was like yeah this is kind of neat and then it went away towards the end and I didn’t want this, so I needed to get another job that I would like."
bad,"Good place to work, but no advancement within the pharmacy for a pharmacy technician.  However, I worked with some very good people and managment was even fair."
bad,Rude loud manager in professional  I did not like that the employees were mean an very territorial. They were in packs it was like they made me feel uncomfortable in a way
bad,Walmart has some beneficial classes and benefits for employees. Walmart does not really take care of employees in time of need. Walmart has a few things they could work on for employees.
bad,"I've been an employee for a number of years and the same problems exist here as they did when I first started."
bad,Walmart was a great company  to work for 10 years ago. They would have enough people to get the area done on a timely matter. Now they under staff to cute cost. Putting more stress on the Associates. Making it a stress full work environment.
bad,"When I first started at Walmart @ 18 it was great people where nice it was a fun environment to be in. Over the years it has changed so much the dont treat the employees fairly, the structure has changed. Jus my experience it was chaotic"
bad,"Walmart is a very stressful place to work. The job itself wasn’t bad,  management wasn’t helpful or friendly. It’s hard to get full time hours unless you work third shift. Pay is average."
bad,what i learned at walmart is to always try to be on time to be able to put your belongings in the few best lockers they have there and how to get the products to their right locations.
bad,"I really enjoy my job due to meeting new people every day and that im constantly busy but, the management at some locations is very poor. Sometimes they forget about you and leave you isolated when you need a break. There's never enough staff, the scheduling system isn't reliable. And the point system is a little unfair due to some peoples lives. Alot of people loose thier jobs because of the point systems especially new hires. I asked to transfer due to moving away from the area and the store manager denied me despite of my situation now making my life a little harder."
bad,It was an ok experience working there alot of integrity issues with management. Not alot of respect for the workers. Not alot of appreciation either...
bad,"La empresa tiene muy buenas normas que están a favor del asociado, el problema es como sus líderes manejan esas normas."
bad,"The people I work with are great, but the company itself sucks... they have a absent point system and do not accept doctors notes. if you are late by 10 mins its half a point. one full day is a point and you only get 4 points in 6 months. so 8 days a year. which in itself isn't bad, but I am a single parent and things happen. I received a point because I couldn't leave the hospital because my daughter was ill. plus the hours are inconsistent. I was told if you work 40 hours in 12 weeks your able to receive insurance benefits was scheduled 40 hours for ten weeks then the hours dropped off. next week I am only scheduled 5.45 all week 1 day and not a full shift....."
bad,My typical day at work involves customer service. By working in this field I have learned how too communicate with customers and satisfy their needs. The workplace culture is sometimes easy going and sometimes a fast-paste environment. The hardest part of the job is was trying to stay up through the night. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team effort with co-workers.
bad,I felt like I was a lone. even through they say they were. I felt that my neck was sticking out. if I open my mouth. they got mad I did things on my own. you are to know what people know on the day shifts.
bad,"Walmart has made some new changes lately with making certain departments into one big one. They put a lot of pressure on just one person to get the job done when it clearly takes up to 3 people to get the task done correctly.  Management itself has been bad, schedules are just not what they used to be."
bad,The pay was decent but i thought i worked but butt off for nothing they treated us like dogs not employees i wouldn't give good advice about Walmart to anyone
bad,Productive it’s not fast paced at all there are favorites. Production is expected. Safety is priority there. You work 4days a week 10 hr shifts or three days 12 hr shifts
bad,This was a good first job but not long term never able to receive a full 40 hours and never respect your school schedule or any type of time off. There is no growth in the company
bad,"There's little control given to managers. Their attendance policy does not account for acts of god, nor unavoidable circumstances. It makes it tough to keep your job after a stint of poor luck."
bad,Management had their favorites who got treated differently than others. They would often joke around with them and send them help when they didn't finish their work. Others were criticized for asking for help or would have to help others if they finished early.
bad,"I worked in 4 departments over a 13 year period. Was department manager in two of the departments. Walmart micro-manages like no other place on earth! You may have 5 different managers giving 5 different directions on a single project. They have excellent training tools...but no time to use them. Most of upper management was really good, but the ones that weren't, should not have been in management at all."
bad,"Nice place. Only reason I left was because of distance but it was a fun and nice place to work. Associates very friendly, when help was needed they were there."
bad,"I worked for Walmart for eight years, and there was no room for advancement outside my department. When my plans to become a pharmacist fell through, there was no way for me to advance to a management position from pharmacy technician; the company's structure didn't allow it."
bad,"worked 1 to 10 mostly"
bad,Every day at work I spend my time cleaning up after others and trying to find some kind of support from team members who seem more interested in finding ways to not earn their pay and Pokemon Go then actually performing any kind of useful task.  Think that this is only floor associates?  Nope!  Salaried managers included!
bad,"Wal-Mart seemed at first to be a pretty cool place, the employees were nice, decent job training, okay hours and pay. "
bad,Was a very uniformed step by step schedule. Management did not know how to treat their employees fairly. The hardest part of the job was not being able to find help when i needed it.
bad,Relaxed place to work. Co workers were friendly. Pay could be improved and communication with management could also be improved. They are good with making the schedule work for you.
bad,Working at Walmart is like working in a high school with all the social levels intact. There is competition between stores for the same goal. The social structure of any store will be much like what you see every where else so it's easy to fit in and get lost.
bad,Management is not considerate of work life balance. Over worked for what pay was given. I learned a lot about customer service working there. A typical day is helping customers
bad,"After 6yrs of working the front end till I got tired of being overworked and under paid. The head office likes to have minimal staff and expect other departments to help pick up the slack. Meanwhile you get to deal with the angry customers cuz its your fault, not."
bad,"Production is ridiculous, very fast paced and being number one is their goal, regardless of how fast they work their associates. Production sometimes is impossible to meet and you will get held accountable every time you don’t meet it."
bad,A typical day at work was helping customers with their needs. Management was not understanding of the every day issues that employees go through......
bad,Tiene muy mal ambiente de trabajo y te obligan a trabajar más de tus 8 horas por día (normalmente te obligan a trabajar 12 o 16 en algunos casos)
bad,Get to work and clock in walk to the work area greet costumers ring up there purchases be friendly and keep an eye out for shoplifters wright up vehicles for the auto care center.
bad,"It has benefits and advancement in career,  Strict rules on attendance and leaving work early, clocking in late or early but they are easily followed."
bad,Walmart management could be a whole lot better.They didn’t properly train their employees. You was just left to learn on your own. I like the company just wished management was better
bad,No work/life balance. You’re expected to do more and more with less and less by working everyone to death. Salaried employees are treated poorly and expected to be available at a moment’s notice. Home office constantly changing direction so you can never be “on process”.
bad,"Every store has its issues and this one was no different.  A top down management structure meant having at least 6 bosses that could tell you how to do your job at any given moment, and without caring what one of the other 5 might have already told you to do.  Never a good way to try and keep the workforce running smoothly."
bad,"A typical day at work involved a good handful of standing still, even on the slow days."
bad,"Good job for college students or first time job.  But not enough to support a family or pay enough to deal with the stress.  If you need flexibility in your schedule, then this may be a good fit."
bad,"As a sales floor associate, you're constantly unloading pallets full of merchandise, filling them as much as possible, and stocking the merchandise on the floor or putting them away. Assisting customers is always going to happen, and management will always be coming around. "
bad,Positions available at Walmart ranges from stocker to pharmacy technician to Deli associate and customer service cashiers. Walmart has gone through multiple changes within the last 5 years
bad,"Walmart was an ok place to work. I met a lot of nice people there, but some of the people were less enjoyable to work with. They did not have good work ethics."
bad,"A typical work day at Walmart really depends on the day. Some days are chill where we aren't real busy and picking goes smoothly. other days nothing is on the shelf, all the customers need help, management is paging half the associates up front check because they never schedule nearly enough cashiers."
bad,It was a good experience to help me jump start my listings in the work experience section of my resume.  Good experience but wouldn't do it ever again.
bad,"Poor mangement, rules only applied to some people. cashiers do more work than anybody else minus the backroom people. schedules  are inconsistent. do not count on a 40hr work week even if full time."
bad,i loved walmart becuase i started with a new store that was opening and had the options for movement within departments walmart paid ontime and allowed me to be verry active within the public
bad,"I worked here when I really needed a job. The pay isn't enough to live on. There tends to be a lot of drama from employees and customers. The managers do what they want. A lot of inconsistencies. However, some of the people"
bad,"je n'ai pas aimé travaillé chez Walmart."
bad,"I worked the graveyard shift, 10 pm to 7 am. I was attempting to go to school at the same time but I couldn't keep up. our lunches were an hour long but not until about 12 or 1 am. However because I worked overnight I got an extra dollar an hour and did not have to deal with a lot of customers"
bad,Flexible with hours when possible. Company matched 401K and able to purchase Walmart Stock Day 1 of hire. Excellent Prescription Coverage and Dental Coverage.
bad,The most enjoyable part about the job is providing help to customers. I learned a lot about how to always meet the customer's satisfaction and be productive at the job.
bad,It’s an fair job I wouldn’t make it out of a career . Walmart has many opportunities where you can grown and learn .. Walmart is one of the top selling disturbtors in America..
bad,"Walmart was my first job. I did the best I could do, given management staff. Everything seemed dysfunctional at any given time, so following the rules could be a bit difficult. In other words, if one CSM (Manager) is telling you store policy, you enforce it afterwards, only to have another CSM telling you that what you're doing is totally wrong and contrary to what the previous CSM has instructed you to do."
bad,The time i was there the management team was poor.  The employees knew more than management. It was an experience before I went away for college.  Now things seems to be better because the employees of the past are now the mangers.
bad,I did not work in the retail stores. I am a pharmacy technician and I worked in the Health and Wellness division. This is and okay place to work if you don't have any other choices.
bad,"It paid better than waitressing and was more willing to work with my school schedule. However the overall manager I had was very poor in performance and it felt like he would personally try to undermine employees by talking down to them or complain about productivity, then refuse to help struggling employees. However, he was replaced, and the manager who took his place was amazing for the few days I had worked with him. I suppose it all depends on store locations, I would suggest talking to current employees of which ever location you are considering to get a better view of the store before applying. If the management is bad, its not worth it, but my department manager, and support manager were both excellent, despite the head manager of the store"
bad,"Personally i enjoyed the work but after my initial training was over i was scheduled to work alone most days. Which by itself would be fine but i worked mostly in housewares in a Walmart that catered to a lot of people where many customers like to open products to visually inspect or demo them and then not put them back in the boxes. A lot of my time was spent trying to put pots and pans sets, kitchen utensils, and appliances back in their boxes the the very specific way they have to be so you could close them. So while i did this i was expected to clean up my section, collect go backs, help customers and restock product for the first hour or two that should have been done the night before which would take me away from my other duties and special projects that had to be done. I would get hassled about not having everything perfect by other department managers while my own promised that they were going to hire more people for the department to help out which never happened."
bad,When i first started there i couldn't wait to meet new cashiers/customer some of cashiers got real bad attitude but i love it until they fired me for not being above 10 i have family problems.
bad,"I think it was decent, not too good not too bad. Besides the fact that I was a part time employee working full time hours. Yeah, that didn't make my decision to leave hard."
bad,"The work place was fun productive and enjoyable, I enjoyed working there everything was great but the rate of pay the fact that we weren't allowed overtime all the time and the raises were very minimal, I couldn't afford an apartment let alone a rental house in my area or any area for that matter."
bad,"Many people seem happy with walmart"
bad,"Empresa  como prestaciones, fue una experiencia muy agradable trabajar en walmart  en el formato de bodega Aurrera"
bad,"Its Walmart. Its what you expect. They have benefits, paid time off, etc. But its still Walmart. The management in Amarillo is hard to judge, as it changes so often. Sometimes good, sometimes bad. Its Walmart."
bad,Working at Walmart has its challenges.  There are a plethora of things that need to change to accommodate the employees.  The amount of pay that the employees get for the work that they do is not sufficient enough.
bad,This was a job I had while I was in high school. I would recommend trying to stay and move up there. If unable to move up I would find another job. There are jobs that pay a lot more than Wal-Mart with little to no experience.
bad,"It was ok at best as long as you worked with someone who you enjoyed working with. If it wasn't for the people that I worked with, I would of left a long time ago."
bad,So many positions restructuring its difficult to feel secure with your position   Every month or so positions are eliminated   When I left no one contacted me 23 years and no Thank you for service nothing.  Very ruthless and cold company now.
bad,The environment was tolerable for work for only a certain period of time. Management was reasonably fair on some occasions but the overall work experience was detrimental to my health and my education in school.
bad,The day would start off me working in the frozen department and stocking the floor and then inventory and if i finished before it was time to go home i would go and help other departments while my manger finish paper work for the next shipment that comes in the next day or week.
bad,working with people besides management was the best part of the day. days at wal mart were very interesting. customers interaction was an great experience couldn't get anywhere else.
bad,Its a decent place to work at for someone who is currently enrolled in school but not for someone who is trying to pay bills at home. The pay is not enough.
bad,Overtime the people know you as a worker and become very nice and you learn many new positions and jobs. over my course I got a promotion. The people after a while just stopped being as friendly and you started to feel disrespected.
bad,I was happy to take this job at first but when I wasn't fast enough as a cashier they tried to remove me from my position and put me somewhere else with no training.
bad,some Whatever productive place to work needs more organization and team work needs to implement more training for management to be able too address and tackle situations on a professional level.
bad,"Responsible for preventing financial loss caused by theft and fraud"
bad,Manages new employee relocation by determining new employee requirements; negotiating with movers; arranging temporary housing; providing community introductions.
bad,"Rating this company does not help me at all. I do not feel this is necessary. Management does not care about you. There is no paid holidays or vacations unless you are a supervisor. We aren't even allowed to be off on Thanksgiving so we can go home to our families. Walmart is a slaveship, not a job."
bad,"Managers did not care about their jobs, employees were left without any tasks while others were suffocated with work, management played favorites. I don't recommend working at Walmart."
bad,"Honestly the management left me speechless, if you have health conditions forget it they fight hard to ensure everyone is treated the same slimy ways :("
bad,When I worked there the management was poor and they didn't take the time to help improve employees work experience. They would write up employees who failed to finish work that sometimes wasn't even told they had to complete before leaving for the day or even given the task to do in their task to-do list. They would also give tasks that required an 18 hours shift to complete and only had one person doing it working an 8 hour shift.
bad,"Work flow is not great but it's alright. Connexus is extremely difficult to get the hang of, and is quite buggy, even still in 2018. The new Mobile Express seems promising and is working smoothly so far. The 2% annual raise is trash because the starting wage is low already."
bad,"Management was very hard on the associates with unrealistic expectations that no one could meet. Management was constantly changing, many of them quit."
bad,Were suppose to be a big familly no lityle gangs talking againt other employe not true.if you had a problem with someone working there you had to wright the time  the day and what that person did to you .you think we have time to stop everything to do that.they say come to us we will fix it together but that is there answer to wright it down and you don't bother with that.And the problem don't get fix .
bad,The managers and co workers are very friendly. Good place to start as a first job. Pay is competitive for the area and you also get pay raise by a dollar after your 3 month probation period.
bad,"If you like the standing there for hours at a time, with rude customers, and everything that comes with being a cashier then more to you. I didnt enjoy it"
bad,would recommend to a friend for sure. they treat you well and respect you when you deserve it. would go back and work for a lifetime if i could but i needed to move on.
bad,Job description was not made clear would ne what I disliked the most about the job. The management did not have very well communication skills. And the workplace was okay to work for it just all depends on who you surround yourself by.
bad,Very poor and disorganized  work environment. They don't provide enough training for associates and they expect you to know everything. Managers are not good at managing employees.
bad,"I worked at Wal-Mart for a year, 6 months as a cashier, 6 months as a garden center associate. I really have no complaints about being a cashier. However, as a garden center associate, all kinds of issues arose. My management completely ignored our needs and our suggestions for product care. Immediate management didn't care about the plants. They would give us at least 6 hour-long projects, for an 8 hour working shift, then complain to us about how we didnt get projects done. Meantime, we were understaffed, trying to take care of usually 3 to 4 customers at once, trying to get these projects done, answering phones, running a register, while still trying to do general maintenance and organization of our department."
bad,Over work you for less money had 12 pallets with no help with big big ones always got done last had way way more than everyone eles and they use to look at me like I was moving slow when others have 5 pallets unfair if u working overnight
bad,Not the greatest job in the world but I mean if you need a quick and easy job then Walmart is for you. Prepare to deal with rude customers. Courtesy Associate is basically just pushing carts from the parking lot too inside the store all day.
bad,i liked working in the deli cooking cleaning the smell of the good food i enjoyed the people i worked with work good long hours i like the managers mostly
bad,I didn't like it here simply because of the establishment I was at. The store itself was very unorganized and didn't seem to have compassion for their workers.
bad,"Cultura laboral excelente donde los asociados la llegan a aplicar e identificar, lástima que los superiores a veces la olvidan y se va perdiendo poco a poco."
bad,i worked at Walmart and didn't earn enough to stay there plus the manager was very partial to some people and have others to take up the slack in the department
bad,Very confusing work environment one moment they would tell me everything needed to get done that day and I would get it done take a quick 5 min breather then managers would come back and get on to me 3/10 would not work there again.
bad,walmart is a place to get a paycheck the work is boring and the manangement is usually terrible. I hope i dont have to work at a place so monotonious again
bad,"Working at walmart is typically seen as one of the worst places to work and for the most part its not that bad. The problem arise from lack of support and no appreciation from management after being yelled at and treated like something found on the bottom of your shoe. You can try will all your might and be as nice and courteous to what are frankly the worst example of humanity and still be reported for something as simple as you didnt smile enough. When they say the customer is always right what they are really saying is your opinion are wrong, you have no rights, and you have no right to defend yourself when accused of doing poorly on your job even if you work yourself to death."
bad,"they are always pulling you to go and work in a department that you know nothing about. they leave you to look after a high volume area like electronics by yourself because they don't know how to schedule their people. they expect you to watch the area, prevent somebody from stealing, restock and check out customers while you're by yourself"
bad,"Many daily meetings, need to consider work life balance of  their associates. Unreliable for advancement  or longevity. Mangers are in need of management training.  Some manager's have no expierence in people management."
bad,Over worked and underpaid . You have to do several roles and only get paid for one. They dont properly train you. And tell you you only have 2 available shifts take it or leave it.
bad,"They may be required to document sales by creating and updating records of customer profiles. Additional job duties may include greeting customers, stocking shelves, taking inventory, marking price tags, setting up displays, and processing payments."
bad,"Managers will let anything slide. Felt like they played favorites. Would be doing more work, but would get paid close to the same as other people. Was not a fun times"
bad,"I started working a summer ago and I returned to work this summer just to save up so many before moving a couple states away. For a full-time career, I would look for elsewhere."
bad,"good for experience and not much else, customers suck and are usually not the best of characters managers either love you or hate your guts for no particular reason"
bad,Walmart was a a stressful working environment. My store in particular was very under staffed so everyday you could expect to work outside of your job description
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job was using my bilingual skills to help patients get their medications. I learned how to manage my time wisely and in a fast but efficient manner.
bad,"I despised working here. At first it was great but the more I worked the more I hated it. SOME of managers were rude and hateful, while others were very nice. None helped me get a transfer to a closer location. I was driving an hour to work 3 hours a day."
bad,"Management was never around were always hiding out in the office. never were there to help customers or workers when customers were complaining, hated working there"
bad,The job wouldn't be so bad if the management was better (happier and nice) Then they only give you 2- 20 min lunches with over 150+ on a shift and only 10 microwaves by the time you get ready to eat it's time to go back to work.
bad,"Walamrt was a great place to work, and co-workers were very polite and nice. However, in order to advance in Walmart you must be the managers favorite. I went into the job with plans on advancing in the company. I learned you had to be there for six months in order to advance. So, I accepted that, tried to learn as much as I could and work hard every day. Once my six months were up and I had learned most jobs in the store I tried to advance, but others who had been there longer were advancing. I accepted that, kept learning and working hard. Eventually it got to the point after four years that I had more seniority than others advancing.I also knew how to do more jobs, people who were advancing over me would even ask me how to do certain jobs, and that was something I couldn't accept. I loved working there, but my pride was wounded and I felt as if I wasted four years of my life."
bad,"I worked there for about 6-7 months, while I was in high school. They did not have any care for my schedule, placing me to work while I was still in school. 40+ hours a week as a full time student. Great pay though"
bad,"A typical work day here was so intimidating, especially someone who came from Africa and first job in America. Most of the top people were Bosnian who were very much discriminating."
bad,I learned more about decorating cakes and pleasing customers. I loved the work and my customers. It was relaxing and as I said previously said the customers were great and pleased with my work.
bad,I really dont remember it was a lont time ago after i graduated from high school. i was only there for a year and went on leave within that year as well
bad,"I started working at Walmart when I started college to make some money. I was promoted after a year to CSM (Customer Service Manager). If you show your ambition, most likely management will give you an opportunity to advance. Co-workers are typically enjoyable to work with, but many do not take the job seriously. Corporate culture is very lacking within Walmart. Assistant managers are paid a fair salary most of the year, but are forced to work nearly double their required hours regularly, thus lowering the value of their pay. When given the opportunity to become an Assistant Manager, I declined."
bad,"A typical day includes talking with patients, helping them find item or fill their prescriptions. Inputting their scripts, filling, and calling either insurance or doctor office if there are any issues. Cashing customers out. Walmart used to be a great place to work there where family oriented and a fun place to work. Lately they are all about the money and not so much their employees anymore."
bad,walmart was a good experience at the time for me. it is not a place for people with big bills because the pay rate is not high. the people an management were easy to get along with
bad,Hard place to work not very many hours and they work you hard for no reason they will schedule you split shifts even when you ask not to  they require a lot of your time and no real payback
bad,"Overall good job steady work always busy, however the managers and co workers would tend to get to personal. It was a great job, but had the aura of high school drama added to it."
bad,"This job was the most stressful job Ive ever worked, The best part of working with this  company was meeting new people and meeting their requirements."
bad,My experience started out very positive. Then they started cutting hours due to the budget. You never knew from one minute to the next if you were going to have a job. There was never such a thing as a job well done. If you went above and beyond to complete a task or project. There was never a good job. What could you do better the next time if they even noticed
bad,"I believe that this could have a much more fulfilling career if management took a more active interest in the well-being of its associates, and a more active role in training, leading by example, and took time to address concerns instead of trying to take short-cuts."
bad,el trabajo es pesado pero no recompensado con el salario
bad,Cashiering at walmart wasn't an issue at all. management and the rude customers made the job a little bit of a struggle at times. I'd go back though because my experience has geared me to deal with these aforementioned issues.
bad,"the job was good and the people were a pleasure to deal with as they came thru the line.  however, management was continually interfering and adding additional work to the cashier, making it really hard to complete all work."
bad,managers are focused on being friends rather than treating everyone fair/equal. they push away good team players. If you are not in the right click then they will lie so that you cant keep your job or be rehired
bad,The short time I was at Walmart they would understaff and expect one person to do the work of 10. Management was always rude and demeaning to the employees as well.
bad,I had different positions over the years with this company. As a department manager I had to order merchandise. As a stocker I stocked the merchandise on the shelves. I unloaded trucks and worked in the backroom. Customer service was always a part of each position.
bad,bon salaire et belle équipe de travail par contre mauvaise expérience personnelle avec les patrons.
bad,Learned a great wealth of knowledge about what it takes to make your customer's happy. Even the experience was horrid i learned somethin i can use for the rest of my life never again at wal mart
bad,"Walmart continues to look for an identity in it's pursuit to stay relevant.  With all the changes (lay-off's & constant re-org), lack of clear vision, producing quality work is a challenge."
bad,"Management was not very friendly or personable, for example I was in high school and I was scheduled until 2 in the morning also outside of my availability."
bad,"`Management not trained, you get 15 and 20 minute break for a 10hr shift and two 20min breaks for 12hr shift. you get written up if you late"
bad,They are kind but they are quick to accuse without evidence. I enjoyed my job and hanging out with my co workers on breaks and meeting different people but I feel like I wasn’t treated fairly and with reason
bad,They are very lacking in safety. Once you get hurt they out cast you and look to terminate you as soon as possible. You work until work is completed even if you are there 20+ hours and you do not get an extra break
bad,Was not a very likeable place customers as well as the team members and staff were rude and hateful. Hours where given to the more seasoned staff while others had barely any
bad,Terrible with scheduling. I had to call out for school related activities even though I notified management well in advance. I disagree with giving someone an unexcused absence when they have a doctor's note to prove that they or a family member were actually ill.
bad,"I work in deli multi task job attending costumer , frying food , preparing sandwiches attending costumer service you have to be fast weekends are very tired you are always running around to get things done on time"
bad,"I pride myself in providing optimum customer service; however, as a Walmart employee, from Department Managers to Store Manager restrictions of your ability to do what was right for the customer were diminished. "
bad,Walmart is not a company I would recommend anyone to work for due to the lack of respect management has for their employees. Managers treat their employees like something they stepped on.
bad,I have no idea about the work place culture or a typical day because I didn't work here at walmart.  I worked at walgreens drug store. I do not want to do this any more
bad,It had a high demand and expectation to perform duties.  There were many times though that the demands on the employees I felt led towards lower quality levels of work because of the stress and demands placed on the employees.  Quantity became valued more than quality by the employees while employers demanded quality.
bad,"The people there are really nice and easy to get along with.i learned a lot how to stock shelves right, I learned register really easy to learn. The environment is really relaxed."
bad,"There is not much to talk about. I enjoy working with people, and I work hard. Iam looking for a company with advancement. I love to learn new thins and willing to learn form others."
bad,It was not a difficult job. The hours were not very good. 12 hour open availability. I guess for retail that is expected. I did not like certain management. I would prefer to have a manager that does what he asks of you. Many do not.
bad,"Good first job, to go and get the ins and outs of working in a fast paced customer service environment. You definitely learn a lot. I think the pay should be more though for the amount of hours on your feet."
bad,"on paper, Walmart  is a great company to work for. in reality, all members of upper management (regardless of rank) have the latitude to bend and stretch corporate rules and  guidelines beyond any recognition, as long as actions can be justified to be beneficial to the greater good of the company. this results in a lack of continuity of process from one manager to another, from one shift to another, and even from one worker to another. this makes it next to impossible to hold anybody accountable for anything. at the end of the day, most everything gets done only to the extent that upper management keep their jobs when their managers visit, accuracy is of very low importance, and the only thing that matters is that things look good from the outside when Corporate visits. anybody looking for a job that offers stability, structure, discipline, integrity, honesty, ethical procedures  ... this is not the job for you. this is a great part time job for young adults that are free of most financial responsibility and who prioritize social interactions ahead of professional advancement - and for those who don't care where they work at, what they do, or with whom - as long as they have a job ..."
bad,"Not the best place to work, pay was fair, benefits were good but my direct manager and supervisor were not qualified to run a kindergartener's lemonade stand"
bad,"A typical day at work can be long, management needs improvement, need more workers. Not having the help from other coworkers or management. I enjoyed the customers"
bad,From what I'm being told new drivers will not want to work here because of the new pay scale which is below $.40 per mile with the activity pay.  The new guys will have to work a flex schedule and not be guaranteed to work full time.  If your young with a wife and little kids do not work here!
bad,"Management was dismissive"
bad,"In working at Walmart I worked with the public. The most enjoyable portion of my job was working in Layaway and the challenges it provided, especially during the Christmas season."
bad,"As a cap 2 associate I was required to help unload the truck and then stock the shelves. The managers treated my department in particular very badly, they would constantly yell ad scream at us and expect us to a ridiculous amount of work in a little bit of time."
bad,"Management gives you tasks that must be completed. On top of that, you tend to the customers needs. The only day Wal-Mart is closed is Christmas. Black Thursday (cause they no longer do it on Friday) is stupid."
bad,it was ok at first then my store went through management changes.I started a lawn care business which is good in the spring and summer but is rough in the winter
bad,A typical day is very stressful. The managers that the company have brought in does not care about the employees anymore.  The overall company does not care about the employees they only care about numbers now and the environment has changed over the years.
bad,"Contrat de 6 mois pour renovations le magasin devenait un supercentre, belle chimie entre les associés, environnement agréable à travailler."
bad,"It was very obvious you are just a worker, some of the managers are really great but you can tell they are unhappy as well. Horrible pay. Not even living wage."
bad,There is team work in this company. We love to see employees and also customer leave to store happy. Walmart has wonderful benefits to take advange off. They are also flexible with your work  schedule
bad,working for Walmart they don't treat you right its starts from the store manger to his manger they wont to work you very hard and not pay you what's your worth.
bad,"It was not your ideal job . Atypical day would start by getting your cart ready for the floor , cleaning all bathrooms , picking up trash at registers and spot checks down every isle. The hardest part of this job was when the toilets would overflow."
bad,"I miss it sometimes but what can you do? It was hard sometimes especially when I didn't get assistance from the other cart attendants when I really needed it and they fired me because I showed up late too many times after injuring my knee at work in the winter time, I walk to work because I don't have a vehicle and I had a work related injury it was winter and my doctor stated under my work restrictions I was only supposed to be on my injured leg for 4 hours a day Walmart did not take my injury into account when they terminated my employment with them hopefully that doesn't Affect the possibility of employment elsewhere"
bad,They never have enough staff to cover certain areas. Associates have to scramble to cover zones their not familiar with. Walmart have the resources and funds to hire people but they choose not too to save money.
bad,stocking merchandise cashiering I learned how to assist customers managers were great walmarts staff were loving the hardest part about Walmart was lack of help the good days were holidays to see so many people shopping for they're loved ones
bad,walmart is not a great place to work. they do pay more than most grocery stores but thats because no one wants to stay in that corrprit prison. managment
bad,Did not enjoy my time at Walmart. all Positions were way overworked and unappreciated totally. Work load in all departments was not being done by teammates.
bad,"Worked at Walmart in high school and during college. It is what it is an easy job that pays the bills for a student, pay isn't great but that's to be expected."
bad,i liked working there at first but as i started being there for awhile i started realizing that the managers there play favorites and dont treat everyone equally
bad,"It is really messed up that Walmart doesn't accept medical motes. I messed my knee on the job, and I called in two days over my limit due to being in the er cause of my knee. They did take my ortho doctors note, or the ers note about taking me out of work for a couple of days."
bad,Es un buen ambiente de trabajo te enseñan paso a paso y es muy bueno
bad,Customer service oriented. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people that work there. Most deplorable is the work pace and load is very demanding .
bad,"Unloading is a hard postion for the first half of an 8 hour shift you are either in a roasting hot truck trailer or sorting boxes as they come out. "
bad,This place is a garbage dump waiting to be set on fire.  This place will continually ask more of you and still give you less hours than the lazy workers.
bad,"Hard work, terrible management, long hours need I say more. Try to find any reason it seems to write you up. I am glad I no longer work at this warehouse."
bad,"Wal-Mart can be a good place to work, but you have to have the perfect conditions. That would include a good management team. Having a good management team that can keep morale up so the associates are more productive. The changes Wal-Mart makes benefit only financial reasons, while cutting hours for associates but increasing the workload at a very high rate leads to extremely fast turnover. Having a positive impact on your associates can only benefit everyone but Wal-Mart does not promote that."
bad,Peu rémunéré pour le travail à effectuer. Employeur peu soucieux du bien -être des employés.
bad,O took care of the people money and cashed out the meds to people and stocked and they worked with me starting school and they did holidays to and paid vacation
bad,Never enough people to fill all the work. Doing three times your normal job duties. Managers had their favorites whom got to leave work early often. No paid maternity leave.
bad,Working at Walmart has its up and downs. but they are always so nice and well mannered and ready to help with whatever. Hours are long especially if working 3rd shift.
bad,Very stressful upper management do not have concerns for their employees and they constantly treat the hard workers bad. There are great benefits but not sure if the stress is worth it/
bad,"No es una compania recomandable para trabajar, la gerencia suele ser ineficaz y no hay lideres, solo jefes. Exigen demasiado para dar tan poco a los empleados. No respetan al empleado base."
bad,"..........................................lowsey place to work. People aren't friendly and the staff is horrible. Also, they don't care about the customers"
bad,I was a cashier and had many issues regarding scheduling. My manager would schedule me outside of my availability and would often have to lose out on hours because they didnt schedule me properly.
bad,"Great place for teens that are trying to balance school and work, but not for career advancement. Can work with you when it comes to your school schedule."
bad,"Walmart is a good place to work, but it can be stressful and you rarely have people who would work as a team. There's also lack of communication there."
bad,Policies are bs and favor shoplifters. Pretty much hands off and coaching policy is a joke. Coachings should not stay with you for a full year before dropping off.
bad,"Promoción difícil,distancia larga ,mucha presión en la tienda por falta de personal"
bad,"Walmart is not a very flexible and understanding place to work. They will not excuse sickness, death, or family emergencies. Everything counts against you."
bad,"It was always a high paced environment. Customer volume was high, which gave plenty of opportunity for new challenges. Management was always on hand for assistance."
bad,"Besides one manager, management handled the work environment poorly. Many times there would be little to no communication with the workers. I also heard rumors that one member of management was purposefully trying to get employees to quit."
bad,"All of the managers are friends with each other in one huge clique.  I asked for help with something I didnt know about , i usually get ignored. No communication."
bad,"The environment is designed for turnover. Different managers were currently rotated to different departments and always tried things that didn't work. If it's not broken, don't try to fix it."
bad,Managers only seemed to care about the bottom line. Staff didnt seem to matter. Felt like just another peice of equipment. I was given a management postition but the higher level managers went in often and undermined my decisions.
bad,"- on the weekends we would get a rush and wont take our breaks until later than we suppose to "
bad,"Do not work for walmart if you wish to be treated like a human being with some shred of dignity and respect. Understaffing, poor hours, poor pay, terrible leadership."
bad,basically some of the managers act like they are better then you and instead of helping you out they just make you feel bad. also they are sometimes rude to there customers.
bad,"management sucks , but some managers are ok depends on where you work . I worked in 2 walmart . One neighborhood and a super center . My position was meat department . The job itself isn't bad but its really cold"
bad,My department manager was kind enough to always ask her employees for pain killers and proceed to offer them to her employees and walked in on her talking bad and using racial slurs behind my back.
bad,Stressful and fast-paced workplace for me. The training period was brief and I was treated differently from my other coworkers. Lack of understanding and patience regarding my relatively new placement.
bad,Overall good experience. Not good benefits. And could pay a liitle more. Not flexible hours. I just wanted to have a consistent shift. It didnt work with my school hours.
bad,everything about it sucked with the exception of being creative while decorating the cakes. Mangers didn't care about staff hard to get approved time off or switch shifts. hard to get full time status or benefits. they manage your time down the second and will even cut your shift if you go over your scheduled hours for the week and I don't mean overtime. If you were only scheduled 12 hours and you work 13 you can get in trouble.
bad,"I feel that walmart only cares about the upper management and not the actual workers that do all the work, I work so hard and get absolutely no appreciation what soever."
bad,"Typical, walking aroung zoning, working ""operations"", basically its allot of moving boxes, making sure the isles are fine and dandy."
bad,Learned alot about safety and met alot of good friends and learned alot of things from them and how to communicate with customers and to be on time early
bad,Worked here while I was in school.  It helped bring income in while I was in school.  I would recommend this to anyone who is in school and would like an income and no obligations.
bad,"Wal-Mart is an alright job, just not for everybody. Would run a lot smoother with better management. On the bright side, I've made some great friends and met great people working there."
bad,"Walmart allowed me to use my skills as an ACE certified mechanic. I was also able to learn multiple new things that I didn't have experience in before such as, customer service, basic computer skills, etc. The most enjoyable thing about my job was the customer service and being a basic mechanic. I love to work on cars so this was a good job for me. The hardest part of the job was not knowing from day to day if I would have the proper coverage to cover the whole shop. While I enjoy my job, I feel like I am stuck in my position with no advancement. I have applied time and time again for other higher positions to no avail. I want to work somewhere that will allow me the opportunity to advance and further my career."
bad,Make pretty good money working only three days a week but the environment is horrible.  Willing to take a pay cut for a job I can enjoy and not want to kill myself at.
bad,"the place was poorly manage , never got in good contact with manager they always left at 5pm everyday so nobody couldn't get in touch with none of them"
bad,"I despised working in the Walmart Deli. Management was horrible and they would never schedule me any help when I had to close at night, and then they would complain that I was working overtime because I had to get everything done and did not have the time nor means to do so."
bad,My work experience at walmart was average for that line of work. It was hard work with a few breaks. It was not a great workplace due to everyone not working as a team.
bad,I liked being a department manger cause I loved what I did and I took pride in my work and I also liked to manger a little crew of associates.  what I did on a typical work day was I did prices changers and also stocked shelves. the management was alright sometimes. the hardest part of the job was being pressured by management to get work done when they wanted it.
bad,"I did not greatly enjoy my time here. The management was not too caring for the employees, they were quick to assume you were bad, and they often passed all their Sodom to you."
bad,"Manage over 400 employees, work with profit and loss and merchandising daily. Overall great customer interactions. Train you for the position you are in no matter what area or job you take."
bad,"bad management and stressful place to work and also mangers don't care for employees they give up easy and there is a lot of things are not fair at all , also they assign jobs that has nothing to do with you position"
bad,The managers are usually pretty terrible in regards to associate problems. I personally went to a regional manager about a problem 3 times and I was ignored and laughed at. So I left.
bad,"I loved going to work in Virginia (Store 5779) it was nice, everybody was friendly management actually helped you do things. They would genuinely have a conversation with you. It was like they were friends not managers. Which was nice. And then I moved to Oklahoma, and the management basically didn’t know I existed. I worked the garden center in Oklahoma, and my breaks would be hours late even though I would call management and ask for someone to come back so I could have a break. What I mean is my lunch would be scheduled for 5 and my shift would be 1-10. But I wouldn’t get my lunch until 8 o’clock sometimes. That Walmart is the reason I quit. And when I quit they had no idea I was gone, I called in after 2 missed days and they thought I was coming back. Granted I quit after I had called out a Saturday using the Walmart1 app and it never got reported to my store and they thought I no called no showed and discontinued my discount card that day. They never made a phone call to me to see why I didn’t come in or why I didn’t call out. I had no idea the app didn’t notify them as there are glitches in the system sometimes. So basically they had already fired me when I called that day because my card was canceled, and they said “oh we can rehire you!” Some managers just aren’t responsible nor are they caring. If you’re mistreated by management, just leave."
bad,Work place is very fast paste. Must be on your stuff. Walmart is a good place to work when you are at school because they work with your school schedule.
bad,"Walmart does not respect their employees at all.  I was told this before I got a job there, but didn't believe it.  Well, I should have listened.  Only worked here five months, and just could not take the stress anymore.  Respect yourself and get a job some place that will respect you!!  They seem to just use you here, but don't care about your well being."
bad,"I was out of a job and really needed something. I guess that's the benefit of Walmart, is they're always hiring. But still, it's not an easy place to stick around for long."
bad,Wal-mart is good company to work for as long as you have the resources to be to use to get the job done. it can become stressful when you are under staff
bad,"I had always loved going to work, getting to meet bright faces and interact with people. I worked in the bakery department and most especially working on freight. I learned how to decorate cupcakes, bake bread and packaging them. The manager was not cool at all as she did not really care much about how the associates felt. Working is done in a very fast pace and becomes so tough when you have to do the pulls at night, clean up the environment and still leave work on time. On very special occasions work was fun when i had to bake and package bread into bags."
bad,"Where to begin? Well my coworkers were a fun lot. Typically everyone I worked with was easy to get along with. But work was typically an exchange of heaping responsibilities onto each other. "
bad,"Unloading and stocking any and all freight coming in for the day. Managment giving out unrealistic ultimatums, and only a few managers willing to understand the big picture."
bad,"decent place to work, depending on management, other employees will often take pistons where they do not belong. Most management is on different pages with only a certain person knowing the specificity department."
bad,"Retail is a hard thankless job, working here is no different, depends on your boss and the people you work with cant really rate a company like walmart fairly with my experience with them."
bad,"For me it was stress full and had to work many shifts solo assisting a large town population by myself at walmart. I did minor work on phones tvs and various computing devices. When i worked alone i almost alway had lines so had to work quickly to assist everyone, but with a phone activation takes time espicially with tracfone services and just made a stressful job more stressful"
bad,Working at Walmart is a great way to begin your career. A typical day at Walmart consisted of stocking shelves and assisting customers with anything needed anywhere in the building.
bad,"all in all my general review for Walmart as an employee was in all honesty exhausting, for a very unfair wage. my responsibilities in the department include everything from ordering product and supplies, organizing said products and supplies when they would come in, customer service and ensuring customer satisfaction with products questions and concerns. Other responsibilities included making sure shifts were covered and employees were punctual and responsible for shift coverage in the event of and absence."
bad,The managers don't care about the employees. Instead they work you in the ground and you get little to nothing in return. You are forced in on overtime from time to time as well.
bad,"If it weren't for the crappiness of my manager, I would have probably wanted to stay with the company after having my son, but the manager was so rude to mothers and pregnant women it made the idea of coming back way too hard."
bad,"Dispense orders to customers in a timely and organized manner."
bad,not a good job if you want to advance in a career. it was actually a fun environment because you could be with friends as well as get stuff done through out  the day.
bad,Don't even try to get thanksgiving off they will give you points even if you were injured like me and they force you to leave work. I went for an hour and they kicked me out b/c my arm was injured. but even working for the hour I did not receive my discount for the showing up and them forcing me to leave
bad,Managers are unfair and does not treat you with respect they all think for themselves walmart is become more than a work company they are lacking in being there for the associates
bad,"Learned many things at walmart about customer service and how to have everything that the customers were in wanting and needing. Some of the management were great, but then management got switched around and the attitudes and the atmosphere changed. The hardest part of the job was not having enough associates to get the job done. The most enjoyable part was getting to know some of the customers and the people you worked with."
bad,"Fellow employees are great. However, Wal-Mart has high demands with little reward. Difficult to get a day off. Hours vary unless position has a set schedule."
bad,"As an employee of Walmart, I am a manager and see first hand the cut-throat culture of the store. While I do enjoy working with customers and helping others, it has been difficult dealing with others who do not have the same customer-first interest that I do. PTO is a minimum and you are often asked to do more than your role requires."
bad,Get to work and sign in. Gather the needed tools for the work stations. Start working in a station and wait to see if you get moved to another station.
bad,"there isn't much to being a cashier you show up, you clock in you go to your assigned register and you check people until you are released for your break or your shift is up. between customers you are reorganizing candy, cleaning your register and folding cloths."
bad,i worked for the specialty pharmacy dept where i dealt with various customer questions and concerns fast paced knowledge of product and good communication skills required
bad,Walmart might be a good place to work if they made more positive decisions regarding their employees it seems like they do but do not. Need to use more common sense and logic not worry about their foreign relations.
bad,Empresa de metalurjica especializada em perfis de aluminio.
bad,this was a temp job for extra income. cashier helping customers with purchases and returns and locating items in store and cleaning area on floor and cash registers.
bad,Wal-mart pharmacy is a typical retail pharmacy environment. It is actually quite similar to any other retail pharmacy experience from any of the competitors.
bad,The job was working in the deli. It was both fast paced and slow passed. It all depended on the time of the day. You really need to be aware of your surroundings or you may loose a finger.
bad,Unfortunately I did not have a good experience at this job. The management was very inconsistent and it left me having to figure out which managers wanted me to act in what ways. Then they would all leave while I have 2 hours left scheduled which put me in a position to need to find things to do or bother night staff. Not very efficient scheduling or operations.  Could be different at other stores.
bad,Was a good job. Just had a lot of issues was there for a short Time due to health issues. The doctors took me out of work til after my surgery and Walmart wanted me to go back the day of my surgery.
bad,It was a fun job at times. They did not train you probably at times. I started to work there on black friday. They said work and threw you out there. The bakery was a better environment.
bad,This job allows you to learn new things throughout the company. I started from being brand new to the company and was very nervous to start in my store. Thankfully the management team took the time out daily to help get me comfortable with my daily tasks.
bad,Wal-Mart is a place where you don't get much down time you are always busy and always have something to do. There is always issues to resolve and try to make systems and every day work easier for you and co workers
bad,Walmart is an alright place. May have to deal with many rude customers and managers may not always be the best to work with but they pay well and give lots of hours if needed.
bad,"walmart market I was working in the fruit and vegetables department & tyson foods Meat Factory In the section of shredding, canning and packing of meat and the order section"
bad,"Management does not value their employees or there work efforts.  Again, working with a Spanish speaking culture was very difficult.  Didn't speak complete English sentences.  Management wasn't available if you needed help or in answering questions.  They were going in ten different directions.  Lazy, overweight staff who were very slow in getting the necessary supplies when I needed them.  Management didn't tackle the important issues or in settle disputes between co-workers.  Like I said BS management.  Only tackled the petty issues that didn't relate to the job operations.  HR was very rude and unhelpful and lazy.  Spanish culture didn't know how to mind their own business when it came to minding your own job."
bad,"Unless you are trying to work your way up into management, Walmart is not the best place to work. I made a few friends but the pay was low and the management team was disorganized."
bad,"Management make you feel like you are undeserving to even be in their presence. It was miserable. You are treated like you can be thrown out and replaced in a second. If you have an emergency outside of work, you might as well quit then because it is likely that they will fire you if you have to leave anyway."
bad,"I was unhappy working at Walmart.  Pay was too low.  The managers were decent people.  But pushing shopping carts was too much, especially when holidays came along."
bad,"I think Walmart, well the one i worked in was ok. The mangers could have been a little better in the way they treated people. and they could have authorized more overtime, but all in all it was ok."
bad,"The company as a whole is rather is big on cutting the hours of any employee that does not work at a store that is considered a ""Super Center"". Some of the major problems at the store was the lack of proper tools to do the job."
bad,I stocked and restocked shelves in the grocery department. learned how to inventory and properly account for items in the store. I also learned how to work in multiple areas of the store and perform multiple tasks that were not listed in my job description. The best part of the job was meeting new people. The hardest part would have been the long hours for minimal pay.
bad,Good until manager gets angry for no reason. The people are good. Work experice was alright. Manager doesn't do anything. You cant help people if they injure themselves at work.
bad,Working as a cashier at Walmart is as you may expect. you need to be a friendly person and a quick worker to be a good cashier though. It is hard to get those type of people.
bad,I liked working at walmart except peoples there weren't really that nice. They were mean and exepected you to pick up after peoples mistakes. They had good benefits but it just wasn't for me. I ended up moving to a different city
bad,"My experience here was overall good. I had no problems with coworkers or management. My personal reason for leaving where I worked when I did was the reason I cannot apply with the company again, and I wish that was different. I would work there again if I could apply at my area Walmart."
bad,"Management was very unfair and poor. Team was always arguing, amazing anything got done. No direction, no teamwork. Was not a fun place to work at. Do not recommend at all."
bad,Walmart is a fast pace working environment. With great benefits but there are many downfalls for working for the company. management needs work on being more helpful and supportive.
bad,"Alway have people calling off so we would be given 4 times more work and be the only one doing everything, and at the same time having customers make you grab what they need and get angry when there isnt anything in the back that they needed. The management was very unprofessional and picked favorites to just sit and do nothing and expected too much"
bad,"inventory control lead with team of 6 keeping track of inventory and product availability "
bad,Everyday job with everyday supplies rolling into the store. Management was poor in communication and always changing persons in charge. Hardest part of the job was time management on activities getting done.
bad,"Great Job But Hours Not Worth The Pay.This Company Starts at $9.00 per hour with Bi Weekly Pay. Downside, If You Need to Adjust Your Hours or Availability, It is Difficult."
bad,"Its always so messy, there staff is never friendly. I know that they had bad reviews from all over. They dont treat there employees with respect like they way they should!"
bad,not sure why I have to write a review for all of my jobs. I was 17 when I had this job so I didn't make the most of it. Walmart sucks tho not much you can do to make it better
bad,it gave me a learning experience but not much room for advancement. most people you work with are great but some that I worked with did not know how to treat their employees
bad,"DBP oderfiller, Scan the box with a scanner gun whatever the number the ask for is how much you have to pull out of the box to fill that store. alot of turning and bending."
bad,That a tough one not sure theirs enough room to right about it so I'm not going to say anything here it a so so place to work if you like hearing coworkers have  blank relations in the bathroom
bad,"Wal-Mart is a corporate empire that Sam Walton created as a ""one stop shop"" and has slowly been going down after his death. becoming more about making money then about the associates. Sam believed in treating your associates well so they perform well. Now the associates are in the hands of the people, and sometimes people are wrong.  I would definitely not recommend working for this company, but it does have room for newcomers to go up into management and offers a safe and healthy workplace."
bad,Good to work for when your just trying to make money. Not a great career field unless you are in management and Human Resources. It is a very physical demanding job.
bad,The company was an okay place to work. It was a starting point to my career. I do not remember anything else as this program is making write a review of ancient history.
bad,"While working at Walmart I felt as though I was in high school again. Management had their favorites and everyone knew who those were and it felt as though when you did your job you got to do everyone else's as well, and if you did your job well you got a bulls eye on your back. Just my personal experience."
bad,"Liked the work, never dull. Gave me lots of work experience. It taught me to be flexible, reliable and dependable. I enjoyed my co-workers and team members. Really liked that it was so close to home."
bad,Unloading boxes all day in a small cramped storage room gets difficult especially when there is no room to haul pallets. Management stops by to observe from time to time.
bad,The job part of it was super easy. The management part was the hard part. Not 1 manager was on the same page at all during any given day which made communication hard because as an unloader we didn't always know what we would be doing.
bad,Working for this company has been a learning experience for me. One of the most important things that it tought me was the value of team work. I now understand that by dividing task among fellow coworkers can lead to a more productive and enjoyable day at the work site.
bad,"If you expect to be challenged daily under, most times, very difficult situations, then this is the company to work for. You will learn and what you learn will be applied."
bad,"My day at Walmart starts around 6:45 in the morning I bounce around from two main departments both of those being main services for customers, not only do I have to greet, check out customers I also have to make sure every isle is zoned and I am working returns and freight. On any given day I will have 4 different managers telling me what I need to do including my main manager and my department manager. It's a lot to handle all at once. I learned to do what I can and do my best. Managment is the worst thing about Walmart because there is no communication so you have like 4 other managers telling you what to do. Most enjoyable thing about my job is meeting and talking with the customers"
bad,I worked full time sometimes over time I was in the remodel part of Walmart so we always dealt with angry customers it was our job to redirect customers and make Walmart look good as new .
bad,"Typical day at work from start to finish during a 9-hr work day. I come in at my scheduled time and sign out keys for the jewelry counter via an assistant manager. I then get a till for the jewelry counter register from the cash office, and take it to jewelry to be put into the register so I can cash out any customers right from the counter. I then work in the shoes department, which is also part of being a jewelry associate and spend most of my time doing reverse picks in the backroom, cleaning up the shoes, placing overstock back into the backroom, and putting out pallets of freight that the overnight team leaves us. I usually am only over at the jewelry counter when a customer needs assistance there, such as for getting a case open so they can look at the jewelry or try it on before deciding to buy it/changing out watch batteries and watch bands for customers, or when I am scanning in jewelry freight, which I then put away, and place any overstock in our locked cases. Normally, we are short staffed, so I have to cover all breaks and lunches at the fitting room area where all incoming calls are received, while also going back and forth from the fitting room to the jewelry counter to help any customers that may come during that time. I also have to help the customers on the phones when after getting transferred that department doesn't pick up their phone call because they have either already left for the day, or they don't have any coverage in that area while they are on breaks. I then go to that section of the store to find whatever item the customer on the phone might be"
bad,"Honestly Walmart was probably the complete worst place i have ever worked for with poor management. When i say that i don't just mean communication i mean in an overall aspect like scheduling, management skills, and professionalism."
bad,"As a place with potential to grow, I personally feel like you have to go beyond excellent work habits just to advance or even get appreciation. In that particular business, if you do not worship the ground that higher management walks on then they will try to walk all over you great work habits by nick picking and backstabbing for no apparent reasons."
bad,"Pay is decent, work is hard. There is no air conditioning, except for managers. Workers are constantly complaining and angry. Majority of managers seem like they only want to get people in trouble."
bad,"Some of the management team will talk about you behind your back, and promise you positions and you will never get them.stressful, favoritism,you had some people who would work hard everyday, and some who just sat around wanting you to do everything.work overload"
bad,Some customers would nice and then you would have some that were very mean and call you names and throw stuff at you if they didn't get there way so they would yell and ask to speak to management then when they would talk to management they would get there way and always get what they want. They would look at you like ha ha I got my way
bad,I worked on the floor folding/stocking/restocking all day long. Great coworkers and poor management plus there skills. Poor workplace culture and the hardest part of the day was closing time it was rush rush rush to finish your work on time
bad,Walmart is a place where they don't really care about you. They don't have a say in anything because if you are not in management your opinion doesn't matter one bit.
bad,. The most part that I enjoyed was learning new things. I loved working customer service even though there were rude people. I have more patience than some people when it comes to working with the public. Management never had our backs when it came to rude customers or customers that got in our face.
bad,"A typical day at work would be helping carry bags and assisting customers with putting bags in their cars, especially heavy sutff like furniture. Also clearing parking lot of shopping carts."
bad,"rude customers"
bad,"Like any big chain store it focuses more on the bottom dollar than anything else. If you are hourly be expected to never get over time, but if you are salaried expect to get work absurd hours. They have increased the rate of pay recently, but doesn't really cover the amount of holidays you are required to work."
bad,very busy with no workers schedule cut hours after schedule is made and management never come talk to the customers...hard part of the job is the customer have to wait on management at least 20 minutes
bad,"es una empresa muy importante globalmente, sin embargo no ofrece  oportunidades equitativas a los empleados, es decir es una empresa muy grande pero con muy bajos salarios y beneficios para os trabajadores."
bad,Worked long hard hours in this company. As an unloader you are still required to do many things outside of your job description. Discount isn't that good either
bad,This job could be very stressful depending on the manger and the coworkers around you. They have good perks of this job but yet they also have plenty falls.
bad,"Salary Management was all over the place, contradicting each other. The hourly supervisors and managers were the best supervisors and managers you could have at that job because they knew what they were doing."
bad,The job was ok for the most part. I didn't like the fact I had been there for 3 years & new workers came in getting the same pay I did. My only problem with management was their people skills (learn how to talk to your workers).
bad,"Hectic at times with little help. Long lines, standing on your feet all day. Breaks are never on time. Would check people out, stocked inventory, handled cash."
bad,Really a fast pace type environment you have to go with the flow they do play mysic to help you get through the day but as long as everything is going good your day will go great.
bad,"The job was itself was good but i eventually had to quit because of management. The coworkers were upset all the time and it reflected on their work, and the management never said so much as thank you."
bad,"They are good with job placement and advancements.  But, they kind of think that they should be more important to you then, your wife, children, and etc."
bad,"I would get scheduled on days that I was suppose to be in school ( which they were aware of ). I got overworked with no recognition of my hard work. However, most of my co-workers & supervisors were very friendly."
bad,This job isn't for the light hearted. You deal with rude and messy people. Managers can be jerks as well. Never had any issues with my employees. It was a decent job but I wouldn't go back to it
bad,"Would be asked to work over 8hrs and then would have to take a 2hr lunch the next day to take off that time instead of getting paid for the extra hours worked. Would be scheduled to work until 10pm and then back in at 2am the next morning. My schedule was changed daily on me, was changed without being told and then sent home because I showed up for my original schedule not the one I never made aware of. No communication between management and employees in the department."
bad,"When I worked at Wal-Mart, the company was trying to figure out how few employees it could have and still be able to run. It was a very stressful experience that I would not recommend to anyone else."
bad,People who work here only do it for the paycheck. Good people just trying to make a living. Management is screwed up bad. Would not recommend working here.
bad,I had to visit the ER late one night with a temperature of 104 degrees F. I was required to take very high doses of Tylenol and Ibuprofen to maintain said fever. Upon returning the company refused my doctor's note and other paperwork.
bad,Not a lot of space to move around when filling orders. Many people run into things or they can't get the percentage they need because of other people being in there way
bad,Working at Walmart was a memorable experience for me both good and bad. You can have a good time or tough time working here depending on your position. I think employees here a under paid however which was the cause of me leaving for another job.
bad,It was super easy to work there although you get extremely bored just walking through the same aisles all day. Every once in a while you had to do freight which wasn't bad
bad,In all honesty I wasn't happy I told them where I would best fit in and they never considered me to work in that department.  Instead they had me in an area I knew nothing about.
bad,Walmart taught me how to work under pressure while surrounded by hundreds of people. I learned how to multi task and handle customer complaints on my own.
bad,Hard work. Strict numbers to hit or you will get written up. Schedule is nice if you have other responsibilities. Perfect weekend shift for students. Good management for the most part.
bad,"To few people with too much restocking to do. Most times there's not enough hours during the shift to restock, clean up and fulfill other duties, so you get reprimanded."
bad,Didn't really enjoy walmart as much as I thought I would a lot of things we had to do that wasn't in the job descriptions and the pay was less than what I was hoping the employees were pretty fair some rude people a little thay worked there management wasn't on top of some employees
bad,"Day to day I worked as a cashier. I learned about customer service, returns and exchanges. I learned cash flow management processes as well throughout my time there."
bad,I did over-night stocking. Was new for me having to get used to my schedule change. Over-all management was unprofessional and really didn't appreciate their hard working employees.
bad,learned how to positively communicate and assist customers while working and helping them shop around the store. learned how to stock properly in the store
bad,"With Walmart being such a large corporation- job security is there as long as you work your job.  Promotions and climbing the ladder gives you ambition to keep pushing forward- but the higher you get into the company it becomes politics and not on whether you are deserving.  Hours are long and demanding taking you away from the family.  System scheduling leaves a lot of associates with no hours to make ends meat.  Notes continue to pile on from the Visiting Market levels and expected to get complete with nothing but a skeleton crew.  Associates lean on one another like family, however"
bad,I would get the at 10'oclock to clock in then we would all meet to know where we would be stocking. Most of the time we would have a lot to stock because everyone shops at Walmart. Sometimes whenever I finished early I would go back to the receiver area where I would help unload new shipments off the truck. It was fun meeting new people and mingling with customers
bad,Walmart is an okay place to work if you like staying busy. I would consider working here again but in a different capacity than as an overnight stocker.
bad,"Walmart wasn't that bad. During season hours are amazing. However , when its over hours drop drastically. I like the two 15 min breaks and hour lunch."
bad,Wanted your best from you but never willing to give you any compensation for it. You work hard just for it to be brushed under the rug or not acknowledged. Work all holidays except christmas.
bad,"A typical day is just cooking , cleaning and Customer service basically . I learned to Write down or record when speaking to a manager because they tend to lie and not keep their word . My Manager was rude and nonchalant about everything . The culture at Walmart I'm not sure honestly . Hardest part of my job was when I was pregnant and  I had to close by myself almost every shift  everyone was lazy. And the Most enjoyable part of my job was that they actually raised my pay from 10 dollars an hour to 11."
bad,Walmart is like a factory.. they get you in and out as soon as possible. They have so many employees that they have no personal respect for any of them.
bad,"The job was very laid back, i worked as a cashier and self checkout employee, i learned how to interact with others due to the fact that i was assisting customers throughout the day."
bad,You learn how to deal with customers and try to make your area as good as possible with the time limit you are given. Hardest part is trying to get all the work done in an 8 hour period.
bad,"Often mis-managed, hours are cut too often. Full time employees should receive at least thirty two hours per week and often do not. It claims to be a family business but seemingly could care less about your family."
bad,"A typical day at Wal*Mart was fast paced, stocking isles by the counter, running cash register, helping customers, and zoning your area. I learned how to deal with customer, how to use a cash register, and how to work at a fast paced level. Management was decent, some better than others. The work place wasn't anything like I thought, lots of rude individuals, weren't nice about sick days, complained when help was needed. Overall the job was easy."
bad,"It was okay at first, but then i started working 12 hour shifts and and having to close due to so many call outs. Missed out on a couple of breaks and the managers were rude."
bad,"At 20$/hr the warehouse position is pretty good."
bad,"There is a reason they are the top retailer in the world, it's not because they care about the people working for them. The job is fine if you need money."
bad,Very Busy at all times.  Not being able to sit for long periods of time could be hard on some.  Never felt like part of a team.  Ok benefits.  must enjoy working with public.
bad,Walmart is a great place to work for if you got people that want to tell you what to do instead of asking or actually not asking if they just tell you what to do it's a good company if everybody works together but it's some of the stores they don't thank you.
bad,"great place!key duties undertaken by Walmart cashiers upon hire concern various aspects of customer service. Primary roles include scanning coupons, applying discounts, processing payments, and ringing up sales on computerized cash registers. Cashiers also take responsibility for handling returns and answering questions about merchandise, store policies, and ongoing promotions. The job features part-time hours at start, with options for full-time schedules or promotion into managerial careers with experience. Work environments include checkout aisles at store frontends. Cashiers sometimes assist sales and stock associates with remedial tasks during slow hours."
bad,"Never shop there and see a smile on any associates face,customer service is obsolete. It's really a shame, had fun working there back then. I really enjoy the customers."
bad,"Bad Mangement, Bad communication over worked and under payed to many lazy people and unprofessional ways how workers treat people and merchandise, bad job"
bad,Walmart is not competitive and stuck in their own ways and will never make a change in pay or the way they treat their employees. This is unfortunate due to the competitive nature of companies that are like Walmart.
bad,not good do not work there. they want you to work 90% of the frate that come in but only give u $10 a hour an get mad when u dont get eveything done. they give u 5 people for a 15 people job very crazy
bad,"Iam enjoying the work place, management has supported like a friend... Good relationship maintain in workplace....and one to one & skip level meetings conducting every month to know our performance and our know to co-workers performance..."
bad,Not a fun or engaging place to work if that is what you are looking for. Definitely not a place for college students looking for a summer job. You will want to quit every day.
bad,"The overall experience wasn't bad, It's just not a store that I want to work for in the long run. They pay pretty well I must say, but it doesn't give me the vibe of hey! I work here and I'm proud to be an employee here. It was more of a cold, I'm only here for the money, let me do my work and get out environment. I'm looking for something more, some place I can say ""hey, I'm an employee here, and I'm proud of that."
bad,"A typical work day for me was very long, productive, and extremely fast paced.  I learned a lot about my personality, patience, and I improved a lot on my customer service skills."
bad,"Able to do, anything needed in the store. Worked in almost every area of the store as needed. Learned how to do inventory, down stocking, product fulfillment, Online fulfillment, Register maintenance, Accounting, Interviewing, Training, Stocking Shelves, Using Handheld Inventory scanners. Just about everything you needed to do."
bad,if your retired and just want extra income this is for you unless you become a manager of some sort its not a career for anyone with bills or a family
bad,"It really depends on what manager is there. Typical day at work consist of putting back reshop, doing modules, ringing up customers. I enjoyed the job and my managers."
bad,Walmart is a nice place to work.  You get to meet a variety of people.  You can work in many different sections.  There are always those busy times where you can get hours.
bad,"One of the best paying jobs I ever had. Worked as a selector rigorous work, but it was worth the pay. Great Pay, but cut dry work environment. Wouldn't turn no one from the job."
bad,It was ok working for Walmart for the time being however managers there had alot of favoritism with only certain amount of employees. And when you had an issue they like sweeping it under rug.
bad,Management often times sent you to other departments and set goals that were not likely to be achieved and complained when they werent accomplished. Especially pulling people who had no experience unloading trucks from the front to the back and complaining about the time it took to learn where to put items.
bad,I worked the night shift 10-8. There was no training and on my first night I did not even know I needed one of those scanner guns to stock inventory. Management basically just told you to work faster and were non existent unless you messed something up.
bad,It is a foot in the door job with much high turnover.  You are not allowed overtime at all and you deal with annoying customers that cannot get out of the way when you are cleaning up a spill.  Customers are not cognizant of employees at all.
bad,"This is a great place to work if one chooses to employ themselves in the customer service realm. I do not approve of many of management's practices, or the seemingly arbitrary schedules. Flexibility in an employee is great. It is not so fitting in managerial orders."
bad,"walmart might be an ok place to work for a first job but other than that walmart is not a place id work again or recommend to a friend, walmart overall is a awful place to work"
bad,Manager are not very bright. Stuff gets swept under the rag. You get blamed for everything even if you didn't do it. They never have enough people on to do the work.
bad,"I did not enjoy walmart. The people that worked at my facility were hostile. The managers were lazy, rude and disrespectful. I am glad i left walmart."
bad,You had way to many higher ups and when one of them told you to do something another one told you to do the opposite. The work environment was just so dull I didn't enjoy it.
bad,"Busy, Fast-Paced, Customer Service Based, Thinking on Your Feet, the hardest part of my position has to be Upset Customers, Most enjoyable part of the job has to be knowing my Customers leave the auto shop happy with the service they received."
bad,"Walmart does not appreciate its workers and there is no support for managers. If you have any ambition at all, avoid this place. Supervisors are treated no better than glorified associates."
bad,Zero Heart in working here.  Management doesn't take care of things until they are in trouble.  The expectations are unrealistic and management is borderline abusive.  Favoritism runs deep.
bad,Never really get a consistant shift. Work all kinds of hours between 7am-11pm. Get an hour lunch for over 6 hour shift. Two fifteen minute breaks depending on your shift. Work weekends and holidays usually. You are often pulled to another department to help. Often doing jobs you are not trained in or paid the rate for that department.
bad,great place to learn and grow into a human being that will be successful in the workplace and grow into a healthy person in society as well as help others.
bad,It was a cool job management was not good at all rushing to put pallets out did not enjoy at all .... pay was ok but wanted to much outta u...just always looking for some better
bad,Let go over something small but everyone in the store does it and still does. Need to hire me back and I would like to be rehired I did enjoy here pays well
bad,"i love working at this company , the people there were very friendly and polite to me , all smile everyday, i enjoy going to work to see and meet people and be helpful and to learn."
bad,"production is a must, you will get wrote for everything even if your right r wrong. very stress hardworking no sitting down everyone trying to tell you what to do. I wouldn't recommend anyone from my point of view."
bad,I didnt mind working nights but with 2 kids it was some what rough. The work was easy. I met some cool people. The long nights make for long days without much sleep.
bad,"I worked at Walmart for 3 years ,and enjoyed the people I worked with. I received a lot of hours, but it was difficult to get time off. I have a son and he got sick at one point where I needed to leave work and I was told I could leave but I better be in the next day...no excuses. They also were unable to work around my school schedule and that ended up being the reason I left. After leaving I couldn't understand why I stayed employed with them so long."
bad,"Walmart is not easy. As a CSM, you are required to basically do the jobs of the Assistant Managers and the Cashiers without being properly compensated."
bad,Was a overall good experience for a first job. A typical work day can be hectic but with good people skills and being able to work well with others the day goes by smoothly with no problems. Learned great costumer service skills & how to deal with difficult situations in a professional manner.
bad,"Management doesn't care whatsoever about the employees, not about their needs or the problems that they are having. They will terminate anyone for the smallest thing."
bad,"Walmart is not a bad company to work for, but the problem is with working there are the people running the store, you have several managers who flat out do not know what they are doing."
bad,Its not a bad job good pay but i couldnt make a career out of it i didnt think so but the money was real good but i would work there again maybe if i was doing someting else.
bad,busy mostly just care about money not emplyees. the most  enjoyable part of the day was going home. I loved my job but hated the management  they make everything harder
bad,"I liked working for the company for awhile but after being there for over a year I got tired of always being put in one area, and I got let go unfair."
bad,it was pretty good busy all the time but was not the most organized place though and stuff everywhere and was very dirty and staff was not willing to help with things
bad,"I started in the Dairy Department stocking shelves, unloading trucks, rotating product, and helping customers. After 1 year I moved to the Electronics Department where I helped customers apply for credit cards, sold contract cell phones, hosted events, set up displays, stocked shelves, unloaded freight, price changed, and assisted customers with home electronics issues."
bad,"Working for Walmart as a cashier is not the best job to go to. They expect you a lot from you with very little pay. You have to deal with all types of customers for which you have to have a lot of patience. Unlike other jobs, in order to get your raise you need to finish a program called ""pathways"" which they hardly ever let me go do due to the fact that they always wanted me in front. Good job to start off with and get experience but not to stay there for very long."
bad,"Fast paced, easy job. "
bad,"all i can say about walmart. is that they pay ok , but for the work and time you put in. its definitely not worth it. but when you have a family that you have to provide for then we do what we have to do."
bad,"do too much work at 10 a hour, its really a mans job, too hot in the backroom, good benefits within the job, nice people, i dont recommend this job for women"
bad,"I went from cashier, to customer service manager, to cashier office worker.  I always took a position to increase my pay.  I like to learn and I ask lots of questions."
bad,manager don't how run to a store they let the customer mess up the store they let them open packages throw stuff on floor they don't have enough help for the store to run 24 hours a day
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the other associates.  I had many years with this company and it truly does become your second family.  The hardest part of the job was the high expectations with never enough staffing to do the job to the standards that were expected
bad,"I only recommend working at wal mart if you're looking for a first job or as a last resort. Most of the people you work with at Wal Mart will not care about the job, making work a terrible experience. Expect to be busy constantly from clock in to clock out."
bad,It was fun being under the hood. But management was poor. I didn't feel welcomed and listened to at this job. I worked very hard and was very quick at my job but I always got stuck with not so enjoyable parts of the job.
bad,Hated working here. Management was rude. If you ever expressed interest in growing at this location you had no opportunity. Only good part was getting to meet different people every day.
bad,"I have no comment in regards to this job some things are better left unsaid, because if tend to speak on those things that occurred at the job no one would be employed but I will say a bad manger can make...."
bad,"The work here was an ok experience. i did not feel valued, though. You can only get benefits if you work full time and it is really hard to get full time status.I would not work here again."
bad,they were pretty decent in getting back to me in a timely manner. They did give hours when you needed it. They do have a low pay but they are friendly positive and its a fast paced environment.
bad,"You had to go to whatever that job send you to for that day and it was just a temporary jobs.  The associates that's there are very nice, helpful, and respectable."
bad,A very good job to have while in school. their a very reasonable job they hired right away before I left to college.  Walmart showed me how to be a people person.
bad,"If you can avoid being a janitor at wal*mart, do so at all costs. The customers have no respect for the store or your actively cleaning it and will constantly interfere with your work, while creating new problems that will require your attention as well."
bad,"Great job to have as a career, wonderful co workers, lots of opportunity involved with the job I enjoy the pace the environment, I would love to work for this company again"
bad,"my typical day of wok involves helping my cashiers as well as customers with price checks, key turns, and money if register is low."
bad,"Wal-Mart asked a lot of its employees for little. They provided training, but never offered compensation for new skills acquired. And, on more than one occasion they've hired new employees at the same pay rate as veteran associates, with the aforementioned training. They're also too willing to give associates management responsibilities without promoting them to management. Needless to say, work morale isn't the greatest."
bad,"A very fun place to work keep u busy at all times very helpful,management team sometimes ok ,always get a lot of hours ,but sometimes have to work 4 in 1/2 hrs"
bad,This Walmart is completely understaffed they over work there best workers the work schedule always changes so you have to check everyday so you don't miss a day
bad,It wasn't a great workplace or experience. Out with the old in with the new. The regional manager made a great choice by replacing the old store manager and most of the supervisors/ department managers.
bad,I worked this job when I was 18 and I found that the customers were very rude and that made it hard to want to do my job. All in all it was not a great work environment.
bad,Overall the job itself was easy but the managers were not professional.  Associates were not treated fairly and lots of favoritism went on there.  The managers push associates and don't offer to help them because they don't even know the job duties.
bad,working here was fun but not for an adult with bills you don't get enough hours nor are there any benefits. if you work night shift be prepared to stock
bad,"Manager was very nice he always answered any questions that I asked "
bad,Working at Walmart is just like anyone would think. Anyone that has dealt with the public knows that it is a difficult job. It would seem that Walmart's customers are more likely to be in a bad mood and treat the employees badly. It wasn't Walmart that was hard to work for it was Walmart's clientele that was hard to work for.
bad,I helped maintain inventory for all departments.  The IT team would stock all departments in the store.  We also worked in the back loading freight for all departments.
bad,"I worked ten our shifts when on minimum wage. I had the title of cashier, but did everyone's job. I pushed carts, stocked, cleaned the store, ran deli, and kept inventory of cash when we closed the self checkouts at night. I also worked at Wal-Mart before the labor union and they raised their base pay to $10.00."
bad,It was different. The managers were very understanding and some were very helpful others were not. I ended up moving to a different area of the state so I had to end my employment there. the experience wasn't bad.
bad,"Benefits are below expectations"
bad,"If they knew how to treat their employees they wouldn't have a high turnover rate and if their assistant managers knew how to not date the employees it would be an ok place to work but I do know that at Marion, Il Walmart they don't know how too"
bad,"Opening Greeting clients, preparing paper and computer files for clients. "
bad,"The hardest part is trying to communicate with your team, who does not respond in a timely manner. I learned that all it is that management do is absolutely nothing, making your job 20x harder. The enjoyable part is counting money and creating special bonds with other co-workers."
bad,"I did not feel important as an employee there. My managers refused to comply with my schedule needs for school, and my obligations to my family forcing me to miss days I could have worked had they made the schedule correctly. It was impossible to find a manger when I needed help. They are notoriously under staffed. Mandatory to work on Thanksgiving, and Christmas Eve. It just didn't feel like they cared about their employees at all."
bad,"I punch in, walk up front to get keys for unlocking game cabinets etc. I count my register and start working on price changes and critical picks. I zoned all areas that need it and start to put out stock from the critical picks. Around mid morning we start putting out stock from the warehouse and from directs.  While doing all this, I help as many customers that need it. I have lots of retail experience and telson gun knowledge. I work hard everyday and enjoy keeping busy."
bad,"enjoyed helping my customers"
bad,Overall environment is unpleasant. There is zero employee appreciation. Work assignments are generally clear and be able to be accomplished. Opportunities available.
bad,"It was busy, you are able to meet a lot of people. I learned a lot about customer service. Management was busy. It was a diverse community. The most difficult part of the job was selling tobacco and alcohol and dealing with customers that did not want to be carded. The most enjoyable part of the day was quitting time."
bad,"Management does not address the issues I present to them in an appropriate manner."
bad,"You cannot depend on them to make a living.They served me well for about the first six months.  After that, I couldn't get enough hours to live on.  It was that way store wide."
bad,I didn't like working for Wal-Mart at all because of the other employees. The employees did not train you the way you would be trained. They also did not show any compassion when you asked for help.
bad,"I would greet customers with a smile, asked if they needed any help. Did returnes and helped customers there with any questions. Encouraged them to return to our store, asked if they had any more questions that I could help them with."
bad,"Basic cashier duties.  Customer service.  The hardest part of the job is 33 hours or less is considered part time.  34+ hours is considered full time.  If you ask for part time, they will make you work 30-33hours a week.  They wouldn't give me less hours either.  I was a student and stay at home mom at the time."
bad,I stocked dairy products..  Hours of work very..  Every two weeks I made 375$..  Wasn't getting enough hours in..  The managers were rude..  You have to pick up the slack from other people who didn't do the work ..  To make time go by talk to all the customers that were looking for things
bad,"Store was not a great place to work. Worked my 40 hours, would go in on days off when needed, and still couldn't work with my school schedule. Management was unattentive, couldn't even reach my manager to put in my two weeks. Completely disorganized."
bad,"The hardest part of working at Walmart was learning to deal with the rude and impatient customers with a happy face. My typical day there was pretty easy, when I first started I was a cashier but after some time I wanted to be a stockman."
bad,"Walmart has issues specifically with any sort of compensation program to reward good work versus bad work. It has a rigid bureaucracy, and can often be unfair for the long time employee.  This being said I believe it a good choice for young people looking to get out of fast food, and on to better things. there are enough positions in the store to gain some much needed experience."
bad,"My shifts at Walmart typically consisted of determining which items needed to be stocked, and retrieving them from the backroom. Another major aspect of my job was zoning the shelves, which meant that I would pull items to the front of the shelves so they would appear fully stocked. I generally had little direct supervision and would often not be given a specific task to do when I arrived at work, but I did not take that as an excuse to be lazy, and would diligently do my job until my shift was over."
bad,"walmrt is a great company to work for, they offer great benifets and pay is okay. the most enjoyable part of my job was my assocaties i had."
bad,"Overloaded work with to many supervisors "
bad,Amazon was and easy job. You walked the floors pushing a cart around to put the items in a slot. Then when the items had been ordered you would have a list of items and you would go back to pick them up to be sent to the buyers
bad,"The customers were rushed, the company has a high turn over rate for a reason. Sometimes people need the job but no-one wants to stay."
bad,All way's know what you are going to do before you even start you're day off. Worked with a few people that really didn't know what they was doing in point of the job that they was told to do and just need a bit more training then what they.
bad,It was a great atmosphere. The only issue was management was very good at picking favorites over the time that i was there. Hardest part of the job was doing 10 hours of freight in 7 hours. Most enjoyable was the people i work for
bad,Walmart is a busy environment.  The most enjoyable part of the job the new kind of inventory that came in everyday.  I learn the important of rotating stock. The training that was provide was helpful.
bad,managers are very opinionated and unfair. store owner has a vulnerable temper and assistant managers are rude. worked there and i left because it was very unfair management.
bad,"Keep up expectations, Learned how to manage 30 cashiers, goof workplace lots of exciting customers some good some bad. Hardest part of the job is walking back and forth for 8 hours of the day. Most enjoyable part is knowing every task is complete for the day that was assigned to you."
bad,"Unpleasant environment, horrible customers attitudes, managers were rude and disrespectful. Hours were low and to much authority for one section never knew what to do."
bad,"Honestly it's okay to start off your career with. The typical day covers customer service, cashier duties, sales floor, cleaning, stocking, and well literally everything. They expect you to learn and do everything. The atmosphere is really negative where the older people are constantly in fear of being fired so they take all the burden of work without asking for help or getting help. Really sad as a young person working there."
bad,Very productive days learned something new everyday. The Hardest part is standing up for various hours. Management was pretty serious about their job in helping customers and employess.
bad,The area I worked in can use some work in the pharmacy management not all together at the moment. They put you under a lot of pressure to do too many things at once which can cause an error on a patients medication to occur
bad,when I would be building bikes they would leave me all alone when I was supposed to have someone assisting me and thee managers would become rude when I wouldn't make enough bikes for their liking
bad,it was an early morning hard comfortable job.  this job tought ay and work hard until it is time to go home. I recommend this type of work if u are good with your hands.
bad,not a place I loved to work. they don't care about there employees. always comes down to money for them. you are not aloud to have a bad day
bad,Enjoyed the environment of the people and employees and I learned a lot from the experience there opportunities to move up which was a great factor
bad,"Overall managers were very nice, but warehouse department is always hiring. Lack of organization cut of hours even for part timers,and lack of staff. Needed a better system."
bad,Very responsible and a very productive worker.i did cashier and stock always was on time ready to work .completed all task on time
bad,"A typical day at Walmart is tiring, to say the least. Low pay, and high volume traffic. Its like pulling teeth to get a day off, and they have no regard for their employees."
bad,It is exactly what you expect if you get hired at wal-mart. low moral and low motivations. don't work here if you are a hard worker. you will get taken advantage of.
bad,They kept scheduling me during school hours did not learn very much. Did not supply anything within the hot summer days.
bad,"I enjoyed going to work everyday, the work was manageable and co workers and customers were all appreciative. I would highly recommend  overnight stocking at Walmart."
bad,A typical day at work is when everything going smooth and everyone is working at a fast and good pace. We learn customer service and rules that has to be followed.
bad,Truck Unloaders was the hardest job in the whole company and I am glad that they took out the job because we got paid the same amount as everybody else for way more labor.
bad,Management was paid unequally with no proper reasoning. Was forced into a demotion because of poor inventory results in an extremely high theft location.
bad,But too many managers telling you to do too many different things. And your direct managers tell you it's not an issue yet the other managers can write you up for it. And some managers are petty. Overall not a great environment. You can do better. They certainly don't care about you.
bad,"I enjoyed doing customer service at Walmart, I liked assisting customers with their purchases and locating items. I did not like the management there, they would not accept my doctors note when I was wrote off for health problems and the pay was not very good."
bad,"if you just do your job you will be fine. the company does not value workers who try to learn more then their position, and you get worked like a dog. company invested in more equipment and now is cutting hours and switching every area to temps. was great for the first year, then everything changed. out of my hiring class only one person besides me was there. overtime was plenty, but very troublesome, they would sometimes have you come in just to tell you they messed up the schedule so you cant work or they cancelled overtime and bother to call anyone to them."
bad,The job mainly dealt with customers & answering questions. I enjoyed that because it allowed me to help people. I wouldn't ever work there again however.
bad,unfortunately walmart has a major problem keeping employees because they are not treated as employees but rather overworked and pushed around robots
bad,"I was glad that they worked with my schedule, however I was often required to work in departments that were a higher pay rate and did not receive the adjustment. Always understaffed."
bad,Making decisions for daily activities relating to associates and customers . Making sure store meets health standard and safe place to work. Sales most priority
bad,I truly did enjoy working as a cart pusher at Walmart I just feel that they needed more people outside and to fix the schedule so that way we were not short-handed.
bad,This job is very easy to do and there is no real effort required in completing it. The only issue I found was with the management in the particular store that I worked in. They seemed to have their priorities out of order.
bad,"Sliced meats and cheeses to customers specifications. Used scales to weigh foods and must maintained a clean working environment at all times. Prepared HOT by operating fryers, ovens, and other in a safe manner."
bad,I have no comments to make about the company. The job was adequate and the workers are mostly generally well to get along with. Management could use a refresher course on how to deal with employees.
bad,I ran the register to check people out.  I was also trained to be a backup for Customer Service.  I enjoyed working Customer Service.
bad,The managers rarely communicated with the supervisors which made it hard for them to communicate with employees. The managers assumed that the supervisors were mind readers when it came to certain task. Most managers didn't help with checkout when the store would be really busy. They would pull employees from other departments of the store which then put those departments behind with getting their own work done.
bad,"I really enjoy working a jobs that requires us to work at a fast paste. I also enjoy driving the stand-up forklift, its comfortable and easy for a young man like me."
bad,"Walmart presented me with a variety of work experience, largely due to the fact that they are consistently understaffed. The company touts respect for the individual, but the fact is that the management is largely a bunch of people that have come to Walmart as teens and ""grown"" with the company and haven't attained the educational experience to supervise their staff effectively. Everybody is miserable."
bad,Most management was very friendly and willing to teach. Majority of other employees were kind and willing to assist when needed.
bad,I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart up until around my final days with the company. The workload compared to the pay didn't add up right. Sometimes your efforts good unnoticed and unappreciated.
bad,In this position I pulled overstock and brought it out to the sales floor only to bring in back and reshelve it in the overstock bins later. They probably have the worst overstock system.
bad,"I managed the photo center, so the building management didn't really know or care what I was doing.  Would have liked a lot more involvement and support, but the positive side of that was that they didn't interfere with my customers.  I suppose it's a good place to start if you want a retail career."
bad,overall its a ok place to work if everyone do their part. the customer said that sometimes I was the only one working when they come in there.
bad,i really liked wal-mart they just could not work around my school time nice coworkers good pay it was was good over all 40 plus hours over the summer.
bad,"Employed full time more than two years , nearly no training from management and understaffed crews are a daily struggle in meeting quota. Easy work and lots of hours don't help meet the quota expected of understaffed and under trained crews set up to manage expected quotas"
bad,"Greeted customers entering store, pulling out carts to pass to them. Pushing row of carts from the back up to the front for customers convenience. Spot sweeping entryway and parking electric scooters for charging."
bad,"Helped people check out groceries and bagged their food items. "
bad,Working at Walmart was good I liked working there.I started off as a maintenance associate but got promoted to electronic sales associate...I worked there for a year and I liked it
bad,"Good store sometimes. Had a shooting there once, people were terrified. Had a great time working with new people, made a lot of connections with the employers."
bad,This was a Friday - Sunday  12 hour a day job. I did not enjoy standing stationary at a machine.  More of a move around kind of person.  The hours were not conducive to any type of social life.
bad,This job is very structured and very rewarding the company is wonderful and management team is the finest and the co workers are amazing they really notice when things are being done.
bad,"Despite what one can read about them on Forbes, Walmart is a very cut-throat company to work for. This I feel greatly impacts it's management teams and associates negatively. Walmart effectively practices the chain of screaming. My bosses boss yells at my boss, to which my boss yells at me with the expectation that I would add the same negative pressure to the associates below myself. This negative management style was one experienced on a daily basis with continuing threats to each employees own job security without regard to each of their own actual work ethic."
bad,"If your sick, pregnant, disabled, or anything do not attempt to work at Walmart because they don't care about and of that.  All they are concern about is the customer and meeting there needs."
bad,Was one of the worst places I've ever worked. The management at the store I worked was outrageous and horrible. Wouldn't work at that store again. A bad job
bad,The pay was good. Environment was great except my department. I didn't like my department. Too much favoritism involved.
bad,"I learned working at Walmart that the managers can be hard to deal with from time to time, but in one hear out the other and get my job done. The co-workers were typically awesome people and I enjoyed working there and having their company. Typical work days depended on the days we got trucks, which were Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. We had coordinated areas we all knew how to do efficiently and worked as a team to make sure all the work got done. Go from one area to another, if someone is struggling we'd lend a hand. For me, there was no hard part of the job, all of it was pretty basic and if you had questions you asked your management on what to do. I'd have to say the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the people in the job itself."
bad,"No complaints about the job, but the number one reason people look for a new job is because of management, not because of the workplace. I enjoyed what I did, however I was not taught my role to the extent I needed to be, and was blamed for others' shortcomings."
bad,It has a great culture and values for the customers very clean and it does have great befits. The managers are not the best it's not really ran great is very short handed and not really great scheduling skills.
bad,Uma ótima experiencia   com a empresa e colegas de trabalho. Também me identifico muito no  trabalho com o público. Embora fosse um trabalho exaustivo mais tinha muito prazer na realização das tarefas.
bad,There are a lot of ups and downs working for Walmart. They expect a lot for a little. Not very family oriented as they claim to be.
bad,"Working in the backroom provided a lot of freedom, but you were a donkey to the company--if your back wasn't moving fast enough then coaching would be provided. Cashiering was standard cashiering. Salesfloor can be hit/miss with management."
bad,"if you enjoy being a cog in a machine and not being treated like a human being this is the place for you."
bad,This job was not one of my longest jobs. I only worked here for 2 months. It was only a seasonal job. I was well managed and full staffed.
bad,It was the samething everyday no one had to tell you what to do. If they needed help with cashier you would have to help but when done go back to your spot in store.
bad,The management was very unorganized and disrespectful towards customers and employees. Where it started to look very bad representing their store in a positive manner.
bad,Walmart doesn't appreciate their employees.  The benefits are poor and the discounts that they give isn't even worth the troubles. I work that for five years and got 1 raise.  They would tell the employees they had a freeze on the bonuses and raises because customers fell and got hurt at the store location which cause the store score to drop and we didn't receive the bonus.
bad,"Wal-mart is widely known for being an employer that is large enough to replace you at anytime. So, while it can be a good, steady income, the management is horrible. The employees are not appreciated or treated right. And hours aren't always guaranteed."
bad,"This job was difficult for me. I did not have the neccessary speed or stamina that I needed to complete the tasks. However, I was also given very little assistance or training beyond videos and bits of advice. The job was third shift and very lonely and tiring. Don't expect to make any real connections with co-workers here."
bad,this job was very unprofessional to say the least. Management was very unhelpful and was never at our disposal. i had too many missed breaks and late departure due to understaffed and call offs.
bad,"I Stocked shelves and helped get the store ready for the new Wal- Mart supercenter. I learned from my boss there how to work at a fast an accurate pace, and how to stock shelves the best way."
bad,Was super bad place to work. I was going to high school when I worked there and told them I couldn't work pass 10 since I had to take the bus home. They still made me work till 11 and wouldn't approve my time off and told me I couldn't go otherwise I will be fired. So I quit.
bad,A great working environment for a short time.  In due time the realization of the lack of coverage sets in then becomes too stressful and creates a bad working environment.
bad,"My fellow associates are nice, and the breaks/lunch are fine. However, training was horrible and mediocre. I was barely trained and then very quickly sent to the registers all by myself, expecting me to just know everything. Management communication is really lacking. Everytime I was in the register and I needed help, it took forever to get someone to help me, and I had to keep the customers waiting. I dread going to work everytime, because this job stresses me out to no end."
bad,"Although wlamart have given me more experince, The job was a little hard to keep up with, the management wasn't good because they were never there. Some of my co-workers were actually really good, i got to make some good friends.i honeslty dont think i have any enjoyable part at that job"
bad,"Walmart is an ok place to work, but there is a lot of walking, standing & lifting.  Other than that, it is fine.  They would train you in different aspects of the job if you would ask to do this.  I met a lot of nice people & customers at Walmart.  I did not like pulling heavy carts full of heavy boxes which was one of my duties.  Not all of the managers would say hello when they ran into you in the store.  Some of them did, which I genuinely appreciated.  You got an hour lunch which was nice if you worked 40 hours which I did."
bad,everything just sucked. hour lunches. management was just rude all of the time. other cashiers were always in a bad mood. needed my schedule changed around for my son to be in daycare and they never did
bad,"This was another job that I enjoyed.  I love helping others and providing customer service.  The only thing I was not happy about was, again, not enough hours given. I needed full time employment."
bad,I worked there for a little while but that place is horrible. Mangers did not have employees back and barely care how they felt.
bad,was a great place for advancement.  My  associates were great for the most part.  Management was also good for the most part.
bad,at most other jobs work was divided into different crews for it to be done but at walmart you do everything yourself. it was extremely tiring and they did not listen about my availability. they scheduled me whenever they wanted me to work.
bad,I was a groundskeeper for this cemetery. I would make sure all areas were mowed and that all flowers from graves were cleaned up. I even did some of the hole digging.
bad,"I was a baker, a regular day was baking bread keeping the sales clean and in order. I also interact with different people to make sure they are satisfied with there visit and make sure they could find any items they need."
bad,"returning merchandise to their positions on the shelf, accepting exchange and returns of merchandise, making refund of money to customers, and ensuring that balance of cash is maintained."
bad,A Typical day at work resulted and waiting on the managers to place you at a register. Working at Wal-Mart I've learned that not everyone has a good heart. The co-workers some where nice and others walked around as if the world owe them something. There wasn't anything hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the days was clocking out.
bad,"I was originally hired as full time and not seasonal.  I worked hard and was always on time, never missing a day of work.  My hours were getting shorter and farther in between days of work.  When I had left I was down to where I had not worked for several weeks even though I was constantly checking in for my work schedule.  There was no communication to me on whether I was being disciplined or not even though I asked if there was a problem with my work.  I was hired as an Inventory Specialist but was doing nothing but stocking."
bad,"This job is not for the lazy."
bad,"A lot to learn a this company, there is just a one sided management who thinks they are better then all the other people who work there"
bad,"El trabajo es bueno es muy divertido"
bad,"As with everyone, they have good points and bad points. One good point is they do take a strong leap into corporate and store level change. Though, it gets overshadowed by their inability, at the store levels at least, to use the A.D.D.I.E. model of problem solving. While they have processes and procedures set to assist in this, they are rarely utilized and followed through. They are a company that tries to push new processes and routines without giving the necessary means to accurately accomplish such."
bad,"It was a job, not a good one.  Managements views and expectations for the staff is bogus. the coworkers were the only thing keeping me there.  too much hassle and 'changing policys'"
bad,"Working at the Walmart Super Center located in Frisco, Texas was not a very positive experience for me. The environment was very unprofessional, and filled with negative attitudes. A typical day at work consisted of attending a meeting at 10:00 p.m where the manager told you what section of the store you were to work on and who you were working with if applicable. Then you were to stretch and go to your area. The manager's way of motivating the associates to complete things faster was to yell at them. Many tasks that were given were impossible to complete especially if you were doing them correctly. The only thing that motivated me to keep working there were my coworkers. They all worked very hard and tried to keep each others spirits up. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to know my co workers. The hardest part was keeping up with the impossible demands. Although I had a negative experience, I did learn how to use an MC 40, how UPC's are used to find items."
bad,"At the time I worked there, there was no store manager.  She had left the company and taken her 4 months of vacation time.  Company policy dictates that you cannot have a store manager until the last manager is gone.  Technically that cannot happen until after you have used up your vacation time.  I don't think I can judge this company as it was obviously not running in a normal condition."
bad,"Being a married family man, Walmart was not the place for me. If you are single and ready to move along quickly in your career then Walmart is where you want to be."
bad,Large store with little help from the overnight managers. They were always in the office and left training up to other associates that weren't helpful or annoyed to be stuck with a new employee and often complained. Hardest part of the job was finishing some of the tasks they give in such short time with no extra help. Enjoyable part of the job was hour long lunch breaks to relax from stress.
bad,"Great place to gain work experience, shifts are not ideal as you only get 36 hours a week, overtime is not offered often. Very little opportunity to move around. Production driven environment, very little emphasis placed on the Safety"
bad,"day would start with management yelling at us saying we do everything wrong and do not work fast enough while being understaffed, expected 6 hours of work to be done within the first 2 hours of the day. Other employees made the job fun and enjoyable costumers were great to us and understanding,. Management would always cut hours during the holidays then complain about how much was getting done they did stick to your availability."
bad,"The management can be hard on the employees and have extremely high expectations from a minimal staff. This company does not view the average employee as a physical person, but as a number within a unit that is valued purely by results."
bad,Assitant managers need to be more proactive. I've enjoyed working there but assistant managers and the department manger never satisfied with employee's work.
bad,basically you do what they say or they replace you. I worked for Walmart for awhile and as my time with the company grew their standards of treating their associates diminished.
bad,"cleaning of parking lot, stocking, cart attendant, assist costumers, unloading trucks. taking costumers groceries to cars. cleaning behind and around store"
bad,The pay is obviously pretty close to minimum wage  but I guess that's what you sign up for. It was a pretty typical minimum wage start out job.
bad,a typical day at work would be getting yelled at by random strangers and having to put on fake smiles. the scheduling sucked. but the best part of your day is lunch.
bad,"Walmart has no form of structuring as it relates their daily operation, its daily operation entails chaos and lack of professionalism. The policies that they write are not consistent. "
bad,I feel they can do more for their employees. Pay did not represent the work. Nice benefits. Could pay more to hourly employees.
bad,"It's an okay place to work for a while. If you are there too long, you get burnt out because management finds out that you're decent at doing something and then they ask you do to things all of the time instead of the job you are hired for."
bad,I appreciate all of the knowledge I gained while I was employed there but the atmosphere was terrible. I tend to be positive and energetic while I work but the environment was the opposite and management was very unprofessional. Working for The Home Depot the last 4 years has really put this into perspective for me in terms of comparison.
bad,"I absolutely hated working at Walmart. Was not even there for a month and left. I can not tell you how many times in that one month I had things thrown at me, how many times I had been cussed out, etc. "
bad,"this is an okay place to start your life in the retail business"
bad,"A typical work night I would have to stock the shelves but overall not the best company to work for, the way treat their employees could be a little better."
bad,a day at work you are lost because nothing is ever the same and even management is not on the same page. there is to many chiefs and not enough indians. i learned how to talk to people and respect people which management doesn't do. the coworkers have to much drama even if you stay to yourself they will put your name in things and if enough people say that you did it what you say doesn't matter they won't listen to you.
bad,Working for Walmart was an awful experience. The management team was a mess and associate complaints were not taken seriously.
bad,"Company only cares about making money, not about their employees. I enjoyed seeing different customers throughout the day."
bad,"It's a job to pay your bills. Loved the family like atmosphere, the people I worked with and the customers. The corporation as a whole needs some work and be more in tune with employee needs."
bad,"A typical day was somewhat busy. I learned how to zone, stock, do go backs, and keep my area clean the correct way. My co-workers were very helpful when it came to shortening the long lines at registers and with customer carry-outs. The hardest part of the job was working with most of management because they were lazy, rude, and unhelpful."
bad,Not enough pay to deal with the way you were treated by members calling in. Repetitive work and at times had a lot of system issues.
bad,"Communicating and taking care of the customers needs was a pleasure. Rather not comment about management. Walmart I feel could do better by their employees, in doing so I feel the turnover wouldn't be so high"
bad,I put carts away all day and they fired me saying I worked off the clock when I was told by my manager to do something even after telling them that I had already clocked out. I did not enjoy working with my manager
bad,"The expectations from the managers were unrealistic to complete in a normal shift, which normally meant I had to stay late, skip breaks, or get in trouble for not finishing my work."
bad,"My experience with Walmart was a tuff one. All of the staff was rude and un pleasant to work with. They had no understanding when it came to your personal life, ad one supervisor didn't like to give breaks where needed."
bad,"Straighting and stocking shelves. Helping costumers find products answering questions or finding someone who could answer their questions. I like working and  interacting with people, there is so much to learn from individuals and they love to share when someone is willing to listens."
bad,"Though I was able to grow within the company, there was constant change of rules by management and not much consideration for the employees."
bad,The managers are very rude. Some of the employees were getting paid to shop. I alerted management several times about thieves walking out the store with merchandise and they were unresponsive. I got along with my coworkers just fine. The hardest part of the job was being everywhere at once. The most enjoyable part of working there was that i got the chance to work solo.
bad,it was okay it just needed new management system because they were not right for company and they were not fair to their empolyees
bad,"There was a lot of miscommunication, Customers would leave upset , not at the employees but because the supervisors and managers always took so long to do something or didn't resolve the issue properly"
bad,At Walmart you are just a number there is no comradery or family environment. Your accomplishments are not rewarded and there is no room for advancement.
bad,"Great prices, Great location, Great many customers to wait on, Location, Location, Location, Location, Location, was nice."
bad,It was busy and I learned to be more efficient. My co-workers and managers were all nice and respectful. The hardest part of the job was how busy it was when I was the only cashier working but I worked through it as best as I could and the best part of the job was how the day went by fast I guess.
bad,"Typical night would consist of stocking shelves, making displays, unloading trucks, and clean up. Remodeled another store learned blue prints and did construction. enjoyed working with other employees. The best part of my job was doing the remodel and the hardest part of it was moving the walls of the remodel"
bad,"Walmart provides a lack luster environment in which to work on a daily basis.  Your hours are strictly monitored, so that the company does not have to give benefits, and many of the people are quite demoralized, leading to a difficult work attitude."
bad,"Typical work day would include helping employees help customers. The hardest part is not being able to spend time with friends and family because you are always on the job, but it feels good to know you have helped others."
bad,"Walmart is a fun place to work. Good staff, busy schedule. Time Management is the key to success if you want to move up in this business."
bad,"A typical day at work was clocking in, finding out where you where for the day and getting ready to work whatever place you were assigned to. I have learned how to work retail, better my communication skills and costumer service. My co-workers where helpful and friendly. Always ready to help you when you needed it, making you feel like you had friends or some close family. The management would be there and than disappear before you even realize they were there. Some of them don't really try to understand you but others would love to understand you. The hardest part of the job is getting your department done in the hours you were told you had to do it, keeping your area clean so costumers can get through safely. The most enjoyable part of working at Wal-mart was working close to people you can talk to and know they will help you if you need it. Knowing there is always someone to be there for you, making some very close friends."
bad,"Bad management, everyday was a bad experience. Working coworkers are unfriendly. Lack of communication skills, never working there ever again."
bad,"Stay busy time goes by faster.."
bad,"Assumes responsibility for ensuring customer service. Supervising employees, enforcing company regulation, and taking care of various administrative tasks. Individuals in managerial careers process payroll, schedule employees, delegate daily assignments, implement promotional campaigns, track inventories, analyze and reports sales data and coordinate merchandise shipments."
bad,"I unloaded all the trucks with the help of a five person crew, when they showed up. We then sorted all the merchandise and pulled the pallets to the sales floor. My crew and I then stocked certain areas of the store."
bad,"Trained at regular times, but then required to come in at odd times, from 4 am in the morning to working until midnight. Very hard when you have to arrange child care."
bad,"A typical day at Walmart is like the, management doesn't care about your health they just want the work done there are so many complaints about working for Walmart"
bad,"I loved working here until my supervisors became less understanding of my mental illnesses. I was great with customers, but I would get a little overloaded due to co-workers goofing off. When I went to the higher-ups about this issue, they seemed to show favoritism."
bad,"Sometimes easy sometimes stressful."
bad,"Not enough workers, hours cut alot Always shorthanded. Too much to do and not enough time or people to ever get anything done"
bad,"The staff was ok, management was ok most of the time. Some of the CSM's let their position go to their head. Hours were ok. Close to home at the time."
bad,The management was very poor! There was no help when help was needed! They had supervisors that didnt even know the registers.
bad,"suck good for high school students find like this job at all they treat you like carp , if you work here use as a stepping stone done be a life'er you be miserable."
bad,I liked the people i worked with but very few people i worked for.  The random days of free food was a plus and the original rule set up was nice.  After 4 months the change in rule made it very difficult to justify working there
bad,"The typical day at work implied:"
bad,typical night at work would consist of cleaning up the hallways making sure customers were directed to the correct theater or working in the conssesion stand taking orders fixing foods drinks etc managment was ok
bad,"Work in a fast paced environment and manage the high volume of load and fulfill the required task in timely manner, in simple words learn how to work like a machine (Robot) :)"
bad,"The specific location I worked at wasn't great. That goes for the other employees and management. There were clearly favorites and rules that didn't apply to everyone like they should've. There were some really great people. However, the cons outweighed the pros. Other locations seem a lot more organized and professional."
bad,"- Standing all day"
bad,"Enjoyed my experience at Walmart, learned a lot well I was there. they were not very flexible when it comes to hours or needing days off, the pay is not the greatest and you only start out at part time and have possibility of being let go if they do not need you after the holidays."
bad,"managers are unaware of policies"
bad,I loved my position at Walmart but they have 8 assistant managers and each one except the one in charge of your area would approach you and tell you how to change things even though it was not the right way.
bad,Working for walmart is a great first job to have and for some it makes a great career. Working for walmart really taught me a lot about reality and how to be a hard worker.
bad,"Typical day: punch in, get register number from CSM (customer service manager), go to register, cash out customers, break, cash out customers, lunch, cash out customers, break, cash out customers, punch out, celebrate"
bad,"Good cultured, great work/life balanced company. What I learned while working there is irreplaceable and will keep dear to me. My co-workers were great and worked very well with each other."
bad,"friendly customers and co workers"
bad,The company is a nice company to work for. The store where I worked was very stressful. The management at the time was not so friendly all and all I love working for the company.
bad,"I liked cashiering and the customers, and became very efficient at it.  I got along great with most co-workers, and managers.  However, some cashiers and managers were extremely unprofessional, and honestly embarrasing to be associated with at times.  Nothing was done to correct problems at the facility.  A new store manager came and things got much worse.  My favorite part of the job was working with my friends, and that includes the cashier managers."
bad,I had to work the drive through and the front counter all by myself in several diffent days and I had to teach myself a lot of the skills I learned
bad,Walmart is not a good place to work. They do not seem to care about their employees. The wages are low and they do not appreiceiat their employees.
bad,"it is a fantastic place to work, i dont mind working there but im jus not recieving enough hours per week. Simple work but low hours. The hardest thing about this job is the amount of walking you have to do every shift."
bad,The times are changing and so is the cost of living. Wages need to increase.There needs to be more benefits for families.
bad,Co-workers were involved in drama. The most enjoyable part of this job was when you clock out. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers.
bad,"most of the bosses were ok, the associates are all my friends. I have fun working, As a boss they always wont more,for the pay? sorry i feel i worked hard with little pay, they just could of been nicer!!"
bad,"a typical day at work is going through and determining how damaged an item is, if it can get sent back, and if it can then we have to put it in a claim package it up and finalize everything to get it ready for shipment. I have learned a lot sense I have been there and it is a hard job to explain. my management is good and my co workers are great I get along very well. The hardest part of my job would have to be making sure each claim is correct and that they are packaged properly. I enjoy every bit that I do in claims."
bad,Eight hour work day. Learned Customer service skills. Trained on register and floor. Kind people. Great customers. Great Co-workers. Good management team.
bad,"Ambiente razoavelmente bom de se trabalhar, os funcionários deveriam ajudar-se mais."
bad,This was a great work experience dealing with customers and helping them. I got to learn new things everyday. I however did not like management and how things were ran.
bad,I did not like my time working under manpower. It does not seem as if the coworkers are treated with the respect they deserve whenever they are shipped off to a workplace.
bad,401k paid holidays with blue cross blue shield dental and health ins. Hourly pay with biweekly  pay day. the hardest part is being able to stay warm while working in the extreme cold
bad,"Worked in the back unloading trucks, taking freight out to the floor and eventually stocking that freight as well. Hardest part of the job was the lack of communication between management. Always got pulled from doing on job to go work on another."
bad,I enjoyed a typical day at work. The people were very friendly. I loved seeing/putting smiles on people's faces. The management was awesome and so was my co-workers. The reason I left was because i wanted experience in other areas of work.
bad,I did not really enjoy working here the staff was lazy and did not want to do there share of the work. I always had an unorganized work area due to lack of help from co-workers. If all of the apparel department does not work together to get everything done by the end of their shift the next shift will be behind.
bad,They have a very different way of treating their employees. You definitely stay for the people you get to work with and the customers you meet.
bad,"I like the fast pace, but not really working for fast food. I learned how to get food out within 3 minutes in between customers. I liked the managers and emplolyees"
bad,This company is not a family company as they advertise. Uncaring for their employees. They promise your working conditions would get better but they never do.  Short handed.  More and more work piled on that you know is going to be hard to finish.  Dirty conditions to work in. Fitting Rooms were rarely ever mopped or sprayed.  There were was just too many things that happened.
bad,"Typical cashier hours, unreliable management, high social and customer service demands and a large multitude of responsibilities and tasks"
bad,"Always busy and has lots of customers, never a dull moment working at customer service, I love the coworkers, my day is normally really busy assisting customers with their returns or bill pay or money transfers."
bad,nice perks 10% discount good co-workers. management isnt that good in my opinion. big franchise bonus check every few months.
bad,My biggest problem was that they don't work with you when you have an illness and need to take time off that is out of your hands.
bad,"liked working as a cashier, but the staff was very unorganized and not often on time to take over for another employee when they have a scheduled break or lunch"
bad,"The company likes to take money from the employees when they transfer to different areas of the store, or not pay them the appropriate amount for other jobs in the store."
bad,"Management is really rude and disrespectful, they never want to work with you and you get blamed for things other people do."
bad,"well I was an overnight stock person and it was fun at time but, Wal-mart would lay me off every 5 months so that I couldn't get any benefits."
bad,"I didn't mind it, but there were times where the bosses were too hard on people and they kept cutting hours. They also put a lot of unnecessary pressure on their employees"
bad,Here I worked overnight stock produce. The workload was more then enough one person could not get it doe. The management did not care about how things were in your department. There was just me unloading trucks putting away freight. While trying to assure my department was fresh and ready for the morning shoppers. my co-workers were awesome everyone worked hard and never had a sad face. The hardest part was the amount of work they expected of you. Now I am a very hard worker but this particular place wanted too much outta of you. There were great benefits.
bad,The experience that I had at  Walmart was not a career building one.  The company didn't treat workers well.  Workers didn't seem happy to be there.
bad,"muy buen clima laboral me ayudaron mucho me enseñaron, me gusto mucho el trabajo por que aprendi muy rapido sin tener conocimiento previo"
bad,"really sucks, horrible management, no leadership, ugly females, crazy customers, snitches all around you, a hole lot of haters when your young  handsome"
bad,Management Was Horrible. They Never Took In Consideration Of Their Employments. I Was Always At Work...Working Days In and Out. I Was  Knick Picked For No Apparent Reason. If You Work Try To Do It To Get To A Better Field.
bad,Management will pull you from your job to give you someone elses responsiblity because the previous person didnt accomplish the tasks at first which henders your responsiblity to handle the job that you were taken away from.
bad,"This company  has a major communication breakdown between management  and employees!"
bad,"everyone loves the low cost, but hates the service . i wish the million dollar company actually treated there employees better"
bad,"Most the time you worked short employees, they would pull to help in other areas, But they still wanted you to get the job done that your crew was to do.That was a typical day at Wal-mart.  I learned is if you pick some thing up put it back were you got it, some one has to do that, its not a lot of fun.       HARDEST  PART OF THE JOB WAS CUSTOMERS  TALKING ABOUT NO REG OPEN UP."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of working between one to two isles with various discrepancies in each isle. Management has different views and thoughts of what to do and how to do it. I learned by lack there of how important communication is for overnights and with other co-workers in general. The hardest part of my job was having to restock something because it was put in the wrong place. It Is not very timely just tedious but more than two or three, which was typical  can set up delays."
bad,"A typical at day at Walmart was long and tedious.  My co-workers was the best part of working for Walmart. The hardest part of the day was the long work days (12 hour shift.)  Most enjoyable was clocking out and going home. However, the management was sketchy at best.  Management had favorites. Walmart has some of the best on job training."
bad,We had several managers telling us different things to do. If one told you to do one thing another from another department came and told you to do something else. Most departments were unorganized and under staffed.
bad,Always busy.  Learned how to cut meat/cheese. Short handed all the time.  Some co workers were hard to get along with because nobody liked their job.
bad,"Constant standing and trying to meet demands from management that I cannot do even with extra help, which I rarely had. Training was great though and personell is exceptional."
bad,Walmart was not an organized company to work at. Management was all over the place and the store was always in a state of confusion. Also did not have the amount of employees they needed to complete certain task.
bad,No room for growth or advancement....The managers showed favoritism towards certain employees. I worked crazy hours and nothing was consistent If you worked overtime you had to take extra hours off during your lunch.
bad,"perform oil changes tire rotations replace tire repair tires replace battery, lights. Management was always helpful. Co-workers were friendly and always willing to lend a hand. Making every customer happy. knowing I did the best I could at my job."
bad,"I did not feel appreciated for the work that I performed. I felt like the focus was more on what I was not able to complete in the allotted time. I was alone most nights and in the department I was in, attempting to keep up was enough of a task."
bad,Not a good family life balance.The store manager is too young and immature. Not a equal opportunity company. To advance you must move away from the city you start in.
bad,I loved working for the comapny. it was a great environment and a very well organized store. i was very pleased with my experience there.
bad,"stocking shelves, cleaning, zoning merchandize, helping customers, running multiple departments, too many managers to employees, average coworkers, getting pulled back and forth between managers and having hours cut to ridiculous lows."
bad,"unless you were a favorite, you could not move up. Management is poorly trained. They have no true training, just computer based learning. The problem with the computer based learning is that it operates as if it is a perfect world."
bad,"Depending on which department you work in, you've got running register, helping stock shelves, help customers find product. Learned that the newer the assistant managers are the smarter they are. They still remember what is like working in certain departments are try to help them out any way they can. The coworkers are the best, they can make you laugh, and make you feel like a family."
bad,A typical day at work was checking customers out. I learned how to interact with a lot of people. It made me a bigger people person. My co-workers and I got along great. Walmart wouldn't have been tolerable without them. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult people. The most enjoyable part of the job was putting a smile on peoples faces.
bad,This involved both customer service and organization and replacement of produce withing the designated areas as well as rotating produce depending on current stock.
bad,Walmart is just as horrible being an employee as it is being a customer. The other associates and management are horrible and lazy.
bad,would complete all job duties and extra. Would be called in on requested days off when they had been requested weekes in advance. i would pick up shifts to help out others when I could.
bad,"Overnight stocking to prepare the store for customer convenience.  low level pay and benefits. Fun and interesting co-workers, but rather unorganized and unhelpful management."
bad,management was very rude. they talked to employees any way they wanted and showed favoritism. job was ok and easy work. i liked working here and the pay was very reasonable.
bad,"Freight left over from 3rd shift must be dealt with first thing.  This takes more time if the departments are not zoned which is usually the case.  There is no help in the departments for this task."
bad,"es bueno es una empresa muy agradable "
bad,"Mangers require more of people that show competence, which makes it difficult to actually accomplish anything. Buying the stock is nice though, and provided a nice cushion for 'just in case'."
bad,"a typical day at work was clocking in then immediately checking my coolers, communicating with my openers finding out the pallet count an if any issues occurred with the load.  Next my sales floor making sure bananas are down stacked to ensure longest shelf life possible, walk floor to scan outs an check prices, cull an direct associates to work sections such as salads, fruits, veggies, or bananas."
bad,"Started off as a sales associate then was promoted to Sales Coordinator of the Jewelry Department. I was basically assistant to the department manager of Jewelry, It was fun until she made me do all her work and then threw me under the bus. The workers were friendly. They didn't last there very long. The management is ok."
bad,"parfait pour les jeunes"
bad,"People expect so much from one person that it almost can't be done. If there is a mess up, there are huge penalties. there is no way of moving up in the company, they try and keep that person in the same spot."
bad,"took advantage of me daily. total joke. I do not recommend."
bad,"I can not speak for anyone else's Walmart. However, the Walmart I work for has very poor management.  They lack understanding and they lack effort in helping their employees help their customers. A lot of the time I find myself having no choice but to make manager decisions because there is not one in sight. Other than that everyday is pretty much the same co-workers are easy to get a long with which is enjoyable to come to work."
bad,"Retail is never an easy job. Working almost every holiday for less than a position is worth. Would not go back to work for them,"
bad,Great company unless calling in for an emergency. Hrs were steady and great uhtil layoff. Lunch breaks were good amoun time. Job is overall a good job if you are looking for good hrs and good money.
bad,"Poor management  as always, Lack of management skill. Bonus shrink down by quarter  because of those supervisor , store manager .too much drama , Grouping ."
bad,"I am a casher. Very busy every day. My co-workers are wonderful. I get to make people smile. Wal-Mart  goes out of it's way to please their employees. We have BBQs, cookie sales, pot lucks, employee production sales."
bad,A good starter job for young adults. Flexible hours. Management can be a little apathetic towards the needs of the employees.
bad,It was an okay experience people would help you get things here and there wasn't all that you think it would be. co workers are good to work with are still friends with most of the at the walmart
bad,"Working at Walmart is not easy. They expect a lot, but pay little. It is easy to move up in Walmart, and after a short time I was able to get a better position. However, they weren't as flexible when it came to school. Also, I was part-time, but would work 32 hours a week with no benefits. I defiantly learned a lot, and gained experience in every department. There are opportunities for everyone at Walmart that is willing to work."
bad,They do not provide enough hours. Gave regular evaluations and raises. Stressful Work environment. Would never work there again.
bad,"tough job, tough environment, tough expectations.  mixture of good/bad co-workers, just the same with managers. worked there 3 years.  tried to go back to school while working at the same time...they didn't want to do it but after way too many discussions with upper-management they finally agreed to let me.  which is hard to understand because walmart ""encourages"" continued education and offers scholarships.  but in my experience I almost lost my job at walmart while going through nursing school.  often considering me absent from work on clinical days(clinical days changed and weren't marked on syllabus calendar properly, I notified my area managers of these date changes.)  when I called and talked to assistant manager to resolve this, he basically told me I was fired and that they need full-time workers not part-time workers that are students. If it wasn't for one of my particular areas managers sticking up for me, I would have been fired.  Be nice to the nice managers.  Not a terrible job, but not a career for me."
bad,"I would help with customer complaints "
bad,"I learned that working in a fast past environment requires strong leadership. Good motivation and timeliness are key to success. "
bad,"Clock in and go to station to sign onto register and start scanning customers  items. When not busy, zone surrounding area and assist other cashiers."
bad,People can be difficult at times. I enjoyed working in the fabric department.  I learned the types and the textures  of fabrics.  My co-worker were easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet.  I enjoyed cutting and talking to people about sewing.
bad,it was a typical day going to work clocking in and clocking out. I learned how to organize the clothes on shelves and hangers. I managed to finish all my work for the day before i clock out. I had no problem with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was stocking the shelves and unloading boxes of items and put them where they belong.
bad,You'll be on your feet 24/7 so make sure it's what you want. The staff are pretty good people and they're a little considerate with scheduling. Meet new people everyday.
bad,"a lot depends on who you work with on how the  experience turns out for the person"
bad,"Great Company benefits, low growing potential pass assistant management. All in All, great place to learn retail and customer service."
bad,management is not aware of the regular employees needs and shows no concern for the people who have setbacks in thier personal lives.
bad,I learned the beautiful art of loss prevention. Management was some of the worst I've ever dealt with. I would never work for that store again.
bad,"FUn work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tapes and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
bad,wal-marts work ethics are not good management was not good or did not communicate well with each other so it wold make working hard there was a lot he said she said from management back room was not very clean and organized equipment was hard to find or did not work properly was rushed all the time. was trained well brakes were good lunch brakes were good and co-workers were nice and helpful
bad,a typical day at little ceasars was a fast pace environment making sure everything was clean and made correctly. Always making sure that the customers need comes first.
bad,"Too many chiefs & not enough Indians. It's very discouraging to work under people who have little to no knowledge about the company & it's expectations. There's little to no organization, lots of confusion, with little to no compensation."
bad,"The co workers are full of drama, talking about people and being in other peoples business. The managers are a different story, they dont act like managers, they single alot of people out, they treat others different then most people, they find little things to let you go when there not supposed to do that, they treat you poorly. "
bad,"A typical day at walmart was a lot of different stuff on any given day. Management there was not very good, they did not like to help customers or really do anything at all. My co-workers were all really nice people except for the managers. the hardest part of that job was 5 different managers would tell you to do 5 different things all at the same time and then each get mad when you were not doing what they told you to."
bad,Loved the work but management was a bit too difficult to deal with. Loved the people I worked with. Too many managers with different opinions on how to do the job I was hired for.
bad,"Very unorganized place in Cary"
bad,Walmart is a great company the management team needs to do better. Things are not done fairly among associates and some people do what they want
bad,Have to work under a lot of pressure. Very few hours of work weekly. A lot of disrespectful employees and bosses do not do anything about it.
bad,It was good job experience. Very hard working and the job keep you busy. Not a lot of time to slack off. Should pay more for all the hard work they want the employer to put in.
bad,great place to work for and to start you carrer. love the way in which they treat and respect their employees. Also love they way  that  they will work with you if you need personal time off.
bad,"Not the best work environment, or the best management."
bad,I did not have the best working experience at wal mart. Because they dont value there employees at all. they throw them inot any project all over the store and dont even do your desired job. The pay was terrible and i felt not very appreciated.
bad,A typical day  at Wal-Mart is very fast paced. you learn to deal with the public in good and bad situations. The management at Wal-Mart isn't that great it could be a lot better!!! co-workers were great! the most enjoyable part of the day is knowing you made someones day!!
bad,"Worked as a cashier ringing up customers and occasionally got pulled for cart duty outside"
bad,I have worked here for 3 years now. And it seems as the days go on the company get worse and worse. I enjoy my job but not the company that I am working for. Lately I have learned that all of the senior associates are leaving due to the company not cooperating with its associates. The most enjoyable part of my day lately has been clocking out and going home. The place has become hostile and full of drama.
bad,"Work was tough, but well deserving of it. Often the management would be unknown to even the workers there, but all of the workers came together to help customers and create a good working environment."
bad,"I'm glad I saw my way out.  It felt like being trapped in the middle of the desert.  Imagine seeing life in one color.  Imagine no trees, no windows.  Imagine entering and exiting out the doors having to cross paths with a slew of zombie cigarette smokers everytime - that's WM RE Division."
bad,Walmart had a lot of diversity. I enjoyed working with different types of people as well as those who I developed report with.
bad,"My typical day as a Walmart cashier requires me to be courteous to every customer that walks through the doors and down my register, processing transactions and providing great customer services. When it comes to working at Walmart, I've learned that patience is definitely the key to working here. When customers start to push our buttons, it's our duty to keep calm and a hostile free environment. As far as the management goes, it seems that they are mainly about the store itself rather than the employees who are working for the store. In my previous jobs, my recent managers have me feel that they are all about the employees but here, it's like we are the last things on their minds. My co-workers on the other hand are kind of immature to the point where they are letting their personal lives interfere the work the put out. They hardest part of working here is feeling appreciated. The cashiers at my store are definitely under appreciated. They endure the most when it comes to handling customers and yet, no one seems to notice it or appreciate it. On the other hand, the thing I enjoy the most about this job are the friends that I have made but that's just about it."
bad,I enjoyed my job! The pay was low and I worked some crazy hours.I enjoyed working the public and had some great co-workers!
bad,"Being trained on first shift was a great feeling. The people were kind, The management was great, but then I was transferred to 2nd shift... Management was horrible,  unwilling to teach they just wanted you to do...  horrible dreadful feeling going into work."
bad,"Great Co-Workers"
bad,You stand on your feet all day and deal with ungrateful people. You only work part time so they don't have to give you any benefits.  Then when you need to change your hours they snub their nose at you. Management is invisible and have closed doors.
bad,"good company and management,"
bad,A usual day at work included pushing carts and doing carry outs for customers. I learned how to be flexible and multi task. The management their are very strict and many co-workers were lazy. The hardest part of the job was keeping all the carts out of the parking lot during the winter. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing all the people coming in the store.
bad,Work really hard without much recognition/fufillment besides personal fulfillment. The amount of work and stress brought on by higher management isn't worth the pay.
bad,"Managers were egotistical, were trying to make you do jobs which you were not being properly compensated for (front cashiers make more an hour at that time) and when I have done the favour many times for them i was not compensated for the extra pay when i was acting as a front cashier from a sales floor associate. "
bad,"There was a lot of drama and personal relationships between the workers within this company, much like a high school setting."
bad,I had to basically try & self learn jewelry because they wouldn't put me with nobody to be trained & i barely got customers cause i couldn't tell them to much about jewelry.
bad,"Maintained inventory standards by labeling, scanning, and updated the inventory, assisted with customer relations, and handled cash register transactions."
bad,I didn't really like working for this company I was a cashier and the store I worked at the managers were very lazy it took them forever to bring me change so customers that had to pay with cash was just standing there waiting for a manger to come because I wasn't a loud to leave my register when I had customers standing there so I didn't like it .
bad,"Getting a job here was cake and I was called as soon as I filled out the application. The hours were great but the pay was roughly what you would expect. Not shockingly of course the management was rude, stubborn, and refused to listen to those they manage. Coworkers were welcoming nice people. We helped each other out for the most part but a few people had a tendency to go out of their way to spot every flaw you had instead of working which ultimately hurt our work flow and caused some stress in some of my other coworkers. The most difficult part of the job was walking there. I lived 2 miles away and it just took a while to get there. The most enjoyable part of my job was looking at all the new things that came out the day they came out and shopping in your head while you worked."
bad,"preform safety sweep of department, stocking shelves, all so zone shelves, customer service, arrange displays and end caps,learned to use hand held computer to pick and bin merchandise, price changes, labels, locking security boxes for certain items, changing shelf mods and signage. the hardest part is pulling heavy pallets. very short staffed is a problem. management should get together on each project, it confuses the associates because we are changing things that one manager tells us,when the next tells us something different. time wasted doing tasks over. my co-workers try to help out but they are overwhelmed with no help. team work is very important. the best part of the job is the people. i do my best to help customers any way I can."
bad,Working at as a customer service manager I was always on the move. Either helping customers or doing other tasks assigned by higher management. Sometimes I felt under appreciated for the things i went out of my way to do. That being said I loved my cashiers and customer service associates and talking with them was always a pleasure.
bad,"Coming to work used to be no problem, then I started getting more stressed out. Dealing with unruly customers and also dealing with co-workers who don't know how to keep their personal lives outside of work."
bad,"This job, albeit simple, was very taxing. Rather than spend my day walking, I stood in one spot for nine hours a day, five or six days a week. This was rough on my knees, as I hadn't previously worked any other jobs aside from two months at Jack In the Box in Arizona, and I had lived a very sedentary lifestyle in my adolescent years."
bad,"working at Walmart was great. it was a family environment full of nothing but positive support and great teamwork. Although I loved working for this company, I have a mental illness and I really hoped to get their support on that but it just didn't happen."
bad,"It's a cool place to work because you get to know all the customers. It sucked for me because I didn't live in Westville so they didn't know me already so I got treated differently. They are also sexist so they only let girls run register and let the guys be stock boys. The owner was kinda rude to me and accused me of stealing even though I worked there for a year and never gave her problems, came in on my days off every time I was asked, and did everything she wanted me too, and would have done even more if she would have let me, but because I was female she wouldn't let me. They hired to many people to give enough hours to anyone and it seemed that after you worked there for a year they kinda just wanted you to leave so they would treat you differently."
bad,"Although I loved spending the days with a really great team of co-workers, the management team is horrible, It was so bad that when i woke up to get ready for work i would literally get sick to my stomach everyday knowing the amount of stress i would put in daily, and in a position that i never even received pay for but was forced to do  for 3 years."
bad,"Very diverse experience, lots of costumer service experience with a lot of opportunities to grow in knowledge of how to deal with various needs. I've even helped costumers with disabilities in being a personal shopper and guide through the store. A lot of team building experience and group projects setting up seasonal displays and keeping up-to-date on a constantly fluctuating inventory and various sales strategies to keep it moving. I think the hardest part of the job was all the different things to learn, there is always room for growth and every day brings new experience but I enjoyed the challenge."
bad,They seem not to care about their employees. I was treated like a child. The pay rate is horrible and I don't recommend this facility to anyone.
bad,"Despite the horror stories I feel like I got lucky, I worked at a Walmart in a nicer part of town and didn't face threats of violence from customers or co-workers. For the most part I was treated like a human being for my first 3 years. The last year I worked there the management changed (as it often does) and I was being criticized for changing my schedule every semester for school among other unsatisfactory developments. After that I decided to leave for greener pastures."
bad,Meeting new faces and dealing with customer service each day. There were days where I was up and days where I was down. Fun atmosphere.
bad,A good company to start your working career with.  An ideal place to make life long friends.  Work days tend to be longer in the holiday season.
bad,"some of the managers are not friendly."
bad,"While working at Wal-Mart, my days were very boring because I didn't see very many customers because I was in the garden area. Then I moved inside and started working as a cashier and I loved it. I loved getting to interact with the customers while still staying busy at the same time."
bad,"Clock in, unload products off of trucks, restock items that are out, keep stock items in a reachable area. Clean and report any damaged products and label ordered products."
bad,"Employees are not valued as part of a team and creating a relationship among employees is not encouraged. Management does not show much interest in helping others or making work a ""fun"" place to be. They rarely consider the feelings and situations o others which causes low retention rates."
bad,"Helping customers with paint, and assisting them where items are. Learned a lot with paint, because of this job. Management were not that great. Some co-workers were cool, and some were annoying. The hardest part about this job, is learning on your own when your supervisor isn't there. The most enjoyable part about this job were the discounts, and breaks."
bad,Company says it is family friendly and is NOT.  They don't care about their employee.  They have some Managers that want what they want done and don't care if the overall Store Manager tells you to do something.
bad,"Typical day is hard because one was never the same as the next.  I worked in 6 different stores from Newark to Waverly.  I have trained upcoming Assistant Managers, was an Assistant Trainee,  I had manned and ran my own hiring site.  I was part of a relocation, 2 store setups, and a few remodels.  "
bad,"Trabalhando na Walmart percebi que não é nada fácil manter uma empresa/um negócio, tem de haver muitos funcionários para empresa desse porte, mas sempre faltava, então o trabalho acumulava, muitas das vezes atendia dois, três clientes ao mesmo tempo, mas eu gostava de trabalhar, operei caixa e repus mercadoria  tinha um bom relacionamento com os colegas, só que percebi que não era mais o que eu queria fazer por um bom tempo, também percebi que a chances de crescimento eram mínimas, eu quero ir adiante..."
bad,"A typical day at work is decorating cakes and cupcakes for the display and any orders. I learned how to work with others and understand people better. Management changed too frequently. The hardest part about the job is dealing with hard customers, you never know how they'll react to anything. The things I like most is being able to decorate cakes and seeing how happy customers are when they pick up their orders."
bad,"the job itself was okay when we had a full staff, it kept us busy some choices were made that made the job diffcult at times."
bad,"culling produce"
bad,Walmart taught me that there are much better job opportunities available if I put myself up to it. My management was horrible because they never wanted to change my schedule and would schedule my break about an hour before my shift was over. My co-workers were friendly but I feel as though they could not be trusted. The hardest part of the job was that it was overnight and I barely had time to do anything when I got off work. The best part of the job was the satisfaction of helping customers and it paid pretty decent to keep me in school.
bad,"This company does not care about its employees. It is more concerned with making money than its workers and customers. If sick you incur points on a demerit based system, and these prevent any kind of advancement, making it almost impossible to further your career unless you are Captain America."
bad,"Being a cashier was nice to inter act with the customers and checking them out so they can buy their product they wanted to buy like CD's, movies, cellphones, groceries."
bad,Had to get as much product on shelve every shift as well as assisting customers and meeting your quota on sales. Enjoyed working with the public. Management were strict on daily duties of the job. Hardest part of this job was stalking mass quantity products. Learned to be prompt and patient with customers.
bad,It was a fair job that served a purpose back then. Very few times did I take a break no matter how long I worked. Hard to remember back then. Gave 100% even though there was no feed back from management..
bad,"I enjoyed my job and its environment. However, it was my coworkers that made it bearable - not Walmart itself. There were many promises made to multiple workers by the management that NEVER came to fruition."
bad,management has unrealistic expectations. hourly associates are not treated well. management is expected to work long hours. no home work life balance
bad,"Stop laying off people without proper warning ahead of time instead of mere hours after they've showed up for work. Also, hire more people full time instead of saving money in benefits by utilizing mostly part time employment."
bad,Walmart is not a bad job but I was put in a bad store.  I had all new employees and was thrown into a PIC position with no training.
bad,"i wish it was a little more customer oriented.its all about the associate just not the management,its ok place to work just not easy to move up."
bad,"although the pay is quit great for this day and age."
bad,very busy and a lot of hard work. I learned a lot. had to work holidays. good benefits. don't like the way the company is ran
bad,"sales transactions, vendor assistance, customer service, and maintaining cleanliness of retail store. Stocking shelves and on occassions inventory"
bad,"Was hired for store standards under the understanding I required more than 22 hours a week. The first month was incredible, the pace at the time was very fast with tons of customers during the Christmas season and work was actually pleasant, however, as time went on I found myself working at times alone taking care of the lot, customers, maintenance and the back room some days for an hour or two but other days for essentially a full 8 hour shift. None of my complaints were taken care of, everything was chalked up to ""that's the way it is"" or ""we're handling it"" and yet nothing came of it. The supervisor I had was very approachable and understanding so no fingers being pointed in her direction. If you're looking for a company that provides good pay, stable weekly hours and no empty promises this probably isn't the company for you, however if you're someone with no understanding of the MOL standards and just want to get whatever little money their willing to pay you at the expense of your safety, time and emotional boundaries feel free to join."
bad,bueno en esta empresa aprendes  a distinguir el que vas a trabajar y no ha ser amistades y hablar sobre trabajo no meterte en la vida privada de nadien por que se viene los problemas y aprendi mucho a saber tratar al cliente y saber que siempre el cliente es primero ate todo
bad,I was able to grow and learn the business they work you hard and pay you little but you can move up quickly if you put in the work. They will also work with you and your personal schedule if your in school.
bad,I have learned so much working for Walmart. I am still employed with the company but i am looking for something new i love a challenge and i am eager to learn!
bad,you have to watch out for yourself now don't get me wrong all Walmart's are not the same but the one in Cleveland ms needs a lot of help
bad,"Management was good, hours were not stable. Co-workers were friendly, maintaining order in the women/girls department was hard when the customers don't put back the item they got it from."
bad,"Very busy, customers were wonderful might have had a few problems here and there. They need to pay more, the management need to take a leadership course. My co-workers were great team leaders, the hardest part of the job is giving your all and know one recognize it."
bad,I worked as a cashier. I assisted cusstomers with the items that they bought. I alkso bagged the items for them. I helped them find items that they were looking for.
bad,not the best palce to work but it pays the bills as long as you can keep to yourself and listen like a lost puppy. management asks more out of you then possible and then you will receive disapinary action for not completeing it in the time allowed
bad,Company is great for cross training for other departments. Wages are competitive and get a yearly 40 cent raise. The company is not as understanding of people with children and families and the hours are demanding.
bad,not saying anything bad about it but just work there yourself and you can find out for yourself.never a great place. walmarts not even fun to go in if you don't work there
bad,"however work became very stale"
bad,No real training and management was scattered.  Schduling was never correct.   I enjoyed my work but would it enjoy it more if I had more direction and a better understand of what they expected of me.
bad,Sign in and do what looks like needs to be done on the sales floor.  Most employees are cranky or in their own little groups that new employees are not welcome in. Management doesn't manage.
bad,as if running a cash register and dealing with people isn't hard enough you must learn to stock and to clean or zone your area the bosses hold stuff over you for a long time and when it finally eats at them they will fire you two weeks later not a job id remotely recommend
bad,I didn't like how they did training. It was all on the computer and then when you got out to the floor you had no idea what you were doing because the computer videos didn't help.
bad,customer service was a big role we as associates had to display on a daily basis I had to zone my are making sure everything was neatly and in order and also put out merchandise daily.
bad,"Walmart was a good experience, working as a team and as an individual. I worked mainly in the outdoors/seasonal department, which required heavy lifting and a lot of outdoor work."
bad,"Advancement is optional but not always guaranteed."
bad,No haces el trabajo que te corresponde por hacer el de otras areas que no te pertenecen promueven a mejores puestos a sus amigos no se basan en experiencia ni tiempo que llevas laborando con ellos gerencia no le da seguimiento a los problemas
bad,It's pretty much what everyone thinks. They ask a lot of you which may not be in your job description. Management wasn't anything to write home about.
bad,"A typical day would be me arriving at work and cashing out customers for majority of my shifts. On occasion i would assist other departments with stocking or work in customer service, assisting in taking customers returns and exchanges. I find this job unpleasant due to the poor management. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the unprofessionalism demonstrated within management, and the most enjoyable part of my job was the relationships made with other co-workers."
bad,This company does not allow for many advancement opportunities.  There is plenty of room for improvement in the way in which employees are treated.  There is a nice sense of community among the lower level employees however.
bad,"I didn't find it helpful. They didn't train me as well as they should have. I had to learn on my own. I worked over-night so I was the only  one up front, so I had no help."
bad,was my first job taught alot was an ok place to work coworkers were nice customers were nice some were crazy was great time knowing people
bad,you may get 35 hours one week and 10 the next. would not grant requested day off even for a medical emergency. enjoyed working with the customers and co-workers.
bad,"Up until the new store manager arrived the company was an amazing company to work for. the store manager that retired was very good at being the store manager, he respected the associates, he made them feel like they mattered. then the new store manager came in and she felt that she could not trust anyone in the building, anyone on management and that she didn't try to accept any associate, and that we wouldn't have loyalty to her. what she did was assume that we were already going to fail her, and began writing all associates up that she did not hire herself. she found a way to remove all associates under the previous manager. job security was no longer with that particular store. the company as a whole is a great company to work for, if you can get the right management team."
bad,The most enjoyable part of that job is the coworkers.  The people are decent people to be around.  Some are really positive and have taught me ways to improve on the job and in life.
bad,"they are not the best company to work for, they tend to play favorites with their employess, and they dont like to work around peoples schedule."
bad,"Come in stock for 6 hrs and zone for the last 2 hrs. Learned how to stock, unload trucks, move pallets, inventory the merchandise, and zone. Management was weak and harsh on most days. By that I mean they were never happy. Even great jobs were done it still wasn't enough to please management. Co-workers were great. Hardest part was pleasing the managers. Enjoyable part was co-workers and the fun you have with them while working and the hour long lunch."
bad,"For the most part, I enjoyed working for Walmart.  I was treated well.  Training was adequate.  Most management employees were helpful, but under pressure to get much accomplished.  This sense of urgency was passed down throughout the ranks."
bad,"A typical day was simple. I clock in, do what I'm asked to do and take my breaks when I need to then clock out once the time comes."
bad,"Physically demanding, large workload "
bad,"On average the direct manager to your personal department is amazing.  They work with you to get you the most hours that is possible, but it is not always their choice and so no matter what your hours get cut because their manager needs to cut hours. The great managers include the managers up to ZMS,  The managers just above the ZMS get rotated often so they have an entire new set of procedures to learn so sometimes it makes it difficult for them to really have a handle on everything they need to know and how to best help the people that work in their area.  Towards the end of their season of managing that area, they are well versed and good at their jobs however there is always a great deal of favoritism."
bad,"I would never work for walmart again in my life time, everything you hear about them is true, avoid at all costs. I needed a couple more words so here they are."
bad,i have yet to have a bad experience other than no communication throughout the store
bad,"THE CSM's SUCKED, and complain about little things. they have favorites. and treat employees terrible."
bad,I will unload the trucks. management could be better. co-workers too nosey. Work hard and don't get paid for it.
bad,I enjoy working at Wal-Mart I like it. Sure there are a couple of mean customers but with a little patience and some smiles anything can be fixed.
bad,normal 8hr work day. The gossip in the staunton store was worse than high school literally grown people sitting around talking about everyone's business. Bad working atmosphere overall.
bad,I have learnt a lot from this organisation. I gained some interpersonal skills. I have improved my communication skills. learnt how to tackle with the problems regarding the customer service.
bad,"Physically demanding, lifting, bending, standing on the hard concrete floors. Shifts were 9 hours with a mandatory 1 hour lunch break. I would eat my lunch in 15 minutes and be ready to get back to work."
bad,It changes day by day. You have your good and bad days. It was great while it lasted.
bad,"almost always something to be done, some managers were sticklers"
bad,A lot of work not much work/life balance but wonderful managerial skills
bad,"My typical day was very busy with customers. I answered calls and directed them where they needed to go. I also helped customers in the store as well. I learned how to navigate around the store and how to use all of the equipment that my job title required plus a few more. My co-workers were friendly for the most part. The management was probably the toughest part of the job because most of the managers that were on the floor were not as helpful as they should be. Although the managers were not up to par I still figured out how to do most things that they could not help with. Finally, the most enjoyable part of my job were the few co-workers that made the time fly because we had fun while doing our job, also the customers that took their time out of their days to have a conversation with me also made my days wonderful. They were the reason I always went to work. Those customers were not always around but on those few days when they came in, it was appreciated."
bad,"As a cashier I normally complete cash, check, and debit transation with customers. I look up prices if I neeeded to. Sign cutomers up for credicards. I also worked in the customer service area and completed returns or exchanges. Working here was definatly a challenge. The Walmart I worked at was very ghetto and unprofessional. Employees would get promotions not based on the most qualified but who did you know or rubbed elbows with. they took away benifits for employees that work part time. Managers are not sympathetic and make you feel that you are not important. The hardest part is when there isn't enough employee on the registers and you are the only one. The most enjooyable is makeing new friends with the emplyees around the store. Other than that, you work like a slave here."
bad,"This company was awful, not only did it not work around my school hours at all, but they didn't stay within my hours of availability. When it became too much for me to handle with school the manager yelled at me for not being available enough. I was working about thirty hours a week at part-time."
bad,I didnt really like this job because of its poor management team. They are not organized and dont pay well
bad,I really disliked working at Wal-Mart. They didn't pay the employees enough for the massive amounts of worked they required us to do. There was not enough training for the jobs they hired us onto. So when an employee made a mistake we were reprimanded for not paying attention during the training we never received. The managers were overtly critical and rude to the employees and showed very little concern for the general welfare of the people working there.
bad,Management treats employees unequally. When you need management they are not there to support you or answer other customers concerns. The hardest part of this job was finding a manager and trying to get more hours. I did earn all my experience here without the managers half the time.
bad,"poor scheduling"
bad,"Overall the experience at Wal-mart was something i wouldn't mind doing again, just never for walmart"
bad,I enjoyed the people I worked with.  The company just doesn't pay well enough to make a living with a family.
bad,"meeting and greeting customers, Customer service.  Processing cash transaction and returns.  Handled disgruntled customers"
bad,i liked my job it just wasn't flexible enough for my school. i was a cashier it wasn't to hard. i liked it i just wish it worked with my school more.
bad,"High volume fast pace great co workers good days bad days passionate about people and helping others,learned to coach co workers for success.sales of about 44 million a year.working outdoors."
bad,"horrible organization of products in back room"
bad,"The largest company in the world can apparently only afford to start at minimum wage and give 40 cent raises, poor Walmart I hope they make it out of that slump. yeah right."
bad,"•	Completed preventive maintenance on vehicles, such as oil changes, tire rotations and changes, wheel balancing and the replacement of filters "
bad,"very poor customer service from managers, disrespectful, never put the customer needs first, failed to comply with company rules and guidelines. very seldom teamwork"
bad,"satisfying customers, helping "
bad,although there was always work and ways to get raises the work place is involve with to much drama. the people like to bring personal problems to the work place. the teamwork was great but socially tge didnt work. management didnt always supervise like they should and everybody know everybody business. the hardest part of the job was going in and doing your job without the extra mess. they do have nce bonuses and christmas parties but you can only do so much before your tired
bad,"I felt that the pay and hours were acceptable. My problem with the job was the lack of care for the employees by the management. I did not feel appreciated. I felt they could have taken more interest in me as a person. I felt like a robot, like I was not important as a person. I feel that a good manager knows they can replace every employee, but treats them so well that they do not feel replaceable. They feel valued. I just did not feel valued."
bad,"A shift for me is usually:"
bad,"Internal & External apprehensions"
bad,This was a good place to work. The customers were mostly nice.
bad,"Wasn't a very good environment for me to work, although i had some friendly co-workers, but the management wasn't very pleasant."
bad,"Working at Walmart is like everyone says it is, worst company to work for.... Low wage; stress; management abuse; not worth full time! IMS/Receiving/ Truck Unloader is probably the most unappreciated, least paid position in the job."
bad,"While employed at Walmart, I learned to work the cash register. Hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers, working Black Fridays, and the day after Christmas."
bad,"I liked the co-workers, I learned alot about being more than a stock associate the hardest part of the job is when people didnt show up and made it harder on everyone else, the enjoyable part of the job is most every one got along to get the job done and then some"
bad,Wal-Mart never really punished the correct associates. I did learn how to work a register and fryer.
bad,they wouldn't work with me and my school schedule. they would make us take short breaks and made us work til late at night and then early the next morning. i would have to work 35+ hours and kept us at part time with no benefits
bad,"	Organization and Maintenance of Shipments."
bad,"The job itself is ok. Working with various people from different background is enjoyable. The people that work at Wal-Mart are generally easy to get along with. "
bad,Not a long term job place to work. Stressful company and disrespectful managers.
bad,"I enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart as an employee. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that they worked me all kinds of different hours of the day. I wanted a job that I could know I would work blank to blank. Not anytime, any day."
bad,"demonstrar meu interesse em contribuir, exercendo praticas de um profissional tendo em vista que busco me qualificar no mercado de trabalho e assim aprender técnicas e habilidades. Estou disposta a aprender técnicas e práticas para melhor desempenhar minhas atividades junto a toda equipe e dessa forma desempenharmos um excelente trabalho. Quero aprender tudo que for necessário para obter ótimos resultados nas realizações dos meus deveres e de toda equipe."
bad,I am a cashier. The pay is lower than McDonalds however the bi-wkly pay adds up after a long 2 weeks of work
bad,"This wasn't my favorite place to work, it was just way too much for me."
bad,customers are always right even when its obvious their not.  as a worker you have no voice AT ALL.
bad,"Begins with checking e-mail for any news or bulletins i may not be aware of,checking for any computer based learning modules I may have missed and checking with manager for any assignments.Our manager is very new,tho I have worked with this person before,so I'll make no comment.There is a good rapore in our department.co-workers are friendly and skilled  and work together.the hardest part of my job would be delays for insurance confirmation.I usually have an enjoyable day because the job is about serving people  and to me that is satisfactory"
bad,For the most part its and ok company to work for needs improvement in management.
bad,"Come in, have nightly meeting with employers and employees, binned merchandise, help stockers, unloaded trucks when needed, operate the machinery when needed, and did any additional work that was assigned by management.  "
bad,"Pay is good, work conditions are equal to any other factory.  Benefits were fair when I worked there."
bad,"There are target time frames for going without accidents, and if they are met the managers reward the employees with food."
bad,There were too many chiefs and not enough indians. I had to do what nearly every person above me said. I wouldn't get to finish my tasks because my boss for the moment has a new task they want put above anything else I might be working on.
bad,Extremely busy store taking care of scores of patients with not a lot of time for counseling. I learned effective successful pricing. Very good co-workers. The hardest part of the job was making sure that the otc freight was off the floor in the morning if the  OTC manager or stocker called out sick. Most enjoyable were my co-workers.
bad,Par for the course.  Exactly what you would expect working at a telemarketing firm.
bad,"I really did not work there long enough to make any concrete comments. However during my tenure,"
bad,"Not a teamwork focused environment unfortunately. It was promoted, but not sustained through its employees or management."
bad,"This job, while fun because of my team members, is not an ideal job for everyone."
bad,Benefits are okay but management is inept.  Typical day at work consisted of stocking the sales floor and customer service for the most part.  Hardest part of the job would be dealing with the management.  It was a mess.  There was no set way business and there were too many titles with many people filling the same position at a time.  No clue who to report to and upper management ignored employees about lower management.
bad,Always something to do; difficult work hours and schedules; a lot of customer interaction and cross training.
bad,"Theres always work to do, Management did not care about workers"
bad,Not a very productive place at work. Employees talked to each other too much and didn't focus on their daily tasks as much as they should've. Employees worked very slow. Employees were also very rude to fellow employees as well as the customers. Management seemed confused on how to run things at many times and didn't seem well suited for their positions.
bad,I liked that I was always talking to someone new. I liked that I could help so many people in so many ways.
bad,I worked at the company for a short time due to the hours and the poor pay .
bad,had a great time with the people i worked with we establish a family based friendships
bad,Many long hard hours which can be satisfying if you have the right leadership above you.
bad,"For a multi-million dollar store, you'd think that Walmart would be able to take better care of stock control and employee production. Poor management makes for a poor workplace and workforce. To top it all off, overtime isn't available due to greed. Expect to cut overtime end-of-week if any is accumulated during the week. Only good aspect is a paycheck and friendships built during employment."
bad,"-Lots of work with little pay or appreciation shown"
bad,"On a regular, associates stock, and clean departments."
bad,"Multi tasking- supervise associates, set-up features and displays, audits,stocking, zoning, cash handling, coordinate workers where needed, etc"
bad,"Learned a great deal about dealing with the public, had great co-workers but management not very supportive"
bad,Not the easiest place to work. Management doesn't care about the employees needs and they don't work well with circumstances.
bad,Top down management style that is not able to recognize talent from the bottom up.
bad,The store is widely considered a joke from other stores in our district for how poorly we are treated. There is no communication nor is there any sign of them caring about the recurring problems.
bad,They don't pay enough for the things you do. Management needs to work better at finding solutions to problems.
bad,I liked working there during rush times but management wasn't very honest about policy or employee reviews
bad,I needed more of an income. hours worked with my other job. Stayed busy
bad,"I  had a great experience being an associate at WalMart. My experience working there was one that I will always remember. The managers and other associates where very nice and loved their jobs. This made the experience good for the employees and customers. I learned how to use the different machines such as the forklift, and the hand held computers. The hardest part of the job was making sure that  nothing was broken when unloading merchandise off of the back of the trucks. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships that I built with management, the other associates, and the customers."
bad,A good job to work at. Steady income. Co-workers always nice. Managers always proffesional
bad,"It was a rather drastic change, trying to switch to an overnight shift when you're used to sleeping at night. However, I always made an effort to be punctual."
bad,"I went to work everyday and enjoyed it, worked the truck, helped the other people in the dept. stocking, guided them on what needed moved around to keep the dept. eye appealing. Ordered, trained any new associates any did inventory once a month. Helped the customers whenever they couldn't find something even if it wasn't in my dept."
bad,"I worked at Walmart for 8 years and had positions in many areas in the store. I had multiple responsibilities and a large area of the store to maintain. I worked the afternoon shift, so I had to know how to cut keys, process ammunition sales, and mix paint. Every few hours I needed to walk a third of the store and make sure there were no safety concerns, I was relied on to do propane exchanges and cover breaks and lunches in many outlying departments. I love customer service so I enjoyed my job, but Walmart seems to be trying to cut costs, and as a result hours are cut and there are fewer and fewer people on the floor to help - as one full timer leaves, they aren't replaced adequately, part timers are fired. As a result, customers don't get the help they need and are frustrated by the inconvenience.My direct manager would benefit from a little perspective, expectations were too high. I couldn't work there again, simply because it's unhealthy, the amount of stress and tension put on one person."
bad,"- 32 hour in  a week in depend schedule"
bad,"Wal-Mart is probably a great starter job and unless you plan on making it your career you might not want to stay so long that its hard to leave because your pay increases every year. Every day the job is the same its a very repetitive place nothing seems to change except the workload and amount of people there to help get it done. It seems that when people become Asst. Mgrs. they completely forget what hard work was when they had to do it but I guess it supposed to be that way. It seems that the wrong people are getting promoted as well, Wal-Mart does base the promotions on what a person has done, its really a who you know not what you know when it comes to getting promoted so good luck there. Also the pay is definitely not worth the headaches and body pain that received on a constant basis."
bad,Being a cashier you are treated like a toddler. You are the only people in the store that are watched like a hawk. Breaks aren't always given and lunches can become late or skipped even though you have to go before the 5 hour mark. Drama is a major key even with managers. Managers start drama constantly along with CSMs. Not recommended. good luck getting anything but part time unless you are a manager.
bad,The walmart community is a great place to work due to its friendly environment between associates.
bad,"I love to  work and learn new things at my work place."
bad,"Frozen Dairy stocker: Pick and stock shelves, provide customer satisfaction, be knowledgeable of department. "
bad,"Although, Walmart is pretty good about hiring from within, they do not compensate enough for permanent employment. It is a good temporary job while attending school or finding better work. The tasks assigned at work can be difficult especially with having to serve customers while being understaffed at some points. For this job you must be able to work in other departments as needed."
bad,"A work day is typical stressful. Everything is very confusing. I do my best but at times I do need a break. Some of the mangers do not not how to talk to us with respect. I feel as though I am being taken advantage of just because I am under them as an associate. I love my co-workers we get along so well. We have good laughs. I learned new things when I started working there but as days go on, everyday is the same. I would love to learn new thing everyday."
bad,It was not a pleasant experience working here. The hours were long and it was not a welcoming atmosphere.
bad,"Every day, I lean how to run  my  business and improving my business in order to increase the profitability. Also, I would make sure that every associate should work as a team to improving profitability in the company."
bad,Management was very hard to get along with. Hours and schedule were reasonable. communication was little.
bad,an ok place to work the co-workers was friendly and ok they want you to work until you cant any more but don't let you get days off
bad,"It is a very fast pace and a very busy job. I have learned a lot from my job experience such as; department statuses, managing prices and, satisfying customers. My co-workers were one team. They always made sure that everyone's jobs were completed. Walmart is a good job, especially for those who are looking forward to management careers."
bad,I would load and unload trailers as scheduled. I learned new equipment. I enjoyed teaching other how to use equipment.
bad,Very unprofessional staff and management. Not too willing to work with college students.
bad,Is a job but nothing I like doing. Pay rate is horrible. Too many rules.
bad,"A typical day at work is normal everything goes smoothly and calm. I learn something new everyday some times customers tell me thing that I do not know or things that I can not find. My mangers are always there when I need them or when a customers is needed. My co workers are strong and are very understanding and helpful anything that needs to be done is done at a orderly timely fashion. The hardest part of the job is on holidays or when sales exist, that's when the store is destroyed and are there are buggies and buggies filled up with things that have to be put back. The most I enjoy about my job is not only the environment but my coworkers as well."
bad,There biggest  down side is lack of quality training a video and someone showing you how to do a job for one day is not training.
bad,A typical day at walmart full of drama to many chiefs not enough indians bad communication skills amongst co-workers and managers but the most enjoyable part about my job was helping the customers and seeing a smile on their faces
bad,"Schedule constantly conflicts with personal life, Management purposely overworks you, then punishes for being unable to handle unreasonable workloads, and benefits are barely worth it."
bad,te permiten socializar con las personas y aprender hacer mas practico con las palabras para poder otorgar un buen servicio
bad,"A typical day at work was usually a productive day, however most coworkers and management were unorganized in providing tasks and direction. The hardest part of the job was working with some coworkers who refused to do any work up front, and stayed in the back offering no help during rush hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was offering service and friendly greetings to customers, being able to help them out and get to them as soon as I could."
bad,management were very overbearing and rude! i did not enjoy my time with this company!
bad,No one cares in Wal-Mart. Management will do anything to protect themselves.
bad,Walmart is not the best place to work. management doesnt appreciate associates and half the time they dont know what to do.
bad,"A typical day at walmart is very fast paced, a lot of work has to be done in a certain amount of time, long hours. In management you have to not only learn to be someone's boss but their counselor as well. Every one works and thinks differently and it is a must to treat people with the upmost respect and let them know you care."
bad,"Set up schedule of employees, get registers ready, count all money, open registers, stock front end, enter all informaions from prior day into system. The most enjoyable part was customers"
bad,"Running around helping customers and stocking Shelves."
bad,Unless You are going to be a manager you are going to be able to get much better pay at another company.
bad,"I did not enjoy working at walmart. They did offer a benefits package, but they use employees and the pay was not worth what you had to endure on the job, from management or customers. I would not recommend working there."
bad,Co-workers are like a second family. Management is nice and friendly.
bad,Job was good...enjoyed working there..loved being able to work independently.
bad,"Working in Walmart is very challenging, I learned a lot in retail when I joined the Company, co workers are easy to deal with, the hardest part of the job is doing overnight shift, and the most enjoyable part of the job is we treat each other with respect"
bad,"Very small"
bad,"working produce was fun the co-workers were great, the job alays kept me going."
bad,"I learned ever department and worked in almost all areas in the store but because management does not like new ideas, you are limited to your position and there are not very many opportunities to move up and hold on to your work ethics."
bad,tedious work with little to no encouragement from leadership inflexible hours and uncooperative team members
bad,"On a day-to-day basis, renting out cars to people and driving cars to deliveries."
bad,It's a decent stable job. I have learned a lot about individual people. It can get bad sometimes when the patient is confused about a situation but its usually alleviated with education.
bad,Inventory control specialist. I worked in the back unloaded trucks and pulled what the store needed. then at the end of the day I put back what is not needed. I worked in the back and put skids up in the air and stayed in the back.
bad,"mi horario era nocturno, cargabamos y descargabamos los camiones"
bad,"a typical day at work will be very busy having to deal with a lot of customers,the hardest part of the job is doing returns having to explain to the customers why we can't take certain items back and they misunderstand,they would argue about it and we have to take it to management. Management is not at its best but they work hard. My coworkers are fun we work together to get the job done the most enjoyable part of working there is meeting new people everyday,I learnt a lot working at walmart. I learnt how to be more open with people,handling difficult situations and how to communicate more."
bad,"I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers. It was very busy, which made the day go by fast. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult or rude people."
bad,"Busy days of stocking,and organizing. also being able to do many things at one time, and keeping up with great customer service."
bad,"While working for Walmart, I was able to enjoy a fast paced workday that allowed me to meet and interact with a diverse group of people each day."
bad,"slice cold cut meats"
bad,"place is ok to work at however it has way to many chiefs that can tell anyone what to do even if its not your area, for as large of a company pay could be a lot better."
bad,Builds skills needed for the retail market.Hectic but fun. Corporate management.
bad,My review with the company was very outstanding....I did a lot of good things for my employees while working for this company..
bad,"customers were rude, manger was never to be seen. wasnt the time for the pay."
bad,"Unless you are management, this company is better suited as a part time job to help pay down debts. Pay is very low and takes years to build to a decent wage, full time positions are rare or nonexistent and part time workers receive no benefits. "
bad,"Most enjoyable part is helping the customers, especially those that appreciate your help. They allow you to learn several different things in your time with them. There is always an opportunity for a job change."
bad,the most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with the customers and helping them when it was need and explain to them the difference between the items the were looking for
bad,I enjoyed working with them. They are a very interesting and diverse group of people.
bad,"Between changing oil and tires, there's always something to do."
bad,"I started working at the job before the store opened, so I basically helped build shelves, etc. It was a lot, it wasn't very productive, we was basically helping the builders build. When the store finally opened it was like a zoo, it was like the staff was all over the place, everyone moving at a very fast pace, so fast, if you had a question for one of the managers they didn't have time to answer. Then a month into working there they started messing up my schedule, as well as others and I wasn't to happy with that."
bad,"I work in the fabric and crafts department, I also cover the stationary area. I'm on my feet all day working a nine hour shift which is the hardest part of the job for me because my feet are always sore. The most enjoyable part of the day would be talking to the customers and helping them meet their needs"
bad,You are expected to do too much and not given enough incentive to do so. The work is easy but you don't have a set schedule. Work long hours with few days off. Not enough pay for the stress you deal with being in a customer service industry.
bad,"Walmart was my first job. It wasn't bad at first, because I didn't know what to expect. As time went on, I realized that Walmart isn't all that great of a place to work. I loved my coworkers, and being a cashier wasn't that bad. The management was a joke. Money-hungry people who claim to care about their employees but don't."
bad,They don't treat their employees great. you are more a number then a person. but they did work with your available pretty good.
bad,"The hardest part about WM is trying to satisfy the customers, and coworkers, and management, working there it is as if everyone is only in it for themselves, no teamwork"
bad,not a place I would recommend working only because they are not very family oriented. I enjoyed working here only for some of my co workers.
bad,"I got ran over by a vehicle walking to work for these people, and with my leg in a cast, tried to make me continue my stocking job despite my doctors note stating otherwise. Apart from that, if you like structure, and a decent pay work here."
bad,A typical day at work is just keeping busy. There is always something to do. Management are not the best at communicating and there is a lot of favoritism. My co-workers are so-so. The hardest part of the job is trying want to be there. Any job given itself is easy.
bad,"a typical day at work, what you leanred, management, your co-workers, the ahrdest part of the job, the most enjoyable part of the job"
bad,"My day starts with checking the stock on the shelves,  and helping people.  I help them find merchandise, check them out, check out prescriptions, help keep the pharmacy clean, and the line moving steady."
bad,dealing with your boss and supervisors it the only problem also the money and hours suck
bad,its a great workplace at times. the management is a little off but other than that i had a blast working there.
bad,This is the only company that I worked for that I felt was bad. They don't like to pay their employees full time but schedule them for full time hours. They aren't good with keeping up with their employees. The management is really bad.
bad,"Work not appreciated and pay was not enough on how much work that was put in. To much favoritism going on, management wont like you unless your kissing up to them but other than that it was ok."
bad,"Lots of rumors of inappropriate behavior going on with the managers. Favoritism, dishonesty, and a lack of leadership within this company."
bad,"Unloading Store Merchandise"
bad,all other hourly employees were nice. but management had unresonable demands... very bossy
bad,Just dont do it. Very unprofessional. Management is always hard to get ahold of. Whenever you do they tell you to go find a different manager.
bad,"nice people, easy job, fast paced, nice managers, good staring pay"
bad,not much to say about the three years that i was there  i boss was lazy so i did most of hi work if not all of it
bad,I went in everyday and got my merchandise from the back. I made sure that everything was stocked properly and cleaned.
bad,"Management isn't up to par, to much favoritism, they want you to be walmart's slaves, they say they care about your family but thats totally not true."
bad,Customer service is a key element for this company. Employee's are encouraged to help each other in all areas.
bad,"Met new people everyday, loads of different types of conversations."
bad,Urgh I don't want to remember this place at all. They would overwork us and if we got hurt- they tossed us aside. I got hurt twice and then they decided they didn't need me anymore.
bad,"Unorganized, they want you to work overtime with no overtime pay"
bad,"I learned that you need to have a lot of patience to deal with the customers that you will have. It is a very fast paced environment and if you can't adapt to that quickly, you will not last very long."
bad,"This Walmart, in particular, had a reputation for being a high-theft store. However, the security there was top notch and were eager to catch anyone stealing, harassing the employees, use weaponry, and etc. But what got my attention was that during the time that I was working there, there were not enough cashiers. The customers were constantly aggravating all of us cashiers. In fact, dealing with the customers with an always professional attitude was the hardest part of my job. My co-workers didn't always have attitudes but when they did it was because of the customers. However, I did enjoy the salary and how i was able to keep my job during the whole summer. Normally my hours took up my whole day and sometimes most of the week so I did not have any time to myself. Nonetheless, an average day at work consisted of multiple customers, some of them with an excess amount of items in their cart, and some customers that are just downright rude because they try to make up prices.The customer service managers were probably the busiest of the employees and were going place to place. The assistant managers were rarely seen and some were transferred to a newly-built Walmart on Cascade. I recently found out that the Walmart I worked at now has Self-Checkout centers in which would have been much needed earlier."
bad,"if this is your first job this one, is a good opportunity to get some experience"
bad,"I was hired for electronics, but walking into my first day of work they switched me over to Cashiering, which was a dollar less every hour. They completely screwed me over from the beginning. I made them sign a contract stating that when my 90 days were up I'd get a .50 raise and switched over to electronics where I applied for. Once my 90 days came, management had switched over twice, I explained to them my situation and showed them all the papers I signed and they straight up told me that there was nothing they could do about it. "
bad,I would get to work about 7 am promptly every morning I was scheduled to work just depended on the ratio of numbers.  Meaning depending on sales.  It wasn't a stable schedule no regrets I learned a lot.
bad,It was really strict job. Didn't really enjoy it at all and the employers were constantly rude.
bad,"Aside from the disconnect between the sales floor and the management, an okay place to work."
bad,"Walmart is far from the greatest job you will ever have.  They make you do a lot of work for not a lot of pay.  I have been there 5 years and they still wont hire me as full time so I don't get any insurance unless I buy it (which you can only do in October). They expect you to work overtime when its busy but are fine with cutting you down to 24 hours or less when they are not busy.  They talk a lot about how they do profit sharing every quarter but you will be lucky to get $20 if anything at all.  You have multiple managers on any shift and often they all want you to do different things for them because apparently they don't talk to each other, and many of things they have you do will seem counter productive.  I have a whole lot of complaints about walmart that I cant even fit into this review but the one good thing is that if you work there long enough or if you get promoted high enough the pay is pretty good, and it is usually pretty hard to get fired unless you don't show up or make the managers mad.  Also there are some pretty nice people that work there."
bad,"This company doesnt deserve all of the negative press it gets, you get a few bad apples in a large corporation and thats all you hear about. I spent 15 years with the company and wouldnt have had it been horrible."
bad,es una buena empresa con la cual puedes creser y creser ademas de una buena enseñansa por saber usar las telsxon para probeer los mejores inventarios
bad,"A typical day at work is unload the truck(s) received that day, pallet the merchandise, pull the pallets to the floor, then clean up loading dock.  The co-workers are good, all the unloaders look out for one another, but management is next to terrible.  They are never happy with the work done even if we finish all tasks before LUNCH let alone our shift, they find a way to shame us and even insult us, it is by far the hardest part of the job."
bad,"Fue un trabajo agradable en cuestión de de socializar, las actividades no eran tan pesadas, pero el personal autoritario si, nos exigían mucho por muy poco, y no me dio lo necesario para salir adelante, yo siempre cumplí con lo que se me otorgaba, pero ellos siempre buscaban mas, no fui totalmente de su agrado que me discriminaron mucho, por ello decidí cambiar de ambiente, eso si encontré muy buenas amistades."
bad,"Wal-Mart is a job for someone who doesn't have a life. I have been there a year and have only received one raise which was a measly 40 cents. In my year time frame I have went from apparel, to back room processing, to fabrics, and now currently I'm a cashier. I stick it out because I'm thankful to have a job because job seeking can be very stressful. I just feel Wal-Mart is unfair to there employees so with that being said I'm seeking something better."
bad,"Wal-Mart will always have someone ready to replace you, everyone has to be assertive or be negatively impacted by the company"
bad,"Working 3rd shift you see a lot of different thing that go on, not only with the customers but also with employees."
bad,Many people didn't know what to do. you always had somebody telling you what to do then them not knowing what they told you to do afterwards
bad,The only thing that was good at all was my co workers. The Management team was horrible.
bad,management was horrible and immature but co-workers were great.
bad,It was a great seasonal job during the Christmas rush with good people.
bad,I think u should get paid more with the experience u have. I had a productive experience while working for Walmart.
bad,"typical day at work, worked at the area of chemicals. I learn how to stock all items. I have to manage all of this with the help of my co-worker. The hardest part of the job was to leave the job... and the most enjoyable part of the job was... everything else.."
bad,"it was great to work Microsoft Word 50 - 60 WPM"
bad,"I did over-night stocking shifts and was still in school, so this job didn't fit my schedule that well."
bad,Its alright your work and efforts go unnoticed. No positive feedback management is poor and unorganized.
bad,Supervisors didnt know what was going on in own store. Causing interuptions in work and people being very un happy.
bad,"I personally loved working at the South end Wal-Mart but I also hated it at the same time."
bad,"All in all I very much so enjoyed my job here, I was offered a lot of opportunity to move up. However, with the pay being so low it was very hard to maintain a life while working here. My management team was very approachable and helpful,"
bad,Wal-Mart is a typical job it has its great moments as well as its dull moments
bad,"The managers, and supervisers were rude. Made fun, and picked at the employees. I was pregnant, and the managers put me through hell."
bad,I was bumped off of the schedule because I had surgery and then there was no hours when I came back.  Pay is decent if you can get the hours.  Higher ups are sometimes too busy in their own drama to make the store better.
bad,A typical work day would include putting up with dumb people and listening to your managers who are also dumb
bad,As a cashier i was in charge of ringing up customers purchases.
bad,"I would take anywhere from 100 to 150 calls in sales a day, its a fast past company with fast turnarounds."
bad,"I learned how to manage direct reports, set up displays, and order stock."
bad,"Stocked shelves, learned to use and telzon and binning and setting modulars. Management depended on the manager. Co workers were great. hardest part was dealing with certain managers. setting the mods were the most enjoyable part of my job."
bad,has almost no care for its employees but does allow for flexible schedule. has no benefits but the discount card is nice.
bad,the people that i worked for were rude and didnt care about their employee.
bad,"It seemed that when they trained you one way, another manager was trying to teach you another way. Very hard to learn how to complete your tasks and you never know which manager to talk to when you need to."
bad,A typical day at work would be cashiering and checking out any customers that wanted to buy anything. I learned more hands on computer skills while also communication skills with angry customers.
bad,walmart has become a company that would rather line its pockets and protect its upper level employees than stand behind its grunt employees.  my time at walmart was well spent but while we worked hard and did most of the upper level managements leg work i will have to say the benefits were extremely well but only for those who have been there longer than a year. the co-workers i worked with were excellent very helpful.
bad,"Decent job, low end pay, management was pretty good, just wasn't the job for me"
bad,ok a typical day at work it was a normal jo0b they are ok and some are better than others a lot of people do not like it
bad,Very under paid job and they mistreat their employees and customers as long lines at check out lines as cashiers always calling in sick saying they are sick when they aren't sick so other employees like me had to pick up the slack for the others that called in sick each and every day.
bad,"I've become a bit jaded about the world of sales and marketing, so my feelings about the most popular retailer in the world are certainly biased. Working at this company would not be unpleasant if they would hire enough people for the workload they carry, but then I suppose that's most companies these days. I did enjoy the challenge of having responsibility over several small departments, and having at least some amount of control over how they were run, but the vast majority of direction at the store level came straight down from the regional leadership, so it was very demotivating to be held responsible for something over which you had so little control. It was difficult for me to find inspiration to do well in a job that revolves completely around the distribution of almost entirely unnecessary commercial goods (hence the use of the phrase ""lacks realism"" in my review summary). Overall, I have learned a great deal about how a business is run, and how I choose to use that information, for better or worse, is up to me."
bad,wal-mart taught me how to be paitent... and how to interact with a wide range of personalities.. how to handle a high pace enviroment
bad,was out of order not enough people to maintain a safe work environment.
bad,"A typical day at walmart loggin in cell phones, allowing customers to gain knowledge on contracts from AT&T and Verizon. Binning in and out merchandise within the department of electronics to the backroom. Ordering merchandise for the department."
bad,Job duties were fine and within normal range of requirements for the position.  However staffing issues were a constant concern.
bad,"Set up morning meetings with associate's make a plan on how to assigned people throughout the store to work freight ,do weekly schedules  I enjoy working with people the hardest part o working at walmart"
bad,"very good stocking plan, do not like theyre work place. they dont really care about theyre employees"
bad,Great pay. lousy work environment. The spirit of team work and scheduled organization is much need here.
bad,"I learned working for a multi million year company such as Walmart is such a learning process in retail."
bad,Walmart is a place for starters because it is very easy work. If you need money then don't work at walmart.
bad,"I personally found Walmart to be more of a hassle to work for than a pleasure. The schedules were always a mess, they took no interest in family emergencies. Their benefits were not what they said for them to be, overall I believe the only good thing out of it was more experience with my customers."
bad,First of walmart is hard enough you don't realize how hard it is to work on your feet all day but all around the staff are pretty nice!
bad,I feel disappointed that the Wal-Mart corporate culture has gone downhill.  This is no longer the company it once was.
bad,The pay was decent. most of the people are good to work with. Fun. Fast paced in some areas. I enjoyed talking with customers.
bad,"Running cash register, customer services, front service desk,layaway dept, and learning everything i could while at the company."
bad,"A cashier takes payments for merchandise from customers in a retail establishment such as a restaurant, gas station, movie theater or a grocery, convenience or department store. If selling items such as cigarettes and alcohol, he or she may be required to check for proof of legal age. A cashier also process returns and refunds. Since he or she is sometimes the first employee customers see when entering a business, a cashier usually has to greet them, answer their questions and respond to their complaints. Sometimes a cashier has other duties such as placing price tags on items, putting products on shelves and keeping the store neat and clean."
bad,"Rude managers, expected you to do what they refused. Lead by demanding, not leadership."
bad,"I've been employed at Walmart for 11 1/2 years.  I've learned some great skills that I will be able to carry with me to any other career I go to.  I have learned time management skills, organizational skill, and problem solving skills.  I have also been able to become an independent worker.  The hardest part of my job has been overcoming the ""politics"" and being able to provide the customer with what they need/want.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing happy customers when they came in for particular items and were able to leave the store satisfied with their purchases and seeing the sales for my particular departments increase each week.  Management seems to have changed a lot.  In the beginning, I felt we had some top notch managers who had great retail skills, now I feel as though the hourly associates are more knowledgeable than the managers.  My co-workers for the most part are some of the hardest working people.  We are all in the same struggle to get ahead in life.  I can only speak from the experience at my store, but we have all worked together for so many years that despite our differences, when things get rough, we all work together and help each other out."
bad,I would stock merchandise on the sales floor for 8 hours a day 4-7 days a week. That stockers aren't appreciated . Co-workers were nice. Hardest part of the job was stocking water. Helping the customers
bad,Crummy job. Bad pay. Arrogant bosses. Just not somewhere I would ever go back to.
bad,"Wal Mart should pay workers living wage"
bad,"I enjoy helping customers, but the stress of getting what the management wants done instead or also is too stressful.  They expect 10 hours of work in a 6 hour day."
bad,I would start the day by walking through my department and verifying what needed to be stocked. I would offer customer assistance to those who needed it.
bad,"They don't treat you like you are a human being; they also do not give equal opportunities for advancement. Typical day is helping customers, calling other stores if we do not have the product. I work as a Cell-phone specialist, therefore I do cell-phone contracts, input information into the system, credit checks. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with customers and making them happy and meeting some fellow workers and building relationships with both customers and co-workers, however Walmart does not care about customers they just want money."
bad,The managers you worked with were very two-faced and didn't understand anything you tried to talk to them about. Didn't work well with the people they had to manage
bad,It was a job that God provided at a time of great need in a fast way. It was a terribly under paid job that was completely thankless. You had to work extremely weird hours and hard work for beyond low pay. If you didn't help customers when you were in the building (even off the clock) you were written up and could even be terminated for it. I believe they were even sued nationally for doing several unethical things and had to make things right for several thousands of people.
bad,I've never been so poorly treated in my life. I do not recommend anyone to work for Walmart
bad,"Customers were nice, good hours. It was always busy, so it was never a dull moment., but it wasn't hard at all."
bad,The hardest part of my job was the management but I loved all the other aspects of the job.
bad,"hard work, long hours, feet hurt, they dont really pay good, but the people are nice."
bad,"I typically threw truck everyday, which means that you unload the truck of merchandise. I was the smallest employee in receiving and not to mention I was a girl and I threw truck better than all the guys! It got difficult at times because of the heavy boxes, but the most enjoyable part was showing up the guys!!"
bad,"it was busy, co workers have bad attitudes, job isn't hard at all, I enjoy working with the customers"
bad,"Management changed every 6  months. Typical day: Took payments for items in store, watched for people trying to steal. Played door greeter for their breaks."
bad,Zoned the toy department. Helped customers find what they were looking for. Helped in other departments as needed. Cashiered as needed.
bad,"When I first began in 2006 I was hired full-time,benefits were good,we had work incentive bonuses and management was very kind and cared about me as an employee and person. Thru the years hours were cut, bonuses and incentives were taken away, I had to take a leave of absence due to having cancer and on the date I was to return I had to have reconstructive surgery and needed a few more weeks leave of absence due to the fact I could not put the surgery off. I was told if I missed even one day upon my return I would be fired. I was also told that even though I was a full-time employee that upon my return I would be part-time and now you don't work in one department you never know where you will work so in my opinion that makes it difficult for anyone to become proficient at their job it also is not fair to be paid a lower rate for a job that should be paid more. After the hours and bonuses went away the only thing I enjoyed about my job was seeing my friends. I still get a good reference from there b/c I did my job plus my department managers job for a very long time and they knew I was one of their best. That was another thing I didn't like was while my department manager was out on medical leave for 6-8 weeks I did her job..everything she did I took over but instead of temporarily moving me up to that pay rate during her absence they kept me at my basic sales associate pay rate but doing the job of a department manager. I was commended by managers and customers for my excellent customer service on more than one occasion..that was the other thing I enjoyed about that job, working"
bad,"When you work at Walmart, you are not properly trained before you are put in your position.  You are constantly moved from department to department and are expected to learn what to do on your own.  There are CBLs that you are expected to do, but there is no time to do them because you are also expected to do your work.  No proper training is given."
bad,Lots of siting around when self s don't need to be stocked hot working environment was a  pretty good job
bad,you wait on customers all day slicing meat and cheese and making sandwiches and you have a cold case and a hot case too. you slice and weigh meat and cheeses and cold salads and some hot foods for customers all day long.
bad,"did not like the night shift, needs more training. people ok to work not very helpful in training."
bad,"great work place"
bad,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers and management. Hard  work. Did not like that after stating that all temporary sesonal employee where hired on full time the deiced a 2 weeks later to lay everyone off. This was on Christmas eve, and left many of us without jobs after we already but off search because of promises upkept."
bad,"If you just need a job this may be good, but if you're looking to make a career out of it you may want to keep your options open."
bad,">Learn something new everyday"
bad,Didn't really have moment for me to grow in. They expected you to do your job and theirs too.
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of working multiple areas of the store, consistently multi-tasking. Although the fast pace could be trying at times, you would learn a great deal about products and where they were located. The management is a bit unorganized, rules are always changing. The hardest part of the job was pleasing the customers, that is also the best part of the job."
bad,The managers were absolutely wonderful. The customers most of the time were awesome to talk to and to serve.
bad,"It was Walmart, so the hours were extensive, no time off to spend with my family."
bad,using forklift drive around preparing orders for walmart distrubution
bad,"Bom ambiente de trabalho, organização do pdv e trabalho em equipe, trabalha a comunicação diretamente com clientes"
bad,"Management have become cutthroat and ruthless. each store is its own culture and family, but turnover is outrageous."
bad,I did not like working here. They do not think much of their employees.
bad,Walmart would be a better place to work for if they would give their employees insurance.
bad,Wal-Mart is not the best company to work for. They make lots of money but do not pay their employees what they are worth. Hates to give full time so they wont have to pay for benefits and The benefits that they do pay for are not even that good.
bad,Well I came in checked to make sure nothing is outta date then do all my cake orders.
bad,"answering 6-line phone directing to necessary department. "
bad,"Typical day-straighten displays from previous day, put out freight delivered overnight, receive incoming freight from DC and vendors, put out same. Customer service, cashier. Price changes, daily counts of more expensive goods. Process claims as needed.  I learned how much work I can do in a day.  Too much management.  They mainly left me alone to get work done but at the same time didn't provide coverage for breaks or end of shift making it difficult to follow all meal/over-time guidelines.  Co-workers were good when I had them which was rare.  Getting all the work done by myself during busiest times of year. Most enjoyable - Customers as always."
bad,"Managers weren't team oriented, everyone seemed to just go through the motions."
bad,Too much drama although very easy work. Management didn'tt care about it's employees. Learned how to efficiently use cash register and bag groceries.
bad,i liked working at walmart it was a well organized company with good benifits. i learned alot of new techniques to build bikes and furniture while i was there. the hardest  part about the job was dealing with new employees who thought they were the bosses
bad,"I stocked shelves over night. It was a job and it paid, but it wasn't very good."
bad,"Day of work is fast paced and a good experience working with people and.Management is very helpful. And, I.Like working and experienced being around different Ethinicites.Hard part is trying to keeping everyone focused on the qualty and keeping a very   good attitudes.Seeing them satified with quality and customer Service  I,do.like working with my Customer Manager Maria.A ,It's very is a competive place to work for."
bad,"It was a job that i did well, but there are too many things involved & almost no promotion opportunities to continue. Its not a job I ever want to go back to."
bad,"A typical day at Wal-mart was to stock shelves and assist customers with items in store. I learned that team work is imperative. Management was difficult to work with in the beginning, once we discussed ways to work better it was fine. Co- Workers at Wal-mart were a challenge. Some workers didn't come to work and the responsibilites fell on me, nut it was my job to make sure I did what was asked. The hardest part of the job was trying to get the products put away in a timely manner and assist customers when I may spent 30 mins trying to help them. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to help others and take the time out to their needs. The smile on their faces were priceless."
bad,"Monitor Customer Service Desk"
bad,the people you will work with are great. but working for the company it always seemed a little to crazy. managers didn't stay on top of things very well and never gave anyone enough time to do there job. they are always understaffed and they environment seemed flustered.
bad,"Aprendi tudo um pouco no caixa."
bad,claims out damage merchandise I love working with my co worker
bad,"Poor Management"
bad,"Working for Wal-Mart was one of the worse decisions of my life. They work you like a slave, and pay you absolutely nothing. Your schedule is never consistent, they expect you to have no life BUT walmart."
bad,Graveyard shift for remodel/set-up new part of store for four months but nevered got called back for part-time as a Walmart employee
bad,"When you get hired by Wal-Mart you start out as a temporary associate. This will Typically last about 90 days. Which is just before you get your 10% discount. They will ask you to reapply again after about a month, and will offer you another temporary position in which you will have a much larger chance to be hired permanently. There are rare cases in which you will be hired directly."
bad,"its work. When you need a job desperately, they will hire you."
bad,just help customers in your department. Most of management is disconnected to hourly staff. Hours and days off change all the time. Little pay compared to time missed with family.
bad,Typical work day is usually very stressful and not worth the pay. Mangers really only care about themselves and not the employees. Although the other people you work next to are great to work with.
bad,"It was a little bit frustrating. i learned there can be very impatient people, and the management pretty much cussres you out when you don't comply or understand. the co-workers are always sad, and dealing with the customers there was intense. the best part of my job was learning a lesson on how to get chewed out."
bad,"~and eats it's own rotting cadaver. "
bad,"They dont care about people, and its all about what they want and not what u need to get the job done."
bad,"•a typical day at work"
bad,"A typical day was a slow environment."
bad,"Unloading freight for each apparel department. I have learned that you never know what people are going through in life, so it is always great to be courtesy and go the extra mile to help. My co-workers are great. The hardest part about the job is trying to help all the customers on busy days. The most enjoyable is helping customers in any way possible."
bad,"Some good benefits, but the overwork with little compensation cancels this."
bad,"Things were always busy,  when running a dept. there is never any downtime.  Always checking in stock and taking inventory.  Not only does the dept have to taken care of but employee issues had to be dealt with as well. "
bad,It was an okay job. It could be really stressful at times. The hours were decent but odd. Some days you would work morning and some days you will be there till 12 the next day. I learned that you have to have a lot of patience not only for your customers but for the management. The co-workers were friendly and willing to help. The hardest part of the job was making sure you were busy all the time especially when it was dead. I enjoyed meeting new people.
bad,I worked their for a year did the supervisor position and only got paid for cashier pay which way minimum wage. 
bad,Good place to workIt was a good entry level job.It is a good starter job for a young person.
bad,good place for work experience and very fast paced if payed better would have loved to stay
bad,Overall negative environment. Would not recommend as a place for long term employment.
bad,"Greeted customers, answered questions regarding the merchandise in the store.  Open and closed cash registers, while performing tasks such as counting money and cashing checks."
bad,Everyday is the same routine. The managers are fine. I learn how to work with people who may seem impossible to work with. 
bad,The typical day starts with helping customers and stocking the floor which is never ending 
bad,"Helping customers, cashier, and folding clothes, along with showing jewelry. "
bad,A typical day would be making sure that my customer  was very satisfied that they had everything that they need to make our day go smoothly. I learned great customer skills. The co workers were nice and help out when you needed them too. It really wasn't anything hard about working here. The most enjoyable part of the job when getting to meet new people.
bad,Walmart.com was a super slow work enviroment. I spent most of my time there sweeping. very boring.
bad,"The work enviroment was fine its the corporation itself, and the way they treat employees thats a difinite turnoff, which lead me to go back to school and persue my Degree."
bad,"my most terrible job ever. walmart is a great place to shop, but what goes on the inside is not right. they treat their associates very badly"
bad,worked many different areas and different hours. worked front door and electronics
bad,"When I was working it seemed like there wasn't ever enough cashiers to cover the front end and we never had any one to push the shopping carts Management wasn't great, but the leads were very nice and always there to help. "
bad,"Los días que labore fueron agradables, conoces mucha gente y aprendes a manejar muchas situaciones complicadas, recibes apoyo de tus compañeros."
bad,"The way they treat their employees is poor. When I was on medical leave I did not receive any compensation or benefits, as a matter of fact I was terminated five months after returning."
bad,"As a cashier you are going through a lot with customers, co workers, managers, prices, items, price changing, coupons, etc. Some people have good days and some people have bad days but you learn to deal with it all together."
bad,It was job that I did when I got out of high school I did enjoyed but then I got sick
bad,"Stocking shelves, customer service. Frozen, groceries, household, clothing ,chemicals every department."
bad,"While working on the floor, I had many duties such as cleaning up, answering phones, making displays, providing customer service. while working in the vision center, I made appointments, pre screened patients, assisted in selection of frames. I've learned a lot from this job such as customer service. The hardest part of this job was staying positive even at the busiest of days. The people I worked with were truly amazing, best part of the job and the benefits were great also"
bad,I mostly handle the  money and was helping customers.it was a very easy job to do But they dnt give many hours and the mangers are very rude like half of the day mangers are
bad,"This was the one job that when my shift ended I was ready to hurry up and get back to work the next day. Unfortunately I rode with someone to this job so when he lost his job inevitably I lost mine, do to lack of transportation. "
bad,"At first it is a good job. When I started working there I had to learn everything on my own, and nobody cared to help me. All management wants is for you to get done with your work, doesn't matter how safe it is, you have to get it done. Only work for Walmart if you are desperate for work."
bad,dont pay well. worked long hours for them not to appreciate what we do.
bad,"I worked with the company for over 4 years. They are not very fair, they do not reward their associates who actually do the work. But they are sure to reward the lazy associates based on who you know. "
bad,"Work every night and stock stuff in shelf "
bad,"I worked in the bakery cooking bread, bagging, and stocking shelves. My work day was was not easy because we had a supervisor transfer in and she didn't really know how to run the bakery. Things did not run smoothly and that was the hardest part of the job. I only enjoyed working on the occasional cake."
bad,"although Wal-Mart has changed through the years, from being family oriented it has been steady work. the co-workers have stayed the same friendly and helpful. management has changed from family oriented to business ethics. there was no hard part about the job because all the associates believed in teamwork. I learned how to run my department like a store within a store, learned how to order, receive and price and label items right to make sure they went to right section in the store. I learned how to organize, set displays, also stock and treat each and every person with respect in their positions. the most enjoyable part of my job has been my co-workers."
bad,job was very demanding but learned a lot about customer service
bad,The job as fine. The hard part was standing most of the day and having to examine and compare their receipt to the item purchased when the alarm went off as they were leaving the store.
bad,"Prometeram unimed para meus filhos e não tive, por isso pedi as contas."
bad,"Company doesn't care about workers, only money and labor. Wouldn't recommend"
bad,management goes out of their way to avoid any interaction with employees
bad,Wal Mart is a disorganized chaotic place to work. I would not choose to work there again.
bad,"I loved working here for a while, but then people became rude and disrepectful. "
bad,"If you have ever been to walmart, you may be able to imagine what it is like working there. It was what it was."
bad,A typicl day at work is working with customers. Making sure you have good customers skills.
bad,"Many coworkers complained working hourly positions was better pay than salary, making advancement in the company less desirable. Hard to meet work quotas and follow very strict procedures."
bad,"helped customers kept everything nice and neat, moved around product. "
bad,required to complete tasks faster than allocated time. example system requires 4 hrs and management wants done in 3 hrs or less.
bad,"A few tasks were ""everybody's job"" often meaning they went undone until it became a nuisance. Spending a shift trying to correct a full day of the previous shift being undone, monotonous and depressing for the most part. The essential part of the job was self explanatory, but I was shown their labeling method to more easily locate where products belong."
bad,It was a ok place to work. Hard to move up the chain. Didnt understand that you might have a life outside of work.
bad,"Wal-Mart proved, to me, to be a job for a high school or college student. Its really not they place to work for someone who has a family and is trying to provide a substantial living."
bad,Opreate cash register
bad,"A typical day for me was working with a team of employees to serve customers in a pleasing manner. Taking orders, filling orders, ordering supplies, and meeting the over all standards of cleanliness on a daily basis. For the most I enjoyed working with individuals that was respectful and felt a need to exceed in the work line. I enjoyed giving them their evaluations, and complimenting them on jobs well done. The hardest part is the act of disciplinary.. What I enjoyed the most was being able to meet and help people."
bad,I like when i had to teach the new people that start they first day at wal-mart all bout how walmart do think. I learn alot bout walmart and i was working without being supervision all the time.The management love the way i work and got along with veryone co-worker and customer .And the hardest part was time to go home becacuse i enjoy my day workin with people but i enjoy the most was when i had to come to work.
bad,"Good people, clean working environment. Con-getting lost in the masses."
bad,Turn back now do not work at Walmart u will do everyone else's job pluss yours and still get told your not doing enough
bad,I would recommend u never work here it is full f stress long days and bring told ur not good enough
bad,"The only thing this job cares about is if you came to work they didnt care about how you were feeling whether you were sick or not. This is going to sound bad but its true I worked as deli associate and I was very sick had fever and all I didnt stay home I came t work just so they could send me home for the day i didnt want to call out due to the fact that Im sometimes latebecause at the time I was taking care of my grandmother who now died of cancer, I came to work very ill told her I wasnt feeling well im sweating from my fever and looking very nauseous and my manager told me just to go take a 15 minute break and im like wow really?! so i come back i sat in the back of the deli not doing anything since u dont want me to go home im going to sit in the back and still get paid she had me around food as im sick which is a big violation, I would definitely not recommend this job to any of my friends"
bad,I didn't much like standing in one spot the entire time working.
bad,"was a great place to work. worked with my school schedule. managers weren't that great. co- workers were good people to be around. I learned how to deal with people with all different types of attitudes. the job wasn't hard at all, it was actually fun to me. you don't get a set schedule that's the worst part. work can get busy when there is a lot of shoppers."
bad,"It paid, that's about all."
bad,This was a decent place to worjk in the beginning. They got to money hungry.
bad,It was very unorganized. We had 3 different managers in the time that I worked there. No one ever knew what was going on or who was responsible for what. So bring on initiative! I found things to do to occupy my work even if it wasn't in my department.
bad,Hardest part is taking care of the customer! You might be scheduled for one position but you do everything else. Little pay for what you do.
bad,Very flexible with hours while you are attending school and the pay is very good in comparison with most any other retail location. They also don't impose any real goals for cashiers. So long as you are working hard you will be good.
bad,Walmart is a very stressful place to work at. One has to be very patient to deal with the vast facet of clients that come in every day.
bad,I never realized how much energy you must have in order to work here. Being on the other side of the register is no joke. I learned excellent customer service skills especially when it comes to disgruntled customers.
bad,"I liked my job in the beginning, however, towards the end, it became very depressing, disappointing, and not very enjoyable. My co-workers were constantly complaining about minor things, attitudes were poor, and my hard work was going unnoticed. In the beginning, they always gave me credit where it was due. Management was all over the place. I felt like they did not treat all employees as equal, even though they want to appear as if they do not discriminate. The job was not hard just frustrating because they did not have enough associates or cashiers. My job was not to be a cashier, however I ended up being one due to lack of employees. Constant complaints from customers since the company did not hire enough cashiers. I wasn't able to perform my job, as an apparel associate, to the best of my ability because I was busy doing other people's jobs & covering breaks. I enjoyed working with people, but I did not enjoy being pulled around, all different places like a ""puppet"" with no say."
bad,"I would check vendors and shipped merchandise in, process claims, and help out with registers and upc office."
bad,"Pharmacies are (for the most part) supervised by non-pharmacists. Market managers are concerned about the things that are not as important in the day to day operations-customer service, filling scripts, etc. Company does not seem to adjust to varied state laws-they want every pharmacy run the sam way; when you have 50 states this is difficult at best. Board of pharm could care less about policies of company-they want pharmacy compliant with their laws"
bad,"The best part of my job is the people I work with, no matter how difficult a situation I can always turn to them for guidance. The most difficult part of the job is terminating employees, even though I have done several terminations it doesn't get any easier. It is hard to have to let people go that you had high hopes for. The front end of Walmart is the busiest part of the store and I think if I could handle running it during the holiday season I think I can handle any challenge given to me."
bad,El ambiente laboral era agradable y con grandes aprendizajes en el trayecto
bad,The best part of this place is the people you will meet. The actual work ethics are not the best. They tend to not be fair and have too many people telling you to do things which can get you into trouble.
bad,They dont pay you enough for everything you have to do. Otherwise a good job
bad,"Enjoyed the interaction I had with the customers. I also loved the fast pace environment, the busier I was the faster time flew"
bad,this company is not what it used to be ppl seam to like drama in this place the management is not very well
bad,While I worked there I made all sorts of friends.The stores are always short staffed and associates are required to work out of there work area often which resort in poor customer service
bad,"as far as back room, work is routine, unload trucks and move frieght to the floor"
bad,Learned a lot about working with customers and money. It was nice to have a job were there was always something to do.
bad,while i worked here i was never acknowledge for the hard work i have done. so many promises were also broken. while i was going to school i gave them 2-3 weeks advanced my class schedule and they didnt like it was forced to quit.
bad,"If you want to keep your job, LIE. If you tell the truth...you will be fired because everybody else will be lying. I do miss my friends, customers and my health benefits, but after leaving the company, I felt like a giant weight had been lifted because I didn't have to lie anymore...what a concept, huh?"
bad,"I worked at Walmart for about a year. I did not like working there. The only good things about working at Walmart was that I got about 35 hours a week, and I was part-time. I also made nearly $10. Besides that, there was nothing good about working at Walmart. It could have been the Walmart I was working at though. While I was working there, the city the Walmart was in was at the time the poorest city in the country. It was absolutely awful."
bad,"Other than that Walmart doesnt lay people off and doesnt have much of a follow through, it a place where if you kiss butt and stay in the ""in crowd"" and are a total ""yes"" man then this is a perfect place for you"
bad,management doesn't hire new workers and too much job stress
bad,"management is not too concerned with employee issues, mainly concerned for production and sales numbers."
bad,I enjoyed the company and being able to socialize with customers to help make sales
bad,"it was work, work, and more work. the hardest part of the job was trying to figure out what to do. One manager tell you to do this and another manager tell you to do that. its confusing"
bad,"There were good parts and bad parts about this job. A day of work would be relatively easy, and the hard-ones arent so bad. The interaction with other employees is a good excperience. The hardest part of the job was dealing with people who abuse authority. Some people in management may abuse their authority. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers."
bad,"My typical day consisted of standing at the doors greeting customers, tagging returns, organizing carts, cashiering when I was needed. Management was ok, My coworkers were excellent to work for. The hardest part was sometimes multi tasking. The most enjoyable was meeting new people and making great friends."
bad,Empresa de prestigio pero paga muy mal a sus empleados aprendes mucho pero el salario es muy poko y el tiempo extra no lo pagan como deberian y es muy dificial subir de puesto
bad,i stocked all the freight that was brought in a specific department
bad,- eventhough we did lots of work managements didnt let us talk and work at the same time.
bad,stocked shoes
bad,Much simpler job with just pushing carts inside. Maybe help an older person with getting bags into their car but that was once a blue moon.
bad,Walmart is a great place to work while you're looking for a new job. They try not to keep employees there for long periods of time.
bad,Run cash register or floor associate. Sometimes in the back putting away overstock(binning/picking).Management not to helpful. Hard time trying to fit everything in such short shifts.
bad,"Put up stock, clean area."
bad,Depending on the department you work it can be very hard work for very little wages. The garden center is full of heavy lifting and constant moving product. Half the management isnt on the same page so sometimes you have to do double the work. After you move one product to one secion or shelf you have to move it again the next day. The only good thing about this job is the job security. If you get fired from this job you might as well give up on life.
bad,"co- workers were wonderful. loved everyone in bakery, learned to do my roses on cakes- best thing I learned."
bad,The company did not appear to care about the well-being of the associates who worked there.
bad,"Working at Walmart was fine as long as I didn't want a life outside of work. At first they were flexible, but in the year i was there, there were 4 different supervisors in my department. The reason I quit was because I requested a holiday off because I was going to be out of town, and they gave the new manager the holiday off but scheduled me to work. A typical day of work for me was to slice meats and cheese, prepare hot food using deep fryers, serve customers, do dishes, shut down the fryers, and other cleaning duties to close the department. My co-workers were generally a good group to work with, not just in my department but the whole store. The hardest part of the job wasn't the job itself, it was the scheduling, the late nights and not being with my kids, and not being home on weekends. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the interaction with other people."
bad,Very busy almost of the time.. this place is more concerned with production that accurancy
bad,The management made sure to tell you how you were doing which is a plus and on Sundays the pay rate went up. The only down side is when I told them I wanted to work part time because of school they still gave me full time hours anyway
bad,The company did not appreciate what employees did and paid very little.
bad,A typical day at work included the following:
bad,It was alright... Not the ideal place to work if you are looking to move forward within the company
bad,great way to meet new people and learn new things from different departments
bad,"As a whole, this company is NOT worried about their employees. In my opinion, when an employee is making you money, they should be a little more appreciated."
bad,"Learned to work inventory management system, check in vendors, stock shelves properly, run register, change watch batteries, invoicing work ie; paying bills, filing paperwork properly, bin and pick items to be put on the sales floor, receive merchandise through fedex and ups, unload trucks and finalize them after they've been received, mark down spoiled or outdated food."
bad,"My typical day at work is long and very strenuous. I working in the frozen department so I usually get around 6-8 pallets a night. I love that Wal-Mart keeps their employees around but management does not attend to those who do not work hard. The ones who do work hard continuously work harder every night to make up for the lack of help of others. From experience, the management at my particular store do not follow through with complaints or concerns and are more concerned with the work being DONE rather than HOW and WHO did all the work. This is unfair to the said worker who is working twice as hard. Also raises are less than spectacular and every year something else changes that affects what little bonuses we get as well as our hours we can or cannot work."
bad,"Friendly people, and very fun to work with. very fast paced company."
bad,i didnt like it at all i dont think anyone should work there overnights at all
bad,"Meet a wide variety of people, placed in every type of department so learned a little bit of everything"
bad,"Todas as organizações por onde passei teve algo novo para aprender , a ideologia e sempre a mesma busca da excelência ,trabalhei com grandes gestores onde comunicar de forma clara e eficaz acontecimentos que influenciam diretamente a vida dos colaboradores. Esse é um ponto fundamental para criar um ambiente de trabalho que prima pela harmonia. Que dê todas as condições para que as pessoas possam desenvolver seu potencial produtivo ,a parte mais difícil era fazer com que nossos colaboradores perdesse o medo do novo,mais quando isso era alcançado a excelência brilhava os olhos de cada um de nos ."
bad,"Typical day at work consists of unloading 1-2 trucks on average, sorting freight, pulling pallets to salesfloor, and then picking if we get to it in time. I learned a lot about the inventory process and how to function as a key team memeber to get the job done quickly. Management at Walmart is pretty bad as far as stuff getting done when you need them, as well as the treatment of associates. I've found management often times will have us place pallets in 2 or 3 different locations, without using any logical reasoning on where these pallets should go. It causes us to do double the work and just wastes a lot of company time. Co-workers are like co-workers in any work place. Some are very dependable, while others are not. Pulling heavy grocery pallets to the sales floor would be the hardest part of the job as well as feeling rushed constantly. The most enjoyable part is working as a team together to get several goals accomplished in an 8 hour period."
bad,"Walmart has a management team that is too large and not at all responsible for their own actions. No praise for good work, and reprimand for decent work. Scheduling is inconsistent, training is computer based with almost no hands-on learning before you're expected to perform at a level on par with 1+ year employees. Terrible benefits, terrible pay, terrible place to work."
bad,Very structured enviornment with many opportunities for advancement although maintaining full time hours is hard to acquire. most full time employees only get 32 hours instead of the full 40 hours a week.
bad,"Its a grocery store. I stocked shelves. I don't really have more to say. I had decent, for the most part, co-workers and a paycheck to pay my bills."
bad,At the Wal-mart location I worked at I was treated unfairly just because I was a new associate and my problems or concerns with my job task were not important.
bad,"A typical day at work was ringing up customers' items whether it was food or clothing, I learned that all companies are different when assigned to registers. Everyone shared a register which is very dangerous. The co-workers were awesome!!! Management, not so great when it came to scheduling. The hardest part of my job was being assigned to work the Self-Checks, stand around all shift. The co-workers are what made the shifts fun."
bad,"A typical day,Trying to find a pallet jack to work with,Dealing with unsafe conditions,Like broken ladders.Other than that its a good place to start out."
bad,"I was thrown into this job without cash register training. I had to learn it from others & by myself. Got no telzon training. All the 20-something ""supervisors"" were constantly critical of my ""zoning"" my area, and then firing me when they changed my work schedule & did not give me a copy. Once an owner of my own business, they were too strict about making us take breaks and ""working to rule"". I enjoyed the customers, however, and felt that I could generally talk to them & guide them toward extra stuff in order to increase sales."
bad,Everybody was very nice. A day at work was helping people and that is what my passion is.
bad,"The staff isn't so bad, it's the ridiculous things that need to be done. The way the time system is set up is for 2 people per aisle, but the management usually only sticks 1 person in an aisle (or even gives that person multiple aisles) to do in the time it takes for 2 people to do it. Other than that, not bad."
bad,"The Management is very indecisive and all on different pages for when it comes to management. They expect way more than what they pay. Good and friendly associates. Personally, it is a job, but that is all it is. It will never be career of mine by any means. I dont have anything really positive to say honestly"
bad,"Each day varied in tasks required, however, those tasks were not deligated efficient. A lot of time during a shift would be wasted looking for additional tasks or managers who would send you to a new task or department that needed the extra help."
bad,"I am responsible for directing, guiding and training department managers and floor associates; assisting with hiring, training, coaching and terminating when necessary. I must also track sales, maintain strong and safe floor standards, care for customers, assist in scheduling, planning for modular changes and customer events, tracking and ensuring successful and lucrative merchandise flow and sales, etc. I assist in these and other tasks throughout the store from grocery to garden center. I am directly responsible for 13 associates, 6 of which are department managers, and am often responsible for more throughout the store from grocery and fresh departments, to sporting goods and the front end."
bad,I worked as a sales associate on the floor. The company was friendly
bad,"Typical workday assisting customers at register. Learned the basis of customer service. My particular manager was awesome. Co-workers were very down to earth. Some had no clue what customer service meant, however, I wasn't the person who hired them. The hardest part of my job was being nice to customers who were rude to me for no apparent reason. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers who came to my register and made my day just a little bit easier with a kind smile or words"
bad,"aprendi muito,caixa,atendimento,reposiçao de mercadorias,uma rotina enorme que trago comigo,colegas de trabalho tinha uma otima equipe p trabalhar,um bom convivio c eles,a direçao nao tenho o que reclamar,nao houve nada dificil no trabalho,pois eles davam oportunidade p aprender e o mais agravel foi ter a oportunidade de aprender."
bad,"The first few years were great, but then management went down hill. I can say I learned a lot of skills while employed there. I have learned about customer accounts and privacy, check cashing and bill pay, and how to decorate cakes. I also have improved my customer service skills."
bad,"I don't mind working here. However, I feel as though the opportunity for promotion within the company is not as easy as they claim."
bad,"Um dia tipico no trabalho era a dinamica e a rapidez.Aprendi na empresa Wall-Mart a convivencia com as pessoas o amadurecimento,na area e ser humana afinal para nos que trabalhamos na area de departamento Pesssoal devemos saber ouvir e respeitar as opiniões dos outros.A direção e a gerencia do meu setor era excelente nada a reclamar todos sabiam lidar com a gestão.Aos colegas de trabalho um otimo convivio sem contar que acabamos sendo para os associados novos o cartão postal ali no departamento pessoal eles são os primeiros a lidar com agente e isso nos torna mais amigos e mais companheiros em alerta-los e ajuda-los a esclarecerem as dúvidas.A parte mais dificil do trabalho na minha opinião é saber lidar com as demissões,com o dia corrido de fechamento de folha mas nada que seja impossivel resolver.Digo que a parte mais agradavel dessa area é tudo,digo poque gosto do que faço sou apaixonada pela area humana,mas se for dizer gosto muito da parte de admissões e fechamento de folha.Departamento Pessoal é um lugar onde deve ter em primeiro lugar respeito saber ouvir e não dizer tudo que se passa dentro do setor como todo lugar devemos saber a hora certa de dizer algo de falar e acima de tudo tratar o proximo com respeito."
bad,busy busy busy you always have to be on your toes with this company. Theres no slow point really working at walmart. The hardest part of this job was one manager who i did not see eye to eye with and in the end resulted me into leaving to find a better work place
bad,"Worked hard as basically the only evening stocker at Walmart Neighborhood Market. My duties included (but were not limited to): Stocking Groceries, Helping Guests, Organizing, Cashiering, Receiving Shipments, etc."
bad,I think that walmart is a prime example of too many chiefs and not enough indians.
bad,Didint have much experience. Wasnt in my field of passion. I really didnt enjoy working here much. Although There were some great and caring people there.
bad,Had to work a lot by yourself
bad,my favorite part of working there was the customers. being able to just talk to them about anything and helping them find what they were looking for.
bad,"Difficult untrained management, Never enough help, Oppressive working environment, lack of concern for associates"
bad,stock clean do price changes daily counts organized backroom break down the pallets with the products came in the night before manage 6 associate knowledge of a handheld computer monthly inventory
bad,A typical day at work consisted of 10-20 oil changes and maybe 5-6 new tire orders. I learned how to change and clean headlights and some tail lights. There are some good managers as there are in every work place. I liked most of the guys I worked with in the shop. The hardest part of the job was unloading the pallets of batteries as they were very heavy. I really liked meeting new customers and knowing that i made their visit a pleasureful one by servicing their vehicle in a timely manner and making sure it was done correctly.
bad,cashier worked in shipping and receving able to use measuring instuments
bad,Before leaving this job offered plenty of work.If you was permanent the pay was great.
bad,I learned a lot about baking while working at Walmart. I also learned a lot about customer service.
bad,"Decent part time work but Got bored alot as my job wasn't needed all the time, and on off times they would have me doing odds and ends and it was to slow paced. There is also alot of work place drama that caused personal tensions and made working hard."
bad,"I worked at Wal-Mart for about six months, and I acquired several life time friends. There was no typical day at work. Never knew what hours you would be working until you printed your schedule. Worked from 5 pm-2 am several times, and still had to return to work and work until the next morning. Also would work until 12 am, and have to return at 7 am. Lived approximately 45 minutes away, and it became rough to not be able to sleep and have to be back in at work in less than six hours. Some of the co-workers were amazing to work with, while others had attitude over everything. If I ever had a bad day, it was not due to a rude, hateful customer, it was always over a rude, hateful co-worker. Because I was a cashier, I was told to return several things to the freezer section because customers no longer wanted the item(s). The Customer Service Manager would ask me to return them, and I would. When I was in the process of doing so, I was literally yelled at, and ""talked to like a dog"" over doing what I was told. Confronting the CSM about it, I was told just to ignore it. I was jumped onto several times over another person's mistake as well. The customers were the most enjoyable part. You would be amazed at how much you learn/hear when they come through your line. If given the opportunity again, I would not return to work for Wal-Mart because management shows no respect to the people that work for them. As previously stated, they are rude, snotty, hateful, and inconsiderate individuals."
bad,"If you want things done at Wal-Mart, do them yourself. Out of the many employees that work at Wal-Mart, only maybe 3 or 4 are ACTUALLY doing any work. The rest are chatting, smoking, playing handheld gaming systems, or flirting with each other. Management doesn't care, because they are a part of the problem too."
bad,"A typical day at work at Wal-Mart was not actually during the day, because I was a third shifter. The night would start out with a meeting for all the associates and managers. In this meeting the managers would assign all the associates departments to stock. I normally stocked the infants department."
bad,I was expected to do whatever management wanted me to do even if the restrooms needed to be cleaned. Management rules your day for you. Your normal daily tasks almost always has to wait for what management wants done first. They have time limits on everything you do. If you don't get it done on time you get wrote up. The lack of communication is one of the major problems with this company. I feel that respect for the individual does not apply for and to certain individuals. The best part was working with the customers and my co-workers.
bad,"A typical day at walmart would to stock all new merchandise that has come to the store within the last 24 hours. After everything is fully out and ready to go, everyone woukd then 'zone.' Zoning is when you go in every ile and make sure that everything is close to the front so that if a customer walks by then it will stand out to them. I learned how to give customer service. Now that i know how it feels to be both the customer and servicer i know what to expect on both ends. The management was strick. It keeps you informed on all information of the store, on how much money the store made, customer accidents, etc. The co-workers in there were easy to get along with because everyone would help each other out to get the job if needed. The hardest part of the job is stocking heavy objects by yourself such as if it werent as many people at the job that day. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people of curse and after all the hardwork was done you were able to take two 30 minute breaks and one hour break. The job was tremendous and showed me a lot of customer service skills."
bad,"Mainly Cashiering, taking funds, sacking goods, and giving receipts. At any time I could be pulled in to work the smoke line for lunches or breaks or to relieve the volumn in Customer Service or Money Center."
bad,In a typical day you are running around like crazy. you hardly have time for customers and get your job done
bad,I learned how to find different ways to greet a customer. i also learned ow to deal with a high volume of customers at once.
bad,"poor working environment, extremely low morale, zero support from upper management in the area of career advancement, the company will need to incorporate an environment of support and continued, consistent training for newly assigned assistant manager entering the company. Extremely high turnover rate amongst management staff."
bad,The people you work with quickly become like a little family. You all have to work together to get a job done. If one person calls in everyone suffers because they have to do their job and that other persons.
bad,"In charge of appointments, insurance authorizations and claims for optometrist. Did preliminary tests on patients for optometrist."
bad,I like working here it was a job to get me buy so i could pay bills
bad,"The management was very awful and would make work easy for those that were the managers favorites, while being very rude to the others. Poor leadership, when it came to organizing the employees with their tasks."
bad,"I honestly really enjoyed my role, lack of proper management, policy enforcement and guidlines, and a lack of support are reasons I chose to move on."
bad,"When sam died the company changed. I met him, and he was a wonderful guy. At that time it was Important to do a Good days work for what you were paid, but you were Appreciated for that, and shown. Just checking out after you collect your Item's should be enough to verbalize where managers are, Ever see one when the line get's long? The most Important thing that i could ever see was the morning meetings. this is where Managers all show suport on how we were going to make the million dallar mark. Not how we were going to help others with quick friendly sevice."
bad,"Management meets with everyone, but later will push you to complete all your task ""poitive renforcement."""
bad,I loved the ins and outs of the job. I got pregnant and couldnt keep working. The job itself was awesome. I loved working with people.
bad,"I worked here for a short period, but there was a lot of confidentiality information I had to know before I could do my job. It was overload basically on my mind. I felt no matter what I did, I couldn't be a good employee."
bad,Work consists of being pretty much being alone with little or no help due to lack of coverage. Running the place by myself management is pretty scarce they only help when its necessary. I have learned that I am very good at being in ither a team setting or in an independent setting. Co workers are not really willing to stay and help if need be or trade hours to accomadate you schedule. The hardest part of my job is taking a working break I feel I have no time for myself to grab a quick bite to eat or even just clear my thoughts for fifteen minutes. The best part is I love my cashiers they make work enjoyable. Staying late if need be to help me do my closing percedures.
bad,"muita cobrança,com poucos recursos ,salário ruim mas aprendi muito com relação a atendimento"
bad,Good working atmosphere with a lot of learning opportunities to make the job flow easier.Management was a little unorganized at times;excellent co-workers that provide daily assistance if needed.The hardest part of the job was accepting the fact that the employee would have to work on the clock and not get paid for overtime.The most enjoyable aspect of the job was being assigned tasks and completing them at the end of the shift.
bad,started in the photo department but later transferred to the bakery department.
bad,They didn't care about family and students going to school. I loved my job as a cashier inspite of that.
bad,"Everything that can be expected of low level retail work. Horrible hours, low pay, and treated like second class citizens by customers."
bad,nice hours friendly co-workers nice management nice pay but didnt like having to push carts
bad,terrible pay.. long hours standing.. move up slower than you could possibly imagine
bad,"A typical day of work would consist of unloading a semi trailer, pulling pallets to sales floor and picking merchandise from back room inventory. Walmart has not taught me anything any other employer from my past has. The Walmart management have been very satisfactory. I enjoy my co-workers very much i think they are a great group of people. The hardest part of the job was constant change in the way thing where done, one day my team would do things one way and the next we would be back to the way we did it a week before. The most enjoyable part of my job at Walmart was my co-workers."
bad,Good workplace friendly customers great associates easy to get along with co-workers overall great place
bad,Did not like the atmosphere. It felt as if I did not have a degree and was working to not better myself. It also felt as if I was not working towards anything except just a pay check.
bad,Poor scheduling by lower management. 3 hour shifts. not willing to work with staff
bad,Typical day at work just keeping the meat wall full and put freight up from truck delivery working for wal-mart you learn how to scan and process meat to go out on the sale floor. Also get alone with all my co-workers the only hard part of working in the meat deptartment is on a weekend cause that's the busiest days including holiday's. The most enjoyable part of my job that you get to see different types of people everyday.
bad,the most enjoyable part of job is going out of my way to help customers find things... hardest part of job is picking up behind continuous mess--especially on weekends...have so many co workers--all with different personalities...some quiet...some fun...management is respectful... a typical day at work can be back breaking... but again... what i enjoy the most is helping a customer
bad,A positive experience overall. There is little time to communicate
bad,• Responsible for unloading freight from truck.
bad,High pressured and no support from upper management.Frequently given tasks with no direction. It appeared most of the upper management team was under qualified for thier positions.
bad,horrible place to work for i love my job and i love customer service but managment does not care about their employees. I think the ceo's need to evaluate their managers.
bad,I stocked shelves and made sure customers got what they wanted.
bad,"On a typical day, I go in and start to clean my area. I order more money for the till, so that I would be prepared for the day. I stock the bags, receipt tape, and whatever else that I need. I help people with gardening ideas and I help them find the right products. I take care of transactions.I have fun with my co workers. I am outgoing and I always am talking to someone. A lot of my customers say that they come to my register because I am friendly, smart and fast. I know alot of people and I know about their lives. The hardest part about the job is there is no set schedule and also working major holidays. But the most enjoyable is my friends."
bad,"poor organization, poorly run, dull dead end job, long hours standing in one place, no skill required"
bad,stressful with little or no coverage and no help. barely get your breaks
bad,"Not what I excepted, but informative regarding Inventory Management."
bad,I worked in the lawn and garden then I got transferred to the deli. The money was just ok. I recieved plenty of hours but the managment had poor attitudes.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different people.
bad,Not enough pay for hard work. Many times their were not enough employees for shifts leaving extra work on others.
bad,Management was not what I expected they were not helpful with the needs of employees
bad,Very demanding place to work....focus on employees is lacking
bad,a typical day is okay. i learned how to work a telzon. management is ok. co-workers are cool. hardest thing is the attendance policy. the most enjoyable part is clocking out everyday.
bad,"I had the opportunity to open a new store with Wal-Mart in the pet department. It was a challenge, but I love a challenge. Overall it was a good company to work for."
bad,Don't plan on having a job still if you haven't been there that long. Even if you have a medically related scenario.
bad,Company has lost what Sam Walton made it and insurance benifits are so high the average worker cannot afford
bad,I absolutely loved my position as an electronics sales associate at Wal-Mart. Although I do not feel I was treated with fairness as far as my termination went. I lost my transportation and was fired within 3 months before I had time to get it fixed. I showed for work as much as I could but they still wouldn't work with me. And now I can't seem to get my job back.
bad,"Wasnt the most exciting job I've had, but it was work. The people were friendly and the customers were usually great. Not something I would recommend for people with thin skin."
bad,"was fun at the start,then it became a job(glad to go home). not good pay.staff was nice to be arround after work. staff complained alot while on the job"
bad,good benefits ok wages
bad,"The turnover was the biggest problem because there was many times where nobody could assist me on tasks involving more than one person. Poor morale also contributed to problems, although in the begininng morale wasn't a big issue. My supervisors really weren't that involved with me enough and I found that not really anybody in the store guided me enough to make my job easier. Favorability was also a factor, especially with the people that moved up in the company. I felt that I was not the right fit with the company and wasn't showcased in the right way."
bad,"I enjoyed the people that worked there and the customers. However, it was too repetitive. I am the type of person who likes a little freedom to move around in my workspace and multi-task. I prefer office work to being a cashier."
bad,Walmart needs to give employees more flexibility in scheduling.  Shifts for stockers especially need this. They need to work more closely with public transportation schedules..
bad,Walmart is a great company but the management field needs more work. The people there are amazing people. They work very hard. Walmart has its issues but that is every company.
bad,"Walmart gets good sometimes but there are not happy customers coming in the the store, upsetting associates ( coming to work angry and taking it out on other associates), and crabby managers."
bad,Wal-Mart DC is a great place to work for those who don't have schedule restrictions since they don't really work with your hours. The money is great though and there is always plenty of opportunity for overtime.
bad,My overall review is you have to love what you do and own it despite the everyday challenges.  A typical day at walmart includes a lot of multitasking and a fast pace invironment.
bad,It's an okay company for those that don't have a family to support it is a company that I enjoyed being at when I didn't have a family to support but now I have a family so have to move on
bad,It was an abuse of salaried positions. They cut hours from the associates then made management stay until we couldn't stand.  Set expectations that were not attainable to deadlines that were unreachable.
bad,"There is never a dull moment. You are constantly moving so you have to be in pretty decent shape to do the job and do it fast to keep up with production. The ""Higher ups"" are frequently lowering the time it takes to complete trips. It makes it a little frustrating because it is harder to earn your grocery incentive."
bad,I get the job done fast I like working non stop an it’s very easy we all work together to get the job done . It’s a very busy job . I just don’t like to work outside when it’s freezing cold
bad,It was like working with (assistant managers) an individual that had an ego to be milked. It was annoying. Once you learn the ropes yourself then they throw you a curve ball. I quite seriously wanted to slit my wrists working there. They under staff the place constantly and the huge majority of their scanners are broken.
bad,"The pay for the work is pretty good for our area. You start at a lower rate, but after about 2 1/2yrs your at top rate. You can potentially make over $45k per yr. However, it can be very hard at times to get all your hours, as they constantly are sending you home early for lack of work. Lower level managers can be fine, but upper management is very shady and like to keep you in the dark."
bad,Peers are messy. They are always busy and need help. Retailing is easy just have to have the mindset of just not making friends and people going to talk and make you mad.
bad,"did not like the environment but the job overall was not a bad place to work at. developed good skills and communication , and the people were great ."
bad,The hardest part of the job was the constant switch in positions but after a week it would go by smoothly I was a hard working individual who strives to do my best for the company I was representing
bad,Work there for 24 years and the advancement is slow management does not take any suctions that are given and doesn’t give all the tools to do the job correctly
bad,"There is no typical day at Walmart, you may go in with a plan for what you want to accomplish that day but having to cover the work of other shifts always put you behind."
bad,Most of my co workers and I had found this was not a great place to work. By now it might be a bit different because they have made pay increases and hired new people as management and cashiers etc. but given the modal they set it might not be the best place to work at this moment I cannot think of any problems I experienced that would apply to other store however I know I do have some but can’t remember the
bad,"Walmart has given many employees many opportunities, however, they have recently changed their corporate structure making it hard to wish to advance your career."
bad,Pues no muy buena experiencia con el personal aguante 2 años
bad,"Okay place to work , some management not so manager material, balance of work and life isn’t hard when they switch hours and give one day off between while on nights"
bad,"The work at Walmart was very fast paced, dead lines are very important with this job, if you do not complete your job within the time limit, then you are slowing down your other co-workers."
bad,The pay is good but it’s not worth your integrity or sanity. It doesn’t matter which location you go to it’s always gonna be a manager that picks with someone especially if you are knowledgeable they will try to get rid of you.
bad,I love my job and am thinking of making a change and expanding my knowledge.  Walmart has given me great opportunities and I want to look at what else is out there.
bad,"This is an ideal job for a part time school kid or part time college kid.. "
bad,"It’s not the management that the stores have that’s the issue it’s corporate expectations and no training of management, I was a Zms but I ran front end and trained my asst managers because no one else could, I did schedules, Black Friday, customer relations and back offices and front as well as Human Resources. All as a zms hourly associate."
bad,"Walmart is a Great place to shop for the entire family. From fresh fruits and vegetables, to the freshest deli department. You can pick up complete salads meals, quick heat and serve. A very good quality bakery. Seafood department. Call ahead and even pick up your order."
bad,The job is easy but dealing with some managers is hard unloading truck and stocking shelves and working with customers is not bad pretty good work and good pay to start
bad,They are happy as long as they need you in their corner doing something but after that you don't exist and are replaceable it's an amazing job if and when you get to do your job but it gets super complicated when you have to do your job and other people's in other departments
bad,"Unfortunately, you're just a number for the most part to Walmart. They have a high turnover rate and could use some more attention to safety standards. If they were able to step up their game in terms of being more reasonable with their workloads, their distribution centers would be feasible to work for. Right now, production demands exceed staffing and there are many things that get overlooked. Safety is one of those things."
bad,Its reccomended not to mingle with ohter employees and stick to yourself. Its a great way to test how calm you can be during stressful situations while mainting a smile and ensuring the customer is satisfied with their visit..
bad,"When i first started everything was great, money was good, breaks were long.  Then everything went down hill, stress everywhere.  Expectants to do everyone elses job once you finish yours.  The managers life is more important than you own"
bad,"Overall the pay & benefits where great. But working there as a whole sucked. The DC treats you like a pack mule. They are only supposed to call you in for OT 2 weeks. The 3rd you are supposed to have off but they dont care how hard they work you & what it does to you mentally. They say they have a 0 tolerance policy in harrassment, but it's not enforced, especially if you are a good worker and can make your numbers. Their sick and vacation policy is the most confusing thing ever, some kind of a point system and it doesn't matter if you've been a loyal working for 25+ years or how you missed those days, they'll let you go."
bad,"No hay trabajo en equipo, la carga de trabajo por colaborador es ridiculamente pesada para un salario miserable, son 2 o 3 colaboradores para atender hasta 6 o 7 departamentos."
bad,Walmart does work with college students on scheduling hours around classes. Walmart can be a fast paced and demanding job depending on what department you are working
bad,"I was thrown out on the floor with very little training and told I would be aloud flexible hours for school, but once working for the company you must have open availability or they will fire you."
bad,The New Boston Texas Walmart has terrible management!!!! They have no loyalty to employees needing help. No I wouldn’t recommend even giving them business
bad,I enjoyed my coworkers. Most of my managers were wonderful. the workload was unrealistic due to being short staffed. we were disciplined for not doing the workload of 3 employees.
bad,Walmart is Wal-Mart... no matter what you are going to have problems just as much as the customers. Being able to stay with Wal-Mart shows how strong you are; because although it comes with issues it’s also teaches you how to problem solve and deal with all different kinds of people.
bad,"This is a place where the work is easy and the customers are usually understanding. My only issue while working here was the management. Having kids at home and having daycare means i can only work certain hours. My manager kept scheduling outside my avaliable hours, that were in the computer system. Since they go on a point system i ended up leaving my job before getting fired."
bad,"When you start at walmart they make you feel like family. They have great benefits. They have 401k, health, vision and dental insurances. Life insurances and ways to cover you if your sick."
bad,Not enough structure and teamwork in order to take care and satisfy our customers needs. Needing more training to accomplish in order to maintain and build customers relationships and prosper. Hardest is not being able to keep inventory stocked because of inventory delays which is sometimes life threatening. And making management understand this for our customers health and not always about the dollar but the empathy and well-being of our customers.
bad,"Days and Weekends are busy. But past 8 its practically dead."
bad,When someone calls out of work you have to work 10x harder and the things you put up with is all on you and how you handle things in a work environment.
bad,Health Benefits and pay rate is good the only things I dont agree with is how much the system has changed the managers dont really show they care for their employees and it has become such a stressful job due to not having the equipment you need in order to get your work done in time and having to work 12 long hours with only two 20 minute breaks can be a little hard if your not used to working the long hours also we are always feeling rushed due to how much work they want us to get done.
bad,your average day at walmart as a cashier is greeting people and asking how their day went; asking if they found everything they were looking for in the store. money handling is another task as well. cleaning up you station and making sure that you bag everything for the guest in a neat and timely order
bad,"I have never worked at a place that wouldnt accept doctors notes. Their new attendance policy is absurd and unsustainable. For those of us with poor health, are not given a chance to justify why we didnt come in. I won't work when im sick because thats disgusting, and im only introducing more germs to the already over populated environment. Which leads to more call ins and etc. The management was beyond terrible, and getting things fixed was pulling teeth."
bad,"Was very good when first started, but has gone down hill as time went on. They fail to fix or replaced damaged or broken equipment. Have put a time limits that fail to count for anything but perfection, no costumers asking questions or help, and perfect item placements. they know about problems but refuse to fix or keep putting on. Time limits are all that matter to them now."
bad,The managers there don’t try to understand you they only think of themselves and the company and not you as a human being that was there only down fall
bad,"Management is pretty bad and mainly care about themselves, pay and benefits are really good and you work with some good people. Easy job for decent money"
bad,"Poor communication and almost no respect from management. They don’t think we know how to do our job, and they overall don’t know how to treat there employees overall."
bad,Enjoyed working there had a blast only reason i left was i moved out of area and want to try my skills in other things where im more comfortable and can make a career out of it
bad,Did not like working for big corporate they think they are always right kind of company. Do not rain for work experience and training modules are a joke
bad,The management at Walmart needs to learn how to treat their employees! You talk to people how you wanna be talked to !! If something goes for a regular associate it should go for a manager also !!
bad,Ok to work at but not very good pay raises. Moving up in the only way to receive a good pay increase but it tends to not move up very quickly after that. I would not recommend Wal-mart as a company to grow with and to make a career out of. A lot of negativity and unhappy employees. Health insurance is average.  I would recommend a supervisors position over a salary manager. You could work 70 to 80 hours during the holidays on 36k a year as a salary manager.
bad,"great company fun people alway exciting lot of different people you get ot see. nice flexible hours understanding managers, great people always open and ready for new tasks"
bad,Walmart was a great place to work for but things have gotten ruff cut employees down to half raised the cost of health benefits by  doble  annual raises are based on 2% cost of living increas
bad,"Management sucks, didn't care about the associates. Other associates were hard to get along with. You're better off keeping to yourself, doing your job, and going home. Walmart doesn't care about the problems they currently have nor care about the ones they'll eventually create in the future."
bad,"My manager threw a TC because he was upset always yells about us being behind by not being 3 hours staged ahead when increasing our maximum number of orders by 250 in an area that can only hold 45 orders max with each hour having 20+ orders with only a handful of people and parking lots almost full at any given point. Never listens to what we say and indefinitely likes the people who shop for the customers better. If you are okay with constantly being yelled at, being put down for everyone doing their best, and a 40 year old man having hissy fits and throwing stuff around you then this is the job for you."
bad,"working at Walmart was ok, I felt like I wasn’t really committed to it like I was my other job, but overall I felt that the staff was very helpful they made it their mission to help you."
bad,Company is making complete changes of their culture.  A typical day is to maintain a stressful physical and mental state for 10+ hours with two 15min breaks while keeping safe.  You learn how logistics company works.  Management varies from department depending on how the facility is doing in our region.  Workplace culture is that all associates are held accountable for any accidents and at the same time the job has to get done. Hardest Part of the job is to keep from getting frustrated.  The most enjoyable part is that they have fixed schedules.
bad,I went into that store every day and have it 110% but got no respect from management in return. They do not protect their employees and do not move you up or give you a ride for working hard.
bad,A typical day we would run freight then do daily routines. I learned some ins and outs of retail/management. The most enjoyable part was working with the customers.
bad,It's a good job to have to grow in communication skills and customer service. But some.of the managers slack on the job and don't provide the help that all associates need at some times during your work.
bad,It's really good part time - full time job for students or newcomers as you can earn on minimum wage but will also have medical or grocery benefits from Walmart
bad,I would not reccomend walmart as a job it was very stressful. The head cashiers were slow to get anything done and were just lazy. I did not feel as though I could or would want to advance with that company
bad,"maagement consistantly lies to you or doesnt keep promises. No room for advancement due to jealous/spiteful managers, working full time hours only to get part time benefits."
bad,"No proveen el uniforme"
bad,It's cut throat.  Walmart thrives on speed and at times impossible outcomes.  The current management which I last worked for treat it as a cut throat business and they don't seem to care about it.  One of the assistant managers talks down to the workers and he's unapproachable for anything.  The people were the only one that made the job enjoyable.  Hardest part of the job was how disrespectful the management is.
bad,"Very fast pace "
bad,"The other employees were always friendly, and immediate management was always helpful to both the employees and the customers. The company's practices and policies lead to lack of morale and motivation for employees near the bottom."
bad,"I was hired with for this temporary position at Walmart that was supposed to go from April 2018 - June 2018. However, I decided that it was better for me to leave this position before June because this work environment wasn't for me. Me and the group of people that were hired at the same time as me all went through the required training, but during the actual workshift everything was so disorganized. I remember one day I was supposed to meet with someone near the deli after I was done with my assigned task of sorting through various products, but said person never came and I was just left confused. There's also a lot of pressure that comes with this job as well. I was told to face all of the products in an aisle within 10 minutes, which wasn't enough time for me, so when my supervisor who gave me that task came back and saw that I was only about 75% done, I was promptly yelled at and left with a bad impression. Overall, I wouldn't recommend working at Walmart. Everything is so disorganized and there's little room for error."
bad,It is not a bad company to work for. They are paying a lot better than what they use to. The management team at most Walmarts are too care free. They only help when something major goes wrong in the stores.
bad,I dont reccoment walmart to anyone ever. I think walmart has turned into a money humgry corporation that doesn't know how to treat their employees. I think walmart pays well and provides great benefits but im not happy there.
bad,The hours were always 6-10 on the weekends... I couldn't even ask for a weekend off to visit my father an hour away. The managers also picked favorites.
bad,Wal-Mart is a great place but the people in the distribution centers will not help you and will ask for your help even when its not needed. Overall I would only reccomend this to people who are desperate for a job.
bad,they play too much but overall it was a cool job and everyone was down to earth. the benefits were helpful if you plan on making Walmart a long term job.
bad,no se considera el tiempo del empleado y se exige cantidades muy grandes de esfuerzo fisico
bad,I will choose not to say anything negative about Walmart. I have met some great people and I have met the opposite. I am simply looking for a better source of income.
bad,"Walmart is a place where the employee is easily replaceable and favoritism is the way they decide on who stays working for them. They help workers who are their friends and everyone else doesn't really matter. There is a lot of pressure to increase sales, nothing is ever quite good enough."
bad,"Lovely Coworkers with an enjoyable work atmosphere but Managers would often let personal opinions, views, and quarrels affect the professional expectations of their position.  It also felt like they didn't necessarily care for you as an employee."
bad,I liked my co workers but some of the managers where unfair and to hard to work for. The scheduling was flexible so that was nice while attending school.
bad,"Walmart provides good benefits. Depending on what your position, this can be a boring place and unchallenging or it can be fast paced. Employees do not earn enough salary. You have to be there for a long time before you can move up the ladder. They have no empathy for family time during holidays. They will work you Thanksgiving, Christmas and other major holiday times. Management is lazy."
bad,"This review is specific to the Tigard, OR store. The number one issues with the store was lack of encouragement and toxic environment. I enjoyed my work and there was more than enough learning material as well as promotion opportunities available. The management was nice but the work load was incredibly heavy. Wal-Mart has great motives but it is not executed well at the Tigard store at all. In short, if you can survive working at the Tigard, OR store you will be able to work anywhere else with ease."
bad,"The pay grade isn't fair. The level of professionalism is very low. The benefits are great. The rotating schedule is very inconvenient.  Overall I love my job, I just wish I got paid more. With the schedule hour cuts  it's hard to plan my bills."
bad,"Awesome meet new people every day, great place to work, management work with you if u had any type of problem, just the holidays that they make us work not cool"
bad,"Wal-Mart is an oiled machine with lots of moving parts. It is efficient in everything it does including staffing, selling, and charity work. their priority is maintaining sales and that's was a daily focus."
bad,"You clock in and do what you think you should be doing but are always told to do something else and then faulted for not completing what you were doing to begin with. There is absolutely no training what so ever unless you have a manager that you trust to go directly too. Your faulted for your lack of knowledge and if there is more than one manager training it gets skewed, because each supervisor tells you something different.  The best thing there was fellow associates that did more and better training the the managers or supervisors."
bad,wonder customer service  hard work with little help. could advace very quickly if wanting to ve in management or like to deal with the public that are sometimes
bad,You get awful hours all the time. You either work very little or alot. Lots of times you get stuck under-staff and they dont really do nothing for you. You are treated terrible and they dont care for your outside life at all. Pretty much if you want to do well here dont have an opinion nor act out.
bad,"Working at Walmart isn't that bad at the start. The employees are nice, the work isn't that hard, the pay is good. Although, after working their for awhile you start to see the true colours. The management is horrible, the back pain you experience is noticeable after a couple of months, and the cut back of hours."
bad,I did not enjoy Walmart. I stocked shelves and interacted and assisted customers during my shifts. I worked here during high school and part of college.
bad,Working at WalMart was just a routing going to work getting the job done the most thing I like about working there was helping the customer and employees.
bad,I was recruited to Wal-Mart while attending college. Initially it was a nice family environment. As the started to grow the concern for the employees changed. The work hours for management increased with no additional compensation.
bad,"I was the pharmacist that opened a new wal-mart neighborhood market. I was also expected to put on a hard hat and assemble shelves. Organization was an issue. I was supposed to be allowed to make some comments at the grand opening of the store but that did not happen. New policies and procedures were introduced without adequate training, and everyone was expected to know them. The business was very profit focused, which I understand. The pharmacy in wal-mart exists so people will come and shop while they wait for their prescriptions. That being said, compensation was adequate, but it proved not to be worth the negative aspects of the job for me. I focus on improving people's health and quality of life, not removing money from their pockets."
bad,the pay wasn't great and the customers even worse. try your hardest not to work front end unless you are management. it seemed people where intentionally rude.
bad,When you tell managers you have a issue with one of your kids cause they have ran away even if it is a step kid that's why your late amd the one more is the battery on your car was dead and it's the only car you got and you get told that's not an excuse then they ant what they say they are about
bad,walmart is a very stressful place to work. managers are not the best.. customers are always complaining. managers do nothing to try and help out employees.
bad,very immature no stability the managers were all over the place very unorganized especially the store owner very unprofessional. and very bias views about the functioning of job roles
bad,The job was at times frustrating I had to cover three departments with minimal staff. Every time I asked management for help they would make it my fault that it stuff was not being done.
bad,"I always get my job completed, Have to fill the cake case, Also do all orders for the day and next day, hardest not enough employees in the bakery. To many call outs,"
bad,"I found management to be incompetent most of the time. The pay does not represent the work as a full-time associate. It can be a very fun and active place to work but it would be wise to go into the job with intent on moving way up. Benefits such as healthcare are hard to beat when it comes to this company. Overall, I would suggest taking the grunt work with a grain of salt and keep a mindset to invest in becoming a leader."
bad,"Walmart ,start a excellent  company with very good benefits was my school tubr very good and nice experiences I learned many things,but unfortunately it is very delicate workplace there it not professional in the people who are in the manager a lot of favoritism how sad that there is a lot of talent but they are not allowed develop it because am not verry professional."
bad,"Choose your stores wisely, Know your management. This is critical in advancement. If you are trying to make this a career make sure you get to know all and be the best you. Be ready to play multiple roles and be worn down. The drama upon employees is unreal. I learned all areas in one year. Also, favoritism is really big. It can be a really good company and some stores really fulfill sams dream. Good luck finding that. The best part were the Stores that really honestly cared about you and your desire to move up."
bad,"Walmart is a polarizing company to be sure, but that doesn't it was not a decent place to work. The policy is strict here, but the management is fairly good. I would recommend against trying to build a career with Walmart as the pay is rather low, but growth is certainly possible."
bad,Worked for Walmart for 18 plus years and my position was down sized and many Co Managers were just let go.  I really thought that I would retire from Walmart.  Now I am moving on to new things.
bad,Eight to twelve hour work days. Sometimes the environment actually made you feel like you were a part of a family. The most enjoyable part was being able to help people.
bad,"Working here has its ups and downs, you learn a lot, get to meet new people and can stay busy but the management are not all good nor nice. The hardest part of being there was being talked to like trash DAILY!!!"
bad,A typical day a Walmart consisted of not being to productive do to the overwhelming clutter in my work space. Management was good and always understood our work environments. That hardest part of my just was the lack of space to put product. What I liked lost about that job is we always made it work.
bad,You have different aspects to learn from and can help you build your career preference. Organization and prioritizing in the work place is very complicated and makes your job harder than it should be.
bad,"Wouldn’t work there again, unless I had to. Only good thing about it was the people I saw daily. And the little discount they gave us. Pay was okay but not enough for bi weekly"
bad,The experience was okay. I had a lot of fun working with the co-workers since they were all friendly. Hardest part about the job is you have to deal with customers who don't care about anything but what they want and will rush you. Hope you have a tolerance for that.
bad,"The place demanded too much of its employees by the end of my employment. We moved 100 thousand plus cases a day, just on my side of the warehouse, and management was completely clueless. the hours were insane. Overall, while the pay was impressive, and the benefits were good, it took too much of a toll on your body, at work by 4 am, sometimes not off until 5 or 6 pm. I didn't know one employee there who wasnt on some sort of pain medication or energy drink constantly just to stay functional."
bad,"Overall, not a bad place to work.  It's for sure not the right job for everyone.  Nothing is consistent.  I enjoyed working with most of the associates there, but you rarely knew where most of management stood.  Advancement opportunities are there, if you know who to talk to."
bad,"El trabajo en farmacia es tranquilo, con bastantes compañeros de trabajo, por lo general la convivencia es buena, aunque a veces hay que hacerse cargo de mas departamentos aparte del que se ha asignado previamente."
bad,Walmart pas good but the managers that I've had were nasty and had favoritism. They give you good hours but they really do not work with school. They were so unorganized and working at the garden center is not cool because they forget about your break and money.
bad,"I started working here right after high school and they worked really well with my college schedule but didn't help me when I had religious event that I told them 3 to 5 weeks in advance and they weren't on major american holidays but were ordinary weekdays and weekends. And SOME Management, I felt were bias and racist towards not just me but many."
bad,"If you are hired as a Department Manager, don't expect to manage ANYTHING!  All you are is an Inventory Maintenance specialist.  Upper management does NOT take any of your suggestions no matter how experienced you are in the industry.  Most unorganized place I have ever worked and I have been working over 30 years."
bad,the job was ok working long hours by yourself and management didn't help out with work load at all but the customers are very nice and the travel time was hectic in the winter
bad,"Walmart Pharmacy is actually great, but soon as you exit the pharmacy you return to Walmart and it is chaotic.  The customers are really rude, and the lines are always long so they come to the pharmacy to check out which is unfair."
bad,"My typical shift at Walmart included bringing merchandise out of the backroom and out to the floor to stock the shelves. I also played a big role in the inventory management within the backroom. Management at Walmart is good and very awful at times. Depending on the managers that were on duty that day, it was a terrible day. The managers typically look right over your hard work and you aren't noticed for your work. The hardest part of the job was trying to please management and be noticed by management. Most enjoyable parts of the job were the hour long lunch breaks and helping customers who needed the help."
bad,I enjoyed my work at CMI/Walmart. I would start work at 6 am and finish at 4 pm. I would handle claims that were lost time and highly litigated. I would responsible for finding ways to resolve claims with high monetary values as well as claims over 2 years old.
bad,"Short breaks, long hours, good work life balance. The chance to move up in the company are slim and depends on many factors. The breaks were too short and you work holidays"
bad,I ended up being the manager after the other one left. He did not do anything and I was not getting paid nearly enough for what work I was doing. I pretty much did everything there including the managers job.
bad,"I enjoyed my time as customer service manager, hours flexible competitive pay.  Good benefits some issues with other members of management. Customer friendly environment."
bad,"You make good money, but in certain departments, you will work for it. I was an order filler having to lift heavy dog food, cat food & bird food bags constantly. You had to place the bags on a pallet in a way for which they wouldn't fall off, or you would have to re-do the whole pallet. They have some good hours...you most likely will get the shift you choose. I worked the weekend shift Saturday-Monday, 6:30am-6:30pm only getting 72 hours every 2 weeks, so my pay averaged out to making $15.00 an hour getting 40 hours. It's an okay job. If you want to be ""comfortable"" working, this is not the place for you..in the summer you will sweat and it's very cold in the winter but once you start working, you'd heat up."
bad,"I had to do a fresh cook of our fried food and take out the old ones,slice meats, make salads and sandwiches, clean machines and close and prep for next days workers."
bad,"Walmart does not like full-time emp.(except mgt), and try and keep hours down by having one person do job of 2. they did teach to change and balance tires, but jiffy lube training is better. The other employees and benefits were not bad, but management sucks( it is all about them getting their bonuses)"
bad,"Good place to work, alot of hours as well as good work enviroment and fast paced place, good management and flexible hours, also you get a discount after 90 days"
bad,If you can stand the work then its a great place to work. IF you have a problem with standing 10+ hours a day then its not for you. Most all the managers I delt with were fair.
bad,"Has good opportunities to advance within the company but very fast paced and stressful work environment. If you don't like shopping there, don't try to work there."
bad,"Il y a de bonnes conditions pour travailler, de bons superviseurs et collègues"
bad,"Working at Walmart was okay, "
bad,"Wait on customers all day. Occasionally you have to sign people up for Walmart credit cards. You get two fifteen minute breaks and one hour long lunch. It wasn’t a bad place to work at, the grocery store isn’t my ideal place of a fun job."
bad,Wal-Mart in Grand Junction was a good place to be employed. I enjoyed my position there and learned a lot. I worked with a very good team. I loved my job there and my co workers.I learned so much about retail sales. I had never worked in a big box store before. It was an excellent learning experience for me. I was mentored by some very amazing teachers while I worked there. We were not as well staffed as we needed to be by the time I relocated to the Rifle store. Rifle was nothing like Grand Junction.
bad,"I have worked on walmart for 13 years, the culture continued to change where they no longer care about their associates, we were told there was open door polices with no retaliation , found out that is not true."
bad,Working at Walmart for almost 2 years theres lots of things that I was not prepared for. You have to be prepared to be torn down by management and customers who don't like you. If you are not mentally prepared for the stress Walmart is not for you. The long time associates seem to be the nicest people and are always willing to help you.
bad,"This place was very clique oritented. I just didn't fit into their mold and got sick with pneumonia three times and was let go because I was hospitalized for it and they didn't approve my absences. They cared more about the customers than the staff and they didn't hide that, they let you get treated like garbage all in the name of customer service."
bad,It's a fast paced job that can be quite stressful. The supervisors try to keep the mood light but that can be quite difficult when management if breathing down your necks. The cap team seems to always be under staffed such adds to the stress.
bad,I was treated unfairly by a superior and I believe he retaliated against me for when he would talk down to me and disrespect me and I told him if he continued I will report him and that he needed to stop treating me differently..
bad,"Overall, Wal-Mart is a great experience to meet new people and move up quickly in the work environment.  My only complaint is poor management from some of the management team."
bad,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, excelente empresa para crecer profesionalmente y desarrollo personal."
bad,The typical day at work for me at Walmart was fast pace with many day to day tasks with dead lines. It was a great learning experience that helped me develop multitasking skills.
bad,Walmart is not the worst job and not the best either its more of if u need a quick pay check until u get a better job . management can be tuff cause u have some that will help u if needed then u have the ones that are not so helpful
bad,"I learned a lot about confidence in dealing with customers, about how businesses are ran, how to be a leader. The hardest part of my job is the hours. one day I could work 2 to 11 the next 7 to 4. It's inconsistent. I also do not get 2 days off in a row. The most enjoyable part is my coworkers. Most are wonderful, hard working individuals."
bad,"working nights is quiet. you have to get your work done in a certain amount of time, management isn't understanding and sometimes demeaning of some employees"
bad,i dont want to re live my experience there EVER again!! this is rediculous that you are forccing me to fill out this stupid questionaire. on a job i dont want to experince again
bad,"customer service, department operations, inventory control, communication to other departments, sales reports and trends, safety checks, customer discrepancies."
bad,The work environment can't be fun when you make friends with the associates and management. They do say they are like a family there which is sometimes true but other times people can be rude and in your business when they dont know you personally. I do believe it's like a high school there. People start and spread rumors even if you keep to yourself and focus on work. You can't stop people no matter what. And sometimes management will help and other times they dont really do much about it. I wouldn't really recommend this job. I could only stand it there for so long. I try being professional but most people there are very childish.
bad,"This job took everything out of me, and I was never appreciated. Would not recommend. If you're thinking of applying for walmart, I would suggest just going with king soopers."
bad,no home life balance working 16 plus hours a day and when requested off was not give it 90 percent of time.   last time was on vacation was out of town was call to say I had to go back from  my vacation
bad,"The job it's itself was good , They just had to many young assistant a managers that didn't know how to treat or talk to their co worker's work with respect and most had a bad attitude problems ,"
bad,"Empresa formada por bons profissionais, com um bom engajamento e um ótimo ambiente de trabalho."
bad,I love my job but the work schedule is always different so its hard to plan things or spend just daily time with your family. Schedule is never consistant.
bad,The Walmart environment is a Great accepting place to work. There are Awesome benefits available. Walmart is a company you can grow with if your a good fit.
bad,A typical day at work in the department was get you price change done to you can keep the  the produce coming on a daily basic. What I learn at Walmart was that you can achieve and move on to better opportunity that they have to offer. it is also difficult of the store is not together when their are different manager that is not on the same page as the department and not enough worker. the hardest part of the job is to  get the employee to work as a team that will benefit the department and to get them knowledge to understand how the department is run when new changes is coming or happening. the must enjoyable part of working at walmart is the experience.
bad,"a tyicpal day at wal mart is get this done get that done ive learned that it doent matter how hard you work it isnt good enough and management Doesnt have any compassion for there associates or they dont back u up , the hardest part of the job is not having management backing u up to get the job done . the best part of the job is getting to know the customer..."
bad,Not the best job primarily because of the management that runs the store. Communication is lacking and causes so many problems its unbelievable that they can run a business that way.
bad,This job is very considerate with not only customers but to the employees. It is a fun environment to work. Meeting different people all day long and assisting customers is very fun.
bad,"Walmart likes to advertise to it's employee's that it offers support for those in need. However even after displaying exceptional performance, they would refuse to loan me any advancements from my check to support myself, and/or transportation.  They refused to assist me in order to get a bus pass to get to work. At the time of working there, I had a 4 hours commute to and from work on the bus. 2 hours there, and 2 back...on top of a 8 hour shift. There have been times that I couldn't leave on time and missed my bus, I would have had to walk for 5 hours to get home. Very poor pay. I could barely make rent, and my 2 bills, almost never had any money for food. Eventually I quit in favor of G6 Hospitality."
bad,Walmart was great. But there managers weren't so great. The managers had very poor skills on respecting empoyless. Plus isn't the head Manager suppose to know how to look up check stubs ?
bad,Walmart has many departments and all of them use different sets of skills. There is also opportunities to move between them or even up into the stores management.
bad,"just a very ""meh"" workplace experience. The hours were nice, the department wasn't ran very well. Never bothered getting to know coworkers. I went to work then went home. No desire to work there again."
bad,"hard word,fast past,great customer service,learned produce and working in customer service,i enjoyed meeting new people and learning new things"
bad,The bad about this company is it's never enough. In this company unless you are at management levels the employee is just a number to corporate.
bad,"I loved my job at Walmart, it was the issues with the leadership team that caused me to leave. I worked 12 hour days or longer and always had a challenge each and every day in my position. I also had a great team that worked together all the time."
bad,Good company poor management over all good people that I work with very friendly and hard working but management doesn't step up when the time is right
bad,I didn ot like the location the customers were very unruly. the management was not personable. I was very under approached as an employee. my direct managers did not even remember my name.
bad,"working in sporting goods allowed me to learn a lot about fishing gear, guns, accessories, etc.  Management is ok.  I had the opportunity to work with others and learn so much at a young age in reference to fishing, hunting and their accessories"
bad,"I loved helping people find things that they needed, Going to work everyday and knowing I was welcomed with open arms made me enjoy work even more."
bad,"I recommend this to anyone that is just looking for a paycheck and a great co worker team to get along with. I would say team in general, but the management team could use help with finding better managers that will treat their employees better."
bad,They weren't bad as an individual place it's just the corporation itself that hurts. You are put on a 6 month probationary period and only allowed 4 absences in that period. It goes against you if you clock in or out late or if you don't take your lunch at you 6hr mark.
bad,While I was working here I was going to school full time and trying to  get my foot in the door in the medical field. The worst part about working at walmart was the management and lack of respect that I was shown because I was young and just a sales associate. I worked very hard at this job and was very grateful for the opportunity that they gave me just coming out of high school.
bad,They don't care about you. The treatment of works is quite awful. I expect a strike in the next 5 to 10 years if they don't change soon. Find something else. One thing I hate the most is being understaffed and then they wonder why more hasn't been done. They continue you take benefits away. If you have another option than Walmart take it. They get worse every year.
bad,The workplace was not what was expected. The management was not respectful nor did they seem to care about their employees. Coworkers great fun interactive with each other very respectful and we all enjoyed each other's company
bad,A typical day at work begins with the order and professionalism that we show with coworkers and customers. We learn the importance of good comunication between managers and the entire team work.
bad,"Management wasn't as sharp as they should've been. Waited until the last minute to impress supervisors. ""Employees do not quit jobs, they quit managers."" It's straight forward but it's true. Every manager has eventually started out at the bottom their selves so they should know better than anyone. When a manger puts employees and goals first it's a for sure strong working environment for them and others (customers if we are talking retail). Thank you"
bad,"They had me doing things my doctor wouldn't allow, but I was still forced to do them. Getting time off was horrible they don't follow doctor's orders unless you are on workers compensation. They wouldn't allow me to change schedules or move to a different dept."
bad,"The job was all ways fun,as long as the task were completed. Adventurous because there was always a barrier to overcome."
bad,Only the lazy people can have an opportunity of doing something else or getting a higher position. The hard workers they leave them where they do their best job and will not move you because you the one doing most of the job
bad,"Wal-Mart was a good employer until the management became greedy. They higher ed the cost of insurance and took away bonuses, as well as, cutting long term employees hours to new hires making less."
bad,"Walmart is not a place I would recommend anyone to work if they can find another job. The managers expect you to do their work and yours, the pay isn't good enough, they get upset when you take your break because all they want you to do is work, they also want you to stay later because they can't get their job done."
bad,"A typical day at work was very active and there was never a dull moment. I've learned how to manage money, take inventory, and how important teamwork is. The management was always available and helpful. The associates and I worked really well together and was very productive. The hardest part of the job was being the front end supervisor and not having enough cashiers for our busy times. The most enjoyable part of the job was I always ended the day having learned something new."
bad,Good place to work for a beginner everyone was nice and good to work for and every was helpful like if u need help all u had to do is ask but do not be late for work
bad,"A typical day at work included stocking, folding, and helping customers. I learned how to work with people from different backgrounds, how to deal with difficult customers, and how to be helpful in every aspect. "
bad,"I recall having difficulty there. Though the management was ok and the coworkers where pretty solid, it was retail. There isn't really much to talk about."
bad,administraciones de locales deficientes con poco personal
bad,Each day is a new experience. You never know what happens next. People shout at you for no reason. Your cashiers don't respect you and your decisions.
bad,Walmart is a fast paced and fun place to work at. the people there are kind but hot tempered. a typical day at work is going home with someone yelling in your face for no reason.
bad,"The last company that I recently worked for was very challenging. I not only worked for my customers I had to make sure that all monies where accounted for and I had four other workers under me. I loved my job because of my customers and my staff. The hardest part of my job was being pulled in many direction, but I managed to perfect that and made the work easier for me and my workers."
bad,"This place felt like I was back in high school. All of the employees were separated into their little cliques in the break room, and everyone talked about each other constantly. This couples with working in customer service made for a very stressful situation."
bad,the people where nice. management kept changing i liked my job though i was improving i felt like  i was not good enough i hated working overnight. i left because i moved.
bad,"Clock-in, manager tells me what needs to be done for the day. I usually start by making fresh pizza's, sandwiches, and salads. Stock the floor, if that needs to be done. Help customers by slicing meats and cheese. Cook meats in oven and do some dishes. The hardest part of the job is having to go into the freezer to find what you need and dealing with management. The management was really bad at the store I was working in. The most enjoyable part of my day is seeing the routine customers."
bad,Começava o dia limpando tudo da parte do almoço era bem corrido a direção era muito agradavel e funcionários também . A parte mais dificil era entregar os lanches no tempo e o mais agradável era a motivação de todos um querendo ajudar o outro .
bad,"The job is not too difficult, managers make the job more difficult...they are unfair and not reasonable. Flexible hours are given out but they are not good with keeping your schedule the same throughout the weeks"
bad,"Management had a tendency to play favorites. We were timed in our departments, and some people were able to go over while others were not."
bad,Its a fun place to work when they let you do your job. The best part of the day is helping customers and working with your co-workers as a team. The hardest part is when they have you working somewhere else then expect you to get your job done. Management need more training before they come into retail cause their management skills be below average.
bad,"It a excellent job u get to work"
bad,"The job was very easy.  I would go to work each day knowing what I had to do.  Management and my supervisor never complained that I didn't get the job done.  They would always say I am a exemplary employee and that I served as a model for all employees because I never complained about the job and I am a professional, reliable and dependable worker."
bad,"todos los días se trabaja bajo presión."
bad,I remember pushing carts and being outside alone trying to clear the lot. I would usually complete my task but it would be hard and sometime I did fall a little short when I was alone.
bad,"While I have enjoyed every job that I've had, this was no exception other than the cons of having to many managers with too little communication among themselves. Shifts started anywhere around 5 a.m and could last until after midnight. We pulled outdated sales product, filled any empty product, maintained prices and signs, set up all hot/cold customer service food areas, operated fryers, slicers and digital scales. In addition, placed orders to ensure on hand of all products, detail cleaned department and equipment on a regular basis to ensure passing inspections by company and health department. Retrieval and organization of freight that was orders was necessary to responsibly maintain operation of our department."
bad,"Walmart is not a good company to work for. My manager threatened me several times to work off the clock, or i would loose my job. I did not agree with management. I think i stayed as long as i did because i loved my employees. A funny thing did happen when i first started. We had a meeting with the CEO, she knew me! She was my client at Daytons. She came in shopping for a coat, she made my co-worker cry. I made a bet with my co-worker i could make her smile, and I DID. She became my client after that. Small world huh?"
bad,"Even though I worked there four to five years, I never moved up in rank.  Part of that was my fault but in the end it was a good easygoing job that gave me part time work while going to school."
bad,"era boa a convivencia com os colegas, o gerente nao sabia dialogar corretamente com os funcionarios, aprendi que devemos trabalhar sempre em equipe um ajudando ao outro e respeito em primeiro lugar!"
bad,"To management you were just a number, not a person. They do not care about you they care about making the numbers. I enjoyed the other employees but some of the corporate rules that came down were ridiculous. they definitely need to do an undercover boss and see whats actually happening in the stores."
bad,The job was very good and i did like it until they turned on me and told me i was part time after me working forty plus hours a week.
bad,"A typical day at work is busy. The Wal-Mart I work at is very understaffed and needs more workers. Management is ok but I think they could do more about satisfying customers needs. My co-worker are awesome, and I could say that we are very good at helping each other out . The hardest part about working at Wal-Mart is working at such low pay, I really think they should consider on paying employees way more than they do being that Wal-Mart make so much money. The most enjoyable thing about Wal-Mart is there pretty good about hiring all types of people, I think they give everyone a chance regardless of race, disability etc.."
bad,Need to work on leaving there problems at home. need to work on how to keep people safe. Need to give people the right training and equipment to unload trucks pallets etc.
bad,"A typical day in the workplace consisted of more work then could be physically done by one person, all job duties were geared to be delegated to a staff of 11 and with no help to recruit, I found myself covering multiple shifts and tasks and to be stressed and accumulating over time hours weekly, and having to go in on my days off regularly, my co workers in my department were great, my colleagues in the management area were over worked and under appreciated and loosing touch with their home and family lives as this business required so much of our time, relationships were falling apart, in the year that I worked my colleagues were loosing weight, bags under the eyes, the stress was obvious, the most enjoyable part of the job, was leaving it to go home to my family."
bad,"walmart was a job that i enjoyed at times, the location that i was working at was a very unique store. i felt that some management did the job the best that they knew. and took pride in there workers. Other employees they was just rude to the workers they tried to overwork others for the little pay they was given.. i just feel that walmart was a start in my journey not a career.."
bad,It's a job.. Advancement is hard to achieve. It's about who you know in certain locations.
bad,"Though Wal-Mart does offer constant dependable work with good pay, they do make you definitely EARN that pay with Extremely High Rates to achieve and much Favoritism that occurs also. You are standing on your feet 10 hours a day with only two 15 minute breaks and then back to work! You basically have to work like a dog and your job is dangled over your head like a piece of meat over a dog's head and you are constantly reminded that you ARE replaceable regardless if you are a hard worker. If you don't make their ridiculous rates, you will be fired!"
bad,Advancement easily obtainable but not good with home life balance.  Poor management team at various locations.
bad,"Very hectic work, you never know where you will be working."
bad,"Wal-Mart is a hard place to work for, not that the work is hard it's management that don't work well with lower level employees. there is never a dull day at Wal-Mart, and you are never board there is always something to do. Management needs to take a close look at their employees and start giving them some respect if they want it back."
bad,the stores are ok to work at but you don't get paid good at all and it is hared to even live on Wal-Mart pay.
bad,"Productive work place, good management that is very helpful."
bad,"They had favorites and didn't do much right, though I did enjoy working with the people and doing what I was doing."
bad,"junta al inicio de cada dia de elaborar  resumiendo los datos generales"
bad,workers work hard however; connection gap between upper management and the lower workers
bad,"Day-to-day Stocking shelves, Helping customers"
bad,A typical day at work is cashing customers out. I learned how to use my communication skills my managers were okay there were some coworkers that got on my nerve but work comes before anything and my enjoyable times were the compliments from the customers. CUSTOMERS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT!
bad,Working for Wal-mart was always steady and my co-workers was fun(one of them). The management was terrible(on a personal level).The hardest part of my job was really nothing.
bad,Working as a cashier I was to ring up items and bag them for costumers. I learned as a cashier to hold my words no matter how talked to me. The management was always their to help me when needed. The hardest part of the job was standing for hours on end and how tiring it can be to do the same job for hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was when costumers talked with me and had question about products that they needed assistance with.
bad,"7am - 4pm"
bad,"Walmart was not something I would pick for an career. They we're very slow, some co-workers were rude. They really didn't make me feel comfortable to work there, Wal-Mart was only something to do to get me back on my feet."
bad,regular typical day at work. I learned how to drive operated machinery.
bad,"* I would clock in and look for a manager to see what i might need to do today. I was moved around alot."
bad,"Walmart was a great job while i was in college "
bad,"Typical Day: Clock in, go to my assigned register, set up register, make sure my area is clean and presentable, attend to my customers."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of working for walmart is seeing a smile on customers face when they need help, always working as a team to get ever dutie done thats required. I have learn that the management tell arent team players and should be coach on there duties as managers, my hardest part of the job was hoping to get my duties done in a timely matter that was suitable to management quailtys."
bad,"I was a cashier and i would ring up customers in a timely matter and i would try and get customers a walmart credit card. Keeping my area neat. If Customer Service was short handed i helped out in Customer Service and assisted customers in exchanges and returns and money orders. There was nothing hard about that job."
bad,i did not like working at walmart because the higher paying associates treated the rest of the associates like they werent good enough to work for walmart.
bad,"No real management. Management was not on the same page. No benefits for those who are hurt on the job, or job security."
bad,Fast paced workplace with a large amount of customer servicing along with technician tasks so you definitely have to be a multitasker. Can be very difficult handling customers along with complaints but that is a huge part of the job.
bad,it was a temp job so I didn't have the time to get a hold of the job to get a feel for it
bad,"Although the management was not caring or understanding there, the co-workers were friendly and fun. Management acted as if they were better than you, and didn't care about what problems you had. I did enjoy working with customers and meeting new people though."
bad,Working in the deli was my favorite place to work. We would have fun and accomplish everything that needed to be done every night. When I moved to the 97 wall the job seemed even better. The ability to take responsibility for all the inventory that came in and make sure that everything was where it was supposed to go was such a great feeling.
bad,"nice and friendly environment to work. Good managment."
bad,I love my work but when I trying to get to a manager my manager would give me excuses because I was a single parent. They would ever give my the job.
bad,"I didnt work here because I wanted to. I hated this job. I only worked here to save money for my wedding and to pay for college. I ended up injuring myself and they never did anything about it. Now I'm stuck with back issues for the rest of my life. They never had enough staff to help in each department. Sometimes you had to do 2 departments in one night alone and they expected you to hav it done by the end of your shift, which was impossible. "
bad,"Aprendí como se maneja una empresa grande. "
bad,Working at the rochester walmart the bosses were not friendly and they talked badly about customers when they were standing in front of them;
bad,it is a place of advancment and learning they are concerned about their empployees and what the customers think about their stores and they strive to meet the econmy and the prices of their competiors
bad,"come in and go to work on the computer,some upper management treated you fairly,taking an hour lunch,the lack of respect from store managers.the pizza parties i provided"
bad,"Responsibilities included shipping, receiving and stocking inventory supplies and thats what i learned while under employment with this company. Management did there jobs but lacked humanity. The hardest part about the job was making deadlines while doing other employees work as well as your own. My co-workers were enjoyable and i would work with them again. I enjoyed the discounts most about this job."
bad,N / A N / A N / A It was fun fast paced environment. I loved working and helping customers
bad,"i go in to a mess and leave a sparkle. I have learned so much about retail since being with walmart one being customer service is number one, management needs some help, but most of the co workers are enjoyable and make for a fast going night."
bad,it was a fast past there you had a certain time to fill the breakpack boxes to get them ready so the can be shipped to the stores ontime
bad,Buen equipo de trabajo buen compañerismo
bad,"The location was terrible felt like I was dealing with a lot of high school kids, due to the continue gossiping. A lot of the workers talked about people more than do there job. The locatio it self was boring, there where times when I wanted to walk out due to no customers"
bad,"I am ok with working at walmart. It is hard working at walmart, but I like the manangment,"
bad,A typical day consists of multiple directions from managers who are not your direct supervisor. When something is decided the decision gets reversed the next day and again and again. Overall not a fun place to work.
bad,"I am currently working at Wal-Mart part-time (30 hours per week) while attending school full-time. Working at Wal-Mart really doesn't take much skills and the jobs are fairly easy to understand and to catch unto. Although, they take advantage of this in regards to very little pay, and not allowing employees to work full-time. This in return brings in a lot of poor workers, which brings down the work experience for the ones whom come to work to actually work. The ones who actually work are counted on to pick up the slack of the ones who do not. The ones who do not work although do not last long, but are quickly replaced with a similar careless employee. In all, it is a pretty easy job, but it is definitely a job nothing more and should really be avoided if you take pride in your work, because it will be taken advantage of by desperate managers."
bad,Es una empresa muy bien especializada en todos los aspectos porque todo ser humano tiene la necesidad de encontrar lo que realmente se necesita para el hogar entre otras cosas.
bad,"A typical day at work for Wal-Mart would be rather busy with customers coming up to you more than one at a time hassling you with questions, you must always know every single thing about your department. What I learned working there is you must always have an answer to every question a customer asks when you are out on the floor on your own. Management was not so great but I am sure at other stores management is different. Some of my co-workers were good but the thing about working at a big store is there are a lot of rumors. I felt like I was back in high school. The hardest part of my job would probably have been unloading trucks, I had to unload trucks every single day. It was hard and sometimes the pallets were so heavy they came speeding toward me. The most enjoyable part of my job was not having someone giving me supervision all the time. I had peace and quiet to get all my tasks done."
bad,"Acknowledged customers in a courteous, friendly and timely manner"
bad,WalMart is a great place to work i enjoyed it and would work there again.
bad,The hardest part of the job was sorting out boxes with no labels.
bad,Wal Mart has treated me very well. It has allowed me to raise a family and support our needs for the last 18 years.
bad,"Working at Wal-Mart you can meet a lot of very interesting people, I enjoy working with people."
bad,"For the most part the employees were fun everyone liked to have a good time and work, keep busy. Customers were usually friendly but can get very nasty because it is Walmart. Management wasn't great but there was a few of them they cared and stayed on top of the duties.Benefits are great if you work full-time but very dificult to get hired into full-time right away"
bad,a empresa tinha oportunidade de crecimento para
bad,"The job itself is simple and not bad at all. The pay is decent, and I have access to benefits. The problem at my store is the management. Specifically the Store and Shift managers, as they tend to come over with a complete lack of understanding on how my department actually works. The worst part is that you never get thanked, and never have I ever been told I'm doing a good job despite almost two years of loyal employment. It's a constant uphill battle, but that's how retail works."
bad,"You work, put up with people, go home. Not much else, easy yet boring."
bad,I more then likely would of stud but had my son and could not afford to pay for babysitting all night and all day. I worked overnights at that time.
bad,My typical day at work was sale. I learned more about sell. I just love all the management in co-worker. The hardest part of the job was when am done with everything. In the most enjoyable part of the job is just staying busy working hard everyday.
bad,Some where very ghetto n rude they didn’t have any type home training talk about everyone starts drama n tell other ppl business or wanna fight jus not my type of environment
bad,"this job was good to earn money and it is good job for students. because students go to their college at day time so, they can amanage their time by doing this type of job."
bad,I work two jobs and walmart wont give me the days i work my other job on the same day so i can have more then one day off a week and it stresses me out.
bad,Walmart being such a large chain of stores with such a vast number of employees was unable to provide meaningful rewards to hard working associates. Pay and benefits were basically the same for everyone regardless of skill or productivity. Even the quarterly bonuses they tried to insentivise didn't really matter since they were uniform across each store. So someone who barely works at all gets the same as someone working their hardest every day. The only means of hard work insentive Walmart provides is potential advancement opportunities but not everyone wants promotion and even if they do there are not nearly enough opportunities for all associates who work hard. The corporate side of the company is also completely out of touch with the work done on the stores as the were constantly making changes that stagnated or even devoloved our productivity.
bad,"You have to be part of a clique or group to get ahead. They expect a ""yes man"" type of employee, who will not be intelligent or think for themselves. Always understaffed and keep their team overworked and under appreciated."
bad,"Walmart is a good place to work at first, for like a first job. Walmart starts to be a problem once they expect a lot from the associates and start to overload you with work. Also favoritisms is shown through their a lot"
bad,"Constant customer service, helping customers find what they need. Finding solutions for customers when their needs are not met.  Guiding associates into setting up the store for the day, clean and stocked. Verifying inventory, making sure everything is on the floor ready for sales. Many tasks come up throughout the day making sure you prioritize to ensure execution. Making sure the store is able to run with  minimum presence."
bad,learn how to stock shelves everyday I work Monday through Friday most enjoyable part was my associate's when I work there I'm the work with your culture was okay except management
bad,"Management was awful, there was no work/life balance, hardest part was working the salesfloor. They do not care about their employees, I learned how to deal with the public better."
bad,"If you’re not seeking a management position working at Walmart is pretty good. They pay pretty well. You get one raise a year based on how well your store does in sales. But at soon as you step into a management position it is no longer a good place to work. I was a department manager there and I loved what I did in my job, however you got absolutely no help with your department. If there was an issue upper management would listen to you but wouldn’t act on it. I got transferred into a new store as department manager after working with Walmart for less than a year and at my new store I felt like a total outsider. Everyone was mean and it seemed like they all wanted me to fail."
bad,"I pulled freight off the trucks, worked in the freezer,backroom, and also worked the freight in the aisles. I helped my fellow employees complete tasks always was looking for work around the workplace"
bad,"They expect you to do everybody's work including the ones who don't show up. When your in a certain position, plan on doing something else wherever needed around the store. They cut your hours, and the job is very stressful...."
bad,It was too many hours I can only work part time it was to much for me to handle knowing that I have disability on my days off I would go to the gym or before work I would go to the gym
bad,For two weeks pay brought home 500$ weekly. It's not enough especially living in Chicago. The atmosphere is cool. The managers were ok. The work was simple but the pay was horrible. I was in college and had roommates and still struggled. The pay is the only thing wrong with this job
bad,"The pay is very good and so are the benefits. But the job itself is very hard on your body. Between the heavy lifting and the 12+ hours a night, it is very hard to work here. Area managers can be very relaxed or very demanding."
bad,"I enjoy helping other worker and keeping a clean area at all time, working at night is great for me,, I ENJOY THE HOURS AND HELPING  ,, TRAINING NEW EMPLOYEE.."
bad,"Nice job,managment is very friendly,  breaks are required and enforced. As in, take your break or else, lol."
bad,OGP is fast paced and keeps you on your toes. I got lucky to work with a lot of college kids my age so it was a decently fun environment. There was quite a bit of drama. Which is hard to avoid with college girls. Management refused to fix the drama and hold the employees that didnt work accountable.
bad,"I had put in the hours I was available to work. Yet, majority of the time I had to go to management to change my schedule because it had me working longer then what I was able to work. The manager also asked why I changed my schedule so many times. Upon explaining the situation, nothing helped. It worked for three weeks and then it was back to the same. No respect for hourly wagers. Even hourly managers are complaining about this"
bad,"I worked at another retail chain for over 10 years. I understand customer service, teamwork and filling prescriptions. Their training was ""just play around with it, you'll get the hang of it"""
bad,"Manger wouldn't follow availability,all in all poor management and the store manager is new no one really talks to him. Certain mangers work hard and get in trouble for things that they were told to do and some like to cut hours for no reason at all."
bad,Management does know how to speak or talk to employees. Walmart has turned into the worst company to work for. There is no respect at all. Not everyone acts the same. I guess it depends on who you are the disrespect didn't come my way. I was always asked why I smiled so much which confused me but I kept smiling.
bad,"Even though walmart staff wore awesomely, and accommodating, this is not the place you want to be if you want to make money. Besides there is not benefits for part times and training is excessive. I wont regret this job, but I am glad I move forward to better things in life. so If you are employee or looking to be employee at walmart, make sure to get your education deal with and get a degree."
bad,Walmart does not think about life and work balance at all. Though they do pay well and have benefits it’s not worth signing your life away. I worked more than 13 hrs daily and they still wanted more.
bad,"First started with company it was great. Family oriented,easy to move up,and very customer friendly. Over the years moral has declined and turnover rate has increased."
bad,It was actually an okay Job other than everybody wanting to be the boss it was a lot of high school kids very messy everybody talks about everybody they leave you alone to work by yourself and they don't really train you
bad,"Management need to be more respectful to associates, but other than that everything is great. Walmart have good benefits and great salary. Safe money, Live better."
bad,"The service desk is very stressful—you have to practice restraint—and the work location I worked for was extremely ratchet and ghetto (Ferguson Road). The customers are still the same; however, the crew then would have physical altercations on the job, management was beyond unprofessional, and there was no such thing as team work at this location. The benefits and pay weren't worth the stress."
bad,Alot of favoritism great opportunity as far as compensation and benefits.hours workable during busy hours over worked people like a slave house for money not enough time for breaks for 12 hour  shifts
bad,I’m looking for something different. Something that interests me more and is fun. I like to think and be creative. We are very understaffed and they do not like to hire people for my department. When they do hire people for my department they use them for other departments that aren’t staffed properly.
bad,This was a temporary job where I pushed carts all day for 10.50 an hour. It’s not the hardest job but it deff can pay the bills. It’s pretty easy to do just don’t get hit by a car
bad,"Start our meeting at 10 pm we go to our departments. Hardest part is cleaning up after another shift. My enjoyable part of my job is talking to my fellow coworkers, and knowing my store closes at 12 am and I can work freely with no interuptions."
bad,"Trabajo tranquilo, Estable, no hay descansos fijos ni en días festivos"
bad,Walmart encourages the bad behavior of the customers. The worse the behavior the more compensation they give.It was disturbing to me to have customers curse and throw things at me.
bad,Includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the effort of it's employee ( or of volunteers ) to accomplish it's objective through the application of available ressources
bad,"The management at the Walmart I worked talked down to employees with no repercussions. They have no respect for the associates there, and the expectations quickly became unreasonable."
bad,It’s Was Good Experiences Being There But Really Poor Management  They Showing Favoritism To People And  Wasn’t Treated Fair  Certain Days We Have Two Trucks But Not Enough Associates And Had To Get Done At A Certain Time
bad,"I relocated from Tampa, Florida to Live oak, Florida here this was the only big place to work for or commuting 2 hours back and forward. So I got hired!  I was surprised how the management helps their employees, getting all the CBL classes in, schedule 36-40 hours weekly, for holidays worked OT- I was very happy the way this entire store care for one another, people don't leave places like that. you work hard, everything was in place cashiers to cart pushers all of the members would pick something out place and take it to where it belongs, we all knew 2 or 3 departments in case to fill in for a no show- we cover our breaks and lunch, very satisfy with  the Company"
bad,"It wasn't my type of work. They had a lot of favoritism, towards certain people and it showed. People would be targeted by management a lot. It wasn't a bad job though but wasn't good"
bad,As much as I hate Walmart I actually enjoyed working there. It was a true community if somebody's house burnt down or flooded people would bring in clothing blankets food anything necessary they would give all kinds of donations cash furniture. Actually in Kingsport Tennessee Mike Ford was my department manager by the time I had left I got to say my favorite manager that I've ever had the store was a very well-oiled machine and I was told if I ever go back to Kingsport Tennessee that I have a job waiting for me so that's kind of nice to know
bad,"After working there it taught me how to work more as a team, and it also taught me how to work alone. The easiest thing about the job was riding the forklift, but the hard part was having to pick some of the heavy Objects alone."
bad,I dont feel as If we get the time we deserve. No doctors excuses or anything.......................................................5 points minimum. Call out on weekend its 2 points. Late .5 point. Weekday whole point. Holiday 3 points. No exceptions.
bad,"the way they manage our team could be done better, but overall the people there are great and the work is easy the hardest part is getting it all done on time with limited staff"
bad,"Typical day we work on 25-35 cars a day. I learned how use a tire machine and balancer, I also learned more about working in a garage in a retail company. Hardest part of my job is dealing with irate customers while keeping my cool. I have no issues with my direct manager. The people I work with make the job bearable."
bad,"When I first started working there I loved it, but over the years it just got worse and worse.  Very bad managment that would rather make an excuse or placing the blame on anybody but themselves to make them look better rather then actually fixing a problem"
bad,I think communication is very important in retail.  I know as a customers point also as dept. manager i know it rough when thing change daily but everyone must always be on the same page if something is broke leave that in on the report so the next shift knows call call in a work order or how to fix the problem.
bad,"I can say I worked for walmart for almost 3 years. The company is crude to floor-bound associates and even worse for unloaders like I was. Granted they demanded that they have things done in a reasonable time when I first started, gradually, they kept getting worse and worse. They honestly thought that a truck could be done within an hour. Though this was highly optimistic about getting things done. They went as far as to add more people to unload trucks which was harder on us unloaders because we couldn't move around as much, considering they demanded that they have us in fixed positions. I can see how that works for new employees but doesn't work with experienced workers. I perform better as a floater or someone who helps with who needs the most help or what needs to be unloaded faster. I'm just glad I got out of there before it got worse."
bad,"Pleasant experience, was a fun environment and diverse culture. There was opportunity to grow within this company................................................"
bad,Hated it! I was a cashier and going to school. Finished high school while working there. Then went to college while working there. Realized that I did not want to do that anymore and found my job in the medical filed so I quit.
bad,Melhoria nas gerências internas e cursos de aperfeiçoamento dos mesmos para melhor desenvolverem e se relacionar com os demais funcionários.
bad,"very quick paced job, great people to work with, great customer service. Just needs more hours for people that want the hour'.great workmanship. Management works with you and answers all questions that you may have."
bad,The hardest part is having to lift all heavy products an the job doesn't pay for back support. an they cut your hours just for other to have more hours
bad,"working at walmart is so stressful, the manager dnt commucate very well,the mangers there try an do u any kind of way if u dnt stand up for yourself.."
bad,"Go In Dept. observe things, clean up if needed. look in oven make sure its clean. take all prepared foods out to floor. come back to dept and prepare todays sub, salads and so on.  I learned a lot of different  depts. a typical grocery chain,  produce, sell, and lower the waste.  enjoyable moments at lunch with other associates, we all were like friends."
bad,"The job isn't what it used to be years ago. The idea of Associates having value or meaning is gone. "
bad,so I like stocking shelves but Walmart's management really needs some work iv heard other locations are not as bad as Chilton Wi but the management at this store was why I left
bad,"I have worked at my local Walmart Super Center for one year nearly to date, and have seen many things in that time. "
bad,"Productive and fun workplace , I have learned a lot working there with new people , helping  customers to the best of my ability is an amazing thing for me and the new people"
bad,"Every Walmart is different"
bad,"If you're looking for a long-term job, I would hardly recommend working as a Cashier for Walmart. While pay is somewhat decent and benefits like discounts can be a huge help, a large majority of your time spent in store revolves around managing difficult interactions with hardly any proper training. First day on the job had me watch a few hours of educational videos about the company's values and history. Then was immediately sent out to the sales floor to downstock/put away items from truck. No prior training. Little help from exhausted co-workers. Just sent to the wolves immediately. Only take this job if you're between big opportunities, moving to a new town from far away, or have little/no experience in the job industry..."
bad,I had been there 28 yrs and this was the WORSE group of mgmt ever!  Nobody took responsibility. They talked down to you. They made you feel worthless. Too many directions you're being pulled. You'll get 3-4 mgrs throughout the day asking for different things and you never get to finish and you get in trouble for not finishing
bad,"Although Managment has changed for the better, the previous culture is still existent. Once Managment learns how to communicate to staff with respect then things will be a lot better."
bad,"I worked in the meat department then trained to work in seafood department. My last couple years I worked as a cashier. "
bad,Walmart is okay to work for just don’t get far in the addentnce you are allowed so many but I was 30 weeks pregnant and it got a little too much for my body
bad,"The managers were completely insensitive to everyone from staff to customers in situations where they shouldn’t have been. It’s a great starting job because it’s good pay and good training, but unless you’re great at being an emotionless robot, it’s not a good place to stay. The people lower on the totem pole were nice and completely agreed with the situation that caused me to quit. When they are busy they ask me to take my job back actually."
bad,"Working for this company has help me improve with my people skills. It has also taught me to be very open minded and diverse. I really enjoyed working here, and it has also helped me get a better feel to work in a crowded environment."
bad,"much pressure to ask customers many questions for promotions (mastercards, fundraisers)"
bad,This place was more like kids working there than adults they were like if you were not in the pack of employees group you didn’t belong and they were unfair to there hard working employees
bad,"working here was never boring, everyday was something different, however remodeling was very stressful on the body, when it came to moving some of the products around. overall working at Walmart has given me exposure to different types of people and cultures"
bad,"I was terminated by choosing my disabled/blind family member in ICU or my job, attendance point system is 6 points in a 6 month rolling period, I accumulated 5 points in 5 days, and had prior points in the 6 mo period, I was there 7.11 years, and terminated, unfortunately siblings don't count thru Sedgwick their FMLA representatives."
bad,"As a corporation, Walmart does a fantastic job with providing employees with needed benefits. Employees also receive a very good wage, but management is horrible here. (Store in Hays, Kansas) They don't care about employees well-being and don't want you to grow with the company. I'm a college student so I didn't have any intentions to grow with them, but it's still sad to see others wanting to climb up the corporate ladder only to stay as a part-time employee for years. As a temporary job, Walmart would be one that I could recommend, but don't expect to be treated with the respect that you deserve here. Wages are good, along with benefits, but nearly everything else is something that I don't approve of as a company."
bad,Not to clean in the work area to many manegers walking around to much work for a 10 dollar salary too much injustice don’t really care about the employees and customers
bad,"I love working with others, however it seemed coming from the outside it was hard to be accepted by the internal employees. The ten foot rule was never used amongst employees. Management was very unprofessional at times. A lot of name calling in front of peers and bullying amongst peers. I felt like the training was inadequate and managers could be very bias toward new members joining the team. Internal Managers need Business Management Training or schooling in order to successfully lead others. I recommend writing down every discrepancy or disrespect from associates. document everything if you are an external hire."
bad,Only thing I can say about Wal Mart is the management could be a little better the women not being fairly treated. Customer Service needs a lot of Improvement
bad,23 yrs of my life wasted. I spent my career giving everything I had to this company and in the end they told me I could apply for a lesser position to keep my employment.
bad,"I worked at the one on Ferguson in Cincinnati Ohio and it was bad but the company itself was a good one."
bad,The pay is worth it but he place is not good. Your being watched constantly and people have their favorites. There are many other things i can go about the place but honestly if desperate for the money go for it
bad,Very Fast paced . I loved speaking to customers . This job is great for someone wanting to move up in the business . The management needs a lot of work with actually listening and helping when needed but it's a great place with great pay and benefits .
bad,I loved working at walmart. I just didn't like the people.... or co workers. Working at walmart was like going to high school and getting paid. People are often in your business. It was a lot of jealousy and haterade being drank.
bad,"mi evaluacion fue muy buena, tratando  de aprovechar la experiencia ganada."
bad,"Empresa com entrada e saída de caminhão 24 HS, faço as entradas de NF's de mercadorias para dentro do sistema, liberação de caminhão com os pallts vazio para os fornecedores, gero NF'S de mercadorias para as lojas da rede Walmart"
bad,"it is a fast pace place to work ffor, it was an ok ccompany tonwork for until they took pour benenfits away from us and want to change everything around."
bad,staff definitely under paid work extremely hard to many customers. not enough cashering lanes are open. everyone does not where correct uniform. no lunch provided short lunch breaks
bad,I loved it at first then it went down hill employers started being gossipy manager started being favortism if they change the staff & get better employers it’ll be great
bad,go in clock in. Make sure the food was at the right temps. Make sure it was fresh and make sure of what your duties were for the night. pretty well easy.
bad,a typical day at work at Wal-Mart is very physical and cold or hot depend on the department you work in.i learn you have to eat a lot because you does a lot of heavy lifting.you very every see management on the floor and the workplace culture was  on your own cause we was on indivual production.the hardest part of the job is driving the stand up lift with a loaded pallet with product standing 6 feet high.the enjoyable part of the job we break a record the company feed us steak
bad,Upper management has unrealistic expectations that not only strain low level employees physically but also mentally. There policies are constantly changing forcing employees to have learn knew rules regularly and they are underequipped for the job.
bad,Walmart is a great place to work other than mangers that take power to they head and feel like they can say and do what ever to who ever like that is a big problem for me just do your job and go about your day.
bad,Not the best job but paid good money every 2 weeks pushing carts. They was vary strick on going inside while we not on break. Had to stay coldf in vary safe because of the cars
bad,"It was a good job, especially for learning skills to further my career. I enjoyed working with the public and the coworkers were pretty helpful when it came to scheduling issues."
bad,"They only hire part time. The only way to get a full-time position is for someone to offer it to you. They only pay minimum wage and the highest raise you can get is 20 cents on your anniversary. If you have the Walmart Family Mobile plan, you get an employee discount so that you end up paying around $35 for unlimited everything."
bad,"regular,trabalho em equipe bacana alguns beneficio"
bad,"Tu demandes un congé et ils te mettent à l’horaire pareil. Tu vaux rien à leurs yeux tu n'es pas un humain , tu es une marionnette. Par contre, le salaire est toujours plus élevé que le salaire minimum."
bad,"Working here for 7 months I had the honor of meeting lots of good hardworking people, low pay and low amount of hours I wouldn't recommend to anyone who doesn't plan on working to jobs."
bad,customers are awful and think they are better and cant wait 3 seconds. great culture and area with very nice patient employees. would reccomend to a newb
bad,working there wasntt bad I enjoyed it except the they really don't care about working with you on scheduling. and there is a lot of favoritism. but other than that I enjoyed it.
bad,"No additional training was given if someone made a mistake, only consequences. Help was not provided, other co-worker still there when she is not people friendly"
bad,People didn't want to do there job so I had to stay later because people would leave and I would have to stay to get other people's job done. It was unfair to me!
bad,"If your interested in walmart be prepared to be on your feet all day, may even start experiencing back problems. Customers are terrible, Hours are ok. You receive  a bonus every six months, but you only get the full benefits if you are full time. The hours are flexible I worked during the weekends and went to school full time during the week. I personally would not recommend working at walmart full time unless you are in desperate need or need a few extra cash on the side. The time goes by super slow as well. The managers also sometimes have their favorites, which may vary amongst locations.I would never work in retail again after this experience unless im sitting in some type of office doing paperwork. This definitely isn't the job for me."
bad,Great company although they do not provide enough money per hour for a person to live on and that is why I had to work two jobs.  They discount was not enough to help.
bad,"Les gens sont sociables, mais quand vous êtes malade ou les enfants sont malades, ils sont non compréhensible. Très peu de congé et appel toujours pour rentré travailler même durant les congés."
bad,The job its self isn't to bad it's more so the managers that are stricken with power and abuse it. You are given decent vacation time and they treat you well for the most part. The pay is average though and it's rare to have a set schedule.
bad,"Aprendi a mexer com contas, computador, a saber converar com as pessoas."
bad,Walmart store number 1493 is a place where there is a lot of favoritism and a lot of unfairness goes on. Their employees are not treated fairly by the assistant management team as well as the store manager. Walmart can be a better place if the people would change their attitudes and treat people the correct way. I feel like you should be able to go to your fellow assistants and talk to them without your business being paraded all over Walmart but sorry that's not the case when it comes to that store. It is a lot of things that go on in that store that is unfair and it really needs to be handled and addressed.
bad,"Good work, I enjoy what I do, Management and just basic Walmart politics ruin the job, Management worries more about customers then employees, will always side with customer even when wrong, and throw Employee in the dirt, upper management only cares about own advancement and nothing about Employees"
bad,Management for the most part suck. They lie. They degrade you. They call you names.  They hardly ever compliment you. However there areally some gems and they are amazing.  They care.  They apreciate you. And I love my job.  I basically shop all day long for people who order things online.. I just wish management wasn't as bad as they are. And give out full time more often.
bad,"Foi meu primeiro emprego,  onde aprendi organização, comprometimento com horários."
bad,dealing with the public is a job that requires very much patients. Sometimes people can be very rude and disrespectful. but for the most part I really enjoy the working experience that you receive because you work almost every department in the store.
bad,I's face  a typical day at work. The crazy customer came my store she is looking for some products. I didn't find my shelves I told them polite but she didn't listen .She made a charge for me I wasn't helping her. My manager came to my area asked me whatever I did. She told me it's ok. 'Don't worry you can't lose your job for that'.Sometimes it happens our workplace .I's the most enjoyable part of the job I met many colleagues and working co-worker;s.This was my first job .I had no experience .I learned about my job from my co-workers . My job was sales associate at customer service . I liked it because I's not talking too much. I observed the customer whatever they needed and organized self the bins. That's my pleasure.
bad,"Existe un buen ambiente de trabajo, remuneran tus logros y los reconocen en público, apoyo por parte de los gerentes o encarados de la tienda."
bad,"Asset Protection Managers don't listen when you tell them there are problems. They don't address issues until their Market Asset Protection Managers get onto them for it. They complain about losing so much product but refuse to let us take steps to secure under the excuse that it would not be customer friendly. Other Asset Protection Associates are good to work with, was able to train a lot of Asset Protection Associates and went to different stores to work witch was fun. Home office has no idea what they are doing when assigning new security polices, most of them are usless."
bad,"Perfect place to work during school years, flexible hours, but the management does not care, and do not respect you enough."
bad,"Teach safety to department heads, start on the cameras in money room also shipments that came in over nite. Learn a lot about the  law  and how it works.Mangement was very helpful in apprhentions also in alerting me on in house theif and the repect that they gave you. Hardest part you never know when danger is coming. Enjoyed hunt of camera watching and the never dull moments"
bad,"I loaded trailers, building safe walls of product that would not fall and potentially harm others. I did this as quickly and safely as possible to meet quota."
bad,Major Corporation.  Pays decently.  Not much advancement to full time employment with benefits.  Easy to relocate to other areas.
bad,"A typical day of work can include inbound and outbound calls, retention, recruiting, scheduling, associate engagement, and  time management on launchpad.I have learned that everyday can be a challenge but being productive is your best success to get through your day.My co-workers are leaders as well and we do so by leading with integrity for whats right.The hardest part of my job is not being able to  smile and seeing how everyone is doing. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I'm here to make a difference for another career advancing day."
bad,"It didn't really like working there, it was more cut-throat than I wanted. They were more focus on what the customers needed and not the workers. They didn't understand or care when I lost someone in my family they still wanted me to work the day of the funeral. The pay was great and they had great benefits."
bad,"Typical day included putting out produce, culling produce, making sure nothing is on the floor, make sure items and displays are organized and presentable. "
bad,"I was originally a cashier when I got hired. After a short time I was made the cashier trainer for new hire cashiers. I was also bumped up to customer service, where I did returns and money gram, cashing payroll checks everyday, also dealing with customer complaints."
bad,"At store level I had had excellent managers. Loved all of my co workers,many will be friends for life.I learned many things from stocking,working in the back room,people skills and good customer service even if I encountered a customer who was upset for any kind of reason. for example if we were out of an item they needed,etc.The lifting was hard at times but I loved my job and the work I did."
bad,"Pues es un trabajo que me gustava ya que me mantenia activo, haciendo cosas cotidianas y pues me parecio buen trabajo ya que se aprenden cosas como: respeto, colaboracion, honestidad, buen trabajo.Todos son amigables y ofrecen buen trato y que mejor empesando con los de arriba (gerentes) desde alli se producia la comunicacion y buen ambiente laboral para motivarnos y trabajar con ganas."
bad,"A typical day at work was hard . I learned how to decorate cakes, cupcakes and bake bread. Management was very unprofessional and my co-workers were very catty. The hardest part of the job was working as a team."
bad,"You enter not knowing where you will be stationed. Learned to be more flexible. There were to many managers and not enough employees. I am able to work with a variety of people, so making friends is never a problem. Hardest part of the job would be pallets stocked to high making it hard to haul to floor. The most enjoyable part of the day was going home."
bad,I stocking merchandise overnight. I learned how to move 15-17 hours of merchandise within 8 hours. Management was not the best most of the time. They need more training in communication.
bad,I was fired because I made a complaint about being sexually harassed on the plus side the employs became family to me. The management need to be changed
bad,"i enjoyed the experifnce a lot ,some supervisors were cool while others were kinda pushy,they taught me things that i still use today so i think that was cool"
bad,it's really not a bad place to work. Your always busy and time goes by fast you get benefits. The work is really not that hard.
bad,was trained in every department in store multitask detail orientated worked with minimum supervision
bad,Doctors notes are not allowed or excepted by management.  I find this to be unacceptable!
bad,working for walmart was a decent job minimal work and enjoyable coworkers
bad,"A typical day at work involved being bossed around by someone in a very low management spot and ignored completely by upper management. This allowed a lot of leeway in behavior and caused cliques with this lower management branch. "
bad,Advancement at own pace. Easy going work environment with plenty of opportunity for promotion/ pay raise but at personal preference or raye.
bad,"My day consisted of waiting on customers and preparing hot and cold food products."
bad,I would greet the customers as they entered and exited the store. I learned that I enjoy helping others. Management was kind and always willing to help. My coworkers were more than willing to share the workload and help others. The hardest part of the job was finding something to do during the slow times of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the culture. Working at Walmart is like gaining a new family.
bad,Attend daily morning meetings to discuss policies and benefits with management and employees. Review emails from management and home office follow all orders given on a daily basis. Review applications and schedule interviews with management for open positions. Update and assign all training plans for new and advancing  associates. Maintain all personal files for all associates. Conduct background checks and drug screens for new employees. Verify scheduled hours to hours worked.
bad,Poor management at times to meet needs of our grocery area. Other than that it was pretty good
bad,"sometimes it was hectic which I like,and sometimes it was nothing to really do.The only hard part was just at the beginning,trying to learn where everything was and to go.most co-workers and some upper management people where cool.what I did learn from this place is when they say they can work with you on your schedule well that's just was an out right lie.And if they feel intimated or don't really like you or feel your abilities a little more than theirs,they will find a way to make it difficult for you to work there.I only sensed 2 of upper management has some issue with me just by the way they present themselves around me,in reality they really didn't have a reason since I haven't been there that long.I did my work and beyond and man was I quick learner.but the other ones where pretty cool.I like a couple of my bosses.Some of the coworkers where cool to work with,but I seen an issue with 1,the comment they made was positive on my side,but I don't think so on theirs.It sad I have to find another job,which could have been resolved,but the feeling I was getting from that upper management person that wasn't on their agenda.I guess I learn what people mean when they say someone is on a  ""power trip"".or maybe they where just plain judgmental and didn't want to give me a chance."
bad,it is a reliable work place but the down fall is you have no personal life if you work their
bad,The training program at Walmart is the best I have encountered.  At store level associates are loyal to one another.  The hardest part of this job is losing coworkers who have worked and trained me from the beginning to other pharmacies.
bad,I sart my day at 5 am to 530 pm I drive a RR forklift I fill module and put pallets away I orderfill in the module and the mangers are good they listen and teach you if you don't now. I have a great group of friends that I work with enjoy our time there and just work. the hardest part is keeping up with the demand of 508 cases an hour. getting over time is the best part of the job making money and working hard doing it.
bad,"learned alot of skills, made good friends, hours where descent"
bad,would come in  at 10 pm and working overnight felt like time was alot faster . the ppl were great and being able to listen to music to keep you busy was a plus. the co-workers were also fun and friendly as well. great environment to work in. Management does need quite improvement as they try to target you for no typical reason and will rudely harrass you 
bad,I worked produce and back room freight unloader. Being taught the ins and outs of produce was awesome. There is a lot that goes into making sure the customer has the best product available to them and that its fresh and delightful. Co-workers were helpful and determined but otherwise were unhappy with their jobs due to poor management. Management seemed disorganized and would often have 3 managers telling 1 employee to do the job the way they each asked and then later would get upset at the employee for following another managers direction instead of their own. the hardest part of the job would definitely have to be repeating the same work you just finished because another manager wanted it a different way. The time wasted could've been spent with more pressing tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and the satisfaction you could see on their faces after you helped them find what they needed. Customer satisfaction and safety are top priorities for any business. walmart definitely has a great understanding of those two values.
bad,cold warhouse
bad,i just went and set up the store learned and the set up the store didnt know anyone at the store
bad,"I was a cashier and couldnt leave where they put me, some of the mangers i didnt like , my job was easy but sometimes the customer made it hard"

bad,"A non profit bussiness, that uses its money gained for meals on wheels program"
bad,I would be at work early we were busy from the time I got there until closing. I learner good coustomer service skills. Management was strict. Co workers were nice and easy to work with. Hardest part wasnot enough hours. Team players
bad,"i learned how to work with others and adapt to different working conditions, poor management, some were easy to work with, the rest were to lazy to work and were only there to procrastinate, won't nothing really hard about the job and one thing i liked about the job was finishing the job on time"
bad,"chegar bate cartão ir pra sala de reuniões saber o quanto devia ser vendido naquele dia e quanto tinha vendido no dia anterior,aprendi muita coisa como ser uma operadora de caixa não tinha noção de como era,tinha colegas muito companheiros a gerência por si era boa ."
bad,"Overall, this company in general is quite non-discriminating when it comes to hiring ethics such as age, gender, nationality, etc. and it gives plenty of opportunities for career advancement. Plus, some of the things that I have enjoyably experienced while working for this company as a sales associate, is that I have learned a lot about electronics and new technology and I enjoy the fun atmosphere that is present when I work beside certain co-workers who are also hard-working and team players like myself. However the hardest part of my job there, is that there is a high-turnover and new employees seem to be coming and going through a revolving door so to speak... and I don't know if it's because they feel uncomfortable because of the minimum training that is initially offered through a computer system, or if they realize that they are just not cut out for retail as a whole. But either way, it makes the job harder and more frustrating when there is a great deal of work to be done and the few hard-working employees in any given department are left to pick up the slack where the slackers left off!"
bad,They are real freindly and give you lots of choices to work from
bad,It was an ok place to work till i became pregnet with my daughter i feel after that they lookd for reasons to fire me!
bad,They don’t care about there employees not understanding at all only care about sales I’ve only worked there for 2 months and hated it they are all mean and rude.
bad,"A normal day at work is running around and trying to keep shelves filled and customers happy, with being able to answer their questions and help them find products. It isn't always easy you'll get customers that will be frustrated or angry form other associates not answering there questions and you will have to manager an situation to the best of your ability and most of all don't take anything personally."
bad,Management is poor but co workers were great loved the pay but no management not fair at all but over all my work experience was good. They work with point system so when they say life happens they don’t care
bad,"The work at Walmart distribution centers is not for the faint of heart. It is hard, fast paced, and unforgiving. Co-workers are great, they help the new people. Personally my managers were good as well. The work is just not for everybody, especially somebody like me whom has a leg disease."
bad,"At the Wal-mart that I worked at  the customers were rude most of the time, the management were also rude a lot of the times and would not help you move up in the company. Racial profiling/discrimination is definitely a thing at the Silvis Wal-Mart, It stopped being fun after a while because you start feeling like they dont appreciate you, Which they don't."
bad,"Nothing was wrong with the actual job, management was just terrible, rude and not helpful at all but were quick to gossip about everyone. I actually liked working at Walmart but couldn't deal with the managers."
bad,"Honestly the company could be better as a whole if they took the time to train their management, and employees a bit better. Not a lot of effort goes into the associates they chose to hire. We need more lead by example leaders not just do as I say."
bad,Walmart started out great but the management team is now horrible I wish they would all get on the same page. The associate are all team oriented but not the management team
bad,"I been working at Walmart for almost 5 years, when I first started, I was working in Apparel, but now I am on cap team 1, we have bad mangers, they are very lazy, I always have to do they job for them because they don’t want too, they don’t appreciate the work that associates do, they always trying to rushed everybody to do they job but every associate has it’s own paste."
bad,"They overworked you for your pay. They demand for you to work like a dog. About 1/3 of the  management staff are horrible people whom treat there sale associates like dirt , they can be very rude and nasty, when you truly deserve praises. There is a lot of favoring at this place and if you are not apart of the brown nosing crowd you will never get a  promotion, you could never be good enough, no matter how hard and good of a worker you are."
bad,They had bad management skills. They had nobody to train me they just kept throwing me off to the next person so because of lack of training I only knew about the stuff that they showed me and ever other day after that it would be somebody new yelling at me saying I’m doing my job wrong or I’m not suppose to be doing certain stuff that the other people said I was supposed to be doing. It was nerve reckoning.
bad,Easy job to get for making a little extra money on the side. Also good for additional job experience with all the positions available. The associates are really helpful.
bad,Management didn’t care about the associates at all they don’t respect their associates when I stated working there it was real friendly and fine then I started to see how management was working and some associates acted just like them rude to customers
bad,"I enjoyed working at Walmart as a cashier through the holiday months. In fact, I would even say I was good at my job. When the time came for seasonal hires to be let go, I was offered a full-time position that I could not take at the time because of my school schedule. I was then offered a job in the grocery department with the promise that if I found that I did not like it, or I was not able to fulfill the job requirements, I could come back to the front. Upon arrival in my new department, I was assured that what I had been told was the case. I tried my new job for a month, and in that month it became clear that the managers were out of touch with the amount of work that was being asked and providing little to no help or guidance. After asking three different managers for my transfer, I finally had to ask the Department Manager directly and she told me that I would have to stay for 6 months (which is normal policy). It was at that point I decided to quit as I had clearly been lied to by at least two managers"
bad,the work experience i got from Walmart was really helpful for my work experience but the manager's where really bad. they did not treat the associate with respect.
bad,Everybody does not work as a team people will leave there work for you to do. The Mangers treat you any kind of way and talk to you any kind of way. I found myself making bales everyday and no one else made them . They don’t let you wear hoodies at all even if u work in the freezer.
bad,Management had no respect for their employees. The harder you work only gets you more expectations. The store manager looks and talks to employees like peasants.
bad,"Excelente empresa, mas após o fechamento de diversas lojas se tornou instável."
bad,Fun and a new experienxce  there loved the people and the interactions.....Overall I would recommend anyone working there.The management some parts are bad....But work is fun the people are fun......
bad,A typically day at Walmart is dealing with customers with angry attitudes and having to carry yourself as a professional and stay positive through the whole situation. I have learned a lot of skills while being employed with Walmart. Management is really poor. They talk to associates any kind of way and using them to do all of their work so they don't have to do anything. The hardest part of the job is going to into everyday where you are not appreciated. The most enjoyable part is the people you work with.
bad,"The job was fast, hard, and management was poor. They don't work well with your schedule at all, especially college students, but I made great money, and they have decent benefits"
bad,I loved working for walmart they offer a flexible schedule with great benefits even though my employment with them was short lived each day was different
bad,"It was an okay job ! Managers could be better ! They could give more hours . Their pay is fair . The longer you’re there the better the pay !  Step it up Walmart ,"
bad,If you get your work done and don't slack you would have fun working at walmart it is a loving environment and the staff you work with will become part of your life
bad,I meet some really good people from employees to customers. Learned how to use hand held devices to change prices on merchandise became a forklift operator and got certified to sell alcohol.
bad,walmart has unrealistic expectations.  The staffing is inadequate for the number of tasks given out on any given day. Employees are often made to feel guilty for time off and family emergencies'
bad,"Very fast paced and busy work environment, there was always work to do. It was a great job! But there was also absolutely no teamwork and very poor communication between the management team members, in the department that I had worked in. A lot of slacking and employees/managers disappearing during shifts(proof of not working during shifts with numerous employees on numerous occasions), it was a bit out of control. Genuinely the company can run better and smoother if everyone did/enforced their roles more effectively. It would be more sufficient if people actually followed rules and regulations, you would have more caring, devoted and longer lasting employees. It could also save money(between paying employees to train, hiring, firin, ect.) and be more in control and less hectic/crazy."
bad,"No comment, personal experience , management do not assist when needed. No understanding to what situation that a employee may experience no time to really listen to any complaints"
bad,"a typical day at walmart was mainly all about the customer service and how we treat the customers. Most days i was cooking with a fryer, food temps, and cleanliness."
bad,It is a very fast paced work place.  You meet alot of different people. If you don't mind going over and beyond for the customers you won't get bored. Learn to do everything and you'll excel quickly.
bad,"Fast paced environments, although some managers do not care of your circumstance or condition.   Some of the managers were very sweet, it was the head managers who did not really care to associate with people.   Although I was pregnant, they still required me to lift heavy items, and not allow me to use the restroom, when I was experiencing morning sickness."
bad,Walmart treats their Employs fair but getting minimum wages to deal with ruid costmers is the worst thing in the world specially when you get costumer that will get very aggressive to the point that it get to become a physically aggressive situation
bad,They expect too much out of everyone and have little no no empathy or understanding of what the job entails when concerning the waves of consumers who come daily.  They expect results with little help and it always isn't guaranteed.
bad,La gerencia y los jefes tenían un trato malo hacia los empleados
bad,I enjoyed working at Walmart but I noticed early on advancement was not an option. After working there for 3 years I still had not cleared $10 an hour. Management is lazy. It is extremely hard to get a full-time spot. Overtime is never an option except for around the holidays. After the holidays your hours will get cut dramatically. Walmart doesnt follow the law in terms of scheduling part-timers at least 20 hours per week. I had times where I would get as low as 12 hours but and fear of losing my job I never complained. The Discount was great but the stocks are useless as i never seen a penny earned.
bad,"Walmart for me wasn't so bad or so wonderful to work there, some of my managers didn't want to change schedule because I'm in school, and people who I worked with taught me a lot of useful ideas to get me up to speed. I didn't want to be a cashier in the first place but I needed a job to support myself and also to provide for my education needs."
bad,It was an alright place to work. I was able to advance quickly in the company. I started in the electronics department and within three months was promoted to department manager of the meat department.
bad,I had a lot of interaction with Customers in this position. At tomes it can be stressful but you learn how to handle different situations and different personalities. The work load can get heavy at times due to lack of help.
bad,the whole day you constantly walking around completing your tasks (changing trashcans and putting carts back in store) and attending to customers needs. The culture in walmart is very strict always to be on time and welcoming to everyone around you. Hardest part of the job is keeping yourself busy as you quickly run out of thing to do for the day. Things that i enjoyed of the job was the customer service you get to meet all kinds of people and you always felt better helping other people out
bad,"Our associates are building better lives for their families, and we’re proud to be a part of their success stories. We offer competitive pay, health care and beneﬁts, as well as bonus opportunities, merchandise discounts, and most of all, a chance to move up."
bad,My experience at Walmart was horrible. I would get in trouble if I removed the carts and shopping baskets out of the walkway.Because I left my workstation. But I was trying to do customer service by eliminating walking hazards.
bad,"Walmart was a good place to work. I was hired for seasonal work, and I got to learun a lot about how a store operates.  I  stocked everything from toys to food and hardware."
bad,"Walmart was my first real job in the real world. However, I felt that my csm's treated me unfairly. I did love working there but I wish I would have applied for a different role other than cashier."
bad,"the staff Ain't that helpful, management is mean. no one knows how to have fun. If you are looking to work here the 12.50 an hour aint worth it you could find a better job."
bad,"it is a place where u can learn everything as a pharmacy tech and as a cashier as well. staff is friendly, they give u a lot of benefits and opportunities to grow."
bad,"Wal-mart is a pretty good company to work for depending on the store you go to. Management  is not organized and tend to not help out at all. They do have ok benefits such as a 401k, Stock Purchase, and health benefits."
bad,This job requires the employee to be on feet all day. The work is very monotonous and boring. This job requires a lot of concentration with less breaks.
bad,"i worked for walmart for about 2 years. i was able to gain a lot of knowledge as far as warehouse, and front customer service. the company is great on moving up into different departments."
bad,"My time working for walmart as a cashier was an okay job. Other than the fact that there would be days where I would have to do my cashier and on top of that when they found out I previously was a stocker they had me doing that and more. My issue was stockers made more money than cashiers, however with me doing my job and theirs I was never offered any extra compensation."
bad,"Employés aimables et serviables."
bad,"Always busy, poor management, a lot of employees showed very poor customer service, great customers, always something to do, they have opportunity for advancement in the company."
bad,Nice place to work  the management team was really good my team leader really nice and help full great money great benefit. All the people really nice
bad,"Walmart is not a very good place to work, yes the pay is good and decent and the employees are very nice and dependable everyone is a team to help each other out, people shop there because its cheap, but employees get treated horribly by the public the quality of people who shop there is very unpleasant."
bad,The managers and other associates don't treat you well . The work is fun but not the environment. There is a lot of drama. They don't care about family or medical issues.
bad,I liked working at walmart its was very good company I liked working with customers and helping customers that's all I learned a lot from working at wal mart I got along with all my coworkers
bad,"Meeting all kinds of new people. Being part of a growing company. Learning how to create merchandise display, order in of products, and management of a department."
bad,"Walmart is actually a great workplace, I love dealing with the customers it makes my day to have all my customers smiling . The work is pretty easy but it could be a little heavy at times , such as needing get a helping hand before my shift is over .  My co-workers are awesome we motivate each other everyday to be better than the day before.  As far as the management it's a bit tough . Sometimes things could get a bit out of hand. Walmart also has a period of time where they cut hours for months. I feel as if it's good because people have responsibilities that doesn't stop. Overall I love working with the customers,  I learn new things everyday and enjoy doing it."
bad,"Me parece muy buena empresa para aprender ya que tienen mucha capacitación continua, pero tienen el defecto de obligar a checar la salida al final del turno y que sigas laborando sin pagar siquiera el tiempo extra, para ellos esta prohibido generar tiempo extra. Porque hasta mantienen cuadros de los principios walmart y uno de ellos dice -no dejes para mañana lo que puedes hacer hoy-. Toda esta situacion a causa de la baja cantidad de personal que disponen para cada departamento."
bad,Ordered and maintained grocery Dept. at a Super Center in Crestview FL. Increased sales by better ordering process that reduced empty spots on shelves.
bad,"Loved this job. I learned how to handle all kinds of stressful situations. The management was very busy,  so, it was hard to get find them if needed. Co-workers were a very diverse group of individuals."
bad,Walmart was a productive workplace but how they set the schedule up is to where you spend most of your time if not all of your time working in Walmart. The hardest part of the job was having to stand in one spot because I like to walk around and interact. The most enjoyable part about the job was when I had a line of people and I had to ring all of them up. Not only did I get to meet new people but I felt as if getting through all of those people in a timely fashion was like a mini challenge for me to succeed at. Working at Walmart I did learn how to come up out of my shy shell and interact with people.
bad,"Everyday is exciting and no two days are ever alike. My work day involves everything from leading my team towards continuous improvement to ensuring that our store is ready for the customer and doing the absolutely best we can to please them. Because the retail industry is changing so fast there is always a better more profitable way to do things. Its very exciting. Of all  the locations I've worked at for this company, currently I'm thrilled to be part of one of the best management teams Ive ever worked with, enjoyable and productive. Where I get the most pleasure from  my job is serving customers and meeting their needs and expectations . Making their particular  experience with me and my team,a positive, successful shopping experience  that will bring them back."
bad,"Great store/company to work at,"
bad,Walmart was a very serious place that system didnt work for my social security card but overall it a good job.So it was hard for me to get a schedule and they constantly forgot about others which was not okay but i survived.
bad,Hard work. Teamwork played a huge role. Learned more advanced knowledge from the higher ups. Steadily moving. Received acknowledgement from managers and a good support system.
bad,I would go n at a different time everyday managers are slow on bringing money or responding but I loved interacting with the customers and my co-workers. The  hardest part was to get the mangers to respond to my calls. I enjoyed coming to work and the customers talking and laughing.
bad,I don't like to beg for hours and when I ask for more hours they don't have them. I got 9 to 17 hours a week. The department Manager wanted to give me more hours but couldn't.
bad,"A typical day at work is arriving there and greeting the customers. We take care of hundreds of people through out the day making sure they are satisfied with their purchases. I've learned that patience is the key in a customer service job and that the customer is always right. The mangers are very respectable, understanding people. I really enjoy working with my coworkers and making our customers happy to shop with us."
bad,The only thing I did not like was standing up on the hard cold floor.
bad,"Cashier"
bad,Very Productive and a great establishment to work in. Fast pace and easy to learn.
bad,"A typical day at this Walmart is just plain unacceptable, always short staffed, very unorganized, average checkout time 15-25 minutes (not including the wait in line). Didn't quite learn anything new. Management (all forms) rude and difficult to communicate with. Most co-workers were friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part was getting assistance from management when needed. The most enjoyable part was assisting customers and making their experience at the store a little more enjoyable by providing speedy service and a maintaining a positive attitude even under pressure. "
bad,I Like The Company But Its Very Unorganized And The Management Is Very Horrible
bad,"My typical Day in the Deli Department was helping customers and preparing salads.  What I learned from this experience was a lot. I learned that Customers were our #1 Priority.  helping them with their needs.Management there were great and out-going.  The hardest part of this job was dealing with frustrated customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was cooking, cleaning, preparing salads and helping the Happy Customers!"
bad,Walmart is a very Bussy Place with a lot of different things to do and not enought staffing at all.
bad,"Em primeiro lugar as pessoas,onde não medem esforços em ajudar os que menos se destacam no dia .Apreendi  a ser organizado e ter metas para o ano todo .O  gerente escuta a minha opinião e apoia minhas decisões. O mais difícil era atender todas as necessidade do funcionário quando a empresa limita recursos .A  parte mais agradável era chegar no final de expediente com as tarefas realizadas."
bad,"Our night really gets started at 12:00 A.M. when all of the customers are officially out of the store. We get the music started and our hard work begins. Most people would see this as a easy job were you don't have to try to get things done but this is where they go wrong, every overnight associate gets put into a department where they are required to get done in a certain amount of time. We have a program called my guide which sums up our tasks on where we are supposed to be throughout the store and how long we have to do so. Bangor Wal-mart, being the most popular Wal-mart in the New England we have a lot to do each night whether its filling up the shelves, changing around feathers, zoning (cleaning up the store and making sure the shelves look neat) and the list goes on. I learn something new everyday, and meet all kinds of daily customers every night which is probably my favorite part of the job. I work with some really awesome people, but some keep to themselves because they are probably not happy with the 10 P.M. to 7 A.M. schedule. I have been told by two of my managers that I should try to advance with the company because they are very happy with my work that I do on a daily basis."
bad,"I come into work and grab my equipment, continue to the back room and pull inventory. You have to have dedication , and be willing to work hard all night. Although management is not the best you still have to find ways to get your job done. I feel like they could work on their communication skills as well as giving instruction. My coworkers and I do the best we can to help each other out to make sure our work gets done in a timely matter. The hardest part of my job is picking up the slack from day shift and having to finish my assigned tasks as well. What I enjoy the most are my hours and coworkers."
bad,"typical day at Wal-mart helping customers with there daily issues and needs, management very decent offers hours for people who prove they want them. I've learned to strengthen my customer service skills and improve on my people skills, and problem solving to come out with a general solution to improve the customer or job related situation. most enjoyable part of the day would have to be the customers different faces and personality to interact with on a consistent bases good&bad."
bad,"My normal day is making sure we are prepared for the business! "
bad,This job pays the minimum but it also allows the lazy to stay employed. For a student with a lot of debt this is okay to work at but for hard workers you will only ever feel frustrated and under payed. I found it aggravating how I worked hard but wouldn't get as much income and the effort I put in.
bad,"Uma otima empresa que a oportunidades de desenvolvimento,da qual aprendi muitas coisas infelismente a gerencia nao supre todas as responsabilidade da qual deveria.otimos relacionamentos com colegas."
bad,i had a lot of fun working there met a lot of good people until i was let go for something that happened along time before i started working there then they dropped the hammer on me after 7 years of hard work.
bad,"me gusta que dan capacitacion constante, tienen buenos salarios y buenos vales y bonos, mucha sprestaciones, solo que en panaderia no se puede desprender uno del puesto en todo el dia incluso en ocasiones en las noches , eso es lo que no me gustó con el tiempo"
bad,Assisted customers with their purchase and handled customer complaints.
bad,"A typical day at work,would be greeting the customers,and making sure they find everything they need. I learned it's always good to keep a steady pace.My manager was great,alot of help.The co workers never mind switching jobs,hours,etc. The hardest part of the job,was being in the building 9 hours instead of 8.The most enjoyable part was we got 8 hours a day instead of 7 1/2"
bad,es una empresa donde tienes un ambiente de trabajo agradable donde puedes trabajar con muchoi en tu siasmo y donde podemos aprender barias cosas
bad,They work u alot for nothing and dont pay well enough to compensate. There were nice people there though.
bad,"Walmart in woodward has some wonderful people working there but the Assistant Store Manager job was that of a joke, it was a salary position and you were not able to leave each evening til the trucks were unloaded and 50% of the grocery freight was down stacked, this usually resulted in managers having to unload the truck if you wanted to go home at 8pm, Most days was 8am to 10pm long hours hard work and not enough family time"
bad,"Sell electronic talk to customers about electronics but recieved no commission for any of the sales I maded, sucked!!!"
bad,As long as you don't get comfortable and your ready for extreme changes this is the company for you. Fast pace and a feel of urgency. Customer friendly environment. There is always something to do
bad,Their is only 4 shifts to work. The schedule is not flexible.Freight handler do the most work and are unpaid. The job is not the best environment. No room to move up in company.
bad,"As a Walmart employee I learn a lot about the company and went above and beyond for customers. I work for customer services and cashier. Customers services I answered phone, scanned items, money gram transaction, help with layaway items."
bad,I love stocking good job I love work at Walmart again fun job get know new people see alot of things work with people love there job fun  have alil fun at work
bad,I would recommend working at Walmart but not the one that I worked at because some of the management didn’t know what they were doing I was only getting 20 hours a week I can’t live off of that and they pretty much made me loose my car because I asked for more hours and they wouldn’t give then to me and I told them I can’t live off 20 hours a week and they said oh well.
bad,Walmart is horrible to work out with not having enough hours and not even good management. Overall a horrible place to work at and would never recommend.
bad,The management was slow to do their job if they chose to do it. Their job can be whatever they want it to be according to my supervisor. Although if you need simple cash and any amount will do working here is great. You can get away with a lot without getting coached or fired as long as you work a little bit. Benefits feel standard to a major corporation.
bad,It was an okay job. It had great pay. Some of the managers were nice and some were very rude and stuck up. If you like being around stuck up people then this is the perfect job for you.
bad,The management at the walmart I work at are inconsiderate to their employees. On busy days it always seems as if we're always understaffed. They walmart I work for has already had over 7+ people leave because of management.
bad,"Todo bien es un buen ambiente laboral"
bad,"I had been with Walmart for almost 3 years and I can honestly say my time there at first was great but it started taking a turn I got promoted to a department manager position was removed over coachings for side notes, one of them that was given too me was against company policy and when I brought that to the manager's attention he told me well there are stipulations too that which there aren't any in the longer run we are suppose to do side notes after 2 P.M.and that is what I did and pulled in the office afterwords because I didn't do them when i first was told about the side note, I can't say it was all bad though and in my time as a department manager I had been to other stores in the market that were fantastic sadly I was just in a store that ran completely backwards compared to the rest of the company and that isn't even just my opinion that any time I went to other stores in the market and the academy store for management training when I was asked what store are you from I would tell them and the typical response was always oh.. you are from THAT store."
bad,"Always smiles, be friendly, an work fast. I work in the customer service department doing money orders cashing checks also at the customer service desk where I refund item customers no longer have value in."
bad,"Most of the time, work days go by pretty fast. I enjoy interacting with new customers and familiar faces. The most difficult part of my job is stocking the shelves. My reasoning for this is that it becomes difficult to do my job when every couple of minutes a customer asks for assistance, and it takes time away from my job."
bad,"A typical day at Sam's consist of clocking in and go straight to work. Nothing particularly hard simply collect carts,pick up trash and lead a helping hand."
bad,It was a good steady job. Fun once you got to know everyone and you know that the store will never close. fast paced and a good way to get a workout..
bad,Overall it was an amazing experience to get my feet in the door of the retail business.. Great pay and really nice people..it required a lot of work but still very worth it.
bad,"just not for me. Supervisors would look for things to fire you for. My opinion is if they did their job and trained you well, then they would have no one to fire. So by firing people it shows they did a bad job of training you."
bad,Working for Wal-Mart is great but the Corporate changes have made this job not too favorable if you aren't a manager of more. Recently they rolled out a new scheduling system that allows you to set in your hours for 3 months. Great right? Wrong what they aren't saying is that anyone who has full-time employment and benefits will loose their full-time status because they offer the associate well under the required 35hrs a week to keep your status. So you now have to scramble to find the rest of your hours somewhere else in the store while your main dept. suffers from the lack of coverage.
bad,"While benefits and hours in the department manager position are great, Walmart does not staff the way it should in certain areas of the store. This results in overworked, stressed out employees. One associate can work hard on a task and another associate can come behind and undo all that work and not be held accountable. There is simply too much work for one person to do and at the end of a hard days work it still is not enough. The job is not fulfilling."
bad,"It was a pretty good workplace. A typical day at work was usually  busy. I learned how to properply bag items to the customers satisfaction, and at an alarming rate."
bad,I really working at Walmart because they tips you good in they take good care of u they reason why I wanna job is because that I leave with my mama in now show just got a baby so she can’t work to paid the bills so I want this job to help my mama paid the bills
bad,"treated like a robot with to many trucks managment was awful "
bad,"Generally, a typical day at work is executing a task in the refrigerator below 25 degrees. The management of Associates seems a bit clunky at times couple with irregular dress codes. Workplace culture was very boring compounded with bias and favoritism managers. Navigating through customers down the aisle to stock the shelves with merchandise was always a challenge. What I found fascinating about this job was the immense benefits it offered. Lastly, I learned how to operate a walkies stoker as well as professionally using a RF Scanner."
bad,i liked walmart when i first started but i didn't like the css or csm there some of them weren't taking their job seriously. and they would not get anyone to relief from my breaks like i had to go to lunch that's why i got ternimated. it was there fault not mines.
bad,"We need to hire people with actual talent, attention to detail and a sense of urgency. Also paying the associates a livable wage would be beneficial...."
bad,"Was not trained properly very limited details and instructions. Unreliable work days random VOT, unnecessary sending employees home early or through out day."
bad,I love working at walmart with my co worker. The customer was the best part cause you get the sweet ones. Then some times you get the ones that mean and don't want to talk but I always put a smile on somebody's face
bad,More better work environments staying safe always try to move forward on every task I have try to make every customer happy always make work my main focus
bad,"I worked for Walmart in multiple locations across the US, my experiences varied from location to location but over all it was a good job. Great pay, multiple advancement opportunities."
bad,Working at Walmart was fun I have the same employees for the time I was there and I was there for almost a little over 20 years and I worked hard with my employees are store number one in sales and in customer service  that was our goal every month when we had our meetings we would set a goal for each department in each department can always reach their goal in sales I had fun with my employees and customers always came back and that is what makes our sales .
bad,Just Poor Management didnt give proper training to there employees and some were jumped to a register when they were not ready which caused unhappy customers
bad,It was a everyday chill environment each day that I worked because we particular did everything late at night when people are not in the store.We stocked our shelves and went about our day
bad,"Responded to escalated customers questions"
bad,"It's was a nice job , I liked working with the others associates. Customers were enjoyable and fascinating people. The hours was good and they pairs well. You had very good benifits as well."
bad,It was fin because I got yo help customers with anything they needed. Answer the phones to help customers on the way too. I also got to work in the front as a cashier to help customers too.
bad,The most enjoyable part about walmart is the fact that associates are like family and closer than ever. The hardest part is having to deal with difficult customers and knowing how to provide excellent care to the difficult customers
bad,Uma empresa de grande porte. Que dá suporte e incentivo aos funcionários para crescerem dentro da empresa.
bad,It is a good starter job for people getting into the work force.  Management do not talk to each other and they don't really help you out with problems at work.
bad,"Mi deber era,abrir y cerrar la caja..Arquear "
bad,"Management was constantly bickering with each other and would talk to their employees about ""communication"" issues while they had their own."
bad,"Management is good, they show their appreciation. If your team up on aisles, your co-workers can make you or break you depending how quickly they can stock. Overall it's a decent part--time job unless your looking to move up the ladder."
bad,unload trucks by setting up convoyer line and separating products to sign department pallet stock shelves hardest part was working overnight and not use to it
bad,"Typically a day at Walmart isn't as horrible as most would say, it's very busy which makes time fly, most customers are polite and willing to listen when it comes to knowledge about the product they are purchasing."
bad,"hard work but great benefits "
bad,pharmacy cashier gave me an incredible opportunity to learn about customer service and how to handle money in a fast environment  and work fast in a stressful atmosphere.
bad,"I really enjoyed working here because I always got to meet new people and being friendly helping them all the time and that made me enjoy my job,I learned to how to be patient and friendly with customers, coworkers were always really nice."
bad,"i hated working here but miss all the people who i use to work with, very great people but customers arent so nice, pay was good just hours werent so good."
bad,Great workplace I loved my manager Joe some managers have no experience and just get put in a position so that's makes it not a good place to stay for a long period of time.
bad,"At my current job everything is almost the same routine. I work in the produce department and sometimes in the meat department. Each day  I stock the sales floor and break down trucks. Through the years I have learned how to work in a busy environment and communicate with people. Management there is okay, but they give you the impression as if you cannot approach them with a concern you have on the job. They also don't like to work with you on your schedule. The hardest part of my job is the weight I have to lift and some days are very slow due to less product. Most of my co workers in produce are not as productive as I am. I work very well with them but I have to pick up their slack most of the time. The most enjoyable part of my job is that it keeps me busy."
bad,"the constant baking of food makes you hungry, there are possibilities of gaining weight due to the constant markdowns of the goods."
bad,"its just routine work nothing ever changes so its easy to catch on on what to do every night. I have learned how to use a scrubber and a propane buffer and they sometimes put me in stocking so i picked up on stocking. The management it varies because it is night shift not many people around and the main manger is not around so some of the manager will abuse their position as manager but some of the mangers do they job like it needs to be done. The challenges of the job, honestly there are no challenges like I said everything is routine so not much gets in the way other than the machines if the ever have malfunction. The enjoyable part of the job is getting the buggies from outside, I am an outside person i like to be able to move around from place to place I'm not much on staying inside to much."
bad,"I perform customer service, helping customers"
bad,"I loved the hours, co-workers, benefits (gave awesome bonuses and rewards to employess, plus you get raises every year) but managers were not professional at all.  They always felt that their role as your manager exceeded your opinions as a subordinate.  Managers always let their own personal indifferences with subordinates outweigh professional ethics."
bad,"helping construction and customer"
bad,"A typical day for me consists of walking around the backroom and picking the merchandise that needs to be stocked. This includes lifting heavy items, climbing the ladder, and using power equipment. Then, it gets loaded onto a cart or a pallet so it can be pulled out to be stocked. Using the same techniques, I put the over stock away. The hardest part is climbing up/down the ladder with heavy items. I enjoy the fast-paced environment and always being busy. I don't see many co-workers due to being in the backroom, but we would crack jokes and play games at lunch time. There's many managers, and they have ups/downs like everyone else. However, some of them need to re-trained on how to talk/treat others with respect."
bad,"money was great, ppl were great, management was horrible. the job wasnt too bad there were days that it felt overwhelming and then there were days that just flow by"
bad,"Good learning experience. Although Wal-Mart did not offer full-time positions, the company gave me the opportunity to work and learn about the retail business. "
bad,"I was labeled a Sales Associate for the Garden Center upon my job landing with Wal-Mart, with previous management experience I was a floater within the whole store within a few months. I could breeze through the entire store and knew more than most manager's who had been with the company for years. I could downstack trucks, water/care for plants, stock almost any department, bin and pick from the telxon and much more. I eventually settled in T.L.E. which landed me out of the store floating and tied me in with some of the greatest co-workers in the store. The worst part about the place is that management often looks past even the best of the best employees to keep them paid to a minimum (but working hard) and bumps up the common guy which lights a fire under them."
bad,on a day to day work place always stayed busy and never a dull moment.
bad,"You have to be very self motivated to achieve a manager position in the market of Central, Southern, and Eastern Iowa Walmarts."
bad,"Walmart has great opportunity and benefits however there depending and do not really care about your wellbeing they treat employees like slaves ,they expect way to much and it's never good enough"
bad,Working for the company was cool. Met alot of people while working there from all walks of life. I would recommend working there but I feel as though it's easy to lose your job there.
bad,"Wal-mart has it good and bad "
bad,"Great with hiring SIUE students, provides a yearly increase with completion of online program. Friendly associates, quick paced workplace environment especially during holidays and weekends"
bad,Walmart is a great company to work for. it has good standards. But some stores need to get there management together and hold bad associates and department managers accountable.
bad,I loved Walmart as a company but I didn’t like how the management team at this particular Walmart did things like for example they never had anything ready in a timely manner how it suppose to be and when something’s wrong in the computer as in points wise they don’t fix it and if you call for personal to tell them you gone be a little late they don’t answer into you get there again this my experience from Lockport Illinois Walmart
bad,Overall Walmart was a great place to work but the time I work there their management wasn’t so well beside that it was a great place to work all the associates would help one another customer rarely complained an the pay to me was very good for my over night work
bad,Every store manager is different when it comes to for work/life balance. You have to sacrifice time with family and friends. Great benefits for full time associates.
bad,The job was easy. Just too many members of management breathing down my neck. Couldn't have a second of peace to try and get my job done. I always got split between the store. Still was pretty laid back after all.
bad,Walmart was a great place to start working and I believe that it was a great experience to have. I enjoyed the job for the most part and I think the Walmart gives great opportunities to grow if you can stand to work there for longer than a few months. Everything within Walmart is always changing and you have to always be prepared for that.
bad,I am certified to operate multiple lift and high reach trucks. My duties consist of 
bad,"Fast Paced "
bad,Typical Day: you walk into ciaos and get yelled at as soon as you arrive. I worked several departments and the disrespect towards employees was the same throughout. The pay and benefits were awesome and even had bonuses every three months.
bad,"When I first started I just felt like I was in competition with others. I mean every man for themselves but, how when every time Im done with a task I have to hurry up an go help someone else not complaining just stating facts."
bad,"I like to work more hours. Now i meed new employee. I thing.  I meed to work new place . l like walmart Is helpful ,  committee then one things i don' t like at this company. They don't give enough hours."
bad,"The customers an staff were all fun an nice.it was a fast paced environment we would get bonuses,catered lunches an birthday dinners with 1 of our favorite supervisor"
bad,it was always different everyday but always got everything done but there is always the issues of who to trust and not trust and sometimes managment didnt have a understanding when it came to personal matters but also never give chances to explain whats going on they also treated there workers with rudeness sometimes
bad,It was a good company to work for fair mangers was good great communication. Mangers always was there when needed work hand on hand with the employees.
bad,Fair to funDep manager- over boys men picking up after girls woman and counting outs for shoes. Dislikes setting mods after mods. Other than that working for Wal-Mart is fine
bad,I loved it. It was great working there and all the employees were great and just had an amazing experience there. I just had to stop working there because of family issues.
bad,I think walmart is a awesome job to have because the give lots of work hours and also they have good benefits. I also like to help customers out. The schedules are also very flexible.
bad,I learned to be more detaieled orientated. i worked in a fast paste enviorment. the maangemet was very helpful. I checked items leaving  the wharehouse ensue quality.
bad,"I enjoyed the benefits this company has. I was able to work eight hour shifts I enjoyed being a mechanic with them. I got to work with customers, and their vechiles."
bad,I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart until they started the new program last May. I was getting full-time hours and a pretty set schedule before then. Afterwards I was lucky to get 30 hours and the schedule was ridiculous.
bad,"For all the shortcomings, it is a solid place to work.  Managers will generally work through scheduling issues and pay is on time every time.  Not much bad to say."
bad,I learned a lot about giving optimal customer service at Walmart. My interspersonal skills also improved when I started working here. the management are very supportive and good at providing safe working environment for their hardworking staff. The most enjoyable part of this job is working with great people whom I shared common goals in helping the company reach its goal.
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of helping and greeting customers, making sure all items are stocked properly and in a good manner time."
bad,"The hardest experience I had when I worked at Walmart is"
bad,"If you enjoy working with people then this job is awesome, the pay is not all that great but the customers make the job exciting. Most of the co-workers were fun to work with but the job was very hard on your feet."
bad,I honestly did love working here . I started off as a cashier then one month later I had became a customer service manager and that's when everything went downhill because of the move to the old store to the new . It's a good opportunity and job for someone that is just starting off.
bad,"I worked with new and old cashiers and helped them get comfortable with the till and assisted them in whatever they needed made sure the front end was running smoothly, rearranged the schedules if need, alos helped out with customer service, used to open and close the cash registers. The hardest part was to make everyone , cashiers and customers, happy. The most enjoyable part was the fact that i worked with a lot of people and was there too help them throughout the day."
bad,"greet associates with smile,learned how to become a great leader,poor management, great co-workers, great learning experience and i enjoyed it for the most part"
bad,"The staff and management are unfair. At the time I was a Photo Technician the pay rate was awful, But the hours were outstanding. I wouldn't recommend working at the Cinnaminson Wal-mart"
bad,"Insuficiente porque el personal no hacia nada solamente se la pasaba platicando con los demas asociados de la empresa, y y yo era el de todo, recibe, acomoda la mercancia en pocas palabras abusaban de mi trabajo y de mi persona en cuestion laboral y mas la subjefa de piso de ventas, me traia como trompo mientras ella se la pasaban en oficina con celular en mano y ablando con su novio el promotor de la pepsi."
bad,Always busy.
bad,"A lot of drama through employees and managers. Just stay focus on you and the customers. Great perks and food."
bad,Es buena empresa si lo malo que te pagan más como cajera y a los de piso les pagan más que a nosotras las cajeras.Seria una empresa mejor si le pagarán más a la cajera que es factor importante con el cliente pues es con quién nos dan su punto de vista si hay algo nuevo o por no hay más mercancía y hasta nos llevamos sin sabores con el cliente aguantamos groserías gritos etc.
bad,"I learned to help others && work hard , managers were helpful &&& equal , the hardest part of the job was being myself because people always has a problem with that"
bad,Management at Walmart is good.  The job itself  was demanding. Some customers were trying. I found it stressful to make sure I rang up at least 800 items an hour.
bad,"Favoritism was shown a lot at also, there were one too many rude managers every shift I attended. The manager refused to work with my new schedule (new school semester started so I applied for new classes) so I had to leave the company."
bad,Ultimately working in this facility was about looking out for yourself and not working toward a common goal. Teamwork would have provided more successful results and higher morale.
bad,"A safety, clean  work place. greeting customers ,bagging theirs groceries and always smile and ask them if they have what they came for, .  making sure they are satisfied with store and there needs. conversate with the customer, ask hows their  day going and if theres anything else they need help with.  check out their items with a smile."
bad,My walmart experience was well worth.but also draining and frustrating..my co workers was the best any one could ask for..but every manager there should be fired
bad,"My typical day at work was serving the customer to the best of my knowledge, as well as cashing out the customer. I learn a lot about difference items, that the customers purchased. The management was great, I did not have any problem with my manager, I done what I was told and that what made my day go well. The co-worker was great because, I always kept my personal business to my self and that kept down confusion with the co - workers. There was no hardest part about this job, because I learn my job very well, the most enjoyable part of my job was serving and making my customer smile."
bad,"A typical day here would consist of downstacking trucks or stocking numerous products lines. Some hours working in the freezer and changing pricing,"
bad,"I learned how to work retail. Also learned to work as a team,how to cashier. was a very importente facter in my row as a working mom."
bad,If you want to work like a dog with no respect then this is the place to be. You are always busy and have no time to breathe. Some of the people are great and the others aren't.
bad,-typical day at work was fold lot of clothes putting up clothes and some time cashiering
bad,Good place to work depending on department  my department has a fast turn around time cause it’s brutally uncomfortable to work in. Constantly going from a cold freezer to a warm floor will leave you constantly sick
bad,Walmart was a fast pace working job. Managment was poor. They do not take care of their workers. And they didnt give me many hours. They cut my hours way back
bad,"Expect to be busy everyday you come in to work, i honestly loved it! i learn more about the wal mart business, bonding with coworkers,and having your everday customer come in into your line. Walmart is very cultured its a little bit of every culture in the work enviroment."
bad,I would of kept working in Walmart but I felt discriminated against because of my condition and felt I was being treated unfair while being pregnant. Also since I was working seasonal they never had the checks ready on time.
bad,El trabajo no demandaba muchos conocimientos tecnicos y es un ambiente de trabajo donde hay mucha mobilizacion en todos sentidos.
bad,Walmart is a very busy place and stays busy throughout the whole shift. They have good pay. The co-works are very helpful and they are very easy to get along with:
bad,"i work different stocking department, and help other worker to complete stocked. i'm very hard worker, and helpful to other customers if they need to."
bad,Learned valuable skills in retail and customer service. Made close friends with fellow associates. Management styles were very contrast and could cause substantial differences and work flow.
bad,"A typical day at work I come in get started right away on my job helping customer with a positive attitude a friendly smile an to unsure that my customer leaves with friendly attitude and the ability to come back. what have learn is to never make your customer leave unhappy always make your customer feel welcome because at the end of the day they pay our bills, my hardest part of the job is when my customer have to wait in line because we are so busy trying to help everyone but together we made it happen. My most enjoyable time is when I see my customer leaving happy and with everything they came for we had in stock."
bad,"Working in the IR team - awesome more."
bad,I enjoyed working here because i got the chance to help others in need. as well as i got to interact with alot of people
bad,"The people were very friendly and welcoming, the management was not so good. best part of the job was being independant."
bad,"I need works, i hope than you guys can give me opportunity to show how i can do my best for the company."
bad,"Excelente empresa, se puede hacer carrera, buen ambiente laboral."
bad,"Buena prestación "
bad,"I would have loved to stay here.,I was only part-time but it was very strenuous on your body, The pay was wonderful and the company itself was very considerate. But they pushed a person way to hard beyond the safety line."
bad,This is a good job. We had a lot of things to keep us busy. The training was extentive but we had to have it. I enjoyed it very much. The only negative thing was being on your feet for the whole shift.
bad,"Fast paste environment , very busy place , lots of customers , cashiers, pharmacy, tire and lube & electronics .. a lot of standing and moving around over all it's alright"
bad,I love it. It rewarding to help customers whenever they need's assisting. I love how wal mart have values such as open door policy in case we associates have any concerns.
bad,Foi de muita importância em minha vida pois aprendi muito com pessoas eram engajados e sempre era avaliada e minhas avaliações sempre estive dentro das expectativas na empresa fui promovida 3 vezes quero guarda tudo de positivo e bom quanto foi durante 4 anos que trabalhei la
bad,Great place to enter act with new people and on the diffrent holidays.People would always come in and dress up and u laugh and enjoy the public
bad,"Walmart is a very big private conglomerate. The training in Walmart is of no equal. The team work and spirit is great. Leadership by example is routinely being demonstrated by all."
bad,the job was a decent place but the supervisors was not so great and and i feel like i was been over worked
bad,"Working at Walmart was a great experience for me. Walmart helped how to properly deal with customers. Walmart could get a lil hectic, especially around the holidays but it made the time go by faster and also taught not to get over whelmed."
bad,"I enjoyed as being a cashier at Walmart and greeting my customers was very excellent. Going to work to prepare my self for a good day at work. Good attendence,  grateful attitude everyday and also stayed prepared at work."
bad,Good environment to work I will like to learn more about this company so i can grow.  Don't only want to be cashier  want to work  harder so i can keep growing
bad,I just love working at Walmart is a good place to work at three in the peoples people that understand you people I like to talk to you people I get the job done everyone there is a very good person
bad,"Walmart is definitely a good place to work i love it,it gave me a chance to excell and work freely to help my fellow employees and customers. If i had the opportunity to work there again i would, because Walmart gave me a chance when noone didn't."
bad,Clean up breakroom and bathroom empty trash and safety sweep through the store at Walmart my first hire there I unloaded truck until I got move to maintenance .
bad,The hardest part about Walmart was that they wanted you to work in one area and then another manager would come and try to take you to work in another area before you get done at the area your already at.
bad,"Looking to improve in life and take on a hire position and career, great with costumers , completes any assigned task and will help other departments when needed."
bad,I'm goal oriented and a hard worker with great people skills.  I'm dependable and punctual. I can multi-task in doing vigorous jobs while still having a positive attitude. I have a go getter attitude and I feel that I could bring the company great aspects.
bad,"mis horario era de 7:00am a 3:00pm"
bad,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was very interesting you had to be prepared for anything at anytime of the day due to the customer's and their different personalities some days I works graciously answering the phone, stocking merchandise, zoning my work area, and attending to customer needs. And some days I have to dodge can goods or some other item because someone is apparently very upset but other than that working their was a joy I have nothing but respect for this company, management was great everyone loved doing their jobs and making sure their employees always came first, they were very passionate when it came to resolving problems. The hardest part about this job was working the backroom warehouse sometimes on delivery day but I made it out alive. Wal-Mart is a very cool place to work you just need speed, patience, good work ethic and you will do just fine."
good,"It was one of my worst experiences. They had no sense of scheduling, fairness, management or care about their employees. The employees are underpaid, under compensated, over worked and under appreciated."
good,good pay good people just had to work to many hours and was moved around alot to differant stores all the time this made it hard to have a home life .....
good,"Although the employees are nice the managers are very uptight and don't really care about the workers safety , I am a hard worker and I need more pay for the amount of work I am doing"
good,"Don’t feel like was getting paid enough for the work we had to do. Bad communication with supervisors "
good,You will work odd hours that will be different daily. You will work when they need a spot filled. Less hours to keep from paying insurance. It is not the company I worked for 20 years ago.
good,"Bad expressions, immature manager, rude employees. Allot of people drank on the job and if you didn't like your schedule the manager would get upset and act childishly."
good,Was a great place when i worked there. From shopping at the store there always empty of products and boxes and stockers every where makes. It hard to shop most of there stockers. Are rude look very disappointed.
good,No set schedule I don’t give you time off with your family is sick Unprofessional bad management Cut your shift and hours take you off the schedule and not tell you
good,"workers had no respect for others, management was very rude and didnt train me just gave me something to until my shift was over. i worked through a temp agency, they really dont treat the people equally"
good,Pro themselves no team work who do you trust no job security Walmart government. Lot of good process and good associates but no support from managers when time away
good,U want good money you have to be there everyday and miss out on your family. Company doesnt care about their employees too much they just need you to keep their store running
good,Some days work was fast paced. Unload two big trucks sometimes in one day on to pallets so we could take the freight out the sales floor and stock it.
good,All i will say is i will never go back. Co workers are rude and have bad attitudes. Makes it a negative environment. Everyone i met was mean and crabby and negative except 2 people.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work. The environment is great and all the people are great. I would love to still work there, but I need something that makes more money to support my life and family."
good,"I have been with the company for about 3 years, I can say that management is the main source of problems, without a great management team problems will continue...."
good,Basically if you were new they treated you like dirt. Any chance they get to try and bully you they will take that opportunity. They have favors in the whole place and it's just a pool of hate if you aren't in any of the cliques associated.
good,The management went down hill due to Orginal GM retirement and they can’t seem to hold there people nor get there policy’s straight they had people that have been there 20 plus years walk out due to the lack of service they are providing to the employees
good,"After the 6 month mark of working at walmart the job seemed well. A few new managers & then a few new corporate office enforcements; then things went south. New hiree's were being letgo, the work demand was larger than there were employee's in the store. Overtime wasnt being paid, managers disappeared off the floor and werent avle to be located for help or customer service. Overall the experience wasnt worth the mental/emotional damage that it has caused. Your workplace shouldn't cause people to think the only way of getting a vacation is if you die. No workplace should make you have suicidal thoughts."
good,They  did not add me to the schedule because I could not work the set schedule they had given me even after I told them I couldn't work those hours due to my second job. They told me as long as it wasn't a competitor that they could work with my hours and they did not do what they said they would do.
good,"it is Walmart, low pay, forced working through lunches and breaks with no pay. This is just filler because indeed require your review to contain 150 Characters."
good,The best part of working for Wal-Mart was meeting new people daily and watching children that you know grow. All customers are not friendly or talkative but they are who keep those jobs going. Management has a stressful job and some take it out on the employees but what can you expect when the Store Manager only have a selective few that he deal with.
good,In the pharmacy you get very close with the coworkers. That’s the best part. You become like a family. Most of the time you are very short staffed so you have to work very hard for very little money.
good,Walmart is not a company to work for if you value a clean descent store. They do not like following procedure and are not above doing things the wrong way just to get them done.
good,"It's a decent place to work if you aren't a manager or supervisor. However, the current management team lacks communication, empathy. and respect for the individual. They try to achieve a visual of teamwork and validation but it;s highly lacking."
good,It’s pays the bills.. and it’s an okay place to work at.. sometimes it’s busy sometimes it’s not I’m just happy to say I had a job at that age.. I was young
good,This was none other than just a job. I hated working here and over all management was poor. They weren't very understanding as to anything going on outside of the store.
good,"After working for Walmart for so long. I realized I was only staying there for my customers and I was nervous about venturing out of the retail world I had started in. I would came in and finish 3rd shifts stocking freight and cleaning up before I started mine every single day. Some days I would even get to my own. It started to get harder to even be excited about the job after so long but I put a smile on my face anyways for my customers. I always tired to have my department clean, shop friendly, seasoned properly and of course sales ready. But when you clean up after people every day and are constantly informing the management team and then they get upset at you for bringing the issue up and or you aren't able to complete certain things when they want.. That pushes people away even quicker because they don't care to even help."
good,"Our Walmart never has lanes open when they need them. During the first of the month, the evenings will only have 2 open registers if you're lucky. They don't carry a lot of the things that other Walmart stores do and the buggy escalator is always broken. It was good for a first job being a teenager but would not recommend if you're older. They do not care about their employees there, you are just a number."
good,Management is inconsistent. A culture of hostility and resentment exists. The pay is not good and raises are overlooked and not given because cost of living increases were given. That has created a feeling of not being appreciated as employees. Management illegally keeps hourly associates after their shifts are over without their consent. The list goes on but the point has been shown.
good,Went from working 35 hours a week to only 8.  Very discriminating. Rude management. Managers don’t care about their associates. Doesn’t accept DOCTORS notes stating for you to be excused from work. No exceptions
good,"Walmart wage was okay but really they didn't train you very well at all, management was just a nightmare, when they were needed you had to call them 3 to 4 times before they would show up and the they almost always sassed the customer ."
good,Too stressful and not enough pay. Customers are completely rude and not understanding of lack of help or what is actually in stock. Most enjoyable part of job is dealing with other like minded individuals who are interested in the same things you are.
good,"The location I worked at was poorly managed, I learned more responsibilty. Overall I would not recommend this job to anyone. The hardest part of the job was dealing with everyday headache because of poor management. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay."
good,Walmart was the company at one time. But however they have lost their way. Its about what high up wants at all cost of employees. Home office sets the schedules where it use to be flexible. Job roles were like rotating doors ever changing Walmart was trying to run lean to get fat.
good,If you are someone who likes to mouth off then you do not want to work here. They will fire you for trying to stand up for yourself or anyone else for that matter. They will do anything to get you out.
good,"I did not like working here, i got bad hours and very bad role models and management wasn't good. nothing was taken care of and was told to stop asking for help and not to ask too many questions when i was new."
good,i struggled with hours and flexibility work was OK but not good enough to deal with daily life or home sett family life  lunches and breaks wasnt kept up like they should have been
good,"A typical day a walmart i was schedule and assigned a register most of the time I would work midday so, for the most around two to nine is  our most busy time throughout the day especially on sunday and saturdays so, as far a fast paced the front end will always be the the most busy due to customers checking in and out and we are the most important we have to make the customer feel at ease while allowing them to channel positive vibes and good spirits leaving the customer a feeling upbeat and fully satified with the experience before leaving the store. I learned alot working for walmart  I learned how to obtain self control, how to appeal and uplift different types of persons such as there interacting with different personailties without offerending anyone. The hardest part of my job was when it was time to get off the clock and I was a fast cashier and I always use to challege myself on how fast I could ring someone up will at the end of the shift every one use to some how come to my line and i would try to accommdate everone without turning anyone down..... I moral of the story its a bit challeging for me to say no. I most enjoyed serving my customers especially the regulars."
good,Walmart use to be a great placw for both customers and associates but within just a few years it has turned into a poor place for both customers and associates
good,"everyone was back biting there and did not care. no room for advancement there, unless you sucked up to manager. I would not recommend this job to anyone."
good,"A typical day at Walmart was being on time, doing your work, do not ask for an upgrade in a new position. "
good,I have worked at two different Walmart and the first Walmart I worked at I had a wonderful experience Management was nice and always worked with you. the second one the one I am at right now is horrible and they never give you lunches or your two 15 they also never work with your seclude or care about your home life or health. also doctor excuses are not accepted.
good,It’s really up to you on how you feel about this place. If you like money it’s a good place to work if you can deal with a lot of stress and drama at certain locations
good,"I just didn't like working there mainly due to the mismanagement and how the store was operated. I enjoyed helping people and the managers loved me and my work. But, I just didn't enjoy how the company ran."
good,A typical day for me at Walmart starts with a meeting where they tell us how many trucks we have and how much fright is on each truck and let us know their expectations and goal plan. I do the same thing daily so nothing new to learn on this shift. Managers need to be on the same page with rules and regulations and hold associates accountable for what they do and don't do and not make it a group problem. There is no hard part and I love the work never a dull moment.
good,"In the area I worked in it was always hectic and the hardest part of the job was dealing with the constant irate customers. If they didnt like what they were told, they would complain to the managers. It was like they came in  in a bad mood and took it out on us.  The most enjoyable part was the few people I worked with on a daily basis. They made it a little more bearable."
good,unless you suck up to management there is no way to get a better position or the time off that you need. its a very friend place they value friends more then they value hard work
good,I worked for Walmart twice. I ended as a CSM (Customer Service Manager) the first time there. As a cashier the second. I think my only issue with working there was management and the location in all honesty. I do not feel that other locations would act the same way this specific location did.
good,"know who you're always speaking to, do not get into any altercations there, everyone is about drama. It is always based on he said she said of stuff.."
good,This place was a very fast paced environment. Some very fun coworkers and customers. Opportunities to move up if you work very hard. Not too bad of a place to work for.
good,Wal-Mart doesn't care about their employees and there personal life.They believe they can work you full time hours and not give you the proper benefits.they will limit your call in days even when ill and don't care. They will treat you like slaves and then they will not allow overtime. It's inexcusable to have overtime even when asked to stay and help.
good,"The work was horrible, the management was horrible, the hours were horrible. the only thing that wasnt bad while working at walmart, was the free water provided during the summer."
good,"Walmart makes an new employee feel at home and you are put to work and givin benefits even if you are an veteran , other co workers are there when you need help"
good,"They don’t treat their employees the way they should. The managers there, there’s a select few that will do right by you. I wouldn’t recommend working at the El Dorado Wal-Mart."
good,"Very slow paced behind on schedule"
good,La paga de tiempo por tiempo es un problema ya que muchas veces noo se ve reflegado ese pago de tiempo
good,Go in don’t talk to nobody get your work done and go home everybody think they are your boss they all think they know everything when they really don’t.
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart and helping the customers. The management at store 3520 all need to be retrained and evaluated for their lack of customer service and professionalism.
good,"It's okay if you need a job but not the best place to work. It's a luck of the draw when it comes to management, you can get a great one or one who doesn't know what they're doing. May the odds be ever in your favor."
good,I think the 2nd shift has the hardest shift in the store. They do everything and don't get no respect. So I say only work here if you really need money because they will work you.
good,"highly stressful with low chance of advancement, i worked there for several months with the promise of being bumped up to department manager and it still has not happened."
good,"Gave me satisfaction knowing I was there help the Public on any giving matter, weather small or large. Public seeked me for advice when it came to helping them with any merchandise in the Garden Center. I felt I was appreciated by them."
good,Walmart has a lot of issues. Including number one issue is respect for their employees. Management used to wonderful. Then after receiving tax cuts they fired anyone who didn’t agree with how the store was being ran. They have a high turnover in this particular store due to the fact management is verbally abusive. The new store manager refuses to speak to store associates which is an issue with company policy about chain of command.
good,E uma empresa a aparentemente boa mais a administração e péssima.
good,place is crazy! if you dont mind waking up going to work then coming home to go bed you would like it. the pay wasn't bad. $9 an hour when i worked there.
good,Wouldn’t recommend trying to make a career out of it. They say it’s easy to move up in the company but it’s not. Good hours most of the time. If it is reasonable they will work with you on your schedule.
good,The bakery would have been a better place to work if coworkers were not constantly fighting with one another.  There was almost no help from management when conflict arose.
good,Easy job with many managers and low pay.  Not much room for advancement unless you've been there for a long time.  No matter what you do its easy to be told to do two different things by many bosses and be wrong no matter what.
good,company with high standards for employees however no salary standards or pay increase the job and treatment is not worth the hourly wage i was provided and there was no room for advancement.
good,I often wonder if the people at the top knew how their employees were being treated. I loved my customers.  That was the best part about the job. Customers that come into the store are great.
good,"My manager would  give me , way too much work. i was expected to get 5  pallets of pet food, toys, litter, etc, to be  done in 8 hours by myself. My manger would  constantly put my  work performance down. I didn't  get properly trained. i was an overnight  stocker in Avon."
good,"I enjoyed communicating with customers and provide a professional atmosphere to the employer.  Although, I did not work enough hours to survive and therefor, I had to relocate."
good,"fast paced, dirty, dusty and unorganized place to try and put away merchandise in it's appropiate place. Management roles changed 4 or 5 times in my time there. production quota is very hard and difficult to meet because of the broken and damaged merchandise to try and work around."
good,"My whole family works are Walmart in Different departments.  Didn't help me at all that they work there also.  no hours, lousy management, nothing secure, even having a disability, no help."
good,The CSMs were rude and often forgot to give employees their breaks they would talk down to the cashiers and when they had to run a register they didnt do it properly but no one would take the cashiers word over theirs. the hours/shifts were very inconsistent. it was highly stressful
good,Long hours and low pay. The employees is helpful but some of the managers was unfair to the employees. Walmart have great opportunity for everyone they just need to become organized.
good,"Walmart is not the job that I would suggest for anyone! They pride themselves on being culturally tolerant, but bully people of another race. The pay is a joke!"
good,"a typical day at work was fast and stressful, customers are rude and inpatient. All you have to do is look ahead and just serve one at a time dont let the line stress you out"
good,seems to never be organized or care about employees management seems to not really do much and pay is good but moving up is not what you would want to and hard to do over working here only would go back cause of the pay but everything else drama unfair treatment terrible place to work at times would not recommend to work here unless you need money but get ready for everything that comes behind the pay
good,This was a stressful environment to work in. Management wasn’t the best and made everything stressful. Walmart can be a good career opportunity for many.
good,"The management team had favorites. They would promise you a position higher up and then knock you down. They were not understanding when it came to personal emergency situations. For example in their rule book we are allowed to have cells phones out at the registers as long as you informed your CSM at the time in case of Emergency. I did that, and I still got in trouble. They wouldn't allow me to do my job which was to assist customers. they withheld me from my break and lunch. The management team were very rude, inconsiderate and degrading. So I quit."
good,"On nights that we had two people in our department and over 30 hours of work, I was still expected to finish. On days where we had less than 7 hours work and 3 people in our department, we were still rushed. I did not enjoy working for those kind of people."
good,A empresa muito boa de trabalha .eu gostei de trabalha nesta empresa
good,"Working at the particular Walmart some but not all managers would not care or work with you. Hours were fairly consistent, expectations and job requirement were above standard."
good,"Ok to work. Low, very low pay. I had a lot of days off. The discounts was ok. The discount help me out. The place is ok, but not a place I could see myself retiring from."
good,Low wage very stressful once was a good job but becomes too much for not enough money................. hopefully they change that one day and make it alor
good,"Was a very stressful place to work for, poor management, poor communication between management and employees. Employees are treated with no respect by customers and management."
good,The hours expected were uncleared throughout employment.  Consideration for advancement was an impossible standard without guidance on expectations slim to none.
good,If you dont mind working a different shift everyday or dealing with the management go for it. If you work 5 to 5 and a half hours you get a 15 minutes
good,"Everyone is pretty much doing their own thing, no career advancement. No one really knows whats going on. Out of maybe 20 different managers only the actual store manager and the head of HR know what they are doing."
good,in the start you received the hours you were expecting then gradually received less. i worked in one department however i did more then my share and never got payed or promoted for all the work i did
good,"very unstable schedules, rare bonuses, don't like to cooperate with religious beliefs, managers don't respect employees unless corperate is there, otherwise they dont even speak to you"
good,Walmart is an ok place to work depending on where you work and your managers. Most of the time they play favorites the biggest brown nosers get the promotions and the good workers get dumped on. I'd tell my trainees that working at Walmart was a lot like being back at high school.
good,I work at a Walmart where the managers get away with everything and everyone under the management is treated as unworthy. I have  worked there for almost 5 years and some days i wonder why am i still here. The store manager do not care as long as they have that big bonus check in there pocket at the end of the year.
good,Sit down take calls up to 3 hours till first break and so on. So boring.Not much advancement. Lots of favoritism and no fun in the call center. Highly upset with the feeling in here.
good,Fast paced liked the work. Learned a lot from this place. Inventory is fun. Loved the customers. Understaffed all the time! They expect one person to do a five person job.
good,"Walmart was a very complicated and confusing place to work based on the environment and atmosphere. Management were rude and did not train there employees properly, most employees where either late or calling out which cause great confusing and hard work for all other employees."
good,"When I first started working for the company it was nice... Management was good, I was happy, I loved my job and the ppl I worked with... But as time went on things just started getting worse... They took away all incentive to want to come to work and do your best."
good,it is a good job for someone who doesn't have a life or who is looking to for something part time. If you are just looking for something until something better comes along
good,Horrible management do not like to help tells u your best isn't good enough and just a outright horrible place to work.  Do not work there if u can help it
good,"Upper management didn't really care about their employees, didn't treat them with respect.  Although there were a few shift managers that were good managers, that did care & did respect the employees"
good,Walmart in orange park fl sucks. I will never recommend anyone to work there and I wont even do my shopping there. horrible people. horrible customer service. horrible bosses. horrible!!
good,I really didn't enjoy this job. I really didn't learn that much from this job. They didn't pay that good and did not treat their workers fair either. The job was horrible.
good,"The store that I work at they want you to bring everything from the top to the bottom, and you only have a certain amount of time to complete the task. It's hard to complete the assigned task when management is always stopping you because they want you to do something else, customers keep asking you where a item is at, and you don't have a lot of coworkers to help you to complete the task. You also start out as a part-time person. That's good for somebody that is in highschool or college, but for the older generation it should be full-time."
good,The management team were mostly women very unprofessional didn't really know how to be managers and they did very spiteful stuff if you didn't do the work the way they wanted it to be. The pay was good. Overall it was an ok job I would go back though.
good,A day at work for me was ok only because I got to work by myself. The work environment was very immature. Management was more interested in gossiping than keeping track of the store.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. It was always busy so time flew by very fast. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday and slowly becoming a friendly face to them.
good,I worked at several stores and it honestly depends on the store and manager. I only had one good experience as an employee there and that was when I worked at Pelham rd
good,its ok to work here.not many raises. co-workers are friendly. there are no benefits really if you are part time. i didnt like all the late hours and the fact you had to be timed as you put things away. they expect you to work harder with less people.
good,It was not a bad place to work for but the pay was terrible and management picks favorites. I got a second job full time and they would not change my availability  and kept scheduling me for days i could not work there. I loved the customers and the job itself wasnt hard.
good,a typical day at work in a Walmart neighborhood market is very challenging. this market is very high volume. Is centrally located which makes it very popular with everyone in town.
good,no benefits if you work 40 I have two children and they would not over me no benefits the hours they cut my hours so low I had to look fo9r another job and found another job with great benefits. the one I work was in Columbus Ga airport thru way the management is very horrible and does not care about no one but them selves.
good,"I was fired for stealing GARBAGE. I have autism, and I had no idea that keeping something we were throwing away was considered stealing. But I was supposed to have known better. When I explained I didn't, they accused me of lying, and should be grateful they didn't call the police on me. They noticed there was an ""increase in claims"" since I started working. This was because I was one of the only people who ever did claims. I found boxes and boxes of candies and food on the registers that was months past the expiration date."
good,"Most workers just walk around, or huddle together talking."
good,Having to pull teeth just to be able to have my medical equipment with me at work. I cannot work on days that my disability flairs up and that causes more accidents than what is necessary.
good,"Okay place to work even if you cross train in other areas for job security dont expect to advance your career. Dont get stuck as a cashier the best departments to work is produce, and GM side."
good,"i had a nice manager and all, and even store manager. But when push came to shove they really would hold the people that needed to be accountable and really let things fall onto me. That really was the hard and the fact that even though i am a manager and had all those responsibility to do in the hba side, I was never given anyone so i had to do everything while getting everything done."
good,fun place to work and many fun people to work with but constantly pushed to work harder and faster than at most places. tons of new hires too
good,It is my firm opinion that management is the key component and to a store working smoothly and their customers being both satisfied. and happy.  Unfortunately Walmart as big as they become they're paying less and less attention to management and to the way they convey the respect and the sense of team leadership they really lacking in those areas.
good,"This job is the most dysfunctional job I have ever had. The managers are not organized, its a lot of distrust with worker and manager. Job security there is none."
good,its the worst place to work i enjoyed working here but it gives no time for yourself there is alot of favoritism you dont have a set schedule they throw you all over the place once i had to work the front desk self check out and a regular check out line while making sure  nobody is getting away with stuff tht wasnt paid for
good,"Worked for a year , one of their best associates. Was used all around store but when I tried to move up for advancement I was always told the position wasn't open but they were still interviewing associates."
good,Loved my customers but management stunknever enough training. Never enough coverage. Loved when i ran layaway for 3 years. Never get help when asking for it.they set u up for failer
good,Management nitpicks at nearly everything you do. When you're hardworking they tend to not leave you alone at all. Lunch is the most enjoyable part of the day. Gets you away from all the work and laziness from other coworkers
good,To much is put on associates with the lack of tools and kniwledge to perform job in timely manner. Associates are expected to complete to many tasks in an 8 hour shift which is nearly impossible and is then frowned upon by management.
good,I have worked in the shoe department in walmart super center organizing shoes restocking items taking items that are not being ordered anymore and replace with new items that are brought in cleaning the floor placing the shoes in right order and right shelfs..
good,Good place for lowest prices but employees are not treated well. Compensation and hours are horrible. Especially during the holidays. Schedules are changed frequently without advanced notice.
good,"I feel like at Walmart no matter how much you do you are never appreciated. They over work you for the most minimum pay, not really a chance to forward your career here"
good,"Great pay but poor communication, The open door is a great thing for the company but the sun down communication is very poor and not impressed with how they treat the questions aked"
good,No holiday pay no overtime no working with employees if they need family time. Just  a paycheck. Mangment  rude. Customers rude.
good,the job it self was fine but management sucked they do not care about the employee at alli had a set time frame to work because i had 2 little kids and was on bus they had me coming to work at times i did not have child care or a ride
good,"I liked my job I just didn't like the hours. The job wasn't full time and the hours were so different from week to week."
good,"A typical day included stocking the shelves with more than they would hold, and having so much product to throw that the tasks assigned (they came with approx. time to complete) would have 12-24 hour times to complete. You couldn't leave until the everyone was done with their tasks, no matter which department you worked in. The only thing I learned was how to hate working with people that wouldn't do their work on time because they knew someone else would come do it for them."
good,"Managers were always nagging about everything,didn't want to help new employers when asked like as if we knew everything"
good,"the manager was not organized, always changed schedules, took money out of the cash register and would overwork us promising higher pay but never happened"
good,Some of the managers where ok but others were rude and couldn't care less how you are feeling or if something has happened to kid(s).
good,"Between constantly changing mangers, and constantly changing guidlines, its hard to know what you're being yelled at for. when one thing changes from day to day, and you're expected to somehow know, like you've plugged yourself in at night and all the updates where dowloaded into your brain, its hard to say what you're doing right or wrong."
good,Management likes to ask you stay after you should clock out to do extra work and then the next they tell you they need you to cut that time you stayed after clock out time.
good,I did not like working here it was very unorganized and the management were never on top of things I love structure and this job did not have that at all it was not the place for me.
good,"working freight every day and getting everything stock to the floor, assisting customers and answering the phone. Planning out my day and what needs to get done and getting everything done on time. I learned how hard and stressful it is to be a manager but also learned how proud I am of myself. The hardest part of my job is trying to find time to get everything done on time on top of helping customers especially with the Christmas season. The most enjoyable part is working with my associates and feeling a sense of pride i take in my department"
good,Walmart is not the place to work if you have a family or are a single parent.  They act as if they are willing to work with you but as soon as your hired that goes right out the window.
good,"Best part of the job was co - workers. The co - workers were amazing. Management, well you never seen them around. Hardest part was trying to get questions answered. Typical day was making sure your section looked halfway decent."
good,"I started working at Walmart when Sam Walton was still alive and the company was outstanding, It was ""The"" place to work. When Sam died things changed and not everything was for the good. For some reason it seemed the biggest change was on the management level. I don't know if the new corporate was putting extra pressures on the managers but it seemed like management got mean. They didn't care anymore that you had a family and would rather fire you if you had to leave for a family issue then to keep you on and find out what was wrong. Many associates have been fired for silly reasons all because they were full time associates and they had all the benefits. As the company has continued to grow they have cared less and less about their employees."
good,Lots of red tape in just doing the day to day. management is very non contestant. Lots of people from all over so the things you learn is from all walks of life.
good,"My review of working for Walmart. It was a good job for the most part. But they DO NOT treat their Employees fairly by any means. "
good,"I enjoyed working with the public, but my patience and mental health was definitely tried when it came to certain customers. A lot of the managers were ""swayed"" when it came to certain (Female) employees. Passive aggressive inappropriate behavior was a major problem. Chances of advancement are highly based on your area of work."
good,its a steady paycheck certainly not a career if your still looking for a job this is some where that's always hiring but there is a reason for that
good,"Great place for high school students and adults looking for an entry level job. Minimum wage compensation, and typical retail hours. $1 extra pay for work on Sundays."
good,hated working for Walmart when I was working there I was also in school they would schedule me 30 minutes after my classes ended and I would have to stay until 11 sometimes 12 pm after I told them I could only work until about 9 because I had to be up for college classes at 7 am but they did not care the management was awful they didn't care about what was going on

Responds to spills and accidents as they occur following Company"
good,"stockier i stocked frozen and dairy and also worked in other departments when they needed me in other departments and never got a thank you for it...i also cleaned,worked on a cashier and stocked"
good,Cashier is a easy  job Wal-Mart stay busy they however do not have policy in order its whatever one says. Management its involved  and does not stay on the same page.
good,"Cashiering is enjoyable because I love working with the public but I am not using my 20 plus years experience in Secretarial, Administration and Human Resources."
good,I would never work at the Wal Mart in Moncks Corner ever. Someone always has a frown on their face. People don't do their work. They do not clean after theirselves also.
good,"Working at walmart was ok. I liked the enviorment, in the sense of the customers and my other fellow associates.The work wasnt too difficult but worth more pay."
good,I worked at Walmart in Wi and it was much better managed.  The one here in Jefferson City TN was badly management and there were a lot of unhappy people.  No one cared about keeping the cusotmer's happy at all.  The register were never open.
good,the first couple of years were ok but learned very quickly there isnt any room for growth. Jobs come open within store they interview who they choose and not who's more qualified. This is a terrible company to work for.
good,"fun working job that requires people skills, great co workers plus management"
good,"not enough workers during needed hours scheduled, constantly cutting hours, no stable management team.  Will work to the point of exhaustion with no raises, bonuses, or benefits"
good,I worked in clothes and backup cashier left job for more hours and better pay
good,I searched and loaded items to go out to the floor so they can be stocked. Also put back everything that was unable to be stocked while keeping my work area clean and organized.
good,Wal-Mart has rail-road me enough that to the point after 7 years of no advancement that I am beginning my search for an employer that would like to use my talents and skills to the ability that is good for the both of us.
good,Logistics great people. Good benefits. Weekend work. Great pay.
good,"short breaks or no breaks standing on card board for hours, not enough hours,"
good,Walmart is the typical minimum wage job. the supervisors are okay and mostly uptight. Lastly the customers are average.
good,they did not want to work with my schedule while trying to go to school then they had a very disorganized front end with the cashiers/cart pushers. and they denied me my raise even though i volunteered in other departments besides doing extra work in my own.
good,"This job has become to stressful. I have learned working with good co-workers seems to be better than making good money."
good,"working is good not much hard work ,stocking. I've learn how to use electric pallet jack and lift.. Management is not up to par need to work on people and leadership skills no EOE. Hardest part of my job at wal mart was to do another person job. Most important  was jus helping others being able to say I was emeployed with wal-mart . Oh yea RULES are subject to change without notice"
good,"I was very disappointed that in order to get a raise I had to wait for other people who were hired before me to receive theirs. I was a customer service manager who made less than my cashiers and was never allowed to make full time pay. I hated the fact we never even came close to overtime I was a manager but was making less than 800 a month.The people I worked with were wonderful but I saw people getting fired for being sick, and worse part was, they were sick because of the problems caused by Walmart itself."
good,"A typical day at work usually involves freight, a mixture of different kinds of customers, and hard work. I learned nearly the entire store on my own, management is not cooperative and favoritism is extreme at my location. My coworkers are awesome, although there is frequent drama throughout the store, you have to learn to clock in, exceed at your job, and go home. The hardest part of the job would be recognition and promotions. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with and meeting the customers."
good,The coworkers are great. Not too busy on weekdays. Hardest part of the job is finding something to do when you don't have customers in the store
good,"I really enjoyed the job at first but after I worked there it seemed that because I was the newbie I was always asked to work weekends and of course I did because I needed the extra hours and money, but at the time both of my children were really young and I worked second so it seemed like I never got to see them. I finally got a weekend off only after asking for one. Management was very unfair and treated you like you did not matter."
good,fast paced atmosphere but fun its all about the people you work with if they have a bad attitude or the vibe is bad it puts other people in a bad mood there for production declines
good,"nothing real challenging just a job, management change job spec ever time the shift  manager changed, most of the employees quit after only a few weeks ,short handed on every shift and expected to perform as if fully stafted, most enjoyable when really busy"
good,It was a fast pace moving job it kept you busy and the my co-workers where good people to work with and that made the working experience more enjoyable.
good,"Walmart rally before starting work, the muscle stretch and quick update of truck status. This was a short temporary position as Walmart Market Night Crew."
good,"New employees sit through days of orientation, then are given less than a day of cash register training. Frequently understaffed throughout the entire store. "
good,"very busy day at work"
good,"At  Walmart, I enjoyed learning how to bake various types of breads, rolls, buns and pastry items. I learn something about working with industrial baking ovens and industrial dishwashers. I worked with a price labeling product machine. I worked with a bread slicing machine and I learned how to clean a dishwasher the proper way. I learned how to put wording on a cake and to decorate cakes and giant cookies. Overall, I had a great experience working for Walmart."
good,"I worked for them and all I got was getting stuck doing a job when I was to leave at 10pm was stuck until 11pm, so one night after paging a CSM 6 times without a response I walked off the area and went home."
good,I love working in a team environment.only if it is a stable job. not temporary cannot live on temporary work does not support my family in need of work.
good,good starter job but defiantly not a keeper the best part was free cake fridays
good,Wal-Mart was a good place to work at in the TLE we did a lot at of different things so it wasn't always the same.The co workers we ok and some just were not good at all but i dealt with it and worked. The management we just not good ones at all the didn't care what was going on back in TLE when i worked there.
good,"The company does not give set schedules for new cashiers. Also, they do not train the new employees very well at all.  I truly enjoyed interacting and helping the customers and learning new responsibilities within the organization."
good,I can't speak for every WalMart but the one in Rockwall is terrible and very unprofessional. The overnight managers are terribly overworked which leads to a hostile work environment. Associates aren't allowed to go to lunch at the given time (2 am) even if they've worked over the 6 hour requirement & the store manager should be fired because she doesn't do anything at all.
good,"I loved it at first. But about the third month being there, and being the youngest in the bakery, i was then bullied. I went to the managers to see what I could do to get it to stop, but they didn't bother trying to fix the situation."
good,Walmart was a job it was a paycheck they didn't have benefits if u worked longer than five hours they wrote u up the hardest part was to make sure u didn't work over five hours the most enjoyable part was when I got paid so I can pay bills
good,"they dont have it organized and they dont keep anyone pass 60 days so it makes it hard to do a great job,they need to take temp to hire out and keep the ones they hire."
good,"served customers"
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart includes flitting around working on whatever project the manager closest to you has thought up in his/her whimsical mind while the customers you should be helping grow angrier at your absence from the department in which you are supposed to be.  The best way to describe management at Wal-Mart is ""the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing"".  While one member of management expects one thing of you, another expects something different.  I have learned the importance of networking at Wal-Mart: a valuable lesson that is unfortunate but true as it is not your ability, work ethic, experience, or education that will launch your career to new heights at Wal-Mart, but simply with whom your may or may not be friends.  The hardest part of working at Wal-Mart is stomaching the revolting amount of disrespect that is shoveled upon one's shoulders as a mere Sales Associate.  The most enjoyable part of working at Wal-Mart is finding friendship in one's co-workers, who share the same depressing work environment."
good,"it sucked"
good,Started off employment at Wal-mart as a maintenance associate then moved my position due to my physical capabilities and now work as an unloader/stocker.
good,"-	Consistently provided friendly guest service and heartfelt hospitality. "
good,I choose not to review the company I work for.  Its seems in bad taste.  If an employer is interested in the company I currently work for then they should ask me.  I am writing this out because I am smarter than the computer program.
good,"I found that there was plenty of work to do at wal-mart. I was never bored during  my shift, and was given enough work. With this said, I found that there was lack of staff in different departments, would have managers that expected out of employee's out of reason, and would lecture and treat said employee's as if they were stupid. I am grateful for the experience that I gained there. But would not want to work there again."
good,Some of the management team is not trained on all the store rules an departments. It is important for the managers as well as the crew members to know as much as possible when working in a department. I feel the more you know the more you should want to know about your employer.
good,Gained alot of work experience . Managers where very helpful at times there was always something new and exciting happening in the store.
good,Lots of frustration. Drags when having a slow day. Customers dissatisfactions. Cash register problems. Co-workers unprofessional. I would enjoy the work more if we worked as a team. many attitudes and judgements. 
good,"Although I love working in customer service and putting a smile on customers faces, the management was inconsiderate."
good,"And your rate of pay did not increase with the amount of hard work and dedication you put in, you got the same raise as someone who did nothing."
good,Walmart was a good place to work. With the current economy they have had to make a lot of changes which affected the associates.
good,the job can use more ideas always work hard management can also use  some tips to make it a batter store job is not hard i love when its time to go home.
good,"In a nutshell I have learned so much about cooking and food prep work at this establishment, but the environment was too hectic and started to interfere with my school/family life."
good,They do not care about their employees. They told me once that we were a dime a dozen that they could find any one to do my job.
good,I worked for the company for 2 years. A typical day would be to manage the shelves and be an assitance to the Pharmacy when needed. I enjoyed most of the co workers.
good,"My typical day would be clocking in for the day, walking up front to see what register i would be working. I wouldn't always stay at that register though, i would move around (i.e. a different reg. or customer service, or going and working a dept.). The hardest part of the job is balancing family and work, it was hard to find family time last minute if it came up (birthday party, other family functions). The most enjoyable part of the job would be the customer's thanking you for doing such a great job, whether it was bagging their groceries nicely, doing a return, or simply finding something on a shelf. Love my co-workers!"
good,"It was a lots of Discrimination on the work place ,"
good,its ok u r not hands on w/ management but ur co workers are always thier for u
good,"high school drama, managers blew off their assoicates and jsut didn't care"
good,"A typical day at work would be servicing the customers, sales, updating the spark, etc. What I learned on the job is communication skills. The management there were responsible leaders, helping us all the time to accomplish all the demands of our jobs. My co-workers were cooperative and we were always working together as a team. The hardest part of the job was probably when someone didn't show up to work because we would have to skip some things that we have planned to do. The most enjoyable part of being a Walmart Associate is to help the customers with their needs."
good,A typical day at work consists of constant interaction with a variety of customer on a daily basis. I have learned to deal with a wide range of different situations with different customers. Our management is well below acceptable to its employees. The majority of co-workers are very nice and try to help you when you need it. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers and the terrible staffing procedures of the management there. The best part of my job is making the customer smile by fufiling thier needs.
good,It was very hot in that plant. The people I worked with were awesome.
good,"working with the public, and meeting new people everyday. my co-workers were very friendly and helpful on my first day they made me feel welcome into the Wal-mart family"
good,"Typical day at work continuous counting of the merchandise, constantly criticized by management. Blamed for things that a regular associate has no control over. I think if they chose there management team more wisely and people actually knew what they where doing in the position they have. The work experience would be better.Co-workers where good people to work around we where a good IMS Team over all as far as regular associates. I learned how to audit the store and how to search and locate merchandise in our backroom. The hardest part of the job is trying to correct errors in the system. The most enjoyable part are the projects we have to do when new merchandise comes to the store."
good,I checked out customers at the resistger and it was a nice enviroment
good,"hardest place to work .stock shelves, the hardest job in dairy dept, we work 2 to 5 pallets of freights every night."
good,To much work for the amount of employees and the pay that you get
good,Enjoyed working for this company even though it wa sesonal. Would like to return if positon becomes available.
good,Most of the complaints come from management. We have to wait a year for health care. The starting rate is very low for an employee working in a cooler or freezer. Lifting up to 60 lbs box's isn't the ideal job for a woman.
good,do not let your kids work for this company they don't care about you only how much money they can make
good,"The people I worked with were great, but there was no benefits and the pay there was terrible."
good,Walmart overnight stock was fast pasted and hectic. They move you around from one department to another. Also helping with unloading of truck. Management was very rarely seen on the floor.
good,"In my experience working at Walmart was a very proccessed area of work. I worked with older women that seemed to not like the idea of any competition especially from the younger generation. myself along with other and previous young employees had been harrassed, insulted, and told to complete taskeds in ways that were in fact wrong. This later lead to strikes against me and eventually termination. Walmart is a very hostel work enviroment, people not only in the deli but throughout the store lack the presents of manners and friendlyness. Store No. 5155."
good,They tell you that they will protect you when you have a life threatening event happen but they don’t . They expect you to get your job done but you can’t cause they have you doing 100 different things at one
good,Way to much favoring between managers and certain employees. It was all about who you knew not what you did. Never worked with your schedules. Put you on when ever they felt like doing so.
good,"Benefits are great, management do not work with your illness or surgeries . They aren’t understanding at all . I like the flexible schedules and that’s about it"
good,Walmart is a great place to work if you are just graduating from high school. you cannot live comfortably off what they offer to pay. The demeanor is not that great so it makes it hard to come with a smile on your face.
good,Fue algo normal entrevistas con l de RH el subgerente y líder de piso.
good,"No help felt as if I was on my own , no one ever there if I had a question or needed help unloading a truck in order to get it done on time then the management would yell at me"
good,We were very short when I worked here in the past so I was always unloading  the trucks full of merchandise by myself the managers were lousy and they always tried to get you in trouble
good,this place is for a younger person with no kids or an older person going into retirement. they have no care for your outside personal life . scheduling is always awful . upper management just cares about their pockets getting bigger.
good,"Hardest part of the job Was that the supervisor couldn’t get along with anyone and some of the rest of the management were not helping us but I enjoyed working there and working with some of the people"
good,this was a good company family orientated. but with time has become a selfish company they don't care about family and they don't help you succeed right now is  bad place to work if you have small children's
good,"Everyone is hired at the same pay rate, no higher pay for previous experience or education. You feel undervalued and uncared for as an employee. Management wouldn't move me to the area I asked for because he said they didn't have enough employees to take over the position  I wanted to vacate, which was due to injury off the job."
good,I was in a mva and out van was totalled and I had to go back to work the next day. When I asked for time to heal I was denied. 4 points is what we got when I worked there. I pointed out healing. I am listed as rehireable but the stores out here in CA and the employees are horrible. My stress level goes through the roof ss a patron.
good,I really enjoy the fact that my job at Walmart has been more than flexible with my hours. However I have had issues with a few employees harassing me. I've heard many people complain about harrasment problems at Walmart.
good,I am very hard worker when u put on something I do my best to learn as much as I can  I want help and learn more  I want  learn about my job so I can be best for the company
good,Wal-Mart promised growth in many different ways and where the worse business I have worked for. They buried me full time but would give me 38 hours so they wouldn’t have to pay me benefits
good,Don’t work for them unless you have tough skin and no personal life. Walmart as a company is fine. It’s the people they have in the store that will make you not want to work there.
good,"A lot of time little respect for much I had to offer in wok ethic/ organizational, management and supervisory skills. "
good,"Working there was fine overall, however my department manager could never keep personal associate matters confidential. For instance if you had to call out and told the main manger why, before you know it the whole department knew what your reason was as well."
good,"If you are fresh and out of school, I good place to learn life and work skill.  As a company, the store I was in was not a very good place to work due to incapable management.  Not sure about other stores."
good,You are not aloud to get tired or to be in any kind of pain.  The associates are doing the work and Management is walking around complaining and calling the employees lazy.
good,Empresa com ambiente bom de trabalho e crescimento pessoal.
good,I had just lost my grandfather and was having an anxiety attack when the store manager threatened to fire me. I tried for a leave of absence but had not been there long enough to qualify.
good,There was alway more work than scheduled hours. Everyone is negative and complains. Nobody is happy but the pay is decent and the hours are not regular
good,Fired me because my sister passed away and I had to be out for 4 days. Another girl at the same time had same problem. She is still there. They have their picks. So unfairly treated. Told me I could come back in 6 months. They won't even review my application. But thats okay. I work for Food City now and the changes we have coming is gonna almost run Wal-Mart out of business!!!
good,I used to work at Walmart. One manager loved how I worked while another manager hated how I worked. In the end the manager who hated me wrote me up so many times I was on the terminated list. Felt like a war.
good,They do not work with availability and they pick favorites. The expect you to work in multiple departments and do multiple things when you only have one job title.
good,"At this location there isn’t any compassion for the staff. The store manager is customers first Walmart 2nd and the staff falls to the way side. Staff is forced to work 10-12 hour shifts and if coded as part time and work full time hours, you still cannot be considered full time or get benefits"
good,"Management is horrible, they never seem to know what's going on. Half of them aren't trained for the departments that they're managing. My coworkers didn't seen to care much about the company or their jobs."
good,Management does not communicate effectively. Often given a moments notice of a upcoming changes. Often pulled from your specific job to do the jobs of others due to lack of accountability.
good,Managers very unavailable and very apathetic towards what we at the deli were going through. I ran a 1 man show often.23 cents raise promised 50 cent.
good,Great place to work.lot of hours to be worked.great people to work with. No problems everyone does there job.lot of work to be stocked.they work with your schedule. Flexible hours
good,Typical day will be very busy and its not very hard of a place to work for at all. They have a pretty nice attendance policy to. The management sucks though seems like they never really know what they are doing.
good,They work you too much and don't really care about you unless you happen to be a favorite among managers. They treat you poorly and don't want to pay you what your worth if you can do more than your basic job reqs.
good,"Walmart has the potential to be a good employer. The company has potential to be a great place to work, but the store that I worked for was a stressful work environment and pretty hostile at times. The managers could be rude especially one of the assistant managers."
good,a typical day started with unloading up to maybe three trucks on a bad day and one on a good day. hygiene was poor and so were break times. catching up at night was always stressful because we were so understaffed
good,"First off, I want to say that my coworkers are amazing. We joke around while stocking and unloading the truck, which makes it go by faster. I've made several work friends here, and I can honestly say that there are only one or two coworkers that I actually dislike. One of my supervisors is pretty chill, too. Even when he is stressed, he rarely takes it out on the rest of us. I appreciate that quality."
good,"Night Shift assigns Tasks to be done in impossible amount of time"
good,Hours are currently being cut. They are no longer flexible on hours. No one except the managers are full time. I have been there for a year and just finally got a twenty-two cent raise. There is poor management there. There is only 4 managers in total that actually do what they are suppose to do. I am a cashier who use to love it but I have slowly grown to hate it. The rules that they are changing are ridiculous. The supervisor over the front end does not care at all. All she cares about is her vacation and making sure you do not get what you need.
good,Walmart don’t work with you! The pay does not match the stress and time away from your family. Policies will change and management won’t inform you until it’s to late!
good,"Walmart was a great experience as an employee because it showed me how en-equivalent, and not fair situations you can find yourself in from the other employees no doing their job the right way to getting blame for something that you did not do."
good,"The Company does not care about the employees, from firing the greeters to managers not taking responsibility for their own mistakes it is terrible to deal with the higher ups at this Walmart."
good,Want you work like machine scared you will lose your job not good company to work for. They don't want to make career they if you they get someelse. No leadership.
good,Muito cacique pra pouco indio na loja. Tudo é engessado e problemas sem solução se acumulam  ninguém tem um treinamento decente para os cargos de chefia
good,They'll hire anyone with a pulse and that can pass a drug screen. The people that I work with are unmotivated and are only there to collect a check. Management is the same way. I firmly believe you get what you pay for and Walmart surely expresses that belief.
good,It’s a pretty good place but there’s a few problems They told me I would be getting 40 hours a week then cut my hours and I only make $12 an hour and I have a kid on the way so my girlfriend’s not gonna be able to work and I’m going to need more money
good,"The managers were unqualified (most of the time) thrown into the job with little information about their job. Coworkers were lazy and slow, didn’t always completely pay attention to training."
good,The management team does not cooperate with or care about the staff. The staff are given little to no hours and is not a stable job. Awful place to work at.
good,Loved working with the people. Schedules changed too much. Could not be content while driving 25 miles and always a challenge to get there and have my hours changed on a moment's notice.
good,Overall it isn't a bad place to work but there is little to no mobility in switching areas unless the management is in agreement to it. Once slotted in a position they are loathe to move anyone even though applicants are experienced in other areas.
good,"If you want to ever go out of your way to be the best at your job and get nothing to show for it in return, work here! It’s an awesome place to waste your time."
good,"It sucks. Horrible. Horrible place. Last resort only. Do not attempt. Will kill you slowly. Guaranteed. You'll end up hating people. When you walk into stores you won't be able to ""see like a customer"" anymore."
good,an average day as a courtesy clerk is long tiring with short breaks and borderline abusive management the pay is low but the work expectation is so high is almost impossible sometimes. i find myself calling in quite often because of the long and tiring hours and impossible work load. i almost never have time for myself after work and im almost never available to do anything but work.
good,"Its horrible, enough said. You work your butt off for absolutely nothing, working off the clock happens alot, theres not many employees so you have to cover  multiple areas, you have to run register when upfront needs you. You can work a job for months and not get paid for it then have it taken from you & you offered another position that similar. Its just awful period."
good,"I work in the Deli, my duties are:"
good,"you get discounts however they are nit much and on limited stuff. The upper management is not all that great. They don't stand by their  employees, the benefits and pay don't match up to the role all employees take"
good,they ask you what your availability is then they give you a hassle when you don't have your availability open for 24/7 . they don't always post the jobs that are available and tend to give it to their friends
good,"My department was automotive but i was put unloading the truck, covered lunch shifts to watch doors, covered  lawn n garden also the work was ok but they had me in all kinds of places in the store when i wore a uniform for the TLC"
good,"Made jokes with co-workers as we unloaded a truck. We all went out on break cause we had to take break at the same time. Spent a good few minutes, searching for my manager to get a hand-held scanner for merchandise. Worked till it was time to leave. Hardest part about the job was how fast-paced they moved and how much I spent on my feet."
good,"I love working for the company, its just the managers don't listen to anything there associates have to say. Then when its wrong you blame it on them for poor execution. Not all of them are like that just some of them. Plus its hard to advance in the company unless you know someone, what's the point of having an internal requisition system if your only going to hire people that are in the job code? Then lets talk about the benefits structure, its horrible Hourly associates can only earn up to 550 against store metrics that are changed hourly, there hardly anything in it for long term service associates aside from a 401k that is only matched, but how can you save money if your barely able to make money? When store don't make money hours are cut."
good,"My last store was the only store I had had issues with.  It was good until the new management team took over.    They started using unethical and unsafe work practices, and when I tried to report it, they retaliated against me by making it impossible to do my job by withholding resources and then firing me for not being able to do my job."
good,I really love this job and I was really dedicated to this job but due to my lack of Transportation they fired me. I wouldn't recommend this Corporation to any of my friends or family due to the fact that management team really didn't care about any of us stuff for themselves.
good,Management is sloppy. Store is dirty and unorganized. Breaks and lunches are scheduled wrong. Breaks are sometimes forgotten. Bags have run out of the store at least twice since I've been there.
good,It was an alright job for a first job management when I started there was very good when ever they made work over time they made me cut my hours. Wasnt worth working overtime.
good,"Conflicting statements from managers, even from managers not over our department tried to tell us what to do, or when to do it. Even telling us we could not take our breaks or lunch on time, only to then be told we should have taken our lunch or break earlier (in time)."
good,Some managers were creepy as well as people who worked overnights. It was a job but as far as management and the type of people they hired I was not fully comfortable.
good,Working at WalMart was not what I expected.  They trained well but they did not treat their employees with respect or show any concern for their well being.
good,"Unloading stock every day and greeting customers, management would always ride you to make sure things were done, even with a doctors note it still would be held against you as a absent day"
good,"I've worked at more than one (3). The first was okay, the second was amazing, and the third isn't great. I've rated for the third store. If I was discussing the 2nd, I would give 5 stars for nearly everything. It all depends on the location. The pay is nice."
good,Management does what ever they want even if it breaks policy and laws and they blame the people under them if they get caught. There is a lot of favoritism and if you call the anonymous ethics hotline  they retaliate because it's not that anonymous.
good,We are very short staffed on a regular basis which affects our ability to take care of our patients the way would like to. This is the fault of upper management.
good,"If you have a family matter to deal with and you cant call in.... Dont apply here... They cut hours like crazy, then if you go over your time they make you cut that time..."
good,"Decent money if your okay with being bullied into everything,  getting ridiculed for things you aren't at fault,  and working 17 roles in one day.  You get 1 hour pto time per 20 hours work so it will take time to get paid vacation.  Bonuses are decent if your store is making enough money."
good,"A typical day at Walmart starts with a fun walmart sheer. Then you go to your area and if you are a stoker, you stok all the merchandise. then you go home."
good,"I walked into the door with 15 years experience in retail and was denied a department manager position and thrown on 3rd shift.  I have no problem proving myself to a company, but when you do so over and over only to get passed over for advancements because ""You are too good of a worker to lose.""  I did finally get the ear of one manager that went to bat for me only to get transferred out for it.  Finally left because a CO-Manager used race fueled intimidation tactics to invoke a panic attack, leaving me no choice to leave.  Even today the store's customer service and knowledge have gone down DRASTICALLY.  Because there is no direct competition in town they are just lax."
good,Reporte de producción errónea aplicación de política si consideras las evidencias en general existe mafia laboral entré medios mandos y mandos nivel gerencial con represalias al personal de línea sicología y en ocasiones física. Es buena empresa
good,"They hire you as seasonal.  With seasonal, they can let you go at any time and you do not get any benefits including employee discounts.  I was out sick and was told they do not accept doctors excuses."
good,"Walmart didn't tend to care about associates issues, whether it was medical, personal, etc. You'd get written up for missing work if you were sick, had to pay for doctors note, which didn't guarantee you'd get approved time off to get better, and not reimbursed for your personal expenses used to cover work supplies."
good,"Too many negatives at this store to list. Within first 8 days of employment:sexual assult at break table, two deaths due to drug od, one in parking lot, one in front restroom,. AP is useless.lots of loitering in parking lot. Unsafe work environment in and out of building. Employees arrive at work high (operate pallet jacks/forklifts) mgt fully aware, jokes that thier 'tired'. If you miss days, leave early, stand around and not work- while leaving the work to others, then this is the store for you. You will fit right in. If your adulting with responsibilities and bills : too stressfull, unsafe, disrespectful. Look to another store. strong work ethic is ignored and commented on as if there's something wrong in it/ with YOU. lack of communication with mgrs-which makes your job stressfull at best. daily, and often several times a shift,  the direction,job and duties will change from one mgr to another. There's a lot of rework, double work, and redoing job tasks for this reason and others: lack of structure, mgt not trained in job, lack of communication,etc. Most associates know more of job than mgt. Pay is $11 hour and not worth the stress and safety at this store."
good,This job was not the worst that I had but t was still horrible. The management thought they were entitled like they were gods give to NEVER EVER work at Walmart EVER work at Walmart
good,Depending on where and who you work with depends highly on your sanity and peace of mind when you come to work and when you leave and go home. As the old saying goes “too many chiefs not enough Indians”
good,A typical day was busy and very high volume of work.  The workplace culture was busy and often not enough time to finish projects within my duty hours.
good,walmart is a great place to start working for first time employees. the management is horrible. they are not very considerate with the employees. walmart does not accept hospitals notes and they will fire you.
good,I love meeting new people. So Walmart was great for me. Love meeting and interacting with all of the customers and learning different things. Its was a great experience.
good,"Plaisant de travailler avec le public. C’est un travail très demandant,  cependant j’ai appris beaucoup de choses. Il faut être capable de travailler sous pression, on nous répète souvent les mêmes choses et les exigences sont très nombreuses."
good,Not a single person cared about their job. Most things were half done. Coworkers would leave messes on the floors and wouldn't clean it. The stores were dirty. Nobody was happy.
good,They did away with my position and didn't seem to want to find me another one. The new hires were making almost as much as me and I was there almost ten years.
good,Management was terrible. they didn’t want to work around your schedule with you home life. Told them couldn’t work Wednesday’s and sundays because if church ended up getting fired for it because I called in when I was scheduled on one of those days
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart as a cart associate under staffed terrible work conditions no teamwork.Management shows no compassion for fellow employees.The most enjoyable part of the job getting a chance from terrible conditions outside.
good,The job is very physical and face pace the hours are hard.  You push a cart and picking up to 8 orders at a time.  Management isn't helpful and job advancement is impossible.
good,"Not really department managers all we do is work freight. Low pay for what is asked of us. Need more help to do all that is asked of us. Don't make any manager mad, if you cross them you might as well look for a new job"
good,"My job is to restock apparel and make sure the 7 departments look nice at the end of my shift. But at my particular store the shift before mine did nothing so overnight was left with the day's work as well as our own. "
good,"No se toma en cuenta la aptitud laboral,mucho acomodo,cero compromiso con los empleados"
good,"they want you to do like a billion jobs because the company is to cheap to just schedule more people, they want you to be flexible so they can work you inconsistent hours but then cut your hours yet not leave you any room to get a second job because your schedule is so inconsistent. Very unfair to the employee."
good,Coworkers where good but management did no listen to complants or problem of employees. There where some times where supervisors did not listen to management and kept employees pased scheduled lunch times and brake times
good,"As an modular specialist, you come I around 9pm. We have an meeting for about an hour where management explain what's happening for that night. We have a layout on what products/displays are going up and coming down at this time whoever was doing the project during the day already left the job undone and wrong. So was have to stripped the display done start from the beginning all while management and other members on the time are replacing stockers and cashier who called out, so we are now down more than half of the team. So at 7am if ALL displays aren't complete b4 customers come management tools the team to the back from and yells and berates team in front of the rest of overnight employees and staff coming in."
good,"i absolutley hated working at walmart, people were always calling in. you have to stand on your feet all day and sometimes i wouldnt even get my 15 min break."
good,"your very busy, there is never not anything to do, some management is childish bringing personal life with work life, they need better discounts for employees"
good,True is a  family store very low moral mangers you encounter are very rude low pay  no holidays off no family time at all its all about the almighty dolllar
good,Got too work clocked in went to warehouse to set up to unload trucks after all trucks was unloaded then we used pallet jacks to pull stuff to where it belonged and if we had time we would stocked shelves
good,it was a stressful job that was only made better a little by my friendly coworkers. As time went on though it only increased the stress levels in my life to unhealthy levels.
good,I personally enjoy my work at Walmart. It provides me with the things I need to try and make working here an enjoyable place to work. I meet interesting people on a daily every day basis
good,"Dealing with customers was the most stressful part of the job, getting yelled at for something that I had no control over.  Management would lie to my face promising more hours, then only scheduling me for 5 hours per week, seriously who can live on working 1 day a week."
good,It paid well for someone just out of high school and they give hours but management is horrible. The store manager barely answered any calls he had come in. The open door policy is a waste of time because they still listen to what the manager has to say.
good,they dont hire and stay true to disabled people. they refuse to accomodate as by law.they need to follow the labor laws and abide by the laws. They dont accept drs accomodations written and unless your in a wheelchair they refuse to work with you.
good,"Fast paced, have to be willing to be overlooked for a lot of things. they play favorites all the time. salaried members of management and some hourly managers can do no wrong. they only cared about certain workers."
good,working for Wal-mart for 10 years and more i would say that this company is meant for kids in school and not for an adult that is looking for a career.
good,"This is a great starter job for a college student like me. It paid the best in the area for the hours i was available. Would recommend for a temporary job, but would be way to stressful as a lifetime job."
good,"A typical work day for me is dealing with customers who are very aggressive and pushy. Managament does not back their associates in anyway. Even when you try to talk to them about things, they flip it back on you and make it seems that everything is your fault."
good,"Too much favoritism , they don't pay enough and you're not always guaranteed hours."
good,Always had to work outside of my job code was held accountable for things that were not my responsibility. I was an hourly and had to cut my hours but was held to the responsible of a assistant manager. I never got my breaks and was told to take short lunches then got in trouble for it. It was not all bad the associates were great had a good repore with them. I always put them first. The customers were great also. I felt sorry for them because the store was not staffed for them because of the hours getting cut so drastically. This is because of managements lack of skills
good,Management could have been better. busy all the time never had a weekend off leave you by yourself all the time. coworkers were out for themselves. just a bad experience
good,Learned all about the retail industry and how it works from top to bottom. They give you the opportunity to cross train and learn about different departments.
good,"Management has poor, bitter attitude toward associates, stocking can be enjoyable, I personally preferred loading/unloading trucks to being on the salesfloor. Rarely any job advancement. No benefits were ever offered when I worked there and I've been there for a year."
good,While working at Walmart i worked overnight and stocked shelves. For the most part I enjoyed working at Walmart. I quit so I could move to Tennessee to live with my father.
good,Management was very disrespectful to their employees. They don't consider outside personal issues when making the schedule. They aren't willing to fix your schedule due to family issues
good,I liked the people I work with . But did not care for management. And over work you and under pay for the job they want you to do. So if there was better communication skills. It woul be a better job.
good,"I got along with my coworkers, and my bosses.  The enviornment was not to bad unless there were a lot of customers.  I started as a stocking clerk and moved up to a support manager.  After ten years I decided to leave because it just became to much."
good,Unprofessional work place. Constant gossip and drama between coworkers and even managers. No clear directions for work. Ridiculous sick policy and pointing system.
good,Working at Wal-Mart can be demanding  and stressful.  You have to have the ability and strength to work in a fast paced environment.  The knowledge to comprehend the job performances  expected of them.  Never let
good,From my experience at the hondo branch I didn't enjoy the employment. The duties I was expected to perform were always based on who liked who more insted of who need to do what to get the job done more efficiently
good,It is a very stressful environment to work. The pay isn't enough to deal with the stress that follows. Management expects everything to be done in a second span while having other work to do.
good,"Working for Walmart means that you'll Pretty much live there, and not in a good way. Hours are long, breaks Short, lacking in training. It's pretty much Learn as you go, which most of the time ends in bad results."
good,"hard work. learned a lot about management. helped great amount of associates grow as employees. learned a lot of new skills, sometimes use them in personal life."
good,"They will work you to death with no regard for the associate and let others by with doing very little. They lie about advancement."
good,I clean up after customers. I run the cash registers and I clean the bathrooms. I sweep and mop the floors. I prepare the store for closing. Sadly I get alot of complants from my new department management.
good,Les employés font un bon travail d'équipe tous ensembles.
good,Overall a good company. Management can be very good or very bad. Good benefits if you work the right amount of hours. Always read the fine print. You must earn all PTO and use it before the end of the calendar year. They do not care about your personal life and will make you work around their schedule and change it without notifying you. It is nearly impossible to have a life outside of work. If you work for this company please read all policies so that you know what is right and wrong because if you end up with bad management they will treat you wrong and go against policy.
good,"They treat their employees here, at Walmart of West Berlin, like we're the lowest of the low. We are the lifeblood of this company, and they want us to all bleed out and die before they take responsibility for their own actions. Would NOT recommend working here under ANY circumstances. No matter how desperate you are, do NOT, and I repeat DO NOT. Work for Walmart of West Berlin, NJ. Too much stress."
good,I would go in to work excited for the day and right away the atmosphere in walmart is negative and became a job rather than a career. I tried to be positive and give great customer service but even the customers were difficult.
good,most of the staff is great and you can have a great day. holidays are a rough time for the store and can cause some stress on some departments. the department manager I had was amazing and very understanding.
good,"I was a cashier, unless you've worked the position you don't know how awful it is. Pay is crud but its not minimum wage, a few cents above it. Most managers have no idea what they are doing or how to actually manage people properly."
good,"When I was hired, they told us at the interview that we were replaceable, a dime a dozen. This job was just a stepping stone until a better job came along. I started out on days then asked to go on afternoons for the summer only while my children were out of school, then go back to days after they returned to school. I was told that wouldn't be a problem, but when the time came for me to go back to the day shift, they would not let me. They lied to me. The store manager did not care in the least. The work was not hard, but you are on your feet the entire time you are working. Sometimes it was hard to get away from the cash register to even go to the bathroom."
good,work day flow always doing something different people was okay i learned people and cashering skills the hardest part standing on my feet all night but it go with job
good,"its a very stressful fastpaced job. I was loading trailers. I had health issues that i could not do the job,The hardest part of the job was loading three trailers at a time."
good,"This is a great job to start out at, but I wouldn't consider making this job a career. I think it could be managed a little better and the workers definitely need to appreciated more and paid more for the things they have to put up with."
good,The only enjoyable part of this place is being around people that actually consider the fact that we are all human beings. I have seen so many things in over a decades time.
good,Poor management at the store I worked for. I can't speak for others. I dealt with too many broken promises. Too much favoritism. Lack of upper management.
good,This is not at place you want to work. Managers don't care about there associates and will try to fire you or write you up every chance they get. The day to day stress is ridiculous.
good,If you work here as management you can do as you please. working as a entry level employee you are treated poorly. this company looks out for themselves
good,"Walmart is a good job to have, you get a decent pay check. When I was working to the one in Breaux Bridge the pay was good, but the managers were not. They did not give me any type of benefit because I was a part time worker, which is not a very good for the employees."
good,Dealing with all types of people who seem to take their troubles and complaints out on the cashiers. Not all do that but most do. Management is not helpful most of the time.
good,Everyone treated poorly do not work there the compensation at the walmart i worked at was not worth the treatment received by management the customers treat you better
good,"They usually made me work alone when it was the busiest days, management was okay but if you did something wrong they would scream at you instead of telling you polity how to do it. What I learned was no matter how difficult or how busy the job is you have to try you best to complete it and finish the job."
good,"There is not a work life balance. Walmart is only concerned about the bottom line which is important. However, in order to attain such goals you have to treat your associate right and in return they will work to such capacity that they are working the business and the business isn't working them."
good,You are expected to do so much work for little pay. Customers are very high demanding thinking they own you and treat you awful. Helps built up experience with how to handle stressful customers.
good,Wal-Mart is possibly the worst company in witch I worked for poor hours low pay and bad management.im great full for the opportunity but all in all not a place i would recommend
good,"No set schedule, Walmart expects you to live off minimum wage, they have no set schedule to insure you wont get a second job to make ends meet. Some Assistant manages look down on their employees thinking they are better then them, they forget with out those employees they would not have the title of Department , Assistant Manager."
good,"A typical day of being a lawn and garden specialist consisted of watering plants, light maintenance, stocking shelves and the floor, helping customers."
good,"When I got hired, I was working with people that were much much older than me. I had no idea there was going to be that much labor. Some days we worked 12 hours days and also on saturdays just so the store can be ready by a deadline. Workplace culture was unprofessional. Hardest part of the job was lifting heavy metal pieces and the most enjoyable part was having a job for that summer."
good,Manager inconsistent with policies and procedures.   Work ethic was low most of the time.  Human resources were not knowledgeable in areas. Associates were the best part of my day.
good,"Walmart was a fun place to work however in cap 2, my department, you get paid very little for all the hard work you do. We did very hard work for very little money which is hard when you are trying to raise a family."
good,"Do not recommend for management. Poor working environment, insubordi,nation form lower managers. Poor advancment opportunities. Does not promote safe working conditions."
good,It ok to get started at Walmart but don't stay for a while and if you do they will find a way to get rid of you and if they don't like you so good to start but don't stay
good,"upper management requires other management that is salaried to work more that 50 hours a week, upper management did not support there management team, very fast paced"
good,I worked very hard everyday and management never noticed. If you wasn't a buddy to management you didn't really exist. I had a job to do any sitting around for hours talking about nothing was not in my job description.
good,There point system is unrealistic. Things happen in every day life and they're not willing to work with you. I missed work due to a medical emergency and was terminated.
good,"If you're not lucky enough to get a fixed schedule you're basically screwed for hours. Even if you do get a fixed schedule it's not likely you'll get one that leaves any time for a social life. Other than that it's not too terrible. Unless you're a female working in a department with nothing but other females, can you say DRAMA. But it's easy work so you can't complain too much, I guess."
good,"A typical work day at customer service in Walmart is hectic. Everyday you come in your the first to deal with all the problems from the day before. Not only do you have to answer questions and be able to inform people able whats happening in the store; you also have to do returns, money orders, and cash checks."
good,They do not care about their employees. If one manager does not like you they all don't like you. In my case I was pregnant and has several complications during and I was in and out of the hospital and I missed several days and had to leave early several times and they no longer accepted doctors notes after January 1st. They had absolutely zero compassion for anything that was going on but acted like they actually cared when other customers were around.
good,"I'd say working for Walmart is good & all but, at my job position i would say is the greatest on Earth. My duty for the company is to gather carts in the parking lot, either if its raining, sleeting or snowing I have to do the work I am there to do. the skills I've learned from being a Cart pusher is to be aware of your surroundings & gaining social skills, it really helped me a lot but i don't wanna do the job anymore. My managers are really nice but, when i ask them for another position they always find an excuse for me to stay a Cart pusher. I really need more things to put on my resume but, they fail to listen, so now they've given me no choice but to look for new opportunity when it arises"
good,"Wal-Mart cares deeply about it's customers is true. From a worker stand point, they make sure to take care of the customers. It's the employees that are not taken care of at all. The system sucks there."
good,We are paid decent but etc need to get paid more. Management isn't what it should be. Nothing ever changes in retail.  We get discount and bonuses.  Days off if u request them early enough.
good,"The employees are really overworked and underpaid. Management doesn't know what they are doing most the time. So many conflicting tasks, the employee doesn't know where to start."
good,"On a typical work day I come in and am given a list of things I need to do on top of my day to day activities and for the most part is unreal. The culture here is bad as no one wants to work or even be there in general. The hardest part of my job is getting what I need to get done with all the tasks that they throw at me on top of my responsibilities. I have learned a lot such as how the company finances work and how the overall bussiness of a store works from how it gets to the store, unloaded, and put on the shelf. I have also learned how to work as a team and how to work for the unexpected that may arise during the work day. The most enjoyable part of this job would be learning different things and learning about all types of different people. Last would be management here is sometimes good and sometimes bad depending on what day and who it is."
good,"This job was alright, I made good money but the managers played favorites way too much. They also had me as part time but I would work 39 hours a week just so they couldn't classify me as full time."
good,"Stressful and everybody is always tired there.  Hard work and I commend all who works for this company. Our Management was"
good,Not a good company to work for.  Walmart treats their employees terrible and I didn't like working there at all.  Management was awful and they expect the employees to work harder than what they can pay.
good,"Some of the other employees around my area, became some of my best friends. But the management team played favorites. Treated almost everyone poorly, refused to give good raises and benefits."
good,En el tiempo que labore no hubo apoyo para crecimiento .
good,"I was fired after injuring my back, doctors notes/weight restrictions were refused. And they liked to change my schedule without informing me. They told me I could every Sunday off due to my beliefs but after the 3rd Sunday they were taken away by a manger with the phrase ""it's not my fault you beilve that stuff."""
good,The managers do not understand that you have family to take care of. So if your if a single parent this is not the place for you. You do not get paid enough for the things you have to deal with.
good,"The job is not hard, but the amount that is expected of you in an 8 hour shift is crazy. There is hardly movement unless someone quits or moves to a different location. Out of all your managers there is usually only one that is decent or kind."
good,"bad days at work there. no structure for associates for business ethics and future business no classes to advance n improve. not a safe place to work,"
good,I had complications because my wife was expecting and I needed to get time off. Lack of communication led to me being written up as a no call no show. For 2 wks!
good,The culture has changed totally in the last few years and not for the better. People are getting displaced at an alarming rate and a large percentage of them are over 50 years old. I smell a class action lawsuit coming soon.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work but they need to get better management so that things can run more smoothly and it can be more inclusive. Vacation was great, the company is flexible not  inclusive enough, there is much work to be done and I hope Doug McMillion can take the company forward."
good,Overall the store management is unprofessional and childish. The store manager make up rules to target and alienate the second shift truck unloaders and stockers. Even though the truck unloaders are one of the lowest paying jobs her at the store the management put way way too much pressure on the team and there should not be that much pressure to the job.
good,Management picks who they want to help. If ypu are not part pf their click it is a hard time for you. They dont understand people have lives and emergencies happen.
good,"Management is horrible you dont get the hours you request after opening your availability. Favoritism is a huge thing at this walmart."
good,"Management constantly changing. Too many people think they are in charge. No room for advancement. The past sucks, though I guess it's okay for the work done. Quarterly bonuses if the store does well."
good,overworked n under payed didn't learn anything new n management never help with any problems the hardest part of the job was trying to work while other didn't n then been asked to help them then getting coached when i couldn't get my job done.then the talking be hide my back when i didn't help them so i could get my job done. the best part of the job was getting off.
good,I didn't like  apparel  so I switched to cashier . Cashier is way easier and stress free! Apparel is just returns and zoning and time that's just stupid I don't recommend it to anyone
good,Es una empresa donde no se te da la oportunidad de escalar para un mejor puesto.
good,Walmart only care about making money...they dont care about their associates or their needs. They want you to think your part of their family but they dont care about you or your family.
good,"overall, walmart was a good place to work, it was the employees that made it difficult to stay there. There were plenty of oppertunities to advance if you can get past the drama from the other cashiers."
good,I would not suggest anyone to work here. They do not care about their employees. You receive little pay. They schedule you crazy hours and they expext you to do everything in just one week.
good,"rude managers, play favourites no real concern for employees. the managers were more concerned about talking in front of the registers than actually doing their jobs"
good,You stay bus on a regular basis and there isn't much support. The pay is not worth the back breaking work they have you do. They are also not flexible with your family schedule.
good,"make sure shelves are filled assist customers or other employees management not very helpful at times low dealing with management not getting question answered or help, telling customers you cant find their layaway items when your able to help the customer."
good,"I love my position as pharmacy technician."
good,Their are to many mangers and they do not care about anyone they are rude and lazy if your kids are sick or you are they don't care they will fire you are cattle to these people I loved my job and dealing with the customers but the assistant managers will not do there job they let people do whatever they want but whats right .
good,"I would work alone and would do everything by myself, the management was good but had hard times coping with and that i would clean up after they had left and were not understanding."
good,"Dont expect this job to be the best, management keeps gettning worse and worse. This company claims to be pro employee but don't believe it. Have fun working there."
good,"Hard work load with less people. Frustrating management with a lot of disorder in the workplace. At first I enjoy my job to the fullest, but it has be a worse nightmare working there."
good,in change of money and check cashing . Also responsible of bagging and cleaning if needed. Not a lot of space to grown on and no mercy on employees. Lack of organization
good,Sometimes you have required meetings. Longer hours during holidays. Training program is long and seems to just keep going even after your hired theirs still more training to do.
good,A fun and learning experience. Some customers are friendly as well as management. A great opportunity to learn new and exciting things about being employed with Walmart.
good,The most unequal and unbalanced place I have ever worked. No structure and severe lack of communication. Work / Life Balance Non-Existent. No room for promotion or advancement.
good,"I worked in the women's department, rehanging the clothes, and also worked in the chemicals department restocking the shelves, and worked as a overnight zoner, and helped open this Wal-Mart In Norwalk Ca."
good,"Typical day at  work would  be  to  clock in on time, then asked . management what section I'm in and whats the tasked for today. I make sure that have a good attitude good values also made sure I have interactions with customers' The most enjoyable part about my job was helping customers and making new friends."
good,Many customers to get to know and help. Other associates can be fun to work with. Management was not easy to work with or for. They changed policy to make customers happy not caring how it made their associates appear.
good,"Management is very strict on absence policy, regardless of the situation. I was let go because of a car accident and was not allowed to explain why. I felt this to be unfair. My car was totaled and I had to buy a new one! Now without my job, how am I supposed to pay for my car?!"
good,"Stressful place to work, with little to no support system, very little respect is given. There is no communication between levels of management"
good,"Limited advancement. Busting your butt at work and receiving ZERO incentive for it makes you want to do nothing like everyone else. You would think that you would stick out but with most stores having incompetent management, No."
good,A typical day was stocking shelves and delegating task.  I learned what it takes to make a store profitable.  The culture was to always keep the customer number one and have the lowest prices.  The management very rarely recognized you for hard work and it is very difficult to get promoted if you work hard. The hardest part of the job was getting promoted.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers
good,"Great customer service ,doing pathways can make your pay rate go up a dollar. I love the team work and loyal customers. You can also move up in another department you can set your schedule or switch shifts with another associate."
good,extremely busy at all times. co workers were great to work with. unfortunately not much room for advancement. Management doesn't always know what is going on.
good,They have a very strict attendance policy and gives no exceptions even with doctors note. Management is confusing you talk to one manager they just tell you to go to the next manager its nothing but a circle and never fully settles whatever the issue maybe. They cut back hours for no reason and have you working 25 hours every two weeks. They also will play you out your bonuses and tell you ...you missed it by a day or two. Walmart is a very cheap company to make as much money as they do. I've been there for 9 months and have been trained for customer service and the money center but still will not get offered a chance to move up. They train you for other stuff that requires higher pay and have you work it without coding you for that station so they dont have to pay you for that position.
good,Working here is very fun. Unfortunately it is also very challenging. Not everyone has good manners is an understatement. Management could be better.
good,The managers don't care what the employees do at all. Everyone is aloud to do whatever it is that they want. People have favorites. You can take breaks whenever for however long. I did not like working there at all.
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, pessoas ótima de bom convívio, amáveis."
good,Enjoyed it but after being cut hours I quit. A lot of drama and management did t help any. And they exspect you to sell credit card to the same people you just asked the day before
good,"This job required a lot of work with little pay, management could have been a whole lot better. This job did not want to take certain days off for school. This job did not care about family death, health issues or scheduled surgeries"
good,Our managers were very disrespectful. Always talking down to the employees and using fowl language. Never complimented us when we did a great job performaning.
good,I was responsible for all registers and cashiers as well as customers as  a Customer Service Manager. If a customer had a complaint i would be called in to assist. I would have to bring cash to cashiers as needed. I would do the schedule for breaks and lunches. If it was extremely busy I would hop on to a registers to help get the lines down. Help train new cashiers.
good,Walmart was horrible for me they overworked me and had me doing other things not pertaining to the job and they never replaced their broken equipment .
good,Definitely didn't have the best experience. Most managers are inexperienced. The schedule is unpredictable and if you change your availability your hours will be tremendously cut.
good,"Not a bad place to work, co-workers were awesome to work with. Upper management isn't very fair with promoting from within. No holidays off to spend with family, benefits aren't great, lucky to get time off when you need it."
good,the hours they gave didn't work with my homelife and plus they really didn't pay alot they also say that you are not doing a good job or let you go to another part of the store
good,Awful place to work. Don't care about their employees being pregnant . Bad management. Hated working there . Took away time from my son
good,I would love to help customers out it make my day good to know i helped somebody out.Co-workers will always be there when i need help on anything.I will help manager organize everything around the store.
good,"On a normal day, it was okay. I learned how to work a pallet jack."
good,"Although Walmart is the biggest franchize around the world, the stress level is not worth what they pay. The managers all have their favorites and they do not appreciate the work that is put in by the associates."
good,"I learned a lot about walmart. Working there was very fast paced. The management was just ""okay"". You get 3 breaks for a 6 hour shift. They don't pay very well."
good,"open jewelry dept, clean up shoe dept clean up purses then do paperwork for each dept. Help customers promptly with a smile and postive attude, check in frieght for 3 depts and put freight up, do aduits for jewelry and counts for gold and diamonds. hopefully get to help a senior with selecting a watch and fitting it for them so they leave happy or help that young man find the just right diamond ring for his first girlfriend."
good,"Work Training was terrible, and Drama across the wholes sales floor. I do not recommend, nor do i suggest to work here in any manner."
good,"The benefits were not worth the time, money, nor effort. The workers are treated like scum and nothing you do is appreciated or respected."
good,The CSM position is rough! You need patience of a saint to do this job without being miserable! But don't be to nice or you won't be considered strong enough! Sure they paid me 11.25/hour but they dropped my hours down to 15 a week. Who can live off that?
good,wal mart is not the place to work at if you are looking for a job with benefits. It is not the happiest place to be on earth. Manager is a jerk and can careless about his employees
good,"un dia típico es realizar mis labores cotidianas."
good,"gostei muito de trabalhar na empresa , só que fiz muito que esqueceram de me efetivar em registro ."
good,Walmart was a very bad place to work for in my opinion. The top managers barely knew my name and coming to work was a struggle because everyone around me was miserable and did not care about anyone but themselves. The management team that was above me was terrible and it was not an efficiently ran business in my opinion.
good,"I feel like the scheduling should be better takin care of, it gets in the way of my plans, never had weekends off, i dont think we need hour lunches it should be no more than a half hour."
good,"A typical day at Wal Mart was to see what time, how many hours, and when meal break was scheduled. These things changed on a weekly basis, and often times daily. The learning experience was an understanding of the ways a major retailer conducts business and uses employees as unsatisfied minions. Management was unaware of what management was doing. From one manager to another, no one in the building knew what the other was doing. Employees would be assigned a task by one manager and another manager would discipline said employee for not listening to them. I was an absolute joke. The co-workers were a group of wonderful individuals. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job were the customers. Some were rude and others were very pleasant. The longer that an employee is there the better acquainted with customers one becomes. There are many loyal customers in which one would see on a daily or weekly basis."
good,i worked in the meat department receiving and stocking the shelves. management seems like they dont care about fellow employees much. is good for part time job..
good,Since it was my first job I didn't expect much. My experience working at that company was not a good one. Management did nothing when someone complained about a problem so I felt that was not the type of working environment I wanted to be in.
good,"Great individuals to work with. Not a strong supportive team of company supervisor(s). Constantly received more advice and help from peers that worked for another company within the building rather than support from first line supervisor. Relationship between the ajoining companies within the building has gotten better, but still not fair treatment to those whom daily do the most laboring and physical work. There is no plan for advancement, even for those that have been there for 5+ years. No management planning nor cooperation with supervisors to achieve set goals or problem solve. In direct talks with Senior Supervisors, in the past 3+ years, they have attended less than 10  Shift Supervisor meetings or training, because those meetings ad training events are NEVER held only written or scheduled to maintain paperwork value."
good,"Associates do not get enough appreciation and are not rewarded well for good, hard work. Management was not organized. People were not taking serious and were not treated fairly."
good,Walmart was hard work which I don't mind. They didn't do anything to make the work environment comfortable did not have any concern for the people that worked underneath them.
good,needs better management and skills to train there workers and women customers .. all education is on the computer not one one as needed in the stores for management and workers.
good,greeting customers and checking them out expeditiously. Always smile no matter what the situation is. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the supervisor when they are needed.
good,"This was a decent job if you don't mind working on the holidays and dealing with irate customers.  I did enjoy working with people, sometimes around the holidays the bad side of people tends to come out."
good,Descent place to work. but only as a stepping stone. All about numbers and money. The key is to put your head down and figure out if that where you want to be. Some stores are better than others . You just have to find the right one.
good,"The management needs to be more professional and stop yelling at others and just take a breather for once. It is a good place to work, but I do not see myself going back until they get their stuff together"
good,I enjoyed it when i was left alone doing my job in the meat department but when they start throwing you all over the store in different departments your own department starts lacking in sales and higher achievement due to me being absent working in some other department that i didnt have any interest in.
good,I always stop what I am doing to help customer when they need. I also help my co-workers if they need any help. I learn about to do the mods and price changes. I also learn how to do claims in one day. I always been a fast learner when it come to do something new.
good,"I loved the job, the customers the co workers but big difference from one Wal-Mart to another.  If you want to keep your Insurance, it is up to you to find a department to transfer to if they cut your hours in your dept"
good,"I really didn't like traveling that long distance to work, even though I needed a job. It was easy and the work wasn't hard. Things weren't really organized and I wouldn't go back to that Walmart."
good,"Its a very stressful place, its often hard to get a hold of management, especially when phones are ringing off the hook, plus you have to listen to the walkie and if your on phone and can't answer right away they often get snappy, management likes to take you from one the to another causing you to have to stop what your doing which leaves you to an unfinished project. like to you schedule you out of your availability. Not all management was like that, but some made it very impossible, but I had great department managers that helped their associates as well as they could, were very patient and did were very understanding, tried not to ask for too much than what could be done. My co-workers were amazing I miss them so much they made working there some days worth it. I learned great customer service, how to put the merchandise in proper order, how to divide merchandise properly and making whatever problems into solutions. The hardest part was doing as much as I could and what I had done was ruined in minutes though I could make it through that management a lot of times were not understanding."
good,"Would have been a great place to work if they would put forth the effort to make their employees feel appreciated. Not by telling the employee they can cross train and learn to become a CSM and then allow a CSM to step in the way and say no. There is a LOT of inconsistency here. They treat you as if your a number. Not a person with a life outside of the workplace. Not a very good place to work. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you enjoy being stepped on and enjoy constant disappointments and inconsistency. They don't want to work with ""Single"" parents as we don't matter because we are single parents with small children. They will not work around your schedule. The pay sucks when you start too."
good,The harddest part of the job was trying to deal with management. There was always miscommunication and a few of them would put employees down insteaad of encourage them. Most of my co worrkers were awesome. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to make my customers smile and keep them coming back.
good,"worked night is was an good job cleaning only 8 hr ,customers friendly,hated the management. the coworkers was friendly didn't mind coming to work"
good,"Walmart fails to promote and educate from within and gives little opportunity for growth and development.Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"Wasnt the worst job Ive ever had, nor was it the best. Requesting time off was near impossible and managment was difficult to get ahold of. Terrible work environment. Took a toll on me as a person outside of work"
good,not one of my favorite places to work. very unorganized not very good at being flexible. not the work place for college students to have
good,"Helping customer with any question they have, we get the store ready for the customer by stocking the merchandise o the shelves."
good,There isn't a lot of benefits or incentives for employees to improve work habits. Advancement opportunities come slowly and are not to much of an improvement in pay or hours.
good,"Walmart is a fun place to work, however; they don't care about their employees families, they don't offer very many hours to new employees, and they don't really care about medical issues that one may have."
good,"A typical day at the Wal Mart deli involved a lot of grease, oil, meat juices, and other very gross things. Despite having to deal with all of that, you also have to be the Flash or Wonder Woman to get everything done if you're short on staff (which we were all the time). Everything had to be constantly cooking to keep up with the time in and time out of all the food in the hot case or customer demands. Customers ranged from friendly and understanding to absolutely distasteful and hateful, especially if you were completely out of stock on a particular item. Management was almost as bad as the customers because it seemed like if they could, they'd have bull whips and use them to whip us to make us go faster. Not only that, but they had outrageous standards for everything especially when there was so little people to do what all they wanted done. There were some nights I'd be at work till midnight or later (when my shift was supposed to be over at 11) cleaning the deli because I was the only one or everybody did a little bit of the work and left me to do the rest. There was even a time when I got into trouble and got written up because a co-worker didn't clean something properly, but because I was the last one in the area, I didn't make sure it was clean."
good,"It was ok at first. The managers suck and don't care. They are completely unfair and give themselves pay raises, and leave us in the dirt. As for the hours... I work 40hrs a week and they wont put me as full time to get any benefits. The company is cheep and they will don't give you any time off."
good,"The chances of advancing are slim to none. Most of the managers are unhappy, because they are told that they are not ready for better positions."
good,"My time working for walmart was ok because when it came do to the management to get somthing done it would not so u had to stay on the about little thing,They are under staffed workers dont like to work so it allways came down on the ones that did work,its alot of kids that work there cause they know they dont have to pay them as much as they would a older person.......but when i was there i worked."
good,"they didn't work with school schedule and had me working more than forty hours on a part time salary and wouldn't offer the benefits full time employees have."
good,worked at several locations in different regions and one thing is the same it is cut throat and what you can get away with.  Customer is not centered in experience bottom line is always driven and there is no room for error you will be replaced both legally and illegally.  I did enjoy some people that were struggling to get by they are very humble people to work with and for.  I learned how to manipulate any situation to meet the bottom line. best part of the day is when you go home.  there are no benefits for anyone working under a certain number of hours but yet won't give you the hours to be considered for these benefits.
good,"hours to long for part-time employee."
good,"never again would I apply at this specific location, horrible management. don't have their stuff together. lazy workers. rude as well"
good,Walmart work environment and management could of been better than what it was. Night stocking is not a good job during pregnancy.
good,there are times when they would not honour your availability and gives you schedule that doesn't work well with your other schedules.
good,"Management is less than great. The company is less concerned with their employees and more so with increasing profit. No union, so they can relieve you for less than reasonable reasons."
good,I feel like my time here was under valued. I loved my co-workers and our customers there. I was happy with the job because all of the skills I was able to obtain there.
good,"The managers always wanted more in less time, more for less. The hours were erratic and you could never have a good day at work due to customers harassing you."
good,"being talked down upon by management."
good,"Most managers were either to lazy or not present most of the day to help with anything. Work was physically, and at times, mentally  stressing, specially with customers. Management didn't know what they were doing half the time."
good,"Theres Not much to say about Walmart, pretty much self explanatory. Horrible hours for very little pay and alot of negatve attitude."
good,I did not like working here.  They would not work very well with my days off that I had to have for school.  If you had one mistake it was completely blown out of proportion and they did not schedule enough people for shifts needed.
good,"I would only recommend this job to someone who enjoys working for minimum wage. Someone who enjoys not having job security, benefits or having a chance to gain advancement in the work place."
good,Its walmart! The same way you are treated as a customer is the same way management treats their employees! You're taught patience and how to handle different situations with adults and kids.
good,"A typical day at work was busy with stocking shelves and answering customer inquiries. I learned a great deal in this position including cashiering skills, but also techical skills like measuring and cutting fabric, cutting keys in automotive, and mixing paint at the hardware counter."
good,a typical day is stressful. Management team doesn't know how to manage their store in a postive way. Enviroment is very negative.
good,"very dirty place to work.  they lie to you and dont care if your sick.  they over work people, like 9 days with no day off."
good,"The work is super easy, honestly I enjoyed working there. However the Walmart location I worked at had horrible management. It seemed that the dumbest workers were promoted or the laziest and least deserving were given the most hours. They would keep me in one area for months at a time until I really only knew that area while other areas had changed, and then flip flop me around to places that I wasn't even remotely familiar with and expect to have the job done in a ridiculous amount of time, or less. If you're looking at just the work itself, awesome job. Easy, kind of fun to be honest (if you like stocking shelves and making them look nice), and nighttime hours are my favorite. Co-workers weren't too bad, but 3rd shift will always have some really odd characters, working there and customer wise as well. The hardest part of the job, for myself, was dealing with BS managers. Everything else was gravy compared to them. It's a good job for a first job, really. I worked there a year before I couldn't deal with the drama anymore."
good,"meet and greet different customers, learn to stock different impulse buy items and make sure dates are in date, some of the co-workers are enjoyable to work with, management is unfair, and the most difficult part of the day is dealing with rude customers"
good,"I did not like working here. I dealt with the public all day and when situations would occur where the customer got out of hand, managment was  horrible at backing up their employees and making the public out to to look like the employee didn't know how to do their job. Most of my co-workers were lazy and unprofessional."
good,Many associates including upper management had a horrible work ethic as well as always wanting to take the easy way out of a situation regardless of how many rules were broken.
good,"They work you to death for what you get paid. They do however, work with you on your schedule."
good,"Productive, and fun and teamwork. Working at Wal-Mart has tought me so much. I have made new friends, and got promoted along the way."
good,Typical day was working long hours and dealing with customers. First job out of college and did not enjoy working for them. Left them to go work for Target
good,"I loved working with the all the different people. Getting to know their cultures and understanding how they live is interesting. Working in lawn and garden you have to learn the products and where they are, know prices, have a good appreciation for your customers and how to make them happy."
good,Place to get to know customer service and patience. Managerial is not a top managerial department.
good,"Fast paced, lots of customer service. the customer is always right."
good,Work area is nice and get to learn new things each and everyday.
good,"Typical days at work involved normal duties such as rounds for all of the restrooms in the facility, sweeping around the entire floor at least once per shift, very easy work. "
good,I worked there twice and both times it was horrible. They gave us a gallon of water with grass and bugs in it and wanted us to drink it if we got thristy from being out in the heat. The heat was fine it was the fact they couldn't clean out the cooler that held the water. Just because me and the other workers have a job that involves been out side dosen't mean we are trash. Out of all the jobs I think we had the hardest. I would have rather been inside working on helping people with their questions then having to be told how I was doing my job wrong by their security team and other workers that work inside.
good,A typical work day is busy. I learned many customer service and communication skills. I've learned to successfully fulfill people's different needs. Interacting with customers was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,stocking shelves and cleaning store... meeting new people and working wit others
good,"this company does not pay its Hard Working associates what they are worth! They pay little and are always having to hire new people because they don't hire for the most part Quality people nor do they pay their Quality people what they are worth. I was involved in the hiring process but had really no say so in who got a job or not, not that that mattered but I saw first hand what goes on at this company. The management makes fair to great money and that's where most of it stays. But they would not have to waste so much overhead if they would hire Quality at first and pay them right!"
good,"mi desempeño fue en el área de seguridad, el cual demandaba mucho de mi tiempo, impidiéndome en ese entonces desarrollar otras actividades de mi interés."
good,"The pay is good, but if you are not hired as full time employee, its not worth your time."
good,It seems like everyone is for themselves. I have only been there for a year and a half. So many attitudes and negativity that comes from most of the associates.
good,"I clock in, check my tasks to see where i am put. If i am up front cashiering then i cashier as well as clean all registers, sweep around the registers and zone all merchandise at registers. I separate the returns and take them to the designated area and put them up.  "
good,Collect carts from parking lot for customer use. Easy work.
good,"I love most of the people I work with and the job is nice because I get to work with people.  However,  the balance between work and family is severely lacking.  I have no set work schedule and my hours are all over the place, making it hard to raise two children."
good,loss prevention associate. I walked the sales floor looking for any suspicous behavior from employees or customers. more customers then any. But i catch people stealing product and stay with them until they left the store. I would stop them at the door and get the product back and take them into an office to get info from them. If they listen and follow all instruction without problem i would just get product and send them away depending on the amount. If not or amount was up there i would call the police to come write a ticket or take to jail.
good,Work days are long and stress full under staffed and under paid.  You learn how to manage your time to compensate for having such a large work load.
good,Not willing to work around college schedule. Notorious for scheduling a cashier to work until a late hour and return to work just 6-7 hours later.
good,Fiquei um período de 6 meses e não me adaptei com a rotina.Pois era muito puxada.
good,"A typical work day for me is stocking merchandise overnight, after complettion of stocking I face (zone) the products that were stocked previously through my shift. While working at this company Ive learned that nothing is easy hard work is always the answer to everything. I enjoy working with my co-workers, we have an un written rule to do our best at the job we are paid to do plus help each other upon any notice that help is needed. Respectfully the hardest part of my job is that no overtime is given, but the most enjoyable part of my job is that we daily work for one common goal, to do our jobs the best we can and enjoy each others company."
good,"I was hired in as temporary in March 2013, loved it at first, but then the hours started being cut horribly. I ended up getting whole weeks off and other coworkers were getting two weeks off at a time. Management was horrible also, no one listened to what you had to say. One assistant manager would tell you to do something and the other would get mad at you and tell you to do something else. One time I was very sick, but I thought I could make it through the day, I kept throwing up all over the store and in front of all the assistant managers. When I told them that I should go home, or actually to the hospital, they told me to sit down at the fitting room with a trash can and keep working my last two hours. I left anyway and when I called off the next day, because the hospital told me I had the stomach flu, my assistant manager actually asked me why I was calling off, even though she saw how sick I was the day before."
good,"I will not speak bad for any former employer, I will only say I was not happy there."
good,"If ran correctly and the problems, like poor management or too much micromanagement were eliminated the company would be able to make a lot more money. It is really hard to get people to hire onto a company even in a recession, when you know that you won't be paid to much and find out later that most of the benefits that are offered to you are slowly being taken away. "
good,This job is not suitable for families. Everyday is different and there is hardly any stability. you learn a great deal of patients working with the public. The hardest part is if you are a single parent because hours are so poor. The best part is the co-workers are typically nice.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me coming in and getting my skids of stuff out on the floor. An stocking the shelves, and zoning my isle and then either helping out other co workers or going to the backroom to clean up and help the manager. I learned how to deal with customers and to do retail. Management was great then. My co workers were okay to work with. The hardest part of my job was the stress. The most enjoyable part of my job was to get done with my isle and get to go home."
good,"I really liked working for this company as a whole, however the management staff was not as understanding and willing to help as they should have been."
good,"penny raises for tenured employees while new hires brought in at more than tenured employees making. no job security. company worried more about who is going to sue them next than taking care of their employees. harsh grating work environment. i.e. for a person who never minded 60-70 hr. work weeks on salary, it was tough putting in 30 here. The joy of a job well done didn't spark enough endorphins to get past the pain of ""no one wants to be here""."
good,you might get past your probationary period but to only be let go a month or 2 later.
good,"Was not any help to them in that particular department, would have been more useful in Electronics. "
good,"The WalMart that I worked at was pretty stressful. They were understaffed and the staff that they had was overworked. You would constantly be pulled to other areas of the store to work that area but you would get into trouble for not finishing your area. Customers would complain about the lack of help they would receive and for the most part they were right. Training is done by CBL's (Computer Based learning) which we are required to complete but when you first start working there, there is not really any hands on training...it's basically learn as you go. In my opinion management was the crux of the problem. I found that their was a big gap in communication when it came to what management wanted done and what the workers were able to do. Sometimes we would not be able to perform certain tasks because we did not have the proper equipment. It's not that the equipment wasn't there it's just that it was not always readily available or it did not work. The hardest part of the job for me was the demandingness of it. I had no problem with doing the work that I was required to do, but what I had a problem with was being told by a manager to go to another area and work that area without full knowledge and ability to work that area efficiently and then getting into trouble with my manager for not being able to complete tasks in my area. This is where the lack of communication and employees came in. M favorite part of working at Walmart was without a doubt working with my colleagues."
good,I really have nothing good to say about the company. The only positive thing was the people I worked with and customers putting a smile on their faces when I helped them out!
good,"This place is both dreadful to shop at AND work at. The customer service here is amazingly bad, and the management is even worse. There will be times when one person is scheduled to cover one or two areas on their own during the busiest times of the week. This leads to nothing getting done right, and customers getting angry because there is nobody around to help them."
good,A typical day at work for me was great and full of joy. I learned to provide great customer service at all times. The member of managements were social. My co- workers were marvelous. There wasn't a hard part of my job. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I knew I was assisting and helping customers.
good,"the management team was very unprofessional, when you talk to them about anything they never take you serious and treat you as a lower being."
good,"Working at the Service desk and Money Center which was dealing with returns and bill pay, I've learned that you can not handle all customers in the same manner. Patience does go a long way dealing with the public. Having support from management and co-workers is vital on any job and that is one of the things that I loved about working with Wal-Mart."
good,I had my fair share of time at Central Fill am i going back?? No
good,If you are considering walmart be ware. They promise you advancement but only for cart pushers and door greaters
good,I would complete work orders. I learned how corrupt a large corporation can get from a great beginnings. Management does not follow corporate rules set in place for the safety of all just to make a profit at store level. Most co-workers are there only because they cannot find a good job. The hardest part of the job is the lack of moral and ethical values forced on the employee with threat of job loss.
good,You are not recognized for the above exceptional work performed.
good,It is want it sounds like. Its walmart not whole lot of advancement there.
good,"Clean your area get yelled at by shoppers and called names smile, and keep working. management ignores you till its time for your review and you never quite measure up. Best part was when i went home"
good,My review is that Walmart have to stop. My hours was changing from full time to part time and then 5 days to 2 days a week.
good,"A typical day at Walmart is stressful beyond belief and it wasn't the customers, but I have learned that every job you work isn't meant to be a career and that's Walmart. The management needs a lot of work I suggested for them to have management workshops to better there managers they have but they thought i was just being a complainer. My co-workers the ones I worked with on a daily are the best even though some of them don't always do there work. the hardest part of my job was to stand there and let someone talk to me like I just graduated from kindergarten. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customer I met throughout the day and clocking out and going home."
good,cansativo
good,"I assisted customers in the fitting room and to find what they were looking for. I also maintained the sales floor, restocked the displays."
good,"I was happy to have a job at Wal*Mart because a job is a job. But when I was hit by a car when riding my bike home, and the doctor's gave me a note stating I could work after 3 days of rest (nothing was broken, just sprained). They immediately laid me off, then treated me very poorly when I went to pick up my final paycheck."
good,"At first I liked working there but the overnight shift conflicted with my home life and I feel for the type of work we did we should be getting paid more. The work for the most part was mostly easy I felt like I was getting paid to workout(if you will). Most of the management were very friendly except for 2 people,one manager told me told me that I need to put walmart before my 1 year old daughter who has had 4 open heart surgeries and went into cardiac arrest once. After that I just felt like this isn't the place for me anymore. I did however love the fact that I wasn't micromanaged and I had the freedom to just do my job because I'm a self motivated person."
good,Stocking groceries isn't that bad... I've learned to pay attention to the dates of things when i go grocery shopping. Management was a great team co-workers were civil and ovearll it was a great experience.
good,"I worked many types of positions and can't say that even once was I given a positive feedback, well not until I stated I was planning to find a new job. I learned that I do not enjoy corporate jobs. I would rather work for a ma and pa shop then corporations. Co-workers are very friendly. The hardest part of the job was keeping a positive outlook when there is no positivity given. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,"Santa fe springs walmart is so unorganized including the employees, terrible experience."
good,An okay place to work not good pay though Very busy cold and stressful
good,"A typical day at Walmart was a non stop rush of customers. We would pass the time by joking around and picking on each other until the managers decided that we couldn't even laugh while we were on our registers, Four of us got into trouble for laughing. Days like that makes you not want to even go to work there."
good,"Por ser uma empresa do ramo varejista de grande porte, ela nos envolve em todos os aspectos. Ela torna nosso dia de trabalho bastante atarefado. Deixando você com pouco tempo para aprender"
good,"At Wal-Mart you are there to help in any way possible, as a cashier I met many new people on a daily basis. some people still recognize me as a cashier! The work environment was great, but when managment was having issues a good day usually went bad. My co-workers were lovely and outgoing and made my time there enjoyable I still keep in touch with them. The hardest part of the job was pleasing the managers. If they were having a bad day they wouldn't always get to you if you needed help or had a question. The expected you to figure it out on your own. I only had two hours of on register training before being thrown on and expected to run things alone. I am a fast learner so I did fine, but not everyone is like that. The most enjoyable part of working there was meeting the people who came through my line and meeting co-workers even some new friends!"
good,"Mostly challenging, customers were great to help, moving around was great for exercise, overall it was great to create friendships"
good,didn't mind working there except for people that came in the store and were rude.
good,"Out of most jobs I've had, Walmart is probably my least favorite. When I worked there, they did offer medical, vision, and dental insurance to their employees. However, as with most retail, advancement was difficult. Plus, compensation was not that great. Of course, my store manager at the time was nice."
good,Redmodel crew and they cared to much about money then workers
good,Lots of work
good,"Well work is good, but management is poor. They are ill educated and don't know about half the electronics or how they operate."
good,The boss put alot of people down and did not like First Nations
good,I really didn't like Walmart they only cared about themselves always working and only one day off and worked on holidays just no family time
good,employees were not appriciated and felt uncomftorable there
good,The company has lost it's luster after the death of Sam Walton. They care for their emplyees. There is no health or dental coverage. Raises or overtime is unheard of. The treatment of their employees is an outrage!
good,"My co-workers are very friendly and helpful. It is difficult to manage time however working several different shifts with no regularity. The management is very busy and it seems that they are on overload, therefore making it difficult to have trade requests approved, etc. The hardest part of the job is knowing that it will not lead to full-time and knowing that the benefits aren't reallly there for health and dental/vision, or they are unaffordable to the average worker. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with customers on a daily basis and helping others."
good,It was over the holidays and it was really fun and exciting to talk to customers and their children on what their plans were for the holiday.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was very stressful. The majority of the employees were not treated fairly. They would rather hire outsider for positions instead of giving the employees the chance to advance. My co-worker were great they made a lot of days go by quickly. Management, they looked down on the employees. I love my job as far as all the other thing. The job was very easy."
good,Most enjoyable part was that I learned import and export of a large factory. So much going on in the store that you were unable to identify management. And it was completely unorganized.
good,Employees are overlooked & at times a hard working employee is responsible for picking up the slack of the less motivated employees who probably make more hourly.
good,Not the best company to grow with the hours are hectice and your own probation for 90 days as a part time associate and then after that there is still no guarantee for advancement.
good,Disliked working for this company after 5 months from the stress that managers push onto entry level employees.
good,"it was a wonderfull job loved working there , they just was not as helpfull as they say when i needed there help they was not there but i was allways there when they needed me"
good,i really like the work i was doing and my coworkers and some managers that pertained to me
good,"Maybe I’m just a whiny kid , I am 20 but this Walmart does nothing but complain about you dress , look , & act . If you’re working front end , the CSMs & managers get attitudes because you have to use the restroom . They expect you to hold your bladder for 2 hours or so . The store manager is great , probably the nicest I’ve worked with . The garden center people are beyond rude & racist ."
good,"If, your planning to work for a Walmart Distribution Center don't count on them working with your school schedule, just apply for weekends or graveyard shift."
good,"Management there is such a joke. I went through at least 3 managers on my time there. You are supposed to be able to accumulate up to 6 points before you are terminated but they only give you 5. If you are only supposed to half a point, they give you a full point and don't bother fixing their mistake in which case employees are getting terminated because management will not correct the issue."
good,"System engineer is probably like system engineer at other companies. You receive requirements, are assigned coding tasks or support tasks on an agile board, and you fulfill those tasks by code or other ways. Your project may be small or very large. Technology is usually split by what your area does. So you may be a part of Supply Chain or Store systems, etc. Those teams are grouped together as they are similar. The hardest part of the job is the red tape as a large company is very bloated. Your daily tasks may require multiple hoops to jump through to get work done. There will be constant barriers for you to be able to do your job, and with each passing year, there will be even more red tape until you want to scream. The common phrase at Walmart is going ditch to ditch. Like they will do something and that puts everyone in the metaphorical ""ditch"", then they change it and it goes into another ditch the opposite way. Walmart wants development to be agile, but prepare yourself for resistance to be able to be agile, if you ever would be. Tech at Walmart also implemented a bell curve in evaluations. This means if you had a good year, but everyone else on your team is perceived as having a better year, you will not receive a raise and will be deemed as development needed. This has created an environment of nitpicking and finding reasons not to promote, and not to give you a raise. Even if your technical skills are fantastic, your programming and code is amazing, one teeny tiny detail of your year may ruin your whole evaluation. The best part of the job is you usually have a direct"
good,All management cares about is everything getting stocked. Even if they over order products that can't be placed anywhere - even if you are understaffed.
good,Poor Management.they took store work more en portent than there customers. or the well being of there employees. the management would tell you one thing and do the complete openest.
good,Management is horrible. Treat workers as though their slaves and always using individuals although their there to work they treat them horribly on and off the clock
good,"In a normal day for me at Walmart, in the mornings we would down-stack pallets and put the items onto carts and then go stock the dairy area. After that we’d either stock picks or do top stock all day."
good,"The job itself isn't terrible, just super repetitive. The management isn't the best by any means. Just seems like your a number and not really important to them."
good,"Boa empresa, porém deveria valorizar mais seus funcionários."
good,As for the company over view iui f performance and professionalism there not up to code. I look f ok reward to advancing b showing my skills in the quality ic my job.
good,"Starting this job was a blast and then as I continued to work there not only did it get worse the managers starting picking favorites and let people get away with almost anything, from stealing to taking 4 hour breaks while on the clock."
good,Was productive and you stay busy but I felt like I couldn't trust anyone. Always get pushed to do more work than what you can do. Management has their favorites and they can be very rude.
good,A typical day as a salesfloor at Walmart involves interaction with people and opportunities to learn and grow with the on-hand task given by a manager.
good,"Walmart is an ok company to work for there were many issues addressed to management and no action was ever taken or never got back to an assoicate with an answer,"
good,"there was no set schedule ,manager always fighting, and never received raises that where promised ,I also had a set schedule once working there to have it thrown into the wind in the first week because of self check outs being built cutting peoples hours that have worked there for years, I  loved my fellow employees but overall the management and system of doing work was chaotic."
good,Pessoas boas gentis ótimo ambiente .. carga horária favorável na semana ..mas passado no final de semana
good,Management is OK. I like how the position is stable. Pay should be higher though because you deal with a lot of situations. Overall a good place to work at though.
good,"Lack of communication, no training, crew of about 20 and Maybe 5 actually work."
good,"Although I enjoyed interacting with the public, the work environment here was unprofessional. The managers don't communicate with the employees about required assignments. There is little to no respect for one another. It isn't the first place I would consider to apply to in order to be employed."
good,No accountability for the management team or cap team. Good place to work if you just wanna work. Not a place to move up. Fast pace and good for hardworkers
good,"At first I was excited to work there. Then I realized for an overnight job why do they need 4 managers on duty? No one manager agrees with the other, its nonsense and constant confusion. Mediocre co workers make the experience bad. No one truly cares about their job at hand. The managers get by doing the bare minimum. Awful salary doesn't help."
good,I no longer work there but It's a good job to start working. I didn't like the long hrs because when I work I had to do other people work. To many people who don't do their job and the supervisor did nothing.
good,clear understanding on how to do my job properly. constantly maintain the back room an sales floor integrity . generally a good place to shop.constantly busy
good,"The store is not bad, it's just open way too late for my taste. There are some really nice people I worked with, but they scheduling situations are ridiculous.  They never have enough people to work, so you become overloaded. For what they pay, the work is not worth it."
good,Didn't want to be there long because I knew it was a temporary job. The people were ok for the most part but got harassed by one of the girls. Often wanted people to work overtime but then management got upset people were constantly going over 40 hours a week.
good,They person they paired me with for training was a very difficult person and unwilling to give me insight to my duties. They even told me she was not well like by co-workers.
good,The job itself was not bad... But the management isnt all that great and there feels like no room for advancement. And if you have any serious life event happen it comes off your sick days they make no exceptions.
good,"I worked there for three years , it was decent the coworkers were nice (mostly) and became a family to me the only things I would change would be the upper management they mostly don’t care about you and you are just a number, and I can’t begin to tell you how condescending the store manager was the corporation pays associates so little to be verbally abused daily and to clean up after customers who have no common decency . At times that place made me question my sanity it’s ok to work for them for a little but get out at the first opportunity or else you’re trapped!!"
good,I loved the people but the company itself was horrible no hours no real benefits for me or my family and the management didn’t really care as long as they got their hours and pay.
good,Walmart is not for people who need someone to care they are all about finding your replacement they hire simply because you have 2 hands and demand you know it in days time
good,"I've worked at 2 Walmarts and both have had terrible leadership. Most of them only dictate and never lead by example. If you want a promotion, good luck. I was under a terrible Dept. Manager and they refused to replace him just because he'd been there for 3 years and overlooking how lazy he was."
good,A typical day at my Job is stressful only because the management is not as good as i thought they would be. They are more focus on what you have going on in your personal life then the actual Job and at times the fired people just because of what they have going on in there personal life even if its a health condition
good,"This was an ok place for my first job, but didn't give much opportunity to advance or grow as an employee. Management seemed to give mixed instruction. If they all were on the same page then the instructions would be more beneficial."
good,While working at Walmart I learned how too place things in neat fashionably order. As far as the workplace culture Walmart is a very busy place. The hardest part about the job i would say is... Having too stock the shelves in such a busy environment while trying to worry about staying out of the customers way. The most enjoyable thing about this job was you got to be independent and do your own thing therefore you get to focus more.
good,"The truth of it. Wal-Mart is a corporate that only cares about the company while making it look like they care about employees. When I worked there, we had openings in my department for full time. The managers were told no more full time because they want less hours, less employees, more work. They expect one employee to do work that is required of 2 people and lower hours if you can’t make the impossible happen. Hourly start up is 11.00/hour which sounds amazing until you realize after a month, your hours are dropping because they are trying to save on labor costs. They expect you to know and do every thing your manager does, but won’t pay you those wages. Try to step up the ladder. It’s all about who you know there. You don’t step up unless a friend of yours is one already. Used to have these managers on Facebook and most of the department managers hung out in personal life. I was pregnant while working there’re and the assistant manager to the store told me that if I couldn’t lift more than 15 lbs needed to find another job because Wal-Mart does not accommodate and I am not disabled. They had no care for the life growing inside of me an expected me to lift boxes well over 50 lbs. I have seen managers give themselves extra discounts or mark down items that should not have been so they wouldn’t have to pay full price. They always find a scapegoat to take the fall. I have seen this a few times. The store manager will never act unless whatever deed accused can be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. So make sure your video on your phones are working people! Without that, no matter"
good,Started as a great company but with all the up coming changes it's hurting the associate. It's a Walmart on almost every corner. They're not family oriented. They will match your 401.have a company stock program.
good,The benefits make working with them ok. Very political and must have thick skin in order to move up the company ladder. Overall good starter job but that's it.
good,It's bad when your a customer and even you know that their employees don't want to be there. The best part about it is that's true. Most employees don't want to be there. The only reason I worked for Walmart was because my mother was pestering me about getting a job.
good,If your looking for a summertime job to get you into the work force than sure great but anything long tern forget it . This job doesn't pay well and there is little to no benifits .
good,Wal-Mart is a very inspiring place to work for. Only if the management is on the same page. But when you have a store manager that's not in the store at times and the employees are getting falsely accused of bad inventory. I believe to have a successful business it must start with a team of successful management.
good,"bad management, lack of communication with employees and management, High Theft, Verbal abuse constantly from other employees and customers. Chics,  Do not  work at Walmart ."
good,Good place to work.. Location needs more good ppl that are willing to treat you as equals. Management doesn't have the same friendly and welcoming demeanor as in the beginning years.
good,"Walmart has changed dramatically. They are more interested in watching cashiers from overhead cameras for mistakes than they are at stopping thieves. Formal admonishment is given for one mis-scanned item yet no thanks is given for loss prevention of multiple items. Scheduling is ridiculous i.e. work till 11 p.m. (or later) and then be expected back the next day at 7 a.m. (or earlier). They have gone from appreciating and taking care to keep good and reliable employees to forcing them out with poor scheduling and very poor bonuses. Your weekly schedule may vary from 6 hours to possibly 30 if they decide to show favor on you. Keeping customers happy as they have to wait relatively long periods of time for assistance in the fragrance, jewelry, fabric, locked liquor/tobacco departments as well as having to wait for managers at registers for transaction approvals. Some managers are rude and outright nasty in the way that they speak with or even ignore employee questions. Very sad, which is why I am seeking more stable employment. Certainly not what Sam entrusted to Doug."
good,"Empresa muito boa de trabalhar ,sempre deixando os funcionários satisfeito"
good,"Walmart is to this day the one place I look back on and cringe at the memory of working there. The customers treated the employees awful, and management treated the employees even worse."
good,one boss was more than ready to fire you just for being sick got along great with other bosses all but one co worker i got a long just fine i love moving around the store keeping busy but when you hurt so bad from standing still all night in one location if you dare to sit down or lean a stool they will fire you
good,They don’t appreciate anything you do. They put in a position to fail. Training is not what they make it out to be.They expect you to work no matter if your sick or not.
good,I was at Walmart for 5 years at Fairview n before I ever got a promotion all eyes were on me doing jobs above my pay grade then I got promoted n o started doing way more than my pay grade should do I was constantly left to hang out to dry with no help from people above me or given information it was here's some paperwork get all this done n in the office everyone went while I was running ever where doing way 2 many things at once
good,Stressful environments managcared more about profits than employees always took customers side on a problemtime off ompossible to get very stressful woek
good,"I was a cashier for about 2 years, and the only thing about walmart is they are constantly trying to find things wrong that you do. I was even wrongfully terminated, because a had to have 6 month off due to back surgery, and they caused that because I was told I had to lift heavy things at the register...."
good,"My coworkers were nice and sometimes they were like family, but... Overnight is really stressful. I was hired along with another person for the same shift and department and neither of us started working in that department. "
good,"I got along with my team. Management was okay, some was better then others. The schedule sucks and doesnt work around your family life. The discount card and pay was great!!"
good,Your coworkers are wonderful people. Management feels that you should be able to change your life for them to work on days off or change hours but when you need that changed its a business and you need to work your schedule. When they give you 36 hours one week then 20 hours then they will give you as little as 8 hours for a week.
good,Tienen un pésimo sistema para rolar turnos y las oportunidades de crecimiento son de 0. El personal con el que trabajas es muy agradable y amable.
good,"My coworkers were the best, and you get paid decently for the tasks. I loved helping the customers and the actual job but most managers are very rude and disrespectful."
good,Very hard work and there is point system. Benefits are pretty good but it was getting hard to work there. All associates and supervisor's were getting pushed way too hard for too much for us to handle.
good,"Walmart is a fast paced, good benefits, no set hour shifts,could work"
good,"There was some things that I liked about working at Walmart. There were a lot of workers that I liked working with. The hours where ok, but the physical aspects of the job were bad."
good,I learned alot from Walmart. I have been there for almost 9 years. I learned how to be in management. I learned so many different things. I learned how to talk to people and work with people and deal with very stressful not so easy customers.
good,I worked in the bakery there at Walmart. I loved my job because I loved to bake. The people I worked with were amazing. the hardest park of the job was getting to work for 4am. I enjoyed doing the baking and helping customers. the management when I was there the one that ran the business was rude and she didn't care about her employees.
good,The company don't care about the employees. If you are injured on the job Walmart try their best not to pay you for time off due to job related injuries. There is a point system that is used. God forbid if you get sick at this company. It won't excuse your absence when your doctor say that you are to sick to work. Management have the option to approve your absence but they don't.
good,"It is a good starting job but I wanted advancement, but it was hard in this particular store if you weren’t part of the friendships .  I work hard but that’s not the only thing they want they are very click oriented"
good,"Terrible service, they dont work with employees.they have very little to no security so things get stolen all the time. Terrible place to work. Dont recommend it"
good,Only interested in sales. Have to ask for breaks. Never given on time. Walmart use to be about family . No longer the case. Most associates work not for the enjoyment of working for Walmart only because they need a job. Could be more caring about families with children around the holidays.
good,"I found that the Walmart location that I worked at did not make for a great work environment, as I felt undervalued as an employee, many times you were expected to cover a number of departments due to not enough people being scheduled for certain times of the day, as a result your work in another area would suffer and you would be questioned about why you didn't get your assigned work completed."
good,Many years of working for them and nothing to show for it you give this company your all but they won’t move you up there is no career advancement here
good,So I've been at Walmart for about 4 months. They don't really put a lot of emphasis in training they train you a lot up on the computer and expect you to be fast with I'm putting product at up on the sales floor I'm overnight stocker is very intense the managers some of the people that been there for alone time most are nice but that's a few that are not nice. I've been in retail for almost 18 years I've never seen people be so not approachable. Corporate is always at this training so it's a train store you would expect that it will be more about making sure that you are prepared and that you know the right way to stock the store correctly. I wouldn't recommend Walmart cuz I've been seeing a lot of people being leaving my good friend that her foot ran over by the manager the manager did not rush her to the hospital like a manager should or had one of her assistants do it it was just terrible I don't recommend anyone to work at Walmart unless you really have to. Don't waste your time and don't waste your time at this store in Lakewood.
good,Not enough hours poor communication .. poor timing on when the task should be finished . Managers don’t know how to communicate with the employees.. don’t give out enough hours
good,A typical day at work would be me clocking in and proceeding to the cashier manager to see what area I would be places in that day. I learned a lot of patience with Walmart because the long lines and sometimes unsatisfied customers. The workplace culture was sometimes fun but everybody was really focused on doing their jobs.
good,The job at Walmart was not bad but they gave you the impression that if your name is on the list after the winter a rush that you would be guaranteed a full-time position with Walmart that is not true they pick and choose their favorites and let everyone else go no explanation behind it.
good,A lot of slipseating and lack of respect for the drivers. corporate trying to stop the bleeding from Amazon and Dollar General stores but its too late. Making it hard on the people low on the totem pole just so the folks living high on the hog can continue to do so.
good,"fast paced work place, must be very patient, problem solving skills are a must. leadership very necessary. quick to think slow to react. flexible schedule"
good,It an ok places to work if I would of work a longer time. I liked the nice customers not the rude ones I was not aloud to count the register drawer that was there palace I am old school wear you count at the start of your shift and at the end of you shift.
good,"Walmart May overwhelm some people, but the do offer flexiable scheduling and PTO. The management team there is not the best, some are actually disrespectful and can make you feel down about yourself."
good,aprendí a trabajar bajo presión y la atención a cliente mas eficaz
good,"It was a hostile environment sometimes. And it was very upsetting how managers didn't care about other employees slacking off, there wasnt any consistency with managers sometimes they cared sometimes not. If I wasnt paid so well I would have went somewhere else. But health issues came up so I had to leave regardless."
good,Nothing is the same. From store to store and even manager to manager. New hires make more then the valued long term associates. They want long term associates to quit.
good,"only a select few  do their job..if you are a favorite, you do not have to do the work as well.  When you go to management regarding problems, nothing changes.  Now that they have ""scan and go""  Comsumers complain regarding no chasiers are available to check them out."
good,"My work experience would have been fine at wal-mart, however, management can make or break a job for you and in my case, it made my job a lot harder than anything else"
good,"I know some of my issues are with my stores specifically, but much of what I heard around the overnight ASM role from a number of stores is that it is the role that gets abused more often than others. Supposed to have a fixed schedule of 4 on, 3 off, 12 hr days. In reality it is more like 4 to 5 on and 14 hour days. O/N also receives 4 fewer PTO days than day shift managers because they are supposed to work fewer hours each week, which is not the case. Salaried is also paid about 20% less than a similar narional retailer."
good,"Job is ok for a starter, but management doesn't treat their workers right. Workers are constantly talked down upon, CSMs get away with it if there's nobody around. Now that they don't have a Zone Manager to talk to them, they get away with anything and everything. "
good,"Its a great place too work for if you need a job, but after awhile working there you realize that none if the managers are on the same page and all employees will be thrown under the bus for things other managers do/allow. It's a hostile and stressful work environment, but they will hire anyone scouts a good rough way too get back on your feet."
good,Needs quite a bit of improvements in the assistant manager level and up skills. Good starter job. Not a place for some to decide to move up in the company. At least at the place I was at.
good,"Alot of issues, alot of drama, managment treats that place like its a fair ground, its who you do and who you know in order to move up in ranks. And alot of favoritism..no matter how hard you work it doesnt matter."
good,"I worked third shift stocking shelves. Most of the managers on third were fun to work with. While there, I also learned to run the register and sort merchandise in the backroom. I asked management if I could learn new skills, they never asked me. I enjoyed working in the backroom. The pay is low (I've heard they've increased their wages though) which is long over due. I worked hard and always got my department done. They will try to work you to death even if you're pregnant. For a large company, you'd think they'd offer better benefits to their employees. I would not want to start a career at walmart."
good,Very little hours! Starting pay is ok but sometimes you only work 16hours a week. But management who are on salary work 12-15hr shifts. Would recommend ONLY if your looking for a little extra money on the side.
good,"I worked at Walmart for 4 years. It was not quite that pleasant. I was consistently harassed by disgruntled, entitled customers. The managers would find something on the ground and walk half way across the building and force you to leave the work you were doing to pick it up, instead of bending down and picking it up them selves."
good,"My overall experience with the job was positive, but I do not agree with many of the company's beliefs and values. "
good,Wal-Mart is a good place to go as far as salary because other jobs pay less but they are over worked and under staffed.The reasons I left is because of the poor management and the way it was ran.
good,The management down plays the workers. It’s like they don’t want you to succeed. They make it hard to want to work there. The way the treat the department mangers and assistant managers is horrible.
good,"It was good for getting back on  my feet after not having a job, but it was not the greatest place to work. Attendance policy is super strict and they only allow 4 absences for any reason in a rolling 6 month period. Also, they don't accept doctors notes."
good,overall wasn't a bad experience all the people were great  but for the most part overworked and nothing paid off in the end unless you are a full time associate you will never get the money or time here
good,no possibility for full time and they dont honor your availability even after hired. i am rehireable but they wont call e even after i reapplied stating i could work evenings and weekends because i am moving to washington iowa my husband works there as a greeter.
good,"Wal-Mart Pharmacy was a very fast pace area of the store to work in. Plenty of work that to keep a person busy.  There were definitely favorites that the management had and it showed.  The associates that had more knowledge and long term employment with the company was expected to do the bulk of the work, while those that were the favorites were allowed to just stand and talk, laugh and goof around with the managers.  I did enjoy the data entry part of the job as well as the interacting with the insurance companies and the doctor offices."
good,"The pay is great, but the hours aren't that good, only if you're on the full-time schedule. The hours are all over the place but you always get two paid 15 minute breaks and one unpaid 1hr lunch, but only if you're full time. They offer benefits but under certain circumstances. Management is usually rude, and they never listen to the employees. They're always pushing on credit card applications, even if the applicant gets denied. If you really don't want a social life this is the best place to work."
good,The work flow was well organized. The work hours was fair most of the time. The vacation time off was not very well  satisfactory. A lot of times ; the time off was denied.
good,The company has changed a lot and it’s hard for someone with no help paying bills and rent alone to make it. If you not a manger then don’t expect good pay because will cut your hours.
good,Job searching on this site and I'm trying to complete a resume to apply for a new job and I can not continue due to all of the mandatory surveys.  I do not have time for this.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was great when I started working there, but over the years, the job experience was not great. Typically my day working their was working as a cashier. After my two years anniversary, management moved me around the store to stock and zone departments, be the overhead operator for phone or department calls, and be Secondary at the Customer Service desk. Before the last year I left Wal-Mart, I was working at the Vision Center as an Optician. I was helping customers choosing glasses or contacts for their vision prescriptions. I left their because lack of training from the other associates and manager. I went to back to cashier. I left of Wal-Mart because of management because they never appreciate their employees. They only appreciate their ""favorite"" employees who work hard. If they would of appreciate me more, then I would of stayed."
good,"Loved the co workers. Management is uncaring. To afraid to give thier own orders. Make the little people do the dirty work. Favoritism is RIDICULOUS.! But pay is good. Benefits offered but are not that great. If you dont go to make friends,  keep to yourself and do your job, take care of customer its good"
good,It allowed me to move up and make the most amount of money I’ve made personally in my life. After hitting the hourly supervisor level you realize ethics do not get followed correctly and shady practice end up getting rid of long running associates like myself.
good,"Management has no regard for employee family commitments. "
good,"I was let go from my position which was a cashier and a grocery clerk to reach 40 hours per week to pay my bills. On November 27th 2018, human resource notified the Supervisor of Cashiers upfront. The policy states that once 9 points are reached, you will be let go from your position. I only had 7 points. I think it was unfair, and they didn't like the fact that I worked in another department. I am sure there were complaints."
good,"Good first local job but don’t let yourself get stuck here . Your co-workers are the only reason so many people stick around. Customers are that bad most a generally kind, but management wants to stick you any chance they can"
good,"a great experience but very demanding enviroment, depending on where you live it may not be Canadian born friendly. need more consideration of white and black associates not just indian"
good,"The job was fun until we got new management. We got new department managers and a new store manager who is just about the rudest man alive. The only bad thing about Walmart is it’s terrible management, they don’t know how to treat people as human beings. I don’t recommend working at any of the locations, expecially location #4286."
good,management was ok but they seem to think its ok to hire people that are lazy and don't like to clean at the end of the night also management did not do a thing when was made aware of the lazy co worker
good,"The company has changed over the years, it is a shame.  Very few of the management team appreciate what the workers do.  The hardest part of my job was having to cover two or three areas of the store in a night, and then being in a rush to finish my original department; however I always completed my tasks."
good,Management walk around doing nothing you ask for something like can you approve vacation time they say they will get back to you and they don't and vacation will not be approve until the day of or before that's lazy.
good,Poor management sometimes stressfull. Hard to move up and will screw you out of a raise. Good luck when you need to go to the doctor Wal-Mart can make it difficult to get your day approved. Only good thing was the quarterly bonus which only good stores get.
good,"Management is a joke, to move up in the company you have to have your head so far up upper managements rump otherwise your not even considered. Worked there 10 years and was let go just like that."
good,If you're in dire need of a job Walmart has you covered. But you must stay on top of your actions and answers because very easily you can be thrown into something you'd thought you wouldn't experience. coming from a place they call family.
good,At times it can be an pleasant environment depending which managers are there during your shift. There is a lot of unfair promotions. Managers allow customers to belittle you even when the customers are very hostile both physically and verbally.
good,It’s Okay working at Walmart only thing is the hours . You never get time to spend with family. I love working with people getting to talk to everyone.
good,"Managers expected me to know everything, got no training and got yelled at when i was unaware of what to do. Managers showed no concern for  the employees"
good,"I was a cashier at Wal-Mart Super center open 24/7.  I had a mix of day  and night  shifts when I first started working  there . Then I was being scheduled  all late shifts until midnight at first, then 12:30 Am or1:00 Am. Every shift. The ongoing hours ,wasn't good for my health  or family."
good,They do not care about their employees and they let you know that you are easily replaceable. Or they may just eliminate your position on short notice.
good,"While I was working at my store location, I loved a lot of my fellow cashiers and some of the sale associates, but the store management was rude a lot of the time. Everytime I went to talk to them it was like they didn't want to hear what I saw saying. Luckily, you dont typically have to deal with store management as much."
good,"Recent changes to company policy such as no paid holiday time,any desired holiday pay is deducted from accrued personal time and no longer excepting doctor's notes for time out due to illness. Some stores managed well,my current store ruined by poor management and favoritism."
good,The main issue I have with the company is that it believes that you should only have loyalty to them and people can survive on minimal hours. A full time hours are from 28 to 37.5 hours. and the pay rate does not measure up. Unless you are independently wealthy I do not think most people can survive on this. The scheduling of hours makes it almost impossible to maintain a second job.  The management only concern is not that of their employees but that of their bonuses.  Cut hours so our bonuses go up is the management mind set.
good,my manager always had a terrible attitude. she picked favorites and always treated her employees like trash never helped with the bullying when she was notified about it. Harassment is obviously aloud here.
good,"Offloading trucks and sectioning off merchandises into sections. Taking pallets to respective location and placing merchandises on shelves. Learnt how to read and place merchandises according to bar codes, and how to pic items to be brought out. management was boring, always demanding, and wanted everything to be put out although there was no space for it on the shelves. workplace culture is that most people kept to themselves. hardest part of the job was getting through the day. no part of the job was enjoyable."
good,"I would unload trucks, stock merchandise to the floor and help my customers find what they needed. I would take merchandise that did not go on the shelf back to the backroom."
good,No set schedule. You could work 6 days and only have 1 day off. Management was incompetent. you were at the mercy of the store manager. Not much for training unless you found a computer.
good,Not much on the job training. Very easy to change departments moving your  way up with the company. If you are full time and by there stock the put in what you put in.
good,"When you are scheduled to work, it is a repetitive work schedule.  Doing the same things each day. You are paid fairly well, but the hours are not fixed. You can have 40 one week and 8 the next."
good,"If you need a job and cannot find one, go to Walmart.  The cashier associates were rude, therefore most of the customers were rude as well.  Having a minimum of an Associate's Degree will allow you to advance to lower level management positions eventually.  Department managers were high turnover positions."
good,Na have nothing to say it has it goods and bads mangers dont report what they should ifu r ahard working person u will be doing all the work yourself I know
good,"Walmart use to be a great company to work. I loved coming to work and although everyone has to be open to change, not all was good change the work load was at best very overwelming, to the point going to work became dreadful, they have policies in place, but only follow them when it helped them ( higher management ), lots of favoritism. This company is based on respect for the individual but rarely follow that."
good,"Walmart is really a great place to work. It teaches you a lot, you just have to be wiling to learn, A typical day at walmart is just like any other job it's all on how you want it to go. I have learned to run the layaway department, electronics, hoe to stock shelves,etc I loved walmart, I just didnt like the new store manager."
good,"Walmart only cares about workers who are middle-management and up.  They protect them and prioritize their needs, while stepping on the heads of their labor backbone, the entry level workers.  Thus, morale is always abysmal."
good,The job wasnt hard but it was like i was working 24/7. Plus some of the other employees were lazy and it made it hard to get things done on time. Pleasant managers.
good,"The customers are usually rude, however there are days that can be very well and some days that can be very bad and all in all it is a job that fluctuates between good and bad"
good,"There are so many sticky policies walmart has in place just to be able to fire you, it's not worth the recent 11/hr increase. The absence policy, the write up policy, and the medical policy (no hospital or doctor's notes accepted), all spell disaster for a new employee."
good,"I have been with Walmart on and off for 7 years, and have continually returned because I knew it was an easy job to get that would not be minimum wage. Before the recent restructure of Walmart's management and positions, I would tell anyone who asked or who was in need of a job to apply, because it wasn't a bad job day to day, but since my respect and dedication to the company has completely diminished. Walmart has demoted thousands by liquidating positions, forcing many who already live check to check to take a pay cut. Several associates were forced to even search for a new job because of the changes. Those who remained were the privileged favorites hand-picked without interviewing of the store manager and market manager, and those who were left to break our backs forced to work harder and harder than the day before. If you have no hopes to move up and work harder and harder due to being shorthanded and not having the equipment to do your job, then this isn't a bad job. But if you have ambition, ideas, or integrity, this is not the job you want."
good,"Work environment is pleasant and sometime complicated to work. Management support is good and consist, All supplies for work are present. However there are little to no incentives in place to encourage the staff."
good,How to do things in an orderly fashion. and feel a sense of accomplishment on a job well done. Working with others to establish a sense of team work. And quality treatment of our customers.
good,It is a challenging place to work that does provide advancement opportunities.  But there is little work life balance and management doesn't always care about the associates
good,"Typically I would clock in, get insulted by my own manager, be held up on my task over unimportant ""meetings"" and then get chewed out for not getting it done on time. There are plenty of negatives about this place but one upside is, being my first job, it taught me to work in a very fast paced environment and work as a team as if we were one unit. The management are dreadfully bad. They would choose favorites as far as workers and no matter how hard you work, if you don't pander to them you will be ignored. Not to mention gossip travels and almost none of it is true. The hardest part of the job is really getting your job done. The management put a ridiculous amount of tasks and pressure on your shoulders and expect you to get it done with the roadblocks they put in your way. The most and only enjoyable part of the job are the coworkers. They are really the only reason the job is bearable."
good,"Walmart has a reputation for a reason, and its fairly accurate. The work has potential for advancement, but your hard work does not guarantee anything"
good,They have the job come first and family second at that store I worked there for 2months and got injerd 2 times because of there falty equipment and the managers are very rude and disrespectful
good,"Loved the people I worked with but i went through some crazy stuff once I became manager after 6 months of frozen dairy"
good,Normal day at work was staying busy.  I learned nothing. I already understood the job I had. Management no response. The culture at work was okay. There was no hardest of the job itself. I went to work and went home was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"walmart took away sick pay benefit, discontinued holiday pay, cut raises in half, and changed work schedules to 4 am shifts. no work life balance. Uncaring corporate management."
good,"Cap 2 associates are saddled with rushed timelines and too few people to get the job done properly, on top of managers/supervisors that like to micro-manage and not work, only to disappear when needed."
good,"I was being pushed out from the start until an amazing pharmacy manager took me in. He has helped me get my license and helped me be a better person. It was going well until I lost my insurance due to me becoming 26 years old. I worked so hard to get full time only to get told they couldn't work with me. They hired two new techs, told me that they had no more hours and couldn't work with me. So only 3 months after I got full time and insurance for me and my son. They took that away from us and that was hard as a single mother. I would not recommend a single parent to work for Walmart."
good,only advance by preferences. Lack of team work always have safety violations. You have to work harder to meet production dead end job if you get hurt in the job site you get fired.
good,They don't care about youre personal life in any aspect. The hours are long and the work is hard! You can only miss 4 days in 6 months regardless of circumstance
good,Very short staffed   too many different responsibilities placed on very few people.  There is a closeness among the employees and could be a great place to work if there were more people to share responsibilities
good,"It was a terrible place to be once the hype of you being a new hire was gone because almost all of the mangers were dirty. Most of the managers that were there during my time of employment have sense been terminated, demoted or relocated to other facilities for their transgressions."
good,"Store would be packed and it would only be like 3 cashiers. They would over work you and you wasn’t being paid to do all the things they were asking us to do. Me along with the new receiuts that was hired, we painted the whole back part of the Walmart I was working at.."
good,"Within the five years of my career at the Hiram location. I found that there was a lot of hostility with all associates, and management. The management team tend to bully, and threaten the associates including me which was my decision for leaving the company. They were understaffed in many departments and expected many times for one person to do an insanely impossible amount for one person in such a short amount of time. If I could not get all tasks finished within that amount of time my job was threatened. I was told on multiple occasions that I was replaceable. A totally hostile work environment all the way around."
good,"Walmart is a good company, but where i worked the management part was not good. they always offered me fake promises. i would work there again but wouldn't recommend a friend to."
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people and talking with customers while checking and receiving payment for groceries, fast-paced atmosphere, workers are friendly and helpful. What I learned is that I like talking to customers."
good,"well a typical 8-5 shift consists of me covering both sides and making sure that the bottles and cans machines are in working order as well as doing carry outs for customers. it also consists of me getting yelled at for both sides not being stocked. Walmart makes it seem like its such a wondrous place to work for and that they care about their associates but if you're not working DIRECTLY with customers, you get treated like absolute dirt. there isn't a day that i go there where I'm not stressed out."
good,This job would be a decent job but the managers are horrible people and they have no sympathy or remorse. The role that I do at Walmart deserves a higher pay grade than other associates because we are the back bone of Walmart. We have the most important job at Walmart yet we barely get paid enough to survive in today’s world.
good,O que levou minha saída da Walmart foram as promessas não cumpridas o que levou a mim pedir desligamento .
good,"Que busca inovação no tratamento com os clientes.promove eventos internos , promoção, preocupação é foco nas vendas."
good,"Job as stocker was fine until unreasonable expectations were asked. They expected you to stock at an inhuman pace. They only want the work done, not necessarily done the right way."
good,"I enjoyed my time at walmart to an extent , mostly the comradary between the associates on my team. Other than that the pay and the work environment were not very pleasing in terms of being happy and living"
good,I have had such a terrible time at Walmart. The management is rude and unprofessional to say the least. When a serious problem arises at work the management would much rather sweep the problem under the rug instead of trying to fix it!
good,Typical work day includes you having to do the job of many people without any help. Many managers do not manage but instead boss you around having you do tasks that are almost impossible to do. I learned many quick ways to get a job done in a fair amount of time . The only enjoyable part of this job is knowing that you are not the only one who suffers. Coworkers are usually helpful if they can be.
good,My store 5398 has poor management and poor scheduling. For it to be my first job it was fine when I first started about the first year in the last 6 months Walmart has seen a turn with management and employees.
good,Some of the other parts of the store was okay but most of the management was able to be seen walking around the store playing on their phones and talking to each other. Leader hid in the office and never came out.
good,"Working with the public can be rewarding and also very infuriating. Some people are very nice, caring and appreciative. Other people seem to think that we make the policies at WalMart and everything is our fault. We try our best but sometimes it is unappreciated. Some of us care too much about the company while others just see it as a job."
good,On a good day when clean under the shelves swep and srap the gum off the floors. Mop change anything that need to be replace the restrooms. I Learn how to wax the floors and use both the scrubber (Ride on & Walk Behind). Not all but some of the managers poor management skills. The hardest part was to the work with dirty or no equipment to clean the store for months at a time. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,"the company is very number driven, thus making the employees feel like a robot. No holiday pay and associates with bad behaviors I.E. attendance, tardiness, and productivity."
good,"They say they are family oriented but they are not. You're part time and work 7 days a week a few hours a day. There are some in management that are not nice, and do not listen."
good,They dont know how to deal with problems they themselves caused. Employees dont work and arent for most of them friendly. Obviously the only thing that matters to them is to make money. They do not care about their employees
good,"In my opinion, I think Walmart corporate should do more training of their supervisors, and more traing for employess. people at the top in store that I worked in didn't seem to care  if jobs got done or not."
good,Ok job to work  long hours high expectations  always questioning associates about performance culture is not the way any more new hire managers start with more pay
good,"it was a good place just try to stick to yourself, they will keep you busy. And you do eveyone jobs. You dont do just your own. Also its good to have that experience"
good,"I feel that over the years the store I worked at has gone down hill.  They say flexible hours, but not very willing to work with the associates. Management and Supervisors not very supportive."
good,I have nothing to say at this time. the workers where not very friendly and the manager's demanded  I wished to work 40 hours a week but they always kept e in the 33 hr range.
good,"I believe that this job is better suited for a younger generation. When you have a one person income and bills to pay, nobody is full time there. Great job for younger kids with no responsibilities."
good,Most of the departments don't have very good coverage and they don't train very well. I worked there for 7 years only making $11 hr and i wasn't happy
good,was underpaid and overworked.  Left this job for KTA. I stocked the cases with meat products and rotated them according to date. The hardest part of the job was working with young men that did not have any work ethic. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers find what they needed.
good,"The company it self is ok to work for but the people/ workers made it hard. There's not really any benefits for anybody unless your a manager, which i dont think is fair."
good,Walmart does offer a lot off benefits but in order to have access to or use them you have to be a full time employee. I am not sure about the rest of the store but working in the pharmacy i have been there two years already and requested full time status and the pharmacy manager just keeps hiring in new people and promising everyone full time hours but never following through with it.
good,"Walmart thinks that every mistake that is made is made on purpose. "
good,worked as a temporary holiday grocery shelf stocker. arranging product to face customers view. running rework back to the stock room. clean up of back rooms. box recycle. computer corses
good,A combination of safety and catching shoplifters along with any tasks the operations manager wants me to complete. Lack of communication and structure.
good,Walmart is a good company to work for but they do not corporate with employees hours if you are trying to work two jobs. I have worked here twice and both times I had to leave because they did not want to work with my hours at another job that I had
good,"Couldve worked better if properly trained, manager was not very nice, highly under paid. Working up front would have been a lot better for me as a cashier."
good,I worked in the sewing department at the time when they had fabrics to be cut. That specific department has since been shut down and is no longer available
good,I loved the customers and some of my coworkers. I was happy with my customers.  If they had allowed my doctor's note in 1/18 I would have still been working there.
good,"Overworked and underpaid, especially if you work overnight! Not saying all of them are bad just the one I slaved for for 11 years and never got to $12/he. Store 1711 Birmingham Al."
good,cashier and stocking work ; hardest part of the job was dealing with how management treated employees ; the most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the public; the work; the fact that the work night passed by quickly
good,"It may be a great place to work for some but for me, everyone figured I was a football player that I could do my job and their job too. I would not recommend."
good,"Ain't much to say about Walmart, a few of the managers didn't care much about others or myself, they didn't really notice you until you made a mistake or were 3 minutes late to work *which if you were so much as 1 minute late to clock in you were immediately asked to turn everything in and were fired on the spot gleefully by the on site manager* "
good,"Working at Walmart is ok if you enjoy working only part-time and variable hours.  The pay isn't so great but the work is not so bad.  Sometimes dealing with rude customers can be a pain.  So, having the patience and professionalism helps."
good,New people all the time.  I left from work ill and spent the next month in the hospital and no one called to check on me.  I left feeling as if I was having a heart attack (which I did not) and let me leave knowing I was driving.
good,Very racist not a good place to work if your not spanish. my stress level at work are extremely to high. And you get blamed for other people's mistakes. The managers are the problem.
good,A normal day started with me setting up to unload trucks. That means I would set out empty pallets for each department's product. I'd then unload truck(s) unto pallets to be delivered to their respective departments.
good,"-lack of training"
good,I hated working here. I was a cashier for several years during college. Management doesn't support your decisions. The only positive is I gained work experience.
good,This was a temporary position that I was using as a stepping stone in my life. The duties were pretty repetitive and self explanatory. It was busy and fast paced but you were doing the same thing all day.
good,Company is ok to work for until you get injured. Company does not pay for time off or want to cover workers' compensation claims. Company will change your job duties to force you to quit.
good,"walmart is a good starter job. but the only good in the job is the people you meet. Discounts suck, managment sucks they dont care they just want to look good for the big dogs above them, walmart is just money hungry, they dont care about their workers anymore."
good,working at Wal-Mart sometimes very stressful but as an associate you needs to follow policies. the management is pretty poor that sometimes mistakes and accidents are occurring repeatedly
good,"they hire quickly, but the management sucks, the discount isn't that great it's only 10% so if you're getting something in electronics it's helpful but otherwise, it isn't that great. The coworkers are nice at least (well most of them, a few are rude and a few are a bit pervy)."
good,Walk into the back of the store completely cluttered with stuff can't walk back sometime management didn't check to see if people are working tryed blaming other people for management issues
good,its nice
good,a typical day at walmart its slow at first but it picks up with usual customers mostly through out the day id be helping customers or doing another task if they ask me too
good,pay is decent however the company itself  could use some work. I would suggest that the company take more care with their employess. their scheduling is very inconsistant makes it hard to work there and have a family.
good,"As a safety team leader I held weekly meetings to ensure the safety of the employees and customers. Unloading trucks, stocking shelves, stocking backroom and helping customers daily."
good,"The job was just okay, it not really a lot I can tell you about it was a job and nothing more there was never a hint of a career. I don't really think it necessary to write a review about."
good,great place to start out as a high school student.  Hard to move up and are cutting jobs on a regular basis.  future looks poor for this place as far as for employees.
good,it was a fun place to work but it was very stressful at times like when someone called in and then work load would be even harder for the people that worked that day
good,"Come in and do your work.  Management likes to talk and be lazy, Did not have a good experience with Walmart.  I like my job but the managers have driven a lot of good workers out of the door."
good,Poor management. Left work feeling stressed. Customers usually angry with you I wouldn’t recommend working for Walmart or at least  not upfront area..
good,I lost my job there becouse I got sick and ended up in the hospital for 6 days they don't help people how are mental ill at all I had no doctors that was at my hospital I was at could fill out paperwork and they couldn't understand that at all so they fried me after 13 years
good,"When i worked at walmart the management was really bad. "
good,You don't really have a chance to move up or to a different area unless you are one of their favorites. The pay is really good if you are getting the hours.
good,"A typical day as a cashier, after clocking in, you'd go get your money from your CSM, log on, and help cash people out. I learned wonderful people skills while working. management was rather scattered; you never really knew whom to report to."
good,I like the reviews are exactly the same.  Because that gives every company the same change of getting the stars that they should actually get. Very fair star proses!
good,Management is horrible. Easy job once you get trained right. I have been there 13 years. You don't get pay raises like you would at a different job. They do offer benefits.
good,"I've worked at 2 different walmart: Gulfport, MS and Starkville, MS. In Gulfport, my experience was great. Management was always there if you needed them and they knew how to talk and work with you. As for Starkville, the management sucked, they always want you to bend over backwards for them but never help you when you need it. It just depends where you go."
good,"I worked there as a stocker and was disrespected and management was rude, I asked for help on a task and when I did they said figure it out or maybe this job is not for you."
good,Managers are unprofessional. Talked down to regularly. Made to feel you are not important and worthless. I would never return there to work again. Never!
good,typical day at work there is hectic. i learned the managers have favorites.Manament was nice. hardest part of the job was doing a job you werent trained to do. enjoyable part was being with my coworkers
good,Pay your workers a living wage instead of coaching them on how to get on food stamps. Treat the workers as if they are real people with real feelings.
good,"need more people as cashiers  and better management  overall better service  could have better befits for in employees more  pay "
good,I made sure that the customers were taken care of with the highest form of customer satisfaction. Made sure inventory was taken care of and made sure we had the necessary tools to complete the days tasks.
good,"Job started out fine. I felt comfortable except I felt, physically,  it was very hard. I probably would still working there, but an illness prevented me from continuing. Returning back to Walmart now is to physical a position.  I need to find something like a desk position to  continue working."
good,I loved working at walmart I loved my staff and the customers but the manager there was not fair and the support manager was really not fair to people
good,"As with most jobs, Walmart's management is directed by ""corporate"" and as with any job, employment there depends on how much your willing to deal with, put up with, or disagree/agree with. Now if you're looking for a few hours of employment to get out of the house while your spouse is out being the bread-winner, then Walmart would be an OK place to work because they will not give you anymore hours than what a part time employee can work to keep that employment status, they offer health care coverage at a high price (but what health insurance isn't) without any contribution by the company, and don't expect them to be understanding or sympathetic to your situation or circumstances; they will let you go at a drop of a dime."
good,"Routine practice seemed to be put one cart pusher outside on a day known to be busy, and then proceed to scream at him because he couldnt keep carts stocked on both sides."
good,walmart was more concerned about work them the well being of their associates. There was no work life balance jet work. Management was not sensitive or compassionate towards workers.
good,The only thing that's keeping me going is my co-workers because we as Cap 2 sometimes are assigned to do a lot and I just feel like we don't get paid enough judging by how much work we do and physical work.
good,"customers were rude, management was demanding, inconsistent schedule and breaks. low tolerance for mistakes. low tolerances for illnesses in family. not fun"
good,The store manager is very rude as well as most of the assistant store managers they only give benefits to people working more than 40 hours yet they don’t let you get that many hours it’s considered overtime after 38 hours
good,too much of your review performance is done by people who seldom have any contact with you making it hard to showcase your talents when needed.  More interactions are needed by those in positions to affect your career.
good,worked as cashier it was fun when I first started but management changed and things were required of a cashier that was not in our job description. Hours were not fairly issued as needed
good,"This company has negative press in the media regarding their workplace tactics.  The company did have some positives,but, this was a college job for me years ago."
good,"Management really sucked. They were rotated every month or two. Job security was there, but hours were horribly cut or changed without notice. As an employee, you'll be utilized not just for your department but for all that they need, making it impossible to keep your department ready enough for the overnighters to stock."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart. I adapt quickly and I am also a quick learner. I learned many different techniques and skills. I knew how to work every cash register from chekout, customer service(returns and exchanges), money center(cashing checks, money orders). I could be placed almost anywhere. I worked mornings, afternoons and evenings and sometimes stayed over when short to cover next shift."
good,"The work itself was not all that bad, if you had someone else working with you. Well honestly a couple of other people working with you. Being the only person working in the bakery is horrible. You have so many different tasks, on top of help customers who take up a lot of time. A typical day would be preparing the bread to go into the oven, stocking the floor, packaging and labeling the various breads decorating cakes, assisting customers, often helping the deli, putting away pallets of food for the bakery, deli and frozen departments, taking orders for cakes, answering phone, decorating specialty cakes, decorating cupcakes and so much more."
good,Management did not care about your personal life. If you had a personal problem.... O well.  I would not recommend this job to anyone with a life or family.
good,I loved working with associates cause we helped each other learn whenever possible but management decisions weren't thought out properly or the person lack the skill to do the postion well and we suffered because of it never enough help but the workload piles up! breaks and lunches taken way too early or 2 to 3 hrs after the scheduled time and the list goes on.
good,"The job is okay. The people suck. The managers as well as the customers. I don't like Walmart as an employer, however it is a good company. They are in dire need of new management."
good,Often had food events that allowed employees to get free or reduced food for their breaks or lunch. also had 2 15 min breaks along with an hour long lunch
good,Having been a manager in the past this place is not run well at all. Managers do not care about asscociates and if you are out sick you can forget about any compassion at all they will fire you medical records and all
good,work place is like family based everybody helps one another. management is the best. hardest part of the job is the long hours and the time frame to get areas done.
good,it is a good company but the way they make decisions is unethical. The management there are pretty good for the most part but do not know how to properly make decisions
good,"It has been quite a long time since I worked for Wal-mart, that I have no positive or negative things to say.  It was a job I took to help make ends meet when I moved from one state to another, and while I was greatful for the job, I was actively looking for another job in my field of experience."
good,"hard to move up in the company, other than that normal day would be dealing with customers management sucked. If the pay was a little better and management improved it wouldn't be that bad"
good,A quick job to get for some money but horrible pay no benefits they dont appreciate your work they rip you off money out your pay check.  Work crazy hours late nights then early mornings no real breaks.
good,"Its an okay job if the managers like you. If they don't they'll throw you under the bus every chance they get even though they should be responsible and accountable for their employees they supervise. Most of the time, it's worse than high school."
good,If you are desperate this is a OK place to work. For me there was not job advancement available. And some members of management did have their favorite employees and were not always fair to everyone.
good,I loved my job at Walmart it was a great environment with tons of friendly people and i thoroughly enjoyed going to work everyday. In July there was a big company change and management has been treating myself and other employees with 0 respect and absolute disgusting behaviors towards us. currently I am on a probation for being off with a head injury where Walmart will refuse me if i try and apply for any jobs within the company and keeps threatening termination of my job. It is myself an numerous employees also in this situation. Walmart management are overall terrible people
good,A typical day at walmart i come in get my mc40 go cap the grocery bins and pull out picks to stock when finished with that i top stock zone and assist customers
good,"Get promoted. It's the only way to make decent money. Stay away from the front end, it's stressful up there. And tire and lube is the best work place."
good,"days may very from very busy to slow yet there was always things to do. sometimes I would work on displays stock etc. The managers I dealt with where good and dependable managers. customer satisfaction in any field is the hardest thing, yet it can be rewarding as well."
good,"I get enough hours to make sure I can pay the bills I need to pay, I would like more fixed hours so I can spend more time with my family and have time during the day or weekends to have some form of a life. Management isn't that great, you have to tell them multiple times if you need PTO or days off approved and even then it still wont get done. And it really sucks that we have to work major holidays when we could be spending it at home with our families and loved ones instead."
good,"Assist and check out customers."
good,Management was horrible. Scheduling was ridiculous. No one from management offered any kind of solutions. Every day felt like you were all on your own. No help when short staffed.
good,management is the worst. the work itself is fairly easy. before i got fired i ask for sundays cuz i needed the money and was laughed at and was told no cuz i work a lot during the week and too many people on sundays
good,I have worked at Walmart three different times and each time was the same horrible experience. This company does not care about family; they care about their profit. I have seen it and experienced this myself. Workplace culture lacked; I was not trained properly and in a sense trained myself on the equipment that I used. The management lacks and this company has really lost touch with their original values.
good,"I loved working there and meeting new customers, and seeing my repeat customers. Management was not the best. Hateful and rude to staff and customers."
good,Wal Mart is a stable job environment. My typical day consisted of bringing in buggies from the parking lot and making sure the parking lot was buggy free. The management was very non active in my day to day job interactions. The hardest part about the job was all of the walking that it consisted of.
good,The managers usually just ordered us around. There were no benefits really. The moral was low at the front end of the store due to favoritism. It's stressful and doesn't pay enough.
good,I would only work there if you really need a job. Managers there are very rude and absolutely have to bust you butt off just to make it through the entire day.
good,"I liked working in Human Resources the best, I learned alot and liked the people I worked with on a daily basis. My manager was patient and very experienced in her job and made learning easy and fun. "
good,Los jefes de abarrotes y algunas areas como recursos humanos no estan para ayudar a compañeros te piden cumplir con un horario fuera de reglamento no respetan vida personal y buscan meterse el pie entre todos
good,Management was horrible. People hired in after me was paid more. Needed FMLA and they would not approve so I had to leave. Lack of training. I'm happy I left.
good,most managers are too demanding of each cashier and let their personal lives interfere with their everyday and take it out on the cashiers. Most customers are treated poorly and walmart does not help save money because there is no more price matching and coupons are very limited. This area needs more cheaper prices due to being a very poor neighborhood.
good,"I worked the middle shift, and because of that i would not have time through out the day to get any other business handled. i learned that if you take a shift that is from 1-10pm make sure you are getting paid fairly for your commitment."
good,"Empresa sem gestão de segurança do trabalho"
good,"I started as a cashier and then moved to the sales floor in housewares.   Much of what I did was organize and maintain the department in an extremely busy store.      I liked the work and all there was to learn about the store.     I made it a goal to experience all the departments, including layaway and customer service.     A good day was getting the whole department kept up to par anad waiting on the customers.    We often helped other departments when we were finished with ours.  The time flew. A bad day was when we were short staffed.   We had a lot of young people who called in sick.  This was a very low paying store at the time.   there was also a disconnect between managers and employees.     I would have like to work myself up to support manager and tried to improve employee relations, but I had another job that paid much better and I had to choose to leave this one."
good,"This is a insecure position. The respect that they show is limited. They are ok when it come to benefits, with their income though they can provide better coverage."
good,"Worked most of the time barely any days off which is good if you just need the money, You can deal with  rude employees and customers. Calling or missing a day they may fire you over."
good,"First I would get to my department and start working till it was time for me to get off."
good,As a cashier we always had to deal with the mad costmers. You can't really do nothing else besides stand there and twittle your thumbs. Mangment always puts themselves above their workers.
good,"Walmart was not a very good experience for me my training was incomplete i was not taught all i should have known & the management was not flexible at all with there hours."
good,Not a bad place to work if you're right out of high school. Would not recommend for a long term job. The hours aren't what was desired and the flexibility was nothing.
good,"It was not a bad work environment for a first job, however it seemed as if cashiers were overlooked for every type of event that Walmart did for it's employees."
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart was meeting new people. I was first a people greeter until I was trained as a cashier and once a cashier I had customers waiting in my line to be served by me because of the way in which I treated them
good,"before my transfer from bedford walmart my typical day was always cool and organized straight forward. then we had to transfer to the steelyard and my days became hectic, unorganized and stressful. i learned a lot at bedford even had manager training and was up for a promotion. steelyard management is terrible. walmart claims to help their employees and don't. i took an approved leave of absence and during that time they laid me off without warning or anything. and no way to get unemployment either"
good,Most of the workers work create together but management needs a lot of improvement. All cashiers are like family to each other and work create with one another. They trust their immediate management but not store and assistance managers.
good,"a little unorganized"
good,"Walmart is good starting job for college students needing to start a resume. However, if you are wanting to move up you better kiss up to the higher up managers and never make a mistake or ask for time off. Pretty much you better be pitch perfect and never complain."
good,"Managers are worthless and do not take anything you say into consideration. When having a concern, you are better off to keep it to yourself. Retaliation is a big thing here. You talk about your manager they punish you for it."
good,"long hours low pay, always something to do managers are able to assist. but they are over worked to many things to be done depending on what department you are in."
good,Would be a great place to work if managment actually cared about you....they wont hire anybody so u have to do the wwork of 4 people.................................
good,"As a cashier, they will force you to achieve a goal to sign people up for credit card and verbally reprimand you if you have not produced any new application for a period of time."
good,"es un ambiente de trabajo arduo, sin aspiraciones a ascender"
good,"I really didn't come into this job to expect to find a career, all i needed was a weekly paycheck.  Overall the work isn't too bad the problem resides in the fact that most people who work here don't want to do anything so the slack fell on the few of us that worked hard."
good,"A typical work day would be I would clock in and head to my designated work area. I would first do an analysis to see what needs to be done, then I would proceed in doing so. What I learned at Walmart is that everything is trial and era. The management in my personal experience with them as that they need more training. I feel as though they need to be a little more knowledgeable on who they hire. The hardest of the job was having to explain to customers why we don't have the product they need. Just to see the disappointment on their faces and me being an employee that can't solve the problem. The most enjoyable part to me was my coworkers and just working with positive people."
good,I had great co-workers here but when my aunt was found dead in her car I was fired for missing work for her funeral. I was not told that I had been terminated until I showed up for my shift the day after the funeral.
good,Working as an employee with walmart they did not allow many flexible schedules; the pay is not worth the amount of hardwork that they want you to do and their supervisors are very strict on overtime and work hours. making $9 an hour with a family was not a good fit. You can't make a living off of the salary.
good,"A year in and was still a part time employee with no benefits. Worked the back room, 40 plus hours a week. Full time hours, part time status."
good,There are ups and downs just like any other job. Its all production type factory work mostly back breaking jobs. They have decent benifits such as medical dental etc.
good,"They want  you to devote your whole life to them with little back in return. I didn't receive a raise in 3 years, upper management will wright you up to cover themselves."
good,This is a ok starter job. They care more about company than workers. It is a fast pace job. I feel like they underpay thier employees. Jobs can be demanding at times. I did learn quite a bit there. How to set mods and work the zone areas. Good learning tools. You must be able to do shift work. Some early and late shifts makes it rough.
good,"Beech Grove Walmart not only has a bad reputation, but it is disgusting. No manager there cares about your life outside of work. Doctors notes do not count as excused, so if you're sick or plan to be out of work for a few days in the hospital, plan to find a new job. "
good,"Although Walmart is great to learn most principles of asset protection and routines,  that's as far as it goes. I was never given an opportunity to advance and therefor I ventured off to new opportunities and was promoted quickly. Work/Life balance is horrible. No set schedules.  Holidays you work mornings and return at night example: Thanksgiving and Christmas."
good,"I work in the shoes, for about 6 months into the job I loved it. Then the company decided to cut hours, hold back raises, and started making everyone help in other departments because of the hour cuts. Higher up managers definitely do not help you with training, and most of them are extremely rude to employees."
good,"Very strict when it comes do missing work. Management takes it to the head. "
good,Everyday was a handful because it wasn't enough coverage or the schedules where a disaster. Management is terrible they never want to help out when call on them
good,"The workplace was awful. Managers were rude, self-entitled and lacked basic communication skills. They were unwilling to work with me on a schedule that worked for all the aspects of my life, including my schooling so I had to quit. During the holidays they will work you like crazy but after that its hard to get enough hours for a live able wage."
good,Once you work there you make friends that turn into family. But you still have to work harder than anyone to get noticed . It can be fun but extremely stressful due to customers.
good,The people are great to work with and helping customers is great.  If you want a part-time job just for fun or a  little extra cash. This is a good job.
good,We would unload trucks that came in with the inventory and then update the inventory system. Management wasn't too bad but of coarse would push you to get more out of you.
good,Never though I would stick here as long as I have and I regret it. The hours are short and the management is very picky and choosy of who advances and who does not.
good,Wal-Mart has the potential to be a great place to work but the management are not mature enough to be in their positions the are bullies and they hire there friends and lock good supervisors out of their positions.
good,"Worked there for 13 years! started realizing how shady the company was getting, so it was time for me to get out. If hired go to these departments. Every other dept is tough an hard labor.."
good,"A typical day at work was either boring or unfulfilled. I learned not to rely on my fellow employees for help because they were either too busy with what management had them doing or what they were ordered to do instead of helping someone who was struggling. Management could have done better and hired more, or informed us that we could take a break when it was needed. Workplace culture was about what you could expect for Walmart in a small town like this. The hardest part of the job was the job itself, being hired as a Cashier and having to do almost everything except work in the Deli. The most enjoyable part of the job, sad to say, was the breaks."
good,"Epresa com otima cultura, porem  devido a crise o Walmart no Brasil esta correndo atras do prejuizo de forma errads"
good,"Management is horrible, they only hire who they want and not who deserves it. I was there 3 years and always on the front end and tried desperately to move up in any way I could and I've been through 20 some interviews and never got chosen for one even though I was highly qualified for a few of them, they just never gave me the chance and they always knew who they wanted for the said position before the interviews even started."
good,"They play total favoritism, will promote even if you don't know up from down. Horrible hours, and subject to change at what feels like a moments notice."
good,they never hire enough cashiers and often times you will work long before you will receive a break. 1st of the month is always horrible because there are only 7 lanes open
good,"The company as a whole is great to work for, only real problem is that you are promised 25 hours a week when hired.  That is only while training, once trained your hours get cut down drastically."
good,"Back straining, tiring job, managers play favorites managers didn't listen when someone went to them with a problem. They forget about your lunch or did when I worked there."
good,I loved working with the customers but the other workers were rude and the manager was rude and they fired me for being sick and light headed all an all I didn't like Walmart
good,"Log into their computer's that are way back in the store, then stock your cart, sometimes they will have meetings before that you have to attend and then stock your cart. Ask the supervisor which isle's you are doing. Example: cereal, canned foods, produce, etc. They say cereal, so you and another co-worker are assigned 3 to 4 isle's to do for the entire shift. First day was a little different, where they have a supervisor help you which is great at it, so you generally feel like your doing good for the first day, until you get another co-worker that is somewhat confused about things like you. Management expects you to get your 2 to 3 carts worth done by the end of your shift, which is freaking impossible, but since you can't this is what happens. The manager and supervisor's call you into the office and tell you how terrible you are doing and say you should do better and send you back to work. Now if I was running Walmart, that wouldn't be what I would do, but if I heard that, that had happened, I would have fired them all!"
good,"a typical at work continually checking out customers in a timely fashion making sure they had a wonderful experience, I happened to love my job as I really enjoy working with people even when they are difficult which wasn't the case as most of my customers loved me"
good,"A typical day at Walmart would consist of having a quota to meet and not always having the necessary tools to complete your job. I have seen many inappropriate relationships between staff and managers and significant favoritism. Also a very high turn over rate. I showed interest in moving up in the company and was always told there were no jobs available at the time, then a week later a new hire placed in the same position. Not very honest."
good,Good place to develop customer service skills and communication skills.  Management doesn't seem to care about you and the customers can be kind of mean.
good,"Walmart is a fun place to work,  it all depends on the management. I loved working there. I liked the staff and customers. The only thing I didn't like is that they don't accept doctor excuses."
good,Una empresa que debe respetar a su gente para que asi puedan surgir otras personas.
good,At Walmart you are just another number. Your personal life did not concern the company. If your legs had just been chopped off you were expected to still show up.
good,was good i just love to work. but i feel as if i never got the props i deserve. i also wanted more hours but i never got that neither . other workers there loved to help
good,Lack of communication of goals that constantly change on the fly to meet company needs regardless of employee understanding. They (from my experience) has a kind of do as I say and shut up atmosphere. Please do note that my experience can not reflect how the company as a whole treats their employees.
good,They let customers walk up in your face and threaten you. Management also talks to you any kind of way. It use to be family orientated where all of us felt good about coming to work. After new management came in no one wanted to come in.
good,"Very unfriendly employees, well mostly management. Good steady work pace, pay and hours sucked though. Only worked there a shirt amount of time, but was there long enough to know some management sucked at their jobs!"
good,Production was over 1400 boxes and hour over a 12 hour shift. 0 leway is given. If you are 1% short you get written up. Terrible on your body. I was 19 at the time and had to do general physical therapy for my body when i left.
good,"Upper management showed little concern/respect for middle managers.  "
good,"Some of the management can do anything they like and get away with it, suck as screaming at employees and having awful attitudes and tones with customers."
good,"Walmart is not designed to be a career but is simply just a job to tie  one over who is between jobs or would like to pick up some extra money.  Expect part time work only.  Managers are less likely to respect you however it is not entirely unheard of to get that boss that acts more friend than employer.  While it may seem I am speaking ill of the company, it has kept me from letting my bills lapse."
good,There is absolutly no work life balance. Unrealistic expectations are given on a daily basis especially if you are the overnight Assistant manager. ALOT of hours dosen't add up to the pay.
good,Expectations to high for people for being under staffed. Very little communications between managers. Stop being flexible with scheduling.  They seem to stop caring about their employee.
good,"I had to work extra hours because I was the only one that wasn't a teen mom, the money was good though. and they make me work the whole 4th of July and fired me the next day."
good,I liked working at Walmart mostly. I will miss my friends there who have become like family to me. I would recommend Walmart to someone else that was looking for a job.
good,"I worked overnights 4 nights per week, this was very difficult as I was often up all day on my days off.  Unless the pay were very high, it is highly unlikely that I would want to work 3rd shift ever again."
good,Unloaded delivery trucks and stocked shelves.  No room for advancement and I felt my skills were under utilized.  Pay scale was at $9.00 but after 30 days did receive a wage increase but no benefits.
good,There was no respect for employees or what our requested time was. For example I applied and told them I could only work evenings and weekends and only looking for 2-3days a week. Well they would put me on for mornings and 5-6 days a week. I would explain I'm in school and cannot be there then they would guilt trip me because I couldn't make the shift. I had to quit not because I wanted to but because they had no respect for people's home life.
good,"I worked at walmart for about 2 and a half years. I worked here while I was going to college. All coworkers and immediate supervisors were amazing. The higher up management were terrible.. they did not care for employees under them. They did stuff only if it didn't hinder them. No advancement opportunities in the store I worked at. If there were dances for advancement they based their choices off of how the person interviews, not how much experience they have or how coworkers feel about them working in that position."
good,"If you are alone and the only one paying the bills i would not recommend this place, if you have a significant other or married and two incomes then this may be the place for you."
good,No life and work balance. The pay is not very good and management doesn't listen to your idea's or feedback. You can't live on this salary alone because your hour's are not reliable.
good,"Just another job with normal daily grind.  Not difficult, but just average.  Nothing special here but no bad either.  They did try to keep their employees happy at the store I worked at."
good,A typical day working at Walmart would be doing not only your job but also everyone else's job as well and never getting awarded or notice for the work you did. you couldn't get anything done because they had you stop short on one task to start another. Management plays favorite at the store I worked at (ST#3301) I think the only good thing about it was that I learned how to do things on my own when someone in a position higher than me doesn't give me any type of instructions.
good,"Walmart provides excellent benefits to their employees.  They have excellent standards, depending on the store you are hired with.  They help associates in trouble, with financial assistance, when needed."
good,The thing I love the most about my job is the people I get to work with. I look forward to going in every day because the people make the day go by fast.
good,Management doesn't treat employees right.They pushed some of their best employees away because they're are very inconsiderate.The benefits aren't as great as advertised either
good,"Stocked "
good,Walmart would be a great place for high school kids to start a working background. Not a place any one who is looking for a long career to be. Need to be cross trained in other platforms.
good,"Walmart is a good store for shopping ! BUT it could be focused a lot more on the people that have to work their day in and day out . The staff is pretty lazy and the cashiers, stockers, csms, etc are overworked for little to no pay"
good,"Expected so much from you in short time.  Zone all those shelves in one section- -like food, pet, or health care.  Zoning is straighten shelves. Shelves are so dusty too."
good,"I am a hard worker, would like the chance to prove that I would be a benefit to your company. All I am asking for is the chance to prove myself, and the need to survive."
good,I personally enjoyed this job. My main issue were the managers and the inability to get assistance with my medical. The people are great and so are the Department managers but the Assistant and above play favorites.
good,"I've worked for Walmart almost two years now, I enjoy my fellow coworkers but management has gone downhill. But the money is decent and if you can handle stress it's a good job."
good,"Each day varies, there are lots of projects and you can stay busy always but management is terrible on how they treat the associates. Sometimes I spend more time doing other peoples job."
good,"New rules, Cashiering was pretty fun. An meeting new people from different backgrounds was nice. I've learned better communication with the customer. The hardest part about the job, is when they changed everything with the registers and how they run the front end.  Some of the employees were nice and others you couldn't trust."
good,Not a bad place to work but not really for me management is childish and petty and shows favoritism even in cases where employees are not good workers
good,"A typical day at work consists of running cash registers, loading furniture and other merchandise in the garden and lawn care items, and the most enjoyable part of the job is talking to customers and learning from them."
good,"I love walmart as a company but working for them is something else not every place is the same but the one i worked at had rude managers, lack of training, and lack of ways to advance."
good,Pay is only good in three departments. That is the only positive. The culture is horrible. You are made to feel worthless. Management is only good at micromanaging. There is a very political atmosphere. Altogether unpleasant and soul-crushing.
good,Management and corporate are more focused on the money than they are the employees only benefits is a 10% discount card and a paycheck
good,Too much favoritism and employees getting away with things.. very unprofessional managers!!! Others didn't have to do their job and got away with it!!!
good,"The job was a very easy job. Just stocking and cleaning, but was very stressful. Had to make sure that you watched the managers when asked for PTO or it would never get done. Gave some workers more ""freedom"" than others. Make sure you watch your check sometimes they didnt give you all of your money."
good,Walmart did not treat the associates fair or allow them to express themselves to better there company and employment status. Many people are not allowed full time to avoid providing benefits all in all not the best job
good,Everyone is part time.  Weeks 1-12 I was scheduled 32-40 hrs a week and that was great but at week 13 I was scheduled for 21 hrs.  Week 14 I had 19 hrs.  Schedules are posted three weeks in advance but they reserve the right to change your schedule without notifying you within 24 hrs of your shift.  That includes adding you to the schedule or removing you.
good,Don't really like it to much drama. I've learened to stay in my own lane. The managers are no help. Their are a lot of racist people. Hardest part is dealing with rude customers. Best part is going home!
good,I liked the job. I liked the pay. I did not like the drama and how I got sick from standing in front of the air conditioner at the door for 9 hours a day.
good,after a experience for about three months in electronics it was great but they need someone else to manage electronics someone without favoritism and the ability to fire someone she does not like.
good,I loved my customers and cashiers. Learning different jobs and meeting different people.Angry customers was the worst about the job.
good,Management Is very rude looks down on employees overnight stocker are overloaded with work required to complete a task in two hours that clearly takes 6
good,"A typical day at work would be bringing freight out from the back room and stocking the shelves.  I have learned to stock shelves, assist customers, zone shelves, and unload trucks.  I have made a few friends with co-workers."
good,I didnt care for the assistant manager there. I believe she had something against me. For that reason i dont care much for that store.
good,"It was a good place, just weren't flexible with shifts. I need more flexible hours due to family obligations. They were not willing to work with me."
good,"Typical day is basically praying before clocking in, knowing management is going to jump down your throat."
good,"I did not enjoy the working environment. I understand the concept of customers are always right, but there must be some sort of support and appreciation for the employees as well."
good,Poor management. High turnover rate. Training could improve. All in all just a temporary job to get you through the hard times.
good,My job was to go in the area ask customers if they needed help I ran the cashier and I did some zoning customer service so I helped with exchanging items and selling items
good,store mgr. is not the best to work for. store mgr. is not there to help his associates at all. you have an issue about your child and if you was to go to the store mgr he does not care about you home life at all.
good,Not much interest in employee welfare and overall dirty/poor working conditions. Also a noted constant lack in materials and available management.
good,Walmart is great to shop at but not so much to work for. Maybe if they had better training on customer service and how to speak to they employees  and not hide from an angry customer thing would be great.
good,Walmart has very poor pay and even worse management culture.  Very poor lunch time policy. employees maybe be let go after going to lunch too late.
good,Not a very friendly place to work. Management has poor communication skills as well as they barely work around doctor visits and school.
good,A typical day at work would require coming in to rude  management and workers. I had learned the basics of any retail jobs.
good,"Lots to do busy work environment, developed new skills and met people from all walks of life, developed my customer service skills."
good,"majority of the times, ok days at Walmart. I learned to work, and run a meat department. the management was terrible. the co workers were full of joy and ready to work. the hardest part about the job well there wasn't really anything hard about this 1. I most enjoyed the wage."
good,The walmart i was located at was very unprofessional and rude. Work environment was horrible and the mangers were mean.
good,"A typical day working at Wal-Mart starting with the same thing every day; standing around wondering where you'll be placed during your shift. The management is horrible! Whenever you have a question or concern, you can't find the manager(s) anywhere!"
good,"overall was an ok place to work, overstaffed, not utilizing all employees to the workload at hand.  I liked helping the customers and filling prescriptions. I missed doing things like compounding and inputting more. Too many other techs wasting time not filling prescriptions."
good,I actually enjoyed working at Wal-Mart. The hardest part was the over shifts plus I'm attending school so it was to much stress they wasn't willing to switch me to days so now I'm trying to find another job that can work well with my school schedule.
good,Trabaje y aprendí demasiado en esta empresa gracias a ella obtuve mi licenciatura pero no me gustaría volver.
good,It was alright management were incompetent most of the time. The managers were intolerant of commitments outside of the workplace.
good,"They lack in communicating with employees and their needs. They are severely under staffed, which causes customers to be upset and angry. They also don't train their employees completely. I went in everyday feeling lost on what I was suppose to be doing."
good,"like working with people but things have changed and a lot of thing have been taken away from employees.Like working in office with gathering money and working on the computer. I also like going out on the floor and working with the people and helping them find things."
good,Everyone is always ready to work and ready to serve and greet. I have learned a lot of people skills and dealer with customers problems. The Management was not very helpful in customer satisfaction or even cooperation with coworkers. The hardest part of the job was during holidays management had to stay over time and rushing to get things done. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new faces and helping others with anything they need.
good,Compensation does not meet the workload and management is not very understanding....depending on what department you're in. Definitely need more employees in the pharmacy.
good,In my opinion Wal-Mart's staff was overall friendly and up-beat. the management lacked the leadership skills and training to run the store efficiently
good,The managers there never really helped but always expected the work to be done anyways. never got time off and the hours werent the best
good,Company is notorious for not paying their associates enough benefits are mediocre bonuses can be paid out but only based on customer experience and product availability..only one of which associates have control over.. Are not that many full time associates mostly part time and hours are scarce almost 6 months out  the year..and to make up for that they will work the associate that is working like a dog. All in all I like my fellow associates but 5 years working thanksgiving and Christmas Eve and other holidays is old.
good,"walmart does not care about you family just $$$$"
good,While working at Walmart I did not feel like I was valued as a person or an employee. The compensation was minimum wage and you had to have a flexible schedule. They were not gracious with giving you time off and they had me work every weekend.
good,Overall at Wal-Mart the core belief is to treat associates like complete garbage and expect them to still care about their job and workplace.
good,"They demand a lot from each person. If some one wasn't able to do they're work it was blamed on someone else. A lot of personality clashes that were used to create drama. I learned all kinds of different skills, using different types of computers."
good,"I loved working with the public, but didnt feel adequately trained before being put on a register. Also, the management wasnt willing to work with the time I needed off (my wedding and short honeymoon)."
good,great co workers however no real room for advancement. working hours and shifts vary extensively. extremely low wage bases. corporate culture sacrifices employee wages in lieu of higher profits and company image of lower consumer pricing.
good,Upper management was to busy sleeping around and with each other no integrity . Enjoyed customers and associates. I'm sure if location was different my experience would have been different.
good,"Go swipe your badge. Clock in. Walk into backroom. Either: 1) Clean up last shifts mess/ shuffle around freight that has no place to go, or 2) Start throwing/unloading a truck of about 1700 - 2600 pieces of freight(boxes). Then a break. Then either 1) stocking the freight on the sales floor or 2) breaking down remix(more freight usually around 1000-1500 pieces. Then Lunch. Then come back and stock some more. Then break. Finally either 1) continue stocking on the sales floor or 2) pull pallets of freight that was sorted through to the sales floor. Clean up very quickly. Swipe badge. Clock out. Repeat."
good,"I had to quit, no one told me anything about what my job responsibilities were. Everyone seemed fearful of management. The job was so harsh I felt like I was 85 years old when my shift was over."
good,i used to like working here until managers started giving special treatment to certain employees. the disrespect from managers. the constant lack of acceptance of cultural background of employees
good,The most enjoyable part of my day was seeing my customers and workers happy and motivated. The hardest part of my job was not being able to completely help a customer with their issues. I learned alot coming from a cashier to a customer service supervisor! Our management was awesome but some played favorites too.
good,"Working at Walmart can have its ups and downs. I'm a Cashier been working there for a year now. Some of the customers are nice and some of them are rude, mean, and disrespectful. I am a friendly associate who love to help customers out if needed. The only thing I hate is having to stand up all day. I just wish the CSM's would do better as in picking up their speed when it comes to US cashiers running out of money at the resgisters."
good,Management will constantly hound you to do 5 different things at once and wont hold the unproductive employees accountable.
good,"There was Lack of training , and employees. But also not enough hours to provide for a family. Job security was also an issue in this company."
good,"The management of my store was just awful, they would not help me move locations, shifts, or job titles because i was good at my job and they did not want to lose me from that position. i could not afford to pay my bills or better my life while working there."
good,"A typical day at can be busy from the start or slow all day. Walk in, wearing proper dress code; blue/white collar shirt, kakis/black pants, brand employee vest, and name badge. Sign into electronic time clock."
good,"Typical day is very busy,I knew what was expected of me so it was always completed before I was ever told, I learned to go with the flow and a smile always gets you a lot farther then an frown ever will. "
good,"I learned a lot about apparel, shoes, electronics, layaway and jewelry also cashiering team work and customer service. I loved working with my co workers. my hardest part of my job was not being able to move up in the company and to go full time. The most enjoyable part of my job was having a department that i could make a change."
good,"This company does not follow policies on associate complaints. They do not take statements."
good,associates are the heart beat of the store but the management team takes all the credit and recognition. would be a great establishment if they took responsibility.
good,"As a cashier, it is almost impossible to transfer to a different department, as that position has such a high turnover rate and new cashiers are constantly having to be hired and trained, that the ones with experience aren't allowed to move on, as they are ""too valuable up front""."
good,"Wal-mart has no control of their staff and don't know what they are doing with their employees, Every one wants to be the boss"
good,"Management doesnt care about anything."
good,A typical day at Walmart is clocking on at 3:00 pm and cleaning the sales floor. Restocking the shelves and making everything look nice and organized. Walmart was my first job and I started when I was 19 years old. It taught me how to talk to people and deal with rude customers. Because the customer is always right. The management was okay. They would tend to tell you to do one thing then have yo leave there to do something else and then make you stay overtime to finish what they stopped you from doing. It wasn't that bad because I made overtime but it was a little frustrating. The hardest part of the job was having to constantly pick up the same thing you just cleaned on the sales floor because people just throw evrythinon the floor. The mos enjoyable part was having to stock the new item because you are the first to see whats on the floor.
good,I was 8 months pregnant when i started and the lady who hired me was very rude and mean about everything. the mangers up front was super nice and understood that i couldnt stand much.
good,"Long Days from time to time.  The money was fair so it made it worth it.  They did tend to train well so that you were ready for your job.   At the rate things were changing it was hard to keep up sometimes,"
good,"If your a young adult just needing experience, walmart is fine for that.. If you plan to go up the corporate ladder then this is not the place for you. Assistant managers are salary and work 12-18 hour days and are not rewarded for it. its just what they have to do"
good,was good job enjoyed the people I worked with. Too many bosses. started switching people around in different jobs that they were not good at. Certain people were made to work all weekends instead of alternating.
good,"I usually only worked for about four hours a day, but I still dreaded going to work everyday. The managers were very negative, and did not offer any constructive criticism."
good,the managers are really mean and impersonal. miserable work life.they wouldnt honor my doctors note for my foot injury.
good,"I was a cashier, so I dealt with difficult people all day long but since it is Walmart, you can imagine how busy it can get. management was slow usually, co workers werent always very nice at all. hardest part of the job was standing for an entire 8 hour shift."
good,the job sucks the management were not always on time and were never around when you needed help the hard part of the job was to talk to people
good,"Extremely difficult and stress filled environment. Constantly understaffed. Extensive favoritism and lack of respect for the individual. I learned that the harder I worked, the less I gained."
good,"Typical day here was a roller coaster ride of emotions. Most of my cashier training for Walmart was done at this location. The coworkers and customers all had a bit of an upper class attitude which I found to be unlikeable. I did my best and had many compliments from customers but there was always that handful each day that criticized every move I made and made me feel like I was beneath them. This was a bigger store and a larger town than the one I ended up transferring to. I preferred the smaller one as it had a friendlier, home town feel to it. I learned many great cashiering tips here and was able to learn to be very proficient in my job. I loved making a customer's day when I would meet or exceed their personal expectations."
good,Ok for a part-time job. Hours are crazy and all over the place. Be prepared to loose your weekends.  Discount could be better giving today's economy.
good,Everyone expects you to do their job.  They do pay on time.  I actually had a mistake on my roe and wrote head office which did correct it and apologized.  This was incompetence at local office.  Keep your pay stubs.
good,Was employed for 26 1/2 years with Wal-Mart.....the company has changed a lot.  Had various classes & have several certifications
good,"The Pharmacy is a very fast paced employment, which is good.  This makes time go by fast."
good,"The management played favorites, one thing you need to learn if you are going to work here. You need to be off of everyone's radar."
good,They do not take good care of their employees. No benefits. I started out at 9.00 and ended 7 years later with 11.00... Hard work for little pay. Clientele is relentless. Working area is disgusting. Bathrooms are horrible.
good,"Expectations exceeded the manpower available.  Management was not supportive.  Consistent call-outs that impeded daily goals.  Management held ""coaching"" process over management heads."
good,"This is the type of job that you only keep until you find something better. To deal with individuals that only care about the company and not REALLY about the employees really tells how the company really works. It all about the numbers, every day there is some talk about the numbers and never about the employees. There is never a real concern about the employees, this job is one I will never return to. They advertise how the company is interested about their employees and when you get hired they tell all these stories about how they will take care of you and they have an open door policy, well I beg to differ."
good,went in and rang people threw  the till .. it was fun at the till the best part of my day was leaveing .. the workers are very rude ...  and i had to leave because they wouldnt let me keep my job after i had my child ... will not go back
good,"Working for Walmart is not the best place ever, but its a job. You work hard for little money, and it is hard to move up in a company that shows a lot of favoritism."
good,"This is a job you take because you need a job. The amount of pressure they put on associates is unfair. I was told to my face ""you could be a manager but you have a kid. People with kids will not be promoted anymore."""
good,Set up room for unloading truck so unloader could unload truck delegate instructions for workers so they could process all the products
good,Store manager at my location is very young and tends to throw temper tantrums. They always seem to place blame on employees regardless of true fault in the situation. The employee turn around is by far the worst I have ever seen.
good,"la estabilidad laboral era buena,llegaba en la mañana con un ameno saludo entre compañeros,llegaba a mi area y sacaba mi herramienta para dar comienzo a mis rondines matutinos por area de piso de ventas(que los de limpieza que estaban a mi cargo hubieran encerado y echo bien su labor)"
good,Typical retail work.  Stocking shelves and assisting customers.  Enjoyed the customers a bunch.  Hard to keep up with the volume of products sold when most customers shop for 10 to 20 of one item on a regular basis.
good,"I did the breakfast bar, I cooked food such as eggs bacon  waffles stocked milk coffee juices cereal  . I also cleaned rooms after guests checkout I made beds restocked the things in the rooms such as towels shampoo soap ."
good,"The management has their favorites, and you never see any of them unless there is an emergency.  The customer are rude and snotty and hateful."
good,"needed hours reduced for social security checks, not given. "
good,"Worked here 6 months b4 getting terminated yet over half the people were worst than me. Over exceeded everyone's expectations. Overall good co workers,  some lazier than others. Supervisors here are on a power trip."
good,"The manager's treat you like garbage, and the store manager has said out of her own mouth that she doesn't care about the customer's. And the department I was in was huge and we never had any help. If you want to be treated like garbage then go work there."
good,"I was part of the over night crew.  A typical night involved time task and we had to work at a very fast pace.  The coworkers were difficult to get along with and appeared to lack any real interpersonal skills.  They were often related and dating management.  I felt threatened by a group and was harassed by them and it took management months to deal with the issues, finally it died down on its own.  This is not a place I would recommend to work for."
good,Mangement sucked never cared nor took care of us. Management just screamed and fused about us not being able to get things done when we were always short at least 3 to 5 people sometimes more.
good,"Walmart started very well. People were relaxed and enjoyed working there, now people are very stressed and try not to upset the managers because everything is always wrong. I learned how to work the cash register and be responsible with my time and I learned how to use a handheld. I had to stock items and fix things to look up to par. They were very flexible with my school hours and that helped me continue school, sometimes they were unfair and wouldn't give me any time to breath between school and work, but the flexibility helped until they started stressing us out a lot more."
good,I did like the way they treated us while working there late lunches and late breaks would make you work longer then what you were ecspected.
good,I liked working in a diverse setting.   I was able to interact with people from all walks of life and try my best to continue their great day or help them to have a better day with a bright smile and warm greetings.
good,Working at Walmart was a very fun experience because you get to meet new people. The management is not good. they don't work with school schedules. they overwork you and pay you not enough.
good,"Slow, not paid enough for how hard I worked. Managers complained about wages. Constantly being sent to different departments. Management was a mess. Co-workers were great, a lot were not friendly (greeting customers/helping). Although, there were many downfalls, management valued teamwork and being accident-free."
good,"not great, i wouldnt go back unless i was desperate. its not worth the headache or time. There are no benefits unless you work there for almost 5 years. This also includes maternity leave."
good,Employees are all helpful and friendly. Management can be unwelcoming and can seem less concerned about employees. Management should be more understanding and considerate of their employees.
good,"Having to waste my break time to walk from one end of the store to the other to log in each break."
good,ah cuando uno llega ay que limpiar y tratar de liberar el área de trabajo para recibir a los probadores y yen abarrotes hay que dar una defensa de zona y a lo que apenti fue etc
good,"Expected to train new supervisor after being there for 10 years and applying for the postion that was given away. Supervisor had ""management"" goals but was clueless with what needed to be done."
good,"Worst place I ever worked at! management employees have no respect, employees are rude and lazy. People steal lunches and personal items of employees. Management expect you to do to many tasks all together for not enough salary."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is unpredictable, your job title may be a cashier but on any given day you would have to push carts. Working at Wal-Mart I learned how to have patience and always do whatever is possible to turn negative situations into positive ones. Being in management had its challenges but I remained fair and consistent. My coworkers were some of the greatest people I could meet. The hardest part of the job is being underpaid. The most enjoyable part of the job is putting smiles on peoples faces."
good,I love the flexiblity but the remuneration is not encouraging at all. A typical day at work is really stressful. Although the nice part of working at walmart is getting to work with some interesting managers who are always ready to give a helping hand
good,"Management sucks!! All they care about is credit card applications. They do not work with your schedule it's very hard to get a day off. Also, they never give bonuses."
good,Not very structured or family oriented. Hectic scheduling and last minute call in's. Lack people and professional conduct skill among the CMS's
good,"I wasn't at this store very long, and I worked overnights so I didn't meet many people. most of the management on overnights would sleep in lawn and garden on lawn chairs at night, or just sit and talk in the office. If anyone had a question, they'd tell you to find another associate, and none of them were friendly enough to talk to."
good,"Typical day at the Wilderness Wal-Mart. Well. As a cashier, arrive, clock in, go to ""assigned register."" Work for two hours. Deal with rude customers. 15 minute break. Work another two hours. Hour lunch. Work two hours. 15 minute break. Work rest of shift. Wait forever for someone to relieve you because supervisor not paying attention. Go home."
good,"constantemente cambian las reglas, hay mucha rotacion de personal desde el personal de punto de venta hasta la gerencia. no hay opciones de crecimiento"
good,I see everyday ego`s flairing up. My direct supervisor calls fellow employee names in front of others and points the finger. Teasing joking at others because he is the Foreman.  I feel this is very negative and when you voice your concerns it comes back at you negatively.  Not a  fun work environment
good,They have their picks you never move up in this place and you don't get a raise like you should for all the work you do. You have to have the right attitude to advance and the littlest things will get you a write up.
good,"A good place to start out at for your first time job, but I would never recommend making it into a career. I've learned a lot from the company and will use my experience gained from there for a better rewarding job."
good,"There was no moving up. hard to please anyone, pay was not great. It was a minimum wage job, not something that is meant to live with forever."
good,"they all suck they do not have good management the co workers were great and they all though about the same thing."
good,"Things need to improve in the stores. Management needs to talk to the associates, not bark orders at them. The associates are people too. You can get more work done by being nice and saying please and thank you than you can by be rude and over bearing."
good,Management was very out of touch with time it takes to perform your duties You were always ask to perform an amount of work in a unacheaveille amount of time with in some cases faulty equipment or lack of.
good,Management did not work with employees they always thought that they had the right to do what they ant and put employees anywhere even though they might have been hired for something different. I did enjoy working for the company but the hardest thing was not having set hours.
good,"Un día típico en el trabajo las novedades."
good,"No room for advancement. Management was rude and not welcoming to new employees. Poor training, no benefits and did not work with your needs for scheduling. HR department was very unorganized and dishonest. They did not inform me of many benefits that I was eligible for."
good,"Overall this job was not worth what they were paying me, much to much work for the amount of workers and the management wasn't up to par. I would not apply here again unless my life depended on it"
good,The best part about wal-mart is the flexibility; with me being in school full-time my availability is limited and they work with that to get me a good amount of hours. I also love if i need more hours all i have to do is ask. Customer service is all about a team you have to use everyone's strengths to make sure your team is doing the best job they can even if that means rotating members to find the right fit. The hardest part of this job is getting everyone to pull there weight but i have no problem picking up the slack. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing your progress throughout the day and knowing you helped make it happen.
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart was usually very busy. I enjoyed the customers although most of the customers were rude at times. I dislike how some of the managers dealt with certain situations I really felt like they showed a lot of favoritism. I got along with my co workers for the most part. The co workers I did not get along with I just stayed away from.
good,"little room to go, very busy with no registers opened, low pay for such hard work. great training when dealing with customers."
good,Worked a sales associate in electronics. Helped customers find what they needed.  Answered phones.  Stocked merchandise
good,Gives customer service by taking orders in the store and over the phone. Also cooks for and slices deli meet for customers. Cleans throughout the day to provide a sanitized and safe work environment. Down stock pallets as they come in and stock the floor as often as possible. Changes models weekly according to corporate.
good,worked at walmart changing oil and tires. the managers were no good and some of the people i worked with had no clue what they were doing
good,would not recommend this to anyone. Pharmacy manager is not qualified to be a manager
good,A typical day is checking customers out.  I learned how to work a cash register.  Management does not want to hear about any thing.  I enjoy my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is when they have only 3 cashiers working on a very busy day.  The most enjoyable part of the job is getting off.
good,"This job was something that helped me get through a dry period in my work experience. I took this job in-between hospitals. I worked there for two years, and came to the decision that It does not matter what Wal Mart did the people would still shop there. Walmart could double there prices and would not loose a single customer."
good,Wal-Mart had good co-workers and moderate management. Learnt how to operate a computerized cash register. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people everyday. The hardest part was standing the majority of the shifts. Good way to start off your career in the work force.
good,"la parte mas dificil del trabajo que te hacen elejir tu familia o la compañia, tenes que vivir para waltmart para ellos nosotros la gente que trabajamos ahi somos numeros nada mas. lo bueno que gracias al trabajo que emprendi en la compañia adquiri experiencia en distintos puesto."
good,"This job requires a lot of climbing, lifting, and pulling."
good,"You learn how retail jobs are design "
good,"cashier, stocker, and modular reset team"
good,This job provided good hours but management didn't care about employees and would make you stay hours after you were supposed to leave. Behind a register this is hard.
good,"a typical day at work for me at Walmart had its ups and downs,i have learned to immediately adapt to any shift or anything that's not the usual. management was everywhere and unorganized; awesome people but unorganized. coworkers were fun and naturally laid back great team work. the hardest part of the job was the overnight hours and having to go home to still work.the enjoyable part of the job was overnights wasn't a hassle."
good,"Unloaded truck, pulled stock to the floor, Stocked shelves, binned overstock, helped out other areas. My co-workers were the best people to work with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the hot environment. The most enjoyable part was going home after my shift ended."
good,"a typical day at Walmart would consist of stocking your departments freight, and facing everything in your department and other departments. Along with helping customers whenever they needed assistance. Walmart was my first job, so in a way I really learned a lot about working. On a scale of 1-10 ;10 being the best I would rate the managment a 2. I loved working with some of my co-workers. I got along with just about everyone there. The hardest part about my job was dealing with other employes not coming into work. I really like to do my job and then get to do other jobs that where not even realted to my job."
good,company policies change like the weather.. Not all policies are followed or enforced by management. Most days are fast paced allowing one to keep their head down and just work through the day. Nothing about a typical day is consistent except the work. The only consistent with walmart is having a job each day.
good,"Their employees are expected to go above and beyond for their job but are not rightfully compensated for the rude customers or the rude managers at that. People are fired for absolutely no reason and they rehire new people what feels every month so the only people who have secure jobs no matter what happens are the managers, everyone else feels 100% expendable."
good,u can use an open door police and they might listen to u but sometimes they wont
good,"They need more assistance and better supervisors. Lack of people in charge, over all it  is a place where you do not want to work."
good,"Resourceful team player who excels at building "
good,"The hours are never the same. If you are a good worker and are annoyed by lazy people, that's a detriment to you."
good,"I love Walmart overall as a company since it first came on the scene with it's competitive prices, however working for the particular store I'm employed would tend to leave people with a bad taste in their mouth from how unprofessional some of the higher ups are including the store manager.  We work hard as the underdogs of the company to ensure that we look good as a unit and it is overlooked by management, making a lot of us dedicated employee's feel as if all of our hard work is done in vain."
good,Didn't like it at all wouldn't go back if they paid me more money.
good,"If you only want a part time job with minimum hours than Walmart is the place for you. If you want full time with good benefits, look somewhere else."
good,I was let go for leaving carts on the sales floor. It is a place were my co-workers were the best part.
good,"I enjoyed the time I spent with Wal-Mart inc., the over all atmosphere was positive."
good,"Easy place to work, good starter job or extra part time job, "
good,"No career advancement for Hispanics, associates are not appreciated for their work and are mistreated. Lack of good management a lot of favoritism from managements and bonus are not given anymore even on Christmas time.  A typical day at work was getting there to my normal shift that was at 5 pm when its normally really busy and finding the department really trashed and over 6 full baskets of returned merchandise that has to be put up and maintain the department clean and clear floors of merchandise by the end of my shift at 12 am or 1 am. The only enjoyable part of the job was that I liked the people that worked there."
good,The culture is dependent on the local and regional management.
good,"most managers don't care, market team does not care, company does not care about customers, only running the store with the bare minimum associates"
good,"A typical day at work begins by sorting out returns by department. Was in charge of sorting returns for softlines. Also answered customer's questions and concerns in regards to product availability, in stock status and ETA of product. Utilized the SMART system for inventory and item availability."
good,"Let me tell you if you work at Walmart is not b/c you want but b/c you have, with that in mind, remember Walmart is cheap so the kind a people that goes to it is not the best, people will humiliate you, your managers will make you kiss your customers butt even if they are wrong, hours are horrible one day till 1am next day at 7am, I had no life outside of Walmart and i was only a part time employee, So if u have a different option take it, Walmart is a hard underpaid and unappreciated job"
good,"Always busy in a fast paced environment which I love, helping customers, working hard loving my job.  Though my son has a medical condition and they would not excuse the days that I missed even though I had documentation of doctor notes.  I am a single mom and family is always first and they didn't really seem to care about this.  Management does not talk respectfully to employees, employees are underpaid, supervisors always complaining directly to you that your not going fast enough.  The most enjoyable part of this job is the customers meeting and greeting everyone; and knowing that my job at the end of the day meant alot to that person because I was able to help them."
good,A lot of jobs at walmart revolve around weather or not you are willing to bend over backwards for one particular manager and make it like the rest dont exist. each manager has their own agenda and dont really care about what anyone else cares or says due to the fact they are trained to believe they are right 100% of the time regardless of how many ways you can prove them wrong or show a better more effective way of doing something.
good,productive enviorment with a working place of any cultures they you an grow accustome to
good,Walmart is not a good company if you want to advance as a woman into any management.
good,"When I go into work, it is sometimes so busy that the time goes by so fast, I love when that happens. But the management in the Vision Center, where I work, is lacking. It is poor management. Other than that I like my job but feel that I need a change. I want an office type job where I can further my office skills and have the ability to move up in the company."
good,"I am sorry, you are a large company and you can't afford to pay a decent wage. Costco maintains great prices and pays their employees well."
good,"Stocking product , Assisting Customers in finding thing in the store, Cashier"
good,"I was always doing something different, i.e. constructing displays, checking out at various departments.  I learned how to get along with people in general as well as co-workers.  Management was always poor.  The hardest part of the job was not getting enough hours in a work week to make ends meet, and the pay was not that great.  I did enjoy greeting and meeting different people."
good,"A typical day at work required performing mostly refund transactions. The returned merchandise had to be processed accordingly. The work area had to be safely maintained. Also performed Western Union Send and Receive transactions. Management was a little bit difficult to work with, because the management staff was so big, every member of management had a different way for wanting things done. It was a bit of a challenge trying to please everyone. The best part of the job was when a customer walked out more than satisfied with the conclusion of their original issue."
good,I liked the people that I worked with but not the company. They had you move around all the time and you never knew what your schedule was going to be.
good,"•	Assist customers with their MoneyGram  transactions, purchasing money orders, and cashing payroll checks."
good,"Talked with customers about their presriptions, ran the cashier, counted and filled prescriptions, answered phone calls, deposited money at the end of the day to the store accountant. "
good,While working at Walmart I have seen many changes some good and some not so good but over all not a bad place to be. Benefits are decent.
good,They worked you any hours they wanted they did not take in consideration the hours that you requested nor do they take in consideration that you have a family. the pay was horrible and the hours were ridiculous.
good,No chance of advancement and no structure of management poor pay rate poor working conditions
good,they make false promises and give you the work around on everything
good,walmart only benefit is the insurance. They only care about the company and not the workers.
good,"Management is very fickle. Some are kind and will work with you realizing that you have more to like that a minimum wage job; others do not care how many mouths you have to feed or how bad you feel. "
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart would just be work. its low in pay and they treat you unfairly. I mean you have some good days but mostly bad days. Its a job but barely get the bills paid.
good,"Working there has it's ups and downs. More customer based than there is anywhere, so there is more tasks to do than there is people."
good,"A day here is like a day i rather not go to work. You go in less stressed than when you came out, the management team does a lot of unethical things and think it is ok. The management team does not appreciate there staff."
good,The most enjoyable part about my job is the customers. Of course the ones I see every night. The management is terrible. they do not communicate with each other. Or one will say one thing than the other will say something completely different. I enjoy working with my fellow associates. I learned that all managers are not the same and should not be treated as such. I say good luck to the new associates just starting out. You are going to need it.
good,"Walmart, has changed after the loss of Mr. Sam. The employee became the lowest peg on the wall."
good,"too much to do , never enough people to do it.would be better if some managers could treat employees better."
good,its a very well for a starter job or a retired person to give them something to do
good,It was an ok job I just think they make to much to pay so less. And theirs a lot of favoritism
good,I had an productive and fun work place at walmart I learn how to strip and wax floors have fun stocking
good,A job is a job. The lunch breaks are nice but if you are even a minute late for you lunch you get a coaching or written up. The managers are never around when you need then. and some of the time you being late for your lunches is the managers fault.
good,I worked at wal mart for six months and I told them before i started that I was a college student and a mother and I could not work until midnight. They told me after the fact that I could not make that choice due to high school students having to get off at 8pm. They don't care to help you when it comes to your schedule. I quit because the pay was not worth staying away from my child for so long.
good,I always had a bless day but management can use some work.I have great co-workers.I enjoy meeting different people.
good,Working at Walmart is some place you only gain experience from. A typical day at work for the most part is you are constantly doing something your schedule on the day to day basis is never the same managers will ask you to do something in a tone of voice like you are looked down upon some will walk right past you and won't even speak but when they need you to do something they will get on their walkie and say tell such and such to do this or that right after they walked past you. The reason I stayed so long was because of the people I come in contact with meaning the customers and the associates that work side by side myself. The hardest part was to reframe myself from totally just losing my head although most of the customers I come in contact with are a pleasure to be around you still had some that come and can make your whole day go bad and then when you go and get a manager they side with customer telling you their right after the customer then called you everything but the child of God.
good,"Wal-Mart took a wrong turn in 2008 by increasing the work load, but decreasing the pay scale. The benefits that Wal-Mart offer are far below par for a company so large. Bullying from management is becoming an increasing problem and has sparked the attention of the labor Unions. There have been many employees fired for bringing up the giant retailer for unfair practices."
good,I don't enjoy it to much because that management is very poor.
good,the receiving crew was easily the hardest working bunch in the company.  however we were paid less than cashiers and were expected to carry the store on our backs taking over any and every job that was understaffed and were disciplined if our original tasks were incomplete before our shift was over. around the day of my daughters birth I was denied the day off because another associate from a different department had requested off.
good,Would be an ok job if people knew what they were doing or their job title
good,"Warehouse Work"
good,"fast paced environment, friendly employees, self motivation to achieve goals, time efficiency required"
good,"the place went out of business, stressful but fun, had quotes to meet that were unreachable."
good,It was an ok job. No overtime; raises were rare.Always had to ask for breaks
good,"Interesting, you are able to meet diverse people.You	provide quality customer service by effectively communicating registering customers for many sporting credentials."
good,Wal-Mart is an excellent company to work for if you aren't looking for career advancement.
good,"typical day at work . your usually under staffed and gets busy"
good,"As a cashier my day was full of people. Management, co-workers, and gests. Every day was a learning experience. Wal-Mart is a company that changes how things are done on almost a daily bases. that is a part of there company mado. Adapting to those changes is sometimes a challenge. If a manager has had time off or is new in our area of the store, (Wal-Mart rotates there managers around the store so they will know all areas.) we were not always on the same page. Keeping up with new ideas and ways of doing things could be tricky. Team work and co-workers with great humor made the day fun. Seeing repeat gests  that came throw my lane ,sometimes just to say hi, and watching there families grow was the high light of my day."
good,"I have never belonged in a retail work environment.  Although I can align with ""the customer is always right"", my issue is with the variations of customers and the rights they claim to abuse employees when they are not satisfied. However, at that time in my life, I graciously and gratefully accepted a year of employment at Walmart while looking for my career in South Texas."
good,"Stressful Work Place, Don't care about Employees. Profit is King."
good,"Management played favorites a lot, and pushed us very hard.  The work was easy though, and for the most part everyone got along.  I would not go back however because I do not like being treated poorly by management.  I am able to get along with anyone I run into, except for the managers at Walmart in Stow, Ohio."
good,I would come into work right after school and work till 9 or 10 at night. I would start with opening my register and end the night with the same drawer and counting my money to make sure everything added up. The costumers that came through my line were most of the time nice. Then at times you had an upset costumer about something in the store or a wait because of the costumer in front of them. I would try to greet them with a smile and try to brighten their day as much as possible. I love working with the public it helps with giving you penitents. I had a very high IPH which was items per hour. The hardest part of my job was they breaks I was never given and the hours that I worked. I enjoyed my co-works very much and were all very nice and would help when I needed it. The management so were nice and helpful others seem to not care about their employees. 
good,"I worked for Wal-Mart for a very long time. I put in a lot of time and effort to doing my job, training people, staying late to help when short staffed. Yet Employers made me not take lunches because they were short staffed, then take the lunches after I stayed after to help , my shift would end at seven in the morning I would stay til nine even ten sometimes and then they would force me to take my lunch before I would leave. The managers do not care if you are very Ill, saying because they make you stay out in the rain cleaning up after a bad storm and then make you go inside sopping wet to do more stocking, and then you catch pnemonia and they try to fire you because you have to take time off. Or better yet, when injured on the job like i was, i pinched nerves in the cervix nerve 4.5.and 6. They told me to take an asprin, then continue to work, then i finally sawa doctor, they showed what I did, after four sessions of Physical Therapy they told me I was meracuosly healed, and yet I have such sever Migraines now because of this that I have Botox Treatments for the Migraines. Or the part where when I finally left they came to me the day before and made me sign a piece of paper saying they should have been paying me  over a dollar more than they had been, mind this is when the lawsuits were coming out about women not getting fair pay. They made me sign that piece of paper nad made me leave earlier than my two weeks notice. Or the fact that managers were allowed to be on narcotics and ride around on motorized scooters to tell people how ineffeciaent they are, and when short staffed"
good,"asked multiple times to be trained on the high-lo. they refused. management didn't follow their own rules they set. had 4-5 managers working at one time, all giving different orders. due to theft over holidays all hours would be cut by half to compensate for the loss of money, they would then make us work 2-3 peoples jobs to keep the store running. horrible work experience with this company"
good,The staff is very rude and make up poor excuses to let you go. They have terrible management who doesn't know where to send you on the registers. They will send you to customer service or self check out without the knowledge how to work them.
good,"Nice people to work with, busy work environment. Wish there was more advancement."
good,It's not a job it's Wal-Mart. They are more of a family then co-workers.
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart, just sad that my health would not let me continue."
good,On a typical day at work I was given many responsibilities. Some were my daily task but most was someone else duties that they've fallen short on. I spent more time at work than with my family and I never had all the equipment /supplies I needed to do my job completely.
good,"Often difficult to find a manager, no upward advancement potential.  Co-workers all very nice.  The hardest part of the job was that it never changed from day to day."
good,Its a tough place to work if you are not strong. Working there prepares you mentally for any job out there.
good,At work you never knew who to listen to. There was always @ least 3 managers there during the daytime and all of them would want you to do what they asked. It was very unorganized. I learned that walmart is not the best place to work because of management. I got along with all my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was trying to figure out who I was supposed to be listening to. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers.
good,In Wal-Mart you have to come to work with a solid focus on getting through the day. Make sure you aren't easily angered because the management's mindsets are not all on the same page. So what the actual procedures and rules are could be over rode at any moment. Just come to work with an open mind and the day will fly by. Making yourself smile is what it's all about. 
good,"Wal-mart is a job that has it's pros and cons. I enjoy the fast-paced, busy work environment. However, there is not much room for advancement with adequate pay rates and the benefits package is not that appealing."
good,"I love to shop at this place, but the work enviornment was not my favorite."
good,"Managers are understanding and friendly, when it came to work the managers had unrealistic expectations."
good,"Being a retail store, the pay is not good at all.  Advancement is easy to come by, but the raise associated with a promotion is something to laugh at.  It's fast paced so that was a plus in my book, and always something going on to fix. Upper management was horrible."
good,"1. Management has a fear- management style that has been the DNA of the company for 50 years."
good,"Lots of work for little, management was horrible! People always at each others throats, pay was not worth the amount of work expected, never a thank you for working over or helping out, work hours changed from week to week."
good,The management doesn't care about you or anything else.  They want you to be available 24/7 and then only give you 10 hours a week.  They will also bring you in a hour before night shift starts so they don't have to pay you for the night shift bonus.  They promise you the job opening up then give it to an unqualified person who knows nothing about the job while you were training for it for over six months.
good,"empresa sem oportunidades de crescimento , não muito agradável de trabalhar . "
good,I was employed for 18&1/2 years & was a loyal employee. The management team was not very good to work for.Health Insurance wasn't very good.
good,"A typical day at work i come it at 4:00 PM and we get the backroom set up to unload the General Merchandise truck. we pull pallets out of the backroom and then set empty pallets down nicely to stack the freight neatly on them. We make sure the back room is clean and work safe. we unload how ever many trucks there are then make sure everything is separated. then go to lunch come back and pull all pallets to the floor for graveyard stockers to stock. After we pull all pallets we will do inventory control in back room such as picks, audits, bin audits, etc... After we finish that up we clean backroom and get any pallets down from upper steel to pull to floor. i have learned a lot of work ethics, inventory control, management skills, how retail runs. Management at Wal-Mart are quite unfair and absolutely dont take work serious enough in my opinion and they don't work as hard as they should as well, this is one reason i want to move up and work hard and get better pay to take care of my family. Most of my co-workers are wonderful people they work very hard and have a lot of potential to do great things. The hardest part of the job is being in the middle of mornings management and graveyards management, one will tell us one thing and the other will tell us something completely different they don't stay in contact which leads us to getting in trouble. The most enjoyable part of the job is just the atmosphere with my fellow truck crew members."
good,I had a fun time there learning new things and meeting new people.
good,it a good company to start with but it hard to move up in the company
good,Like talking to people that come to check out.
good,A tpical day at work is hard and long.
good,"Problem solving is daily. Either machine or personable. Management is good for the most part. Lately they have weeded out the workers who do not perform to their requirements so there are no issues with current employees. The hardest part of my job is doing my job, yet management seems to reverse our guidelines and change rules, for profit."
good,Walmart wasn't a horrible place to work. It was very difficult to get promoted or move around in the business. I really enjoyed everyone I worked with.
good,Great people and not too bad a place to work. The electronics department needs more workers and more management assistance.
good,Typical day helping customers with the photo machine and with cameras. Also assisting with everything electronics.
good,I go in to work and ill start in hardware. make paint and help the customers. then I end up getting pulled to the front registers and have to help customers. then i go back to hardware and try to get everything done there.
good,"Answered phones, transferred calls to different departments, sort and stock merchandise, supervised fitting room, cashier"
good,a job that works their works hard for little pay and they have good health benefits that was a plus for me.
good,"Management is absolutely horrible. Hours will kill you, and you will pretty much live at Walmart. They like to work you late at night, and then expect you to show up really early in the morning. You can only miss 3 days in a rolling 6 month period which is pretty stupid considering in the winter most people get sick often. I was a cashier, and I can sincerely say that is the worst position. You're standing in one place for two hours which kills your legs. Also it's Walmart so you're constantly busy, and people come through with 3 buggies full of food. It's completely ridiculous."
good,When i first began to work at Walmart i loved it but as time went on it became more difficult. When i was in school it was very hard to change my schdual aroud to work around my classes. During my pregnancy they were not understanding of sudden doctors appointments and didnt accept doctors notes when having to miss work.
good,I unloaded tractor trailers with pallets of merchandise and filled the shelves. I made friends with co-workers which was the good part. The management was difficult because nothing was good enough for them. The night assistant managers were difficult with all employees.
good,"take care of all customers first and foremost. managed both fabric and craft departments control inventory , boost sales with demos and "" mini' classes.Cut and measure fabric for both customers and inventory team (yearly.) Reset and redo entire craft and fabric departments every six months. responiable for ordring and maintaining inventory. training of new emploees. cashier,customer service trained. was support manger for 6 months."
good,ringing up customers and 2 breaks and 1 lunch.
good,Only half of the supervisors were fair and we worked underhanded most of the time they had us working in other areas because of this
good,working there was okay I guess. the new management seemed inexperienced and they constantly changed their minds about how they wanted things done. my coworkers were alright.
good,"A typical day goes by fast. There is allways something to do. Ive learned that the more you pay attention the better it is for everyone. Management needs help. Co workers are usualy pleasant, and fun. The hardest part is knowing you cant help most customers yourself you are to allways wait for management. The best part is knowing you helped someone and made there day a little bit brighter just because of your personality, and a good outlook on life"
good,"Walmart neighborhood market was a difficult place to work. Managment didn't treat the associate with respect.If managment saw you talking to other associates you would get in trouble.Theyhad a big turn around in associates because they didn't make the associates feel welcome, they made you feel stressed out all of the time. Very hostil work envirenment."
good,"Aprendi muitas coisas trabalhando lá.Passei por vários setores da empresa,uma pena que eles não paga salário justo e a gerência nao valoriza os funcionários.Lá funciona assim!Uma pessoa faz várias funções diariamente."
good,"would be great if managers cared about more than what would make them look good,"
good,My experience with Walmart wasn't too good. I only worked there a month with the hopes of becoming permanent and was let down. My hours were so different every day that I never knew if I was going to be working the whole time or not. Also I got pulled around from department to department and never worked in the same place more than once a day. Too many Cheifs and not enough Indians.
good,"A typical day Walmart is fun, customers are nice, and I really enjoyed working there, I have learned alot of things that I know I will carry with me to my next job. Management on the other hand if they did like you they let it be known. My co-workers are friends that I will keep in my life for along time. Most enjoyable part of my job was service to the customers and making them feel good."
good,Me personal didn't like Wal-Mart. It was not enough benefits and make you work and it's not worth it.
good,get to work around some really good people. getthe hours but the pay should be more
good,Decent place to work if you don't mind working minimum hours for minimum wage
good,It's a fun fast paced work environment which i learned to be more productive with my hands and customer service and interactions with people and co-workers. Management is the hardest part at my location because of them were so much younger and inexperienced and I think at the time they needed someone who was much more mature and professional and could meet the customers needs and quality. Fix that and I believe it would make a tremendous difference in the workplace.
good,I am grateful to have a job at my age...especially in Las Vegas. I work in Lawn & Garden and truly enjoy that environment and the people with whom I work. We have a strong work ethic as a team and all get along very well. The department Manager is wonderful and motivates all of us. I have learned a great deal about our department and the seasonal transitioning we have to make. I enjoy every aspect of Customer Service and being a cashier. There is no difficult part of this job.
good,i liked working there but the managment i was not too thrilled about they were to much on a power trip and treated us like we were slaves
good,"It had great pay but you really worked hard to earn it. Management is biased, having favoritism, and only caring about their numbers. They have a fault policy that holds people accountable for missing work or coming in late even if a parent had a heart attack, there is no mercy or a child being taken to the hospital. You can be fired for not producing enough production, and they raise it every year. You can be fired for having a cell phone visible if they don't like you while others get a warning."
good,Typical day- Checking to make sure everything was caught up as far as temps and holding times.
good,"Handling money, interacting with customers, making sure the store was clean and in order, I made displays, answered customers questions, and helped out where it was needed."
good,"This job of employment was perfect for when I was in High School and college, but when I began to create my own little family Wal-Mart failed to give any work/life balance. Every holiday was suppose to be alternated one on, one off. This always failed because the turnover rate was near 40% because as an established tradition at Wal-Mart is the hire and fire technique that produces everyday low prices for the general public. Management made unsensable decisions when it came to continuing employment. The best way to remain employed was to point of finger and whoever it landed on was fired."
good,"A typical work day at walmart was a bit challenging sometimes. I've learned alot more about customer service, as well as different handling different payment types."
good,they cut my hours down to like 15 a week after they hired more cashiers and they had me unloading the trucks at cashier sallary
good,"Daily in the position I am in now we have to scan outs and lows, take care of customers(sometimes we are asked to shop with them so they get everything they need or place special orders for them), make sure all the merchandise in the back room is in the proper place and all have the correct counts, price changes, on hand changes, and any reports they want us to work that day. Through the over all store the moral is low. The management team is stressed out which goes down the ladder to us and makes the whole store miserable."
good,"As one of the leading companies of America, they have the power to turn this economy around if they would support and purchase from manufacturers in the United States."
good,lots of work with little pay.
good,changed tires and oil
good,"Walmart is a good job, if you like retail. The managers have no idea what family is unless it is their family."
good,not the best place to work. stressful if you get on the Asst. Mgr bad side they will find things to get you in trouble for
good,"Ghetto , gossip , favoritism , ghetto ."
good,Walmart is a great company and I have nothing bad to say about the company itself. I enjoy customer service. There's truly CLICKS at Wal-Mart. There was multiple personalities and you just don't know what or who they are or even how to deal with them at times. I like Wal-Mart because it gets very busy. Managers that acknowledge only managers and not even speak or acknowledge anyone else was very obvious. CSM forget to give you a break but everyone else around gets a break. A Manager that was over front line was forever and ever in a very bad mood and spoke poorly to customers and to employees she pretty much had them scared to death of her. Which makes it an environment unpleasant to be around.
good,"the job was very cheery, but in order to get any hours, you had to meet the commission, I find that very hard as I am not a pushy person."
good,"Work wasn't typical. Some days were fairly easy, while others were hard. I learned how to manage my time, how to communicate effectively with customers, and how to manage different areas of the store. Management was okay, sometimes I felt that they were not communicating enough with the workers. the hardest part was carrying heavy objects a pallet. it could be very draining. i enjoyed meeting new people."
good,not that great of a place to work management were very unprofessional like
good,Herrin Wal-mart is a great place to work if you want to work a Wal-Mart that isn't as big as a super center.
good,"Work my department; consumable returns, food claims, zone, backroom, pull pallets, and any project my supervisor assigns me."
good,"Decorate cake orders, bake bread,make doughnuts, do price maintance, and inventory"
good,Stress from the time you walkin until you are lucky to get off
good,A typical day of work starts with a tour of my Departments. I figure out which are the most high priority tasks and start from there. I visit each one of my department heads and give them there tasks for the day. I will check back with them several times a day to check on their progress. I feel that I do learn something new every day. I absolutely love my co-workers and get along with them famously. The hardest part of the job is when there are call-ins in multiple departments. This leaves us short handed and sometimes morale will get a little on the low side. When this happens we adapt and overcome. The most enjoyable part of my job is the respect I have earned from the 38 employees that are my responsibility.
good,"stock merchandise, learn how to do price checks, counts mods. the associates their are the best people to work with. the hardest part of the job is working with management. the most enjoyable part of my job is the customers."
good,"a typical day consist of customer interaction, process returns, cashing payroll check, making bill payments, processing moneygram request, sales, requesting start-up monies need for the day, and delivery of return to department at close of night."
good,Typical day was from 6am to 10 or 11pm Long days. I learned that no matter what i dont leave till the job is done.
good,There were to many young kids who tried being better than one another instead of focusing on there job. I was going to be taking off the register and placed on the floor in the pet section until others stated that it was not fair to them so I was forced to stay on the register.
good,I was a cashier here so i checked out customer items. I really didnt learn much at this facility the management was not very helpful and i never really conversated with the other employees. the hardest part was being on my feet all day.
good,"I worked for two stores while working for walmart, one in the Phx area and one in Tucson. My first store, was so wonderfull, i never had an issue while working there. Everyday i looked forward to going to work and doing my job to the best of my ability. Then, when i transfered to Tucson, everything went downhill. For one, I was never introduced to any of the upper managment, the store manager walked by me many times and I had no clue. My immideiate managers and supervisors were just terrible. i evenyually began to hate going to work and my quality of work started to suffer. My last day at that store was a celebration that i would never have to go back."
good,"easy going job, people you work with are nice, fun contests between departments and shifts as well as a zoo trip for charity"
good,"picked up carts in loot stocked the shelves, and was a cashier."
good,"I was hired as maintenance, but I always get placed in another department, like stock. Co-workers will pretend to help,won't give you instructions until you mess something up then say ""you should have asked!"" They are so strict on wating the job done no matter how many customers stop you for help, but will fire you if you work overtime.I'm classified as part time but mainly get full time hours.If I was full time in the system, I would get benefits."
good,"Due to the constant policy changes and rewrites in processes, it became very difficult for managers to be consistent and solid in there training and mentoring of there subordinates. This led to low moral and insecurity in there job futures. Walmart Inc focuses on there bottom line. More and more there priority has become more profit focus and less overall respect for customers and associates."
good,"A cart pusher is one of the worst jobs ever. Wal-mart don't care about your safety at all. They will make you push the carts in the snow, rain, thunder and lighting storms. It don't matter what the weather is like. Plus you have to deal with cars at wal-mart and their cart pushing machines suck."
good,"bad management, and racial prejudice , needs better management"
good,The company itself is a great place to work for. Unfortunately the management can be a bit lacking and they pick their favorites. They don't really allow much chance for advancing within the company as you would think.
good,I only worked here because I needed a job. This was the worst place ever to work. The manager's where horrible.
good,There is room for you to move up in this work place. Raises are minimal but you do get them everytime you get a good review.
good,They don't want you to have a life outside of Wal-Mart. They will invent ways to get rid of you if they don't like your personality. They will not listen when you have something to say.
good,"You can climb up the positions. However, certain people are favored whether they are new or older employees. There are a few managers who will help everyone. Other managers tend to look after a selective few."
good,"The people you work with and their managers are a nightmare. Constant drama and favoritism you'd think you're back in high school. If you're not a favorite they will do everything they can just to upset you. Completely unprofessional. I've watched the CSMs hit and pinch people but since management likes them, they don't do anything about it. Front end is the worst place to be. Good luck trying to get a raise or promotion. They rarely work with your schedule and will otherwise tell you to get over yourself. If they ever get rid of the people in the front then maybe it could be a good place to work."
good,I enjoyed the seminars and some of the relaxing techniques. The company pushes to meet goals and does reward their employees with rewards.  I do feel management could have done a better job training and helping production when things slow down and work orders are piling up.
good,"I don't find the job there to be to bad, they just expect more work then what they pay you for, example you get min wage an they expect $20 an hour worth of work out of you."
good,Overall a fair place to work and learn thing to advance and excel but only if you have proper leadership and guidance respect for employees is minimal
good,"I did enjoy working here until the mangers and the csm starting become a pain in the butt they have no respect what’s so ever and the other employees have no respect for other people "
good,"-management and personnel is rude"
good,They don’t benefit workers with the right medical insurance. They also require you to pay quite a bit just to have the insurance. Management doesn’t entirely care about their employees
good,"Look, I liked my assistant manager, he was absolutely amazing, but the rest of the management team were biased. If you weren't a 'favorite' of the store manager, you were basically bullied."
good,It was about the employees it was about who the manament liked better. When they post a job they already knew who was getting the job they never interviewed and choose the most qualified associate.
good,"A empresa é muito boa em relação a benefícios, mas infelizmente é contida por pessoas pouco profissionais, são movidas por sentimentos."
good,I loved working there but you never see you actual boss just his minions know as CSM. Or every know and then a higher up and everyone freaks when they come in
good,"Could be a great place to work if the managers were actually held to a moral standard. Managers are lazy, demanding and never want to help you advance."
good,"Es una buena escuela para aprender cosas que te aprendes en la universidad, y hacerlo practico. Mucho trabajo en el área de operación"
good,The management doesn’t care about their employees and keeps all the money for themselves they only care about the store looking clean but can’t do it themselves
good,During my experience working at Walmart I provided great customer service to the people that came in however management was all over the place.  One manager would tell you to do one thing other would come behind them and tell you to do something else. Also their scheduling isn't so great I requested weekends off and they gave me a few weekends off then scheduled me back to weekends shortly after.
good,"The job is fast-paced.  If you love such a job, then it is ok.  You have to be standing continuously for two hours at a stretch, which is not always good for your body.  Muscle cramps, back pain, etc. are byproducts."
good,"I worked as a cashier at Walmart for awhile. The Front end manager at the time was very unprofessional and quite miserable. I was always stationed at the far end by grocery which was very high paced. A few of my co workers said they were told if they didn't push the Mastercard hard enough their jobs were in jeopardy. "
good,The other employees were easy to get a long with but the managers didn't understand if it took longer to do something because I had just started working there and they didn't train me at all really I learned on the fly.
good,Honestly Walmart is a great company to work for as long as you’re okay with doing other people’s work and coming to work even if you’re very sick. Don’t expect to move up even if they tell you that you’re gonna because they just want you to work harder and pick up managements slack.
good,"I enjoyed working with Wal-Mart, although I didn't feel they treated their employees the best at all times it was a good company to work for because of the benefits and hours of work they provided."
good,Management was mean and unwilling to provide adequate shifts to live off of. I had a baby while working there and no accommodations were made to help the transition. Benifits didn't exist.
good,Not really a bad place to. Depending on who you are working for. Some of the managers are really nice people. But they pick and choose who they do for.
good,"It’s ok company to work for, the management and leadership could be better, but other then that I loved my job and position and the great customer that comes in Walmart."
good,Your satisfaction while working here is completely dependent upon your store and assistant management personnel. It is also based on your individual wants and desires.
good,Some managers  are not on their job so it's a mess . An when you tell them about it they dont care . The pay was great the managers wasnt to good nor the supervisors.
good,"Stock shelves, organize products. Help customers with their purchases. Assist other co-workers. Clean aisle and work area. prepare store for morning associates."
good,"The company has unrealistic expectations for stocker.sales associates, that are there to weed our anyone. The management does not respect anyone's preferred pronouns, and discriminates against anyone that isn't cis gendered."
good,"High turnover, decent wages but severe lack of respect in the workplace. Health insurance is high, not enough sick time but the stock purchase option is nice."
good,They seem to promote a lot of young females to be assistant manager over middle aged males with college degrees and the store manager's hate any opinions other than there's and any push back they hate letting you have family and time off
good,Walmart was a gateway job Really. Something to put food on the table but not permanent. The environment is a little tense. Other employee's would try to get you into trouble.
good,I have none. I didn't find that working there is an appealing place to work. I felt that for any advancement I would have to be hired as already have a position in an advanced position. Furthermore I don't see Walmart as a good place to work. It may be good for a first job starter position bunt for a career.
good,The management is poor. Alot of lazy workers. You have to pull other people slack.  There's alot of favoritism. I would advise you to not work here if you cant work under pressure beacuse the managers dont do anything. They just put pressure on employees to get everything done.
good,"C’est intéressant pour un étudiant, car les horaires sont quand même flexible, mais c’est un travail éprouvant moralement et physiquement. Bref, si vous avez d’autres opportunités passez votre chemin."
good,"No life balance, no thanksgiving or Christmas with family in 13 years working there. Work hours all over the place..one day closing next day opening, different days off each week."
good,"Good"
good,"I give Walmart a ""D"".   They try to cheat their employees.   I really don't have anything good to say about Walmart.  Training is almost nonexistent and it seemed they expected the employee to already know the things they were training the employee for."
good,I have experience discrimination in walmart due to my inability to work extremely fast but I saw other employees slacking and taking longer than I did and they didn't get in trouble but I did. Management needs a lot of improvement in all departments. The workplace culture can be both very pleasant and very toxic. The hardest part of the job is to meet the impossible standards of the managers. The most enjoyable part of the job and rewarding is to help customers and bring a smile to their faces.
good,The managers do not listen to you. They overwork you if they feel you are a good worker. They schedule you on holidays. They dont pay attention to days you have called off. The only way to have a good day at work while working there is by not having rude customers. Because the work environment sucks......as long as the managers who do not care
good,management values brown nosing above hard work. even wrong customers will be treated as right at your expense. Some coworkers are great. no cost of living increases means that you will end up training someone that makes more than you
good,"This experience was monstrous. The store manager was very capable and understanding, but when he wasn’t around his underlinings would screw with employees and bully anyone expressing an interest to advance. I left because the situation had grown borderline abusive and they were placing their competitiveness over the needs of the store/company. I’ve since moved on to muuuuch better things and chalk this up to a failed experiment."
good,"okay so this job started out great but now i’m feeling like i’m not valued, they let me know how replaceable i am. ever since i talked about getting a new job they’ve acted different."
good,"Walmart seems like a good place to work, but management is horrible and working atmosphere is not that great! They work you like dogs and if you go up and beyond don’t expect any thanks!"
good,"As an employee you don't feel important, they taught me right off the bat to never say ""no"" to a customer. Each customer supposedly represents a hundred dollars. They fail to tell you how abusive these customers can really be. When they abuse you the management doesn't really defend you. I worked at the Scarborough Super Centre, I got robbed on my way home and the management wouldn't accommodate my shifts to an earlier time. I would say if you're a young female opt to work in the daytime, if not don't take it unless you drive. It's an okay job but I can certainly say there are better jobs out there. This is the sort of job you do while you're in school, it's not a job you can really make much of a living on."
good,I would not recommend working as I have not had the best experience since I was part-time. Please reconsider being back in the job market and looking for other opportunities as the work-life balance is very poor.
good,"* My work day would begin with signing into my register and making sure my area was clean and inviting to my customers, whom I always greeted with a big smile, and bid them happy farewell."
good,"Management Sucks, They're always rude. Not Really Professional. Its a messy work environment because of everyone's behavior and attitude towards each other. Honestly the hardest part of the job is dealing with Co-workers"
good,"If you're looking for a part time job while in high school, college, or trying to get your feet under you, Walmart is a great place to start. Day-to-day it's pretty monotonous, scan and bag, scan and bag. Pretty good for someone who is retired and bored too!"
good,I was stressed the entire time I worked at this establishment. Everything is fast paced because of the location and the managers hardly being present.
good,"Was a decent job. Good hours , good pay but the production percent that you have to reach every week is Ridiculous I was getting written up for 97 percent 98 percent even though there where ppl goofing off only getting 70 percent there was no difference and it's all about the person next to you if they are working good you will do better and vis versa that needs to change ."
good,"I struggled to have a life outside of work such as being sick, having emergencies, or being there for my family. But it was an okay place to start work"
good,I applied for unemployment was accepted and then your company fought it and now I'm paying back over 3000.00 in wages from unemployment that I was entitled to....I loved my job I went to the store manager and asked for a 2nd chance He said I was a good worker and I could come back in 6 months I was furious I was not terminated those words were not used when they told me.     a
good,The only thing i liked is it worked with my schedule. I really don't want to fill this out. If u need a job asap to to Wal-Mart its easy to get hired and they really ro work with your schedule.
good,"I work multiple jobs. I am great with time management, I dont burn out much. I asked for an earlier shift and management turned that down i kept asking, I talked to the department manager and they said yea I could use someone in the morning and it would be great if it was you. Still no. It took way too long for me to get an early shift. Another problem was cashiering! Keep in mind we were ending garden, in the middle of halloween and starting christmas. Theres too much going on for them to call me up front to satisfy themselves. I am always called up front to help check, EVERY SINGLE DAY AN HOUR BEFORE I LEAVE! It's bad. Never get your numbers if you do work there. Overall MY department was the best and it was fun and interesting so I dont regret that part of the job."
good,I among many others have found that if you have to take time off for anything including to be in the hospital You will be terminated. And don't try to sue them for discrimination. NOONE WILL TAKE YOUR CASE! Everyone is afraid to take on Wal-Mart
good,"I liked working at Walmart, but the scheduling is a nightmare.  No two weeks are ever the same, and your hours are set at corporate headquarters so the ability to get a more conducive schedule doesn't really exist.  The discount was nice."
good,"I absolutely loved my job at Walmart I wished they would have let me do more of it without having me go work someone else's area... I do think that their associates as well as management should be skilled in verbal communication, and interaction with people."
good,They work there staff very hard  They do not let you work full time so they do not have to give you overtime You have to know someone to get places They want you to work fast and make no mistakes
good,"Wal-mart could be a great place to work, if only they cared about their employees as they care about changing things in the store. Sam Walton would be very upset if he were alive today at how they treat their staff."
good,They never know what's going on in the store . They expect the associates to be able to fix all there problems. That store is in a downward spiral to be closed
good,"It was a great starter job after graduating high school , I was able to learn a few new skills and network. Some managers did their jobs well and there were nice customers occasionally."
good,Advancement management positions Hard to come by especially being a woman of color and I work at the excellent my job appointment outstanding customer service wonderful competent interesting and no advancement there’s been people after me employed with Walmart and have moved Towards there goal in advancement racial factor matter
good,"Always kept busy. Seek out opportunities for growth, but sometimes became difficult. Did get the chance to move to different departments and have a wide learning experience."
good,Customer are disrespectful they would make you clean bathrooms if that wasn’t in your job description it was a bad experience for me around I wouldn’t refer anyone
good,Overall it is really not a bad job. But the management in my opinion is awful. They don't have any respect for their employees or how they feel. And that kind of just makes the job terrible.
good,Takes away personal sicktime and expects to not get sick or have personal family issues to resolve attendence. The managers werent really great at making sure thing were in tip top shape.
good,Boss sucked but it was a good place to work. Don't expect time off. Good luck calling in sick without getting fired. You only get to call in 4 times before you get fired.
good,I was there 17 years and because I tried to stand up for my self and I didn’t do exactly what a manger said I got fired so I guess when a customer cussed at me and flipped me off I was just supposed to take it
good,My time with Walmart was not so decent at time managers could not communicate with the employees about what needed to be done nor did they even explain when the maid a mistake of them self’s
good,"the management only cared about themselves and their profits,"
good,"It had great benefits, ok as a starter job, decent pay, fair bonuses, time off, ok discounts, great co workers to be around, but it lacked good management"
good,"You have to wait a year to get benefits. And you have to be working 32 hours or more. The low pay makes it hard. to stay there a years. If you need a job until you get a better job, Walmart is a good place to work."
good,Management was not professional. Continually asked to do other jobs not hired for. Employee cliques form immediately and not all are treated fairly. There were employees on the floor with learning disabilities and limited reading skills and management seemed to be ignorant of the fact. Asking for assistance if you become lost or confused is almost impossible and frowned upon. I did not feel comfortable in my position
good,"Personally, i had a bad experience; overnight cashiers do have to stock as well as cashier, i even had to pull a grocery pallet, i hurt myself and they took almost a month to send me to the doctors. Always ask the employee how it is before applying.its nearly impossible to switch to daytime from overnight (at least at my store) would recommend days (day management is nice )overnight not so much(@ my store)"
good,It was an ok experience  a lot of time put in rarely had any days off  very team oriented reached a glass ceiling doesn’t particularly promote from within
good,understaffed and under appreciated management has there favorites not a family orientated company to work for they don't really care how your department looks unless corporates is in the building
good,Hope to be pro employee oriented. Help retention by training and providing advancement. Be fair. Listen. Encourage. Stop looking for what's wrong and start looking at what is right.
good,Ring customers merchandise and make gun sales as well as ran background checks. I also did fishing license while at the gun counter and ran inventory on ammo.
good,"Walmart is a okay company to work for. Whenever you need help you can talk with personnel. Their family oriented, and they try their best to approve days to be off need be."
good,Very very very poor management at the Northeast store.  I wouldn't recommend the job as long term. The deli is very short handed so they work you like dogs then tell you your wrong.. all the time.
good,Working at Walmart was fun at times. You get to meet new people and make a lot of lasting friendships. Laid back managers that made you feel comfortable and were easy to talk to. The work loaf can be overwhelming at times but you’re always surrounded by co-workers who make your time fun.
good,Un mal bien te laboral predilección falta de organización
good,Management do not care if you are right are wrong. All they try to do is make money. The workers kiss up to the managers because they do not want to lose their jobs.
good,"The work itself wasn't strenuous, however, a lack of direction in terms of management, i.e, conflicting ideas drags employees in the middle of petty disputes and work ethic suffers due to it."
good,Work you like a dog and not offer much advancement. Any profitable advancements must be paid into courses and college degrees with little to no encouragement
good,"I would not recommend working for this company for any extended amount of time. It makes a wonderful summer job, or a ""until i finish.... I.e. college, training, Don't need a second job"" option. I have watched the policies change mercilessly over 10 years causing many to lose their jobs for simply having preexisting medical conditions, to politics, while other move up based on friendship rather that earnest work. The health benefits are horrible. To the extent is has been better for me to go without health insurance at all. their willingness to work with your person schedule is non-existent."
good,"Muita função pouco reconhecimento."
good,A typical day at walmart is filled with stress fast paced involvement that chalenges all the best atributes one has.the coustumers are number one.working at walmart has taught me excelent coustomer service and while also respecting the individual and working clean to provide a safe invoirment for the coustomer and other associates.
good,"Its an alright place if you need a job. Just like any other place of work, just go in mind your p's and q's get your money. If you listen to the people who work there you will be miserable like them."
good,I was hired to stock clean and organize the toy department of the store on 3rd shift I wouldn't say I learned much from this job as it was very self explanatory the workplace culture was ok as this shift appeared to be a shift for part time work the hardest part of the job came mid shift as my body hadn't gotten use to the hours and this is when I began drinking coffee. The most enjoyable part of the job was being alone to work independently in my section till end of shift
good,"Walmart was a very unorganized establishment and that effected every associate in the store in a very negative way, manages there are very passive until the regional manager comes"
good,My overall experience working there was great. Most of the people I met was nice. I felt welcomed by most. Management could be a lil more nicer to their workers but most of all I enjoyed it
good,This company was based of family and they expect you to forget about yours won’t work with you on hours and always cutting hours. Don’t bother opening your availability you still won’t get hours Walmart has gotten worse.
good,"I loved my job when I started, but then I realized how rude, hateful and two faced the overnight stock team was. Will be in your way when you are clearly trying to clean, will expect you to clean up their trash and every little spill they make. I was accused of numerous things that I did not do (drama) and just quit because I couldn't take the bs anymore. It's pathetic that grown people act so immature at a job!"
good,"Have to be available 24/7 to be considered full time. No balance in the scheduling, have to work all weekends unless requested off. Management doesn’t care about employees or if they need time off for family care."
good,Never is this statement more true than at Walmart.  With proper management the entire store works like a finely tuned engine; without it be elsewhere!
good,"While working at Walmart I got pregnant, I was constantly degraded for not completing as much work 'expected of me', "
good,"The work, pay, and hours were good. Management was terrible. Everything they say when hiring you is untrue so double check all paperwork before signing it."
good,Starting off the day with cooking or slicing meat or loading the rotisserie chickens there was always something to do if you weren’t helping customers sometimes it was slow on the weekends it was really busy. Lazy department everyone asked me to do everything even when I was there for the least amount of time. The hardest part is when we were understaffed and it was busy.
good,"Poor management, no problem solving, not understanding when requesting time off, expect you to work passed your scheduled hours then complain about overtime. I was always told I couldn’t keep the overtime and that I needed to take an extended lunch"
good,"the management is petty and very unprofessional, duty managers are loud,crude and often times bullies! "
good,"Only if you are ready to forgo your life and family then, you may be able to grow. There is no job security. If they don't like your face you can't get to nowhere, really. They abhor saying it as it is. Just keep faking it to suit their expectations. But, you will learn a lot about retail working with Walmart!"
good,"Management is unorganized, always understaffed , little or no break , a lot of jobs you do we’re not on your job description due to the lack of staff."
good,This job could be way better honestly I deserve a better pay. And ive worked so hard and havent moved up in my career at all and I would rather have a different job
good,Management was difficult to deal with or reach when needed. Too much about numbers. Patients do not come first and there is little being done to help them out at the minimum. Never enough staffing for needs.
good,"Management constantly lied about job security, advancement opportunities. I recommend this job as a first job, but experienced workers should find a different opportunity."
good,Wal-Mart is a very fast pace place to work no matter what position you work you are always on your feet. The mangement is poor vut the employers you work with make it worth it plus the pay is amazing.
good,This job is fun..I enjoy talking to all kinds of  people..I would like to move  around to another dept to learn more about retail.  I want to learn all aspects of retail.
good,was a great night to see how you were doing so today we are going on the schedule and I just got off the phone and I have a few things going on in my car I wanna I need you I wanna was your was a really good night I was going on the day and I’m so tired I
good,It was nice to work for Walmart.  It was a learning opportunity. Thank you for experience. Company is doing something. Location was good. Timing was decent.
good,Its okay money to start management was bad the managers never helped they just walked doing nothing . Everyone was super lazy and got angry easily. Its a great place to meet new people i always saw customers that i knew from years back and that was great. I didnt like working from 2pm to 11pm i slept late and woke up late i didnt like that
good,Management clearly doesn't care about you. You are promised things you never get. If you learn different departments they throw you around constantly and expect everything from you.
good,"depending on the management the work is fun "
good,"Each time I returned from break or lunch I was moved to a new register, having to move all my things each time.  I did enjoy talking with the customers and helping them with special needs."
good,I'm a person that is all about teamwork and the vibe that I feel on a daily basis of a lack of teamwork between my staff and management both could stand to see much improvements especially for a billion dollar company.
good,Walmart has a bunch of flaws but can be a great way to gain experience my location lacked compassion and sympathy. Some managers were just very rude and bossy when it was clearly unnecessary.
good,Stuck in position for 6 months so better like it. Employees are definitely under appreciated and hiring management doesn't actually pay attention to your skills or capabilities.
good,We're in a trailer for 12+ hours sometimes it's really hot sometimes it's really cold. water is provided. the beginning of the day we are provided with the time for the end of the day and more time than not we work well beyond that time. the task only becomes difficult when the freight is coming so fast the lines begin to jam over and over again which also happens a lot.
good,Treat people like they want to be treated and to be fair to others love one another not only the company but amongst people and they customers to be more understanding instead of telling people what they need to do they need to be properly trained the first time and if something new comes about I want a new position or management warrants I associate to work a position they need to be properly trained
good,Good for college students or 2 income families. Hours vary. Raises were rare and less than .25 yearly. Taking time off was difficult unless medically necessary
good,"I loved working there in all positions - Cashier, Customer service and Cap 1 team. I liked my co-workers on the CAP 1 team. I didn't like the management they are the reason people don't stay."
good,"When I started with Walmart, it seemed that the company cared for the people that it employed.  over the years that I was there that caring has gone away.  It seemed that the company didn't change for the better.  It had changed for the worse.  I am sure that I am not the only one, but it felt as though the management wanted me to leave as soon as I hit the ten year mark and the fifteen year mark.  I was sorry to go, but in the end it was for the best"
good,"I worked this job for just shy of a year, the employees I worked with were for the most part very friendly but the management team was less than desirable."
good,Being an over achiever does not guarantee that you will remain employed.  Low performers were retained while exceeds expectation employee jobs were eliminated.
good,Stay to yourself..worse than high school in there..childish grown ups.come to work do your job and go home. Breaks are only 20 minutes short and only 2 per shift.
good,"El ambiente laboral es bueno pues lo hacen los compañeros, gerencia y recursos humanos nunca escuchan ni solucionan nada, parece que solo juegan con la gente, estoy muy inconforme con ellos, pero como empresa debo decir que es un buen lugar para trabajar, desgraciadamente en mi tienda el personal de más alto rango no sirve de mucho. Encima se ríen de uno, como si estuvieramos locos, puedes preguntarle esto a cualquier empleado y te confirmará."
good,Its alot that certain employees have to do for the pay we get. I believe it should be some changes with a lot of things. I believe some of the supervisors and management need evaluating
good,well the wal mart i worked at kinda sucked but others might be better. couldnt promote and didnt feel appreciated but other then that it was pretty ok i guess
good,"The job itself was quite easy to understand and get a hang of. The people were friendly and would help if need be. Management however would consistently expect you to always get done at a specific time no matter what, even if it was a heavy load that day or if there weren't as many people as usual. If you surpassed their expectations one day they would fully expect you to always surpass it. They expect unbelievable speed from you, for example, the moto is 1 box a minute for stocking. I would go twice sometimes three times as fast as that and still be called slow."
good,"Don’t apply Cause they don’t care about you ! Your health or anything of the sort , hours are wonky and when you ask about them because you have bills to be paid , you get the run around . Customers are aholes and complain about things you can’t control then proceed to tell management on you ."
good,"A empresa é boa pra quem tá precisando muito, porque no caixa eles mandam você até limpar o chão da loja, maior humilhação. Mas acredito que mude de loja pra loja."
good,Walmart was a stressful work environment full of co workers and managers who only cared about themselves. Everyday we were pushed to the maximum and were expected to complete more work than we had employee's.
good,"Walmart may be good for a first job, or something temporary. However, I wouldnt plan to stay for too long. Eventually they cut hours, management can be very rude and dismissive. Customers can be worse."
good,Not enough associate interaction for those who have been there for a while and left standing trying to keep thingsmovving along while slowing  losing many talented people to other jobs because of low moral and ineffective salary managers not following procedures
good,"Walmart is currently going through a lot of changes, you wear multiply hats with very low pay.  In order, to advance to management you must be able to work every shift."
good,The place was a disaster. Management at my store played employees against each other to reduce the risk of themselves being called out by visiting corporate officers. I worked in the deli which would have been great except there being a deeply seeded toxically hostile and racist atmosphere against anyone lacking color.
good,If you work with a manager that lets you work and is not CONSTANTLY hovering than it’s fine but most of the managers I have worked with were very snobby and as if they were in a whole different world than us workers. They were always right and above us and we were slow in the head is how they act.
good,Each day brings on new challenges. Always on the go with little down time. Changes come down weekly and will affect operations. Shifts varied weekly and at times made to work 6 or 7 day weeks. Upper mgmt. very hard to work with and micro managed.
good,"I was hired part time and was given almost full time hours. They expect the new trainees to train the newest hired. I had childcare issues and had asked to be put on a leave until I could resolve the problem. I was terminated instead. I had found childcare and had to reapply for a position. I had the interview and was asked to give my hours of flexibility. I wrote down exactly what the daycare hours of operations were and was told it wasn't good enough. In order to secure a position, I had to be available from open til close, seven days a week. Yet they have no problem hiring 7 college or university students with VERY limited availability and whom speak VERY little or poor English."
good,"The job wouldn't have been so bad if management didn't pull maintenance to do the jobs of employees, pulling us away from our own work. I was brought on as maintenance, to take care of the store, clean and all. Not stock shelves, mix paints or any of the in-store enployees because they hadn't scheduled enough employees for any given day."
good,Walmart was low paying to be a top retailer! There were some adjustments you made for holidays. I felt like they were all about profit and no concern for the employees
good,There is hardly room for advancement. If you want mgmt ha! nice waste of time. If you get mgmy you have to change schedules so often you end up being biploar or insomniac.
good,If not stocking fast enough you would have hours tooken away. Only have a certain amount of time to stock 4 pallets full of merchandised if not not able to be sent home.
good,My review was great and above average.  Management's is very click like and high school. Things dont get done and overlooked depending on the person.  And things are just out of control  so looking for other work.
good,WalMart isn't the greatest place to work. The pay is very low with no incentives. Management was not trained well and a lot of favfertism. Learned how to stock shelves and where the merchindes gos
good,walmart was so stressful i loved working there but didnt like mangers if you was not a favorite of theres you would have been treated poorly...and was not very nice
good,"Regardless of the circumstances, any customer complaint was ultimately your fault and were given a certain number before firing.  Management never seemed to take in account that some customers just like to complain or that the employee was not at fault."
good,My father was in and out of osu for lymphoma cancer it was around the time I started working at Walmart when we found out. I worked every day I could but when I got calls that he was in OSU they would not work with me on the fact I had to go be with him. I did my job as much as possible! And was a good hard worker. They terminated me the week of my paid time off vacation that they gave me and said I pointed out which was a lie. I was spending as much time left with family and my father as I could without trying to ruin my rep at work. Yet management wouldn't allow it and said it was my fault for losing my job.
good,"The customer service managers (CSM) are the best part of the store. The actual managers have no clue what any of the cashiers or CSM’s do. They don’t want to ever give you requested time off, they will fire you without telling you that you’re fired. (Happened to me and a couple other workers)  The management doesn’t help you while you’re working, or they take their sweet sweet time getting to you, or they forget about you completely. And you have to annoy them to help you. But the majority of customers and cashiers and CSM’s are the best part of the job. You don’t necessarily need the management to aid you in this job anyways. It’s fairly self explanatory once you figure out all the buttons on register."
good,Not everyone is treated fairly. Lack of accountability of associates. Lack of communication and structure. Wal-Mart has great tools for helping the store but the tools are not utilized.
good,"Organizing orders from walmart.com and taking them to customers in parking lot. Hundreds of orders a day, worked in team. Working harder got me more work with no pay increase. Most employees are not motivated to work. Management depends on stronger employees to carry the weight of the less motivated without giving incentive. A perfect job to have if you desire a fast pace work environment where u receive breaks on-time and are never boarded."
good,the days were medium paced some  busy some slow and just really learned good customer service skills and management was ok but always on the go n busy to focus on some issues sometimes and the hardest part of job was when just when u had ur busy days in the store  and the best part of it really was the peope i worked with that just made the day better!
good,"The work was very physically demanding for my part. I would ""throw the truck"" which is to ,most of the time alone, throw all the boxes onto the sorting line. After cleaning the truck and locking the doors I would then move into the pet department with one other person and finish 11 hours of work in 4 hours. Then move onto chemical, grocery, snacks, impulse, and other areas of the store to stock. Other than that i would make cardboard bails, use PLE (power lifting equipment) , help reassemble new shelving, and many other tasks."
good,"The only way to get promoted at Walmart Corporate is to stand on the shoulders of the people below you.  There's a weird, cult-like mentality when a director get's promoted and the entire department goes crazy, not realizing that he got promoted by working them like crazy, cutting back hours, and basically riding the seas on the backs of people whom make 1/10th of what he makes.  Walmart is OBSESSED with the bottom line and they do so at the cost and expense of the families that have made the company successful.  I will never go back there."
good,"Poor managment. Lack of comnuication! bad hours, the only thing i miss was my co workers. Managment was always not comunicating with others and making us run around"
good,By far my worst job. Had to spend long hours on your feet and my back would hurt from having to scan items all day. The breaks were decent and the coworkers were nice. Upper management absolutely do not care about you. I quit after they wouldn't let me book off my final exams.
good,Good first automotive service job. Most customers don’t know what they want.. And Management will always side with the customer and tear you down. There is a difference between a balance and alignment.
good,Despite the actual work this job is awful. Terrible pay and terrible management. Short breaks and unpaid lunch. It us an hour for lunch so not that bad.
good,At that time I needed a chair to sit. They told me it would take 2 weeks. I could not stay any longer. I had to stop working because I went into a wheel chair
good,The management didn't care about their employees or their customers at all. Worst job I've worked. The rest of the employees were lazy and tried dumping all their work on someone else.
good,Everyone thinks they are above people and want everyone else to do their work for them. They would not give me a proper place to pump and I was only part time but they were working me full time hours. I want to be perfectly clear this was the Walmart Supercenter in Owasso.
good,"Wal-Mart is your standard, nowhere else to work company. If you are looking to build a career, work elsewhere. Your time is wasted trying to promote if you are not well known at the store."
good,"Used to be the greatest place to work...(used to be). Now its a hot mess. $10hr/21hrs a wk=nothing. Cstmr srvc is N/A. Mngmnt is worst than the staff, NO concerns."
good,"fast paced, stressful"
good,"Honestly, this job is probably a buffer to a better job later if you aren't totally committed. There are people who will work here for a long time but if you have a lot of kids, or even 1 kid, sometimes this job probably won't be the best one."
good,"it is good money , very hard work must know what you are doing if you want to last. fast pace work environment, any day could be on dry or persh side good people"
good,All in all the store I worked at needs slot of help as far as some of management goes. I really enjoyed certain co workers. Tried to get along with everyone
good,"Honestly I didn't mind my job at all. However I feel like I was singled out for some reason. I was tested and tested and then lets go for ""lack of productivity"". However I know that there was 2 other employees that I worked with that would spend hours in the back where there are no cameras texting and video chatting on their phone. literally doing nothing and they still work there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,A typical day would include putting up freight that was left from overnight morning meeting paperwork customer service counting inventory maintaining cleanliness
good,Its good for teenagers and early 20 to start there in order to learn and get experience in a very fast paced comapany and specially learn how to take care of customers . But its not good as career if you want to stay there as hourly
good,"My review is for the Walmart Stone Road and management over there sucks!! Most of the management (minus a few) is rude, uncooperative and somewhat privileged. They act as if they know everything but trust me they are horrendous at their job. Store manager is ok but she listens a lot to very incompetent managers who are nothing but toady. Just imagine a guy calling himself a manager who was not too long ago a security personnel. You will always see him roaming the floor with higher ups acting all reasonable but in reality is plain rude, manipulative and at best shoddy. Worst place to work as for them you are nothing but a ""robot"" with no social or family life and are just living your days for Walmart."
good,nothing nice to say about this place could have been  better if they would work with drivers instead being rude and total jerks most of the time and stop showing favoritism
good,"Loved helping customers at Walmart, however the management wasn't great at all. Whoever picks and assigns them needs to try harder. They don't provide good management who cares."
good,It's a okay place to work. You get paid benefits and time off. The hardest thing about the job is management. they really do not care about your personal life.
good,There is no opportunity for advancement and there is not nearly enough hours provided to earn a living. Management do not make any changes even though I've brought this to their attention many times. I applied for a full time position but I'm only given part time hours
good,Es una buena empresa con un ambiente de trabajo regular. La promoción es solo para personal con mucha antigüedad. A los medios tiempos no se les pagan horas extras y te piden que apoyes sin pago
good,"Even though that they did have a constant help with keeping the job. It did come at a great price, there were 8 hours and 30 minutes of work everyday because your lunch was an hour and you were required to clock in 30 minutes in the middle of your lunch. There were also rumors that all holiday workers which I was one of were to be removed come February and March."
good,Walmart is a stressful bad management work place no respect and no work life balance they work you like robots and want even say good job never can satisfy even if you do get the job done
good,Now there is no job security. The changes the company is making now mean any one can be let go at any time no matter how hard you try or how long you have been with the company. You can be gone in less than 30 days if you make the wrong person mad at you.
good,"a typical day would be to set up the department that your in that involved food so checking dates and helping customers."
good,Years ago a person could work at Walmart and make a career out of it. That is longer true. Now Walmart does not care about their employees. What a assistant told me is we don’t have to care you can quit there are 10 more people wanting everyone’s jobs so go ahead quit. They no longer care about how well we do our jobs. Nor do they care about the long term employees.
good,I enjoyed working there as holiday help. I got to meet interesting people. Everyone was respectful and polite to each other and the customers. An amazing experience.
good,Awful to work for Walmart. You are told how to do things one way from a certain manager and the other will same something completely different leading to a stressful environment.
good,"Walmart employees are friendly, but the culture policies and wages need to be changed to make it fair. Employees are hard workers and get as much done as possible with working in a skeleton crew"
good,Although my coworkers made it a mostly fun environment the management staff was lacking. The processes that are supposed to be followed were never able to be done properly because work was hindered by a lack of help and very little assistance from most of the management team.
good,Management needs to be re-trained on the process of handling concerns which are brought up via employees. No type of disiplinary action is given to those who act out of line.
good,Wal-Mart is a steady job and there is always work to be done. Management does not support it's employees. Strict rules with no lee way to the lives of its employees
good,The hours were all over the place. CSMs did not seem to care about you. Scheduling sucked. Advancement was a very long and slow process.. if you ever advanced.
good,My Walmart has lazy managers and has you all over the place. It’s a nice job I wish it was better and the pay isn’t worth it . They have a 4point system. You get fired for 4 call out smh
good,Management needs improving they could care about their employees more and treat them with more respect instead of telling them to man up or be a big girl or be the bigger person
good,"No one person is perfect and everyone has  Problemsin in thier lifetime so when there's a issue come up with more  Positive remedies for a employee that's left to earily unknowingly doing so! Like 3 counts and 10 day probation  2  Chance 6 months and r Terminated and Wal mart need to push and promote Cleaning store around the  Registers they are  Disgusting the floors are never Cleaned under shovels or wipe down floors never moped, also belts on  tables BROKEN DOWN AND NEVER any Maintenance done to repair or replace any of them!"
good,"The company was great to work with a decade ago. At the management level, the expectations to the salary consideration is not in alignment."
good,Es una tienda donde trabajas bajo presión te exigen ventas y los jefes tanto de trabajo como su gerentes te hacen trabajar horas extras
good,Management is not on the same page.  The turnover rate is very high because management feels they can talk to people any type of way.  Poor communication
good,"friendly coworkers,worked extremely fast pace all shift,learned how to operate new equipment,management was poor,hardest part was"
good,There attendance policy is bad and they change the rules when it comes to policies and don’t follow cooperates policies. Things could be a lot better if they went back to how they had things years ago
good,"Horrible job setting, rude management and rude customers.Everyone always seems to have an attitude. Again im sure it varies by location but not a place I would say to work too long."
good,"Too many managers on a daily basis"
good,The typical day at work is getting everything that the other workers do not do.  The management team does not care about your life outside of walmart.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the associates as there are cliques and the customers are the worst.
good,"Management is rude and disrespectful.  Managers demand respect, but give little.  Promotions are not always based on performance. Training is not adequate for good job performance."
good,En calidad de vida es buena y las vacaciones son buenas
good,"Poor overall management from store managers to home office."
good,"I was left a temporary employee and made to work every holiday while I was there so I wouldnt get holiday pay. I was a temp for almost 7 months. The holidays I worked while there were Halloween, Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Christmas Eve, New Years Eve, New Years, Valentines Day, St. Patricks Day and then right before Easter (one week before actually), they called me back to office and said my position will be ended the DAY AFTER Easter. So they wanted to me to work the day before and the day of and then come in the day after for my last day. That takes balls, I will say that, but I quit immediately and laughed my whole way out. There is a LOT of favoritism, A LOT!"
good,"It’s a great place to work, not recommended for everyone. "
good,"Pursuing Opportunity which will allow me to grow professionally, while effectively utilizing my versatile skill set to help promote your workplace now"
good,The work politics created an unhealthy work environment. I ended up losing my job due to Walmart getting rid of the overnight shift. Not only did they not place me at another Walmart but they terminated my employment the day my transfer went through in order to avoid the paperwork.
good,"It's retail and basically my first job so wasn't bad for what it's worth. However, there is a strict policy on attendance. They want you there even if you have family emergencies, accidents, death in the family, etc. They want you working like a robot and don't care that you are human being."
good,Morale is at it's all time low - job security is a concern....many management changes - which results in directional changes for the area - constantly.
good,"I loved my job but unfortunately the employee moral was at an all time low, the store management demeaned employees and refused to allow for transfers to a different store location. Walmart overall is a great company to be employed with but the management in the store greatly affects your overall experience as an employee."
good,They never cared about the Photo Center or the Photo Center Customers. Many Customer orders were late because management would rather me do returns or zone. I was the only Photo Associate for years and rarely had help. I was not supplied with the tools I needed to do my job successfully and was blown off by management.
good,It was nice job the managers are nice but they give random scheduals. They teach you everything you need to know to get started anywhere other than they are understaffed and very strict theyare a good work place.
good,"During my 3+ years with Walmart I can say that I had both the most potential for carrior advancement and then the lack there of. my first location I was given opportunities to advance in the business while using my specific talents and abilities. However, after relocating I came to find that my new management was unstable and the farthest thing from personal. The two years at my first location I interacted and worked under one consistent Manager, after my relocation I served 4 consecutive Managers over the course of only 1 1/2 years, and during the time I felt no room to grow or opportunities for advancement. Shortly before I left I was manipulated into a position that I was later told the shift I was promise simply didn't exist."
good,"I liked working for Walmart, they could have better customer service and employee respect but it was good. They weren’t fast enough with the things you needed witch make people made that they had to wait."
good,A typical day at work for me was to help customers in search or in need of advice I was there to assist. I could and would walk from the garden center to electronics for a customer if it would help make shopping easier
good,"Really the only pro is the co workers. Overnights become a family. Everything else is a con. Poor management, favoritism, management talking about personal matters of their associates with other associates. They refused to follow my drs note when I was pregnant. One said no pulling heavy things. Both said no extra breaks. My dr note said extra breaks as needed and zero pulling of carts and pallets. I put in my two weeks and the manager I gave it to wrote my personal number on it and left it laying around somewhere so it never made my file and now I’m black listed to going back (was debating on a different shift after baby was born so I had different managers but can’t now. One manager is getting investigated for unwanted  advances (tried to put his hands down an associates pants). Men can go to the bathroom for 30-45 minutes at a time but women get questioned for taking 5 minutes extra outside of breaks to potty when pregnant or change feminine needs"
good,"Work alot, live at 5. I've learned how to deal with costumers and do apparel with sorting clothes. Learned how to answer the phones in the fitting room."
good,I was secondaried into 2 other positions but never received a pay increase. They gave me a day I requested off and then when it approached revoked it. They would purposely only give me 4 hours shifts and I worked every weekend.
good,"Walmart seemed fun and appropriate for a guy in his early 20's, paying his way through college.  But, as the years went on and the pay remained extremely low, it became clear that the store was NOT the future for anything resembling an enjoyable life."
good,Walmart doesn't care for your life outside of its walls. They will change your schedule without warning so be ready for that. When I put my two weeks notice in they tried to leave me high and dry.
good,"Poor treatment of employees, low compensation. Wal-mart is a world leader in sales, yet a rough place to work. Compensation is low, healthcare is poor, treatment is negative."
good,"La convivencia entre compañeros es buena, aunque los jefes quieren que trabajes más de tu jornada y eso lo hace estresante. Para escalar a otro puesto es difícil."
good,Management worked routinely to undermine and discourage workers. There was little leniency when I was severally I’ll with my pregnancy. Horribly understaffed and expected to do the job of a fully staffed store with half or less employees.
good,"Walmart is good to go to if you need a quick job but beware, its just like stepping back into highschool except everyone's older and talks freely about their misery."
good,"I worked there for 4 years straight out of high school learning everything I could about every dept in the store and putting my best foot forward. I would not leave until my job was done. The logical response would be a pay raise or promotion right? Wrong. The obvious response would be to have you do the work of 5 associates for the same amount of money and then threaten to fire you if you could not do it to their 'High' standards. "

good,Walmart pays well but you can't get paid for overtime but have to sometimes work it. I enjoyed my job it takes a toll on you. Overnight stock isn't easy due to productivity
good,"My experience with Walmart was not a good one. I was overworked, disrespected by management, and was put on jobs that was not my job description. Do not recommend."
good,"cheap material products you could make on your own for 1/2 the price                                                                                                                      .  "
good,"I worked for the Harrisville Walmart location as a Cap 2 associate and my first red flag was that they lied to me to accept the job offer. They promised me full time and they hired me as part time while telling me otherwise. They also didn't give me complete schedules of which I was penalized for leading to my termination. I was also promised no penalty if I was helping customers before clocking in but that was also a lie. The management was also not good at their job and expected way way too much of the normal associates. That place is a prime example of, the route to all unhappiness is unrealized expectations. Other than that the work isn't too hard and they pay decent for the type of work."
good,"Working at Walmart was a great learning experience for me. I learned how to manage my time, while being a full time student. I learn how to speak to different people that I did not know, and how to get things done within a time frame."
good,"Good for experience and learning the basics of customer service/ retail. However, the Management at all the stores I worked at, passive-aggressively promoted brown nosing and breaking company policies. Like working off the clock. They preach about accountability, but they always hold the wrong people accountable. Not to mention, they don't provide adequate training for their supervisor roles. Definitely not a place to make a career from."
good,"I worked at Walmart for four years, two over night and two evening shift. You meet so many great people working there but management doesn’t care about any of their employees. They will give you impossible times to get stuff done, threaten to write you up over almost anything and will give no thanks when things are achieved. If you have any sort of emergency they will not understand and threaten to take your job away."
good,"It's just a normal job.  Like working retail, don't expect too much, but don't expect too little.  It's just a basic job, make basic money, commonly for people going to school"
good,All Walmart stores are different. You have to find the one you want to work at that works best for you. Whitehall location had a lot of issues. There are never enough cashiers. Cashiers are made to work long hours and not getting breaks or lunch on time. Supervisors are limited and not enough to help cashiers with their customers when difficulties occur.
good,"The operation was typically the same but the procedures always changed, the positions always changed without any discussion or notice."
good,"typical day at work would be to get different directions from each superior manager in the building and be told that each of them are more important than the other,management also retaliate if certain things aren't done at a certain time but nothing never gets done on time due to the multiple task that is given to department managers through out the day.The people at work can be toxic due to the childish behavior of retaliation."
good,Maybe good for college students. A lot of favoritism with upper management. They hire new people and cut regular employees hours. They could care less about you.
good,"Dont bother trying to make a career out of this place, just do your job and go home. Unprofessional people make the job harder, but whatever. You can do better."
good,Hope you like working hard with help alot of times and don't think I'll get because you ask for some that's funny.just try your best and your be fine.
good,my typical day at work was a cashier and greeting customers with great customer service. most managers are rude and don't care about you. the culture is fine. the hardest part is when you are doing your job correctly and more correctly and management said you are not doing it right. getting to meet new people every day or have a regular guest to see you cause you are doing your job right.
good,"Walmart is good for students looking for a first time job or retirees looking to fill their time. Anyone with family or a life cannot truly make a career at walmart. They lack flexibility for parents, no maternity leave to speak of, no support for mothers returning to work,  benefits suck and are expensive."
good,A lot of stocking and customer service balancing. I enjoyed my job stocking and interacting with customers. I was part of the front end team and we communicated to get our daily tasks done.
good,"As a retailer, Walmart is evolving into a modern company that offers its customers great value and brand selection in the retail stores and online.  It's clear that the purpose is strong. As an employer, the culture of valuing its employees has shifted to be ambiguous at best, writing a history of downsizing and job elimination as the new norm."
good,"Place was too busy trying to just boast numbers, never really cared about the staff. Even though it was through a temp agency it was better ways job duties could have been explained and perfomed"
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart it was simple but when my medical problems came up they didnt make things any better.  Eventually I had to leave."
good,Overall the company is a solid place to work but there is a lot of unprofessional managers and associates. The first four years that I was employed here the working environment was great and I had no problems with anyone. New management was brought in and place turned in to a circus.
good,"Typical day was always the same. Management could be a lot better, but it wasn't horrible. The hardest part of the job was there wasn't enough brake time to regroup yourself or even eat. The pay is pretty good so therefore it was worth it."
good,I loved working there because of my fellow associates but the management was very poor it was just a poor work environment due to management. the schedules would be changed without any acknowledgement.
good,I would not recommend working at this walmart.  Horrible manager was accused and fired for something that wasn't true wouldn't accept Dr note when taking my son to the er
good,"It’s a great place to meet friends and new work colleagues. But the turnover rate is ridiculous, people constantly calling out it feels like we never have enough people working"
good,i worked for 2 walmarts. the one in california was great. i enjoyed working there. and was given many opportunites. Since i moved out of state i was not given opportunity for advancement and i was actually demoted because there were no openings in management. my pay was not as california. .
good,WALMART is a good place to work but they dont give to their long term employees and cannot keep people. They also promise advancement and hire from the outside instead of people that have worked their way up.
good,"Good place to work overall although management is incompetent and hours are low. Wages are good, atmosphere is friendly and inviting. Employees are not trained very well and management makes working there intolerable."
good,My job at Walmart was not a good experience. I was a cashier and CSM's were not kind to any of the cashier's. We sometimes would have our lights flashing for change or a void on our register & they would continue talking & gossiping & look right at us as they were doing it. There were many displeased customers due to that fact & I would be the one that continued to apologize for their behavior. I would never recommend this as a work place.
good,"I joined about a year and a half ago and when I started working on third shift everything was fine, just a normal stocking job. Then I moved onto day shift where there's just about as many managers as there are associates, none of whom can communicate with each other and get things done as a team. Now they have started cutting hours and trying to fire people due to our new ""customer first"" system right before the holiday shopping starts."
good,Working for Walmart iLearn how to be a team lead work well with others talk to customers do the work schedule drive a forklift take charge and care customers
good,"My best experiences at Walmart were when I was a part time associate. It seemed like the higher you climbed up the ladder, the more the work/life “balance” was thrown out of balance."
good,Wal-Mart did not care about family and management was very clicky.  If they did not like you then you had a hard time even if you were an exceptionally good employee.
good,"Wal-Mart was a difficult place to work.  They paid just over minimum wage.  It seemed that we were always short staffed.  The supervisor and manager in my area were not bad but I found that people were always worried about staff cuts or hours cut. The store manager cut security to save money but then customers would wheel carts of unpaid merchandise out of the store. Raises were based on the store performance not on our performance. Basically you barely made enough money to keep your  head above water.  We were not allowed to leave the Jewelry department unattended however, getting someone to relieve you for a break was almost impossible. Almost no recognition for going above and beyond the call of duty. Quite often had to ring groceries through our register even though our work space was not set up for handling groceries. Unfortunately, the store often closed down many of the cash registers which would cause a line up at our register and then our customers became angry and rude."
good,"enjoyed being a cashier, working in customer service, layaway, phone operator, apparel dept., working in site to store. great employees. great meeting so many people"
good,"Wal-Mart is a great company to work for. If Wal-Mart had the opportunity for growth and better job benefits, I could definitely see alot if people retiring from there. Management does have the tendency to throw their title around and try to belittle you however."
good,"There was always problems, either with the customers or the staff... we were always shortstaffed and expected to work twice as hard but still get paid the same."
good,"I really enjoyed working for the company but the last year I hated the company I loved what I did and my customers but NOT the company. They went from a family oriented company to a company that did not care about their employees. The benefits where good, management of ok but they way the company and its new policies effected the employee's life was bad."
good,"Management is terrible, they don’t care about anything except themselves and their pay definitely wouldn’t recommend anyone to work there only plus is the hour lunch"
good,"I've worked for Walmart for 7 years. I love my job but they're no longer willing to work with their employees needed  hours My husband has stage 4 lung cancer and I need to be home with him at night, my availability is 7am to 7pm.Because of this my hours went from  24-32 to 8-16"
good,"I worked for this company 16yrs. I have notice over the yrs the moral is at its worst.I love my job helping people ,but i feel i walmart doent respect individuals. Make up rules everyday to write associates up. Current upper management not. Knowledgeable enough to run a establishment as big as dc6070."
good,Poor management bad hours stressful environment lack of team work competitive shifts low staffed poor communication horrible policy for medical leave even with doctors note
good,It’s so many different positions so if you ever want to move around you can always an opening somewhere an so many different locations easy to move jobs when you relocate
good,es mas importante las ventas que su personal no les brindan calidad de vida
good,A typical day at work would be overwhelming within the first hour of work. Due to lack of staff most days I worked alone until about 1pm at the latest 3pm.
good,"I was routinely scheduled to close one day and open the next morning."
good,"They paid me really well, and you get a one hour lunch along with a paid 15 minute break every two hours. Compared to other jobs I have worked, they don't ask too much. I actually only quit because my manager was racist, not due to the company itself."
good,Han sabido hacerle frente al mercado y a sus mayores competidores
good,Teaching people how to operate and ring up their own it’s bagging and assistance with finding items. Sometimes having to find whatever it is the customer may need to insure they have had the best shopping experience
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart but it was only seasonal. I enjoyed working closely with the customers and being able to help them in any way that I could.
good,The manager that I had worked under would not take care of the people she had working for her and was not flexible when it came to college classes. The point system was terrible too.
good,Working on the produce section at Walmart was fun. I learned a lot about different fruits and vegetables and I got to meet a lot of fun and nice people.
good,A typical day at Walmart is busy and stressful. Management was all over the place. They constantly shuffled around assistant managers to the point where I did not know who my manager was some days. Hardest part of the job was dealing with angry co-workers because that's when the place fell apart. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people. I am a people person so it fit me.
good,"The hardest part was the fact that the manager's pretty much breath down your neck. I was overnight, and had seven-eight hours of the shift manager constantly looking over my shoulder."
good,"Manager tells you what to do and gives you assigned daily tasks. Just be sure to help the customers and make the sales, sales, sales. All the company cares about is sales."
good,"I worked in automotive so it wouldn’t be that busy in the morning. It gets busy around maybe 12 noon. I learned about different tire brands , how to read tire sizes, how to pick batteries for certain cars and etc. My managers were super cool and laid back as long as I got my job done. My job wasn’t hard at all, I just didn’t like having to stay overtime because of the slow pace of my coworkers."
good,"It was a very poor environment management put a lot on my role and expected way to much without listening to reasoning and explanations for how things came to be. Many times I was by myself trying to juggle schedules for all the cashiers, cart pushers, door greeters, and many of whom called off trying to fill luches, and breaks, with minimal support. When I called for other associates to come and help nobody would come and customers lines were backed up into the isles and customers got mad and management blame you for it. No level of communication among supervisors/management to improve these working conditions to come up with a game plan to solve the issues. Also work among CSM's were not equal some were sent out to collect carts when we were low on cart people or had a call off and others plain refused and wanted to send me out instead it pushed me to leave. Things could have been better if upper Management took a lead and dealt with these issues and I did voice my concerns but it fell on deaf ears."
good,"Company is great to work for. I worked for the employer for 12 years. They taught me a lot of skills and even did tuition reimbursement. But lately the company's moral compass is going in the wrong direction. The company has new policies and processes in place and actually cares about their employees, but the people that are on the field that are supposed to deliver the results failed them miserably. When I started the company,  reading Sam Walton's book was part of our training and I believed in the company, but now 6 years later I am staring to realize the company's culture has gone down the hill. People they put in place to develop and mentor their associates are more concerned about their personal agenda and retaliation and the home office in Bentonville seem to ignore, abandon or marginalize great workers. !2 years ago I believed in the company, now looking back I was either too naive or the company's moral compass is non existent these days."
good,"When I get to Walmart I clock in, go to the service desk to look at the schedule to see how my coverage look for the frontend, then I oversee the frontend to insure the customers are taken care of."
good,"It was very unorganized and on slow days, they wouldn't allow voluntary time off. Every single mistake was documented and you were written up for it, even if it was the smallest of mistakes or an accident."
good,my review of Walmart if u can work there u can work anywhere the job sometime can be very challenging and u have to be on point there is change every day.
good,was there for three years and never got anywhere in the company as much as I wanted to the management team has favorite and if you are their favorite then you don't get anywhere in the company
good,Not recommend. They change the schedule up on you last minute without you knowing. It's very stressful they expect you to do to people's jobs a lot of the times you're left alone to run the place by yourself
good,I was there a month away from a year before they did me dirty. My mom was very very Ill and they would not work with my schedule even the slightest. The management only wants certain people to advance into management and want it to be who they want. Other then management I had a great experience there. Fast paced most of the time hut the days went by pretty fast and they was a few cool coworkers
good,waal-mart is a good place to work.. but if the management dont like you then you cant get very far in the company..there are alot of unfairness in the company.. the reason i say this is because of the way i was let go.the people are great but like i said the management cut hrs and make you pick up the slack and you do the job of 4 to 5 people but get paid for one.
good,Was paid under $8 an hour as cashier. hours were not consistent. never made enough money to pay bills. high turnover rate. stressful when customers would come in and yell at you over prices. most times customer service managers would handle discrepancies. had some assistant managers there that would give cashiers a hard time.
good,I did not get paid for full time work they told me I was going to get full time hours but they gave me 15 to 30 hours but management lied to and put me under part timer worker and the store manager would  swear  At me for Turing a customer away because he had a invalid license to pick up money
good,Working out in the auto department use to be fun and and everyone got along with each other and now no one wants to be there. We've had 3 managers since I've been there. Our last one left after 6 months because she couldn't deal with upper management.
good,"It’s not all Walmarts but the specific one in petrie way was horticulture, the employees were disrespectful, it was alot of favoritism from the managers, the work ethnic was poor"
good,"I highly recommend this job to anyone looking to work part time, however if you are in need of full time hours you would have better luck else where...."
good,treated unfairly and almost always like a work dog. I can not stand this company I was laid off and can not grasp why a company that I worked for part time could not afford to keep me around
good,"When I first started working at Walmart it was awesome. Great manager, great work schedule, great coworkers and great pay. My last year at Walmart was crazy. Managers were so cut throat. They wanted me to come to work with the flu. They always had me training people but never gave me a raise or upgraded my position."
good,worked there several years only received one promotion and it wasnt even the job i wanted. i was a over night associate and had applied for sporting goods manager. instead i was forced into inventory manager right before the blitz with a staggering 4 associates. i was set up for failure. i dont care how you look at it but just how was 5 people suppose to unload and seperate 2 gm trucks with over 2000 pieces and 2 grocery trucks with the same amount plus get them to the floor and seperated into the right departments. my guys and i where beat on a nightly basis... it impossible
good,"I worked sat-mon 6am-6pm. I only hated mandatory overtime. Not a good place to work if you don't like being forced to work up to 60 to 70 hours a week. I was Packer and my job was very simple. There was some heavy lifting but not too heavy maybe 60 or 65 lbs. Most items aren't usually heavy. There was lots of people and not enough structure. My co-workers were rude, loud and very obnoxious, the workspaces were very close together which was very annoying. The company does feed you on certain holidays or when your team wins something."
good,So many great individuals both employees and customers to interact with lots of potential with the company as long as your service oriented. The climate of retail makes you a jack of all trades master of none.
good,"I enjoy my job I stay busy and a lot of moving around."
good,I used to love it here but alot has changed from corporate on down for the company. U a not sure that the changed were for the better. Employee morale is as low as I have ever seen it.
good,"It's Walmart, You get what you expect to get working at Walmart. Don't expect much and you'll be fine. Don't stay here long though it's just draining. Don't expect much in terms of benefits."
good,"My manager had issues with my grandmother, before he found out everything was fine then after he found my work life changed. everything seemed to crumble at the thought of him having a feud with my grandmother over a bunch of nonsense."
good,"Walmart is a large company, anywhere from gorceries, electronics to clothing can be found there. Management from my personal experience always chose favorites to work with. never really listened to concerns or personal emergencies. hardest part was wanting to come to work and work around others. easiest part was knowing it was an income."
good,"My manager didn't know what she was doing because our department manager didnt train her correctly. And she would have me do most of the work for her, so."
good,I honestly didn't think Walmart would be as stressful as it was. I have learned a lot and some of the reasons it was stressful at times with me being apart of management I understood more. I really enjoyed helping the customers with everyday purchases and some just needed a ear to listen. It made their day and by that it made mine as well.
good,Just like any other job working at Wal-Mart has it day. Because it is a customer service field it constantly changes due to customer demand and also working with different personalities. The management was not so great we had so many managers and not one could be found when it is needed or they are no help at all. But like I did stated before every job has it day.
good,Walmart's management was terrible. They were unreliable and drama coursed through the entire store all the time. I learned a few things from working there such as being punctual and having to watch my back with how efficient my work was.
good,As a cashier at Walmart I was always on my feet thank goodness they have mats to help support you. Training here was fast and I did not feel confident in my roll as a cashier.
good,The job is very physically demanding. The assistant manager is lazy. Co-workers were fun. High turn over rate. The main department manager was a very nice and caring person.
good,Everyday you feel as if they are gonna take your job. Never felt appreciated. They make you feel as if you don’t know how to do your job. Schedule is good but took a long time to get there.
good,Very stressful and unpredictable. Flip flop shifts made job difficult adjustment. Unhappy with the department and no open opportunities to transfer. Low hours meant very low income.
good,They put to much of a workload on the employees. They stretch them to the max. The don't offer any type of training to learn more about the company or even in the different departments or any chance for advancements in the company.
good,"i personally would never recommend Walmart as a place to work, but if you need a job and absolutely nothing else is coming through, then yeah I'd say go for it because it did pay the bills"
good,"The overall work culture of Walmart is disappointing. Working their now knowing how it functions and the attitude of the workers is sad. the individuals who work their and really, really want to make a difference are the ones who get the bad end of deal. I truly admire all my associations I have worked with, and a few Dept managers I work for are awesome!! this is their means of living and surviving, and I find it so unprofessional the way Upper Management treats them. I  wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't saw this myself."
good,"Demoted and forced me to work more than what I was asking for despite needing time off for school. Poor staffing so most times, I was working alone for an entire shift."
good,Walmart is a nice place to work if you need some extra income but I would not recommend working here as a career choice. They lack moral values when it comes to the employees and the management scale is too clustered
good,They cut you off hours when you got close to full time status and the benefits werent that great. The discounts was nice but in the long run didnt make it worth the stay .
good,"It's good enough to pay bills (sometimes) but dont expect much else, bonuses are small, no overtime and your hours depending on you boss can be so unorthodox that you have to work 6 or 7 days before getting a day off, or work til 11pm and come back at 7am."
good,Wal-Mart went through a spurt of no store manager. Therefore making the whole place a mess. Couldn't get answers if you asked a question. Not many people wanted to help you find something. Took a while to get back to a decent store.
good,"I personally think they can use better management, why should employees feel intimidated to speak to management?"
good,Not the best job I have had when you work hard and make things right but the management mess everything up and doesn’t care how best performance you have. All of that stuffs are joke
good,"If you like to work with customers, you will survive. If you know how to do your job without giving an option, you will survive. You have to have open availability unless you are a department manager. It does not matter if you have a family."
good,Most of the time things were ok.  Depends on the day and the who was a manager on that day.  I did received a certificate for outstanding customer service from corporate office.
good,"Walmart has a poor work environment, so bad that I constantly get hurt. When I do get hurt instead of helping me and making amends for the work place, they blame me getting hurt on me and not on the work place. Then also if you aren't have the favorite of one of the managers good luck keeping your job, it is a day to day struggle due to this, I try to share my ideas to improve the environment and they work efficiency and instead of taking my ideas and looking them over they reject them and scold me for going against how they want things to be run. I would not recommend this job to anyone unless they really need the money."
good,"When working at walmart I had the chance to experience many things. Besides the hard work i've met many of good people along the way. Wal-mart provided me with many things as far as car, great benifits, and 401k"
good,I injured myself and management could care less. The pay is decent but the terrible hours balances it out. So you still make about what you would at minimum wage.
good,"I would not recommend it to my worst enemy. There isn’t one person in the place who is only doing what is in their respective job description. There is such a lack of staff and so little appreciation for the staff on hand that the place is in a continuous state of chaos. You might find that many of the people you work around are good people. However, the management and the culture isn’t one of rigor, it’s one that points fingers. Very little responsibility is taken by upper management when something goes wrong."
good,"In the past 17 years I have  went from a job that I loved to one that I don't anymore .Wal-Mart has gone from treating its employees like family to just a number .I don't feel like I'm providing great customer service when all that our management wants is to rush the customer out the door ,and make sure you get them to apply for a credit card . I feel  that this company had forgotten it's original founding father and gone too corporate ."
good,"I was dedicated, I would work any time, any hours, stay late, come in early.  I put 200% into some of the most stressful situations. To management, I was just a replaceable body, my dedication and skill did not matter, they couldn’t be bothered to listen to my suggestions or requests"
good,Your co-workers usually don't care or won't be there long. Your managers accomplish there job with little to no interest and helping the rest of the team accomplish their goals.
good,Starting there didnt seem so bad but i soon found myself doing jobs above my pay grade that were not compensated back. It sucks to be walked on and treated like all the hard work you do is for nothing. I litterally got told that i did my job too well and it didnt have to be. I was told to do as little work to make it “look” good. Which might sound nice to do less work but it was frustrating and demoralizing.
good,Front end service was mediocre and not many team players. Management seemed stressed all the time and did not interact with employees. Disorganized environment and all training was on the computer.
good,The associates are great but the management is awful. They don't want you to voice your option and there open door policy they have to keep out unions is a joke.  It use to be a lot of fun working there but when they say there for the associates at the end of the day it's about there money
good,"The best part about this job was starting out at $9 an hour, that was until I learned they gave terrible hours. I enjoyed my time in my department, until a dept. manager was injured and had to take leave, I was promoted, only to learn it was temporary, until she got back and they cut my hours again, almost half of what I started with because my pay was higher. The people I worked with were very lazy and the managers didnt't seem to care much, they only seemed to care when their next cigarette break was."
good,"My Overall Review Of Walmart Stands As, It’s A Good Place To Work But This Particular Establishment Needs More Organization!! Also They Need Better Work Schedules And Availability Times. Walmart Can Help The Community By Having More Quantity Of Merchandise Available For Customers!!"
good,"You go in and they have you do jobs for 3 or more people then get mad at you when you can't finish the jobs, especially when you have to take care of the customers, And you only get about 37 hours a week."
good,I think they should train the employees to help the guest more so they can find and buy what they came in to get and not just let you run around asking other employees something you should be trained to know
good,Poor Mangers that contradict each other to the point it confuses the employees. Poor communication and lack of professionalism make it hard to take most of the managers seriously.
good,"s nuts, the self check out it's a wast of space , it take the friendly    experience  away , with dealing with a person ,  i understand the time are changing , but if weren't for the people   working for the company  ,  the company would not be where its at now ,  its supposed to be a family   oriented  store , where every one know every one . I know the old man would roll over in his grave  , if he seen how things are going in the company  today ."
good,I worked for Walmart for 25 years and was displaced by them in March 2018.  I held several position in my 25 year career.  I've had good managers and bad managers in my career.  I've supervised associates as an hourly supervisor.
good,The lack of one management for one department is greatly shown. The expression to many chiefs and not enough Indians fits the company very well. There are people in management that have no idea what their roll is.
good,"Had the latest software, and a big staff. All types of product to get you inspired to design freely. Challenging to convert expensive product to affordable items."
good,"A lot of incompetent out of touch managers, demanding amount of work, but very flexible hours for someone in school.  It's a good temporary job, but not a good career."
good,"The job eventually became a place I hated to go, with the lack of concern from the managers and the lack of coverage during ""rush hour"". That spread assocaite very wide, its not fair for workers to not be able to take their breaks."
good,"Wal-Mart is an American Retailer that makes it's money by barely underpricing it's competitors and underpaying it's employees."
good,"Es una buena empresa en cuestión de estabilidad económica y pagos puntuales. Sin embargo deja mucho que decir la incongruencia entre los valores que promueve entre los asociados. No sé ejerce una política de puertas abiertas sin que vengan después las represalias, los niveles al escalar un problema evaden su función. El ambiente laboral es ameno cuando no te topas con gerencias prepotentes que apoyan y promueven crecimientos al vapor de personas que realmente no ameritan un cargo. Es una empresa en la que aprendes a ser multifuncional, el conocimiento y el cambio no cesan. Para resumir, la empresa es muy buena, sin embargo las personas que la dirigen  son quienes manchan su prestigio, jefes que no son líderes, que tienen al personal correcto en áreas incorrectas en las que difícilmente se podrá explotar su potencial. Jefes a los que no les importa la capacitación de su gente ni su promoción de crecimiento cuando el personal da resultados. Gerencias que tiran por la borda toda esa cultura que por años promovió su fundador."
good,"I have been to 2 different Walmart stores and neither of them has given me proper advancement opportunities for work. I did, however, learn a lot from one manager, who is no longer with the company."
good,"Walmart has poor Management and They don't care for their employees. "
good,"Coaching policy is ridiculous. Verbal coaching is laughed off, and then you get hit with an official coaching which stays on your record for a year and prevents you from taking a position that's considered a pay grade higher, even if you would be getting paid the same. This is to keep good associates where they are. Overtime is frowned on, to the point that you'll be required to take a longer lunch break if you have OT  racked up. The whole place is a joke, and customers come before associates no matter what the situation."
good,"Walmart is a good company overall, however, the salary of entry level associates is not good. Most of the associates work at minimum wage. Every associate gets 30 cents raise after 1 year, which is not good. Only managers get good salary. Bad salary is the only reason I am looking to work in another company. The salary of backroom/shipping/receiving associates should be atleast 16 to 18 dollars an hour."
good,Decent job for someone who has no responsibilities. Horrible management. Work hours vary. Whatever is put on application can not be fixed or worked with once hired.
good,When I first arrived at Walmart it was great. months went by and I began to notice unfair treatment to other employees. I  didn't agree and spoke out. then the scene flipped. I worked extremely hard and received very little acknowledgment for it. WORKING AT WALMART BECAME BS. because of a few ASSISTANT managers who disliked me. all in the spirit of competition I guess. they praised the minuscule of tasks done by some. Yet completely overlook any immense effort put out from my end. good luck!
good,after 10 years in Walmart i was over worked each and everyday . most of the time i was wanted to go into other departments to help other workers .i often applied for promotions and management always put less experience workers ahead of me .i knew just as much or more about the jobs as the managers did .it was not an honest place to work . being fair was not an option to their associates .
good,"It was a great job for a little while, I was excited for it in the beginning but the ""honeymoon phase"" wore off quickly and I became so against working there that my willpower to work and make it fun and engaging went downhill."
good,"Depending on what your job is depends on what your job will be like. On average though, I have found that Walmart is often understaffed, so the workload is bigger than it should be. Some managers are great and help, while others do not help at all and push the whole shift for everyone to complete tasks that are sometimes unreasonable, or the time allowed to complete is unreasonable/unrealistic. Walmart is not a bad place to work overall, however, it is often extremely stressful. Customers can be pretty rude, and with the constant flow of people shopping, it can effect how much work you can actually complete. If you have people who work as hard as you, and are fun to be around, it can be fun to work sometimes."
good,"Basically Walmart is just a job for most people, there are not a great deal of advancement opportunities unless you are basically willing to give up most of your life for the company. Management, basically gives you little instruction on how to do much of anything once you are working on the sales floor. Management will tell you things to do but most of the time very little to no detail is given on how to do it or even the specifics of what is actually wanted, this results in employees feeling as if they have been thrown out into the deep with a live dies sink or swim approach. Leadership is pretty much absent at Walmart, you have bosses here with few true leaders. Management for the most part are simply not willing to get their hands dirty."
good,"Mudança muito rápida de procedimentos, e sem necessidade, cobranças desnecessárias."
good,"what i learned was always complete your job tasks.don't be late to work,always had something to keep you occupied.helping out your  co workers.enjoyed working during the holidays."
good,"Majority of the managers will not treat you well, every employee is treated differently which is unfair, If you call in or book a holiday you will get less hours and basically have to earn your hours back."
good,"Cashiers  take responsibility for handling returns and answering questions about merchandise, store policies, and ongoing promotions. The job features part-time hours at start, with options for full-time schedules or promotion into managerial careers with experience.Work environments include checkout aisles at store frontends. Cashiers sometimes assist sales and stock associates with remedial tasks during slow hours.Walmart cashier jobs receive hourly wages around $9.00. Some cashiers may earn higher pay with experience. The leading retail chain also provides complimentary uniforms and name tags to cashier workers and direct access to career development programs."
good,"This is not a job that is easy, no matter what your particular position is. I had a pretty rough time, from the customers, to some of my co-workers, to some of the managers."
good,"A typical day consists of being yelled at for small, easily fixed errors from the pharmacist, and being yelled at by the customers because it's a day too early for them to get their pain medications, which causes the pharmacist to yell at you even more."
good,Managers are hard to find and often in consistent with their instructions. The culture is one of survival and who you know. Only recommend if you can find no other place of employment.
good,At Walmart the hours are long and demanding.  It's a great place to learn retail but be prepared to work hard long hours.  Great place to establish experience.
good,"Higher management does not listen to the associate's concerns or ideas. The store manager's ""open door policy"" is always closed. Unless you are a ""yes person"" you will not get promoted for any management or supervisor positions."
good,Went in put fresh produce out sweep the floor cleaned the produce room waited on customers that retail is a alrite to work in I had a very good manager the hardest part of the job was  the other employees
good,Greeting customers constantly with our ten foot rule makes it hard to also get our timed stocking job performed . Often only one or two people are pulling out the truck sometimes two trucks worth of freight .
good,"Regular, bajando... Deberian ser mas equitativos... Los alto cargos no aprovecharse de sus cargos, y dejar fuera a los lame zapatos... Los sueldos mas equitativos. Y que aprendan a reconocer a los diamantes en bruto, y no dejarse llevar por arrastrados como lo a sido hoy por hoy, que han llegado a ser jefes por ganarselos de mala manera... En conclusión el personal elegido para jefatura no está apto pata sus cargos, porque además eligen a la parentela para puestos estratégicos y para llenar vacantes."
good,I loved working there over all just didnt like to be stressed out all the time the co mangers were nice people and flexible with our schedules fixed any problem we had right away
good,They should accept dr note because THAT will belp alot of people keep THEIR jobs because you never know when you Will get sick or your child or family member
good,"At first, it was easy work then it became tedious. The manager would harass me on a nightly basis, I couldn't get anything done without  constantly having him over my back. It was the most stressful job I've ever held and the employees don't help the mood either! I don't recommend."
good,"Could help out employees more when it comes to questions being asked on a daily basis. Not enough advancement opportunities either, or it goes to certain ones."
good,"I was excited to work here since I had retired from nursing ,but the training was inadequate, poor communications and lack of management at the registers."
good,"It was a great job working with great people but the management and benefits  was not good. I enjoyed working the floor and helping customers, and working with my fellow co-workers"
good,"This company cares more about customer satisfaction so much that they often overlook the needs of their own associates. When it comes time to taking vacations its often near impossible to get approved let along a paid vacation. Doctor/ emergency visits dont account for missing or being late even if you told management ahead of time. Even if you are sick you are expected to endure your full shift with exceptional service. Benefits are limited and given within a time frame. Most of management is biased. The store manager is awesome his only downfall are his asm,s he has leading behind him. i wish well to this facility as they are changing management and that they succeed in the future."
good,"I loved working at Walmart before I transferred to the Walmart in Richmond, ky. The managers at the Walmart in Richmond, ky are rude and have no patience or understanding for the associates."
good,"All in all in what a decent place to work. Had work hard to advance from part time to full time. Pay wasn't good for the work you did, but it's walmart. Don't expect any over time. Managers are careless. And breaks never come at the right time."
good,Easy place to work at. The system is not complicated at all. Does get stressful at times since you would have to work by yourself at times. Managers need to do more of their job.
good,"It's a typical department store. A lot of work for a little pay. You may be expected to do work normally done by management but, not receive the same pay."
good,"Customer service was a large part of this job. Also, you needed to complete projects within your department, as well as help other departments when needed."
good,this was a great place in the beginning and i needed a job however their structure has many flaws the management is very judgemental and very one way as well as they do not provide a fair enough treatment
good,As a door greater you make 12 dollars.  And as a cap 2 member you make 11. In all reality your doing all of the work in the store  but unloading trucks spring the pallets. Never having a solid standing on what you will be doing that day.You can do all of grocery and Chen's by yourself but the managers who get paid 100-200k a year will come down and say your doing a horrible job. And that you have to stay late to zone  all of foods and liquids while being stopped by coustomers and helping everyone with the 10 foot rule and if you don't make any mistakes.  This job is not worth it in anyway. Unless your management can learn to balance the workload.your technically screwed.   I would not say that working at a cap 2 member is viable unless the wage is brought up to 16 dollars an hour   while  door greaters make 12 really consider what your doing if your applying as a cap 2 member.
good,At least at my location its was a very unprofessional and unorganized environment. Customers were friendly and some coworkers became great friends but management was very biased and rude and unorganized.
good,Always busy and short staffed. The managers are always on their workers. The hardest part is to get a job done that requires 3 people. The most enjoyable day is the customers that appreciate your hard work.
good,"Good starting job, get rid of people quick, hardest part is dealing with customers, everyone know everyone, most enjoyable part of the job is it can be fast pace"
good,I feel if you need help solving a problem management wasn't never around to help with answers to your problems. I need more time to solve problems better than others.
good,all managers have favorite employees. but as long as you did your job and didnt miss anthing or forget something you would do alright. but it also would be a pain when other co workers left some of there work for you to do cause if you didnt do it you would be the one in trouble
good,"I have worked for Walmart as an overnight stocker for over 2 years, and it is a dead-end job. The management at the store I work has no clue how to run it effectively, and I no longer feel comfortable in the work environment."
good,"I loved my job as a cake decorator but management was so incredibly poor that it made the job not worth it. A typical day was stressful with no assistance from management whatsoever.  The other employees made it bearable.  But, again, management expected me to do the work of 6 people in a regular shift and if i did not get it done in time they would pull me into the office."
good,"Generally you clock in by badge and have a Customer Service Manager put you to a cash register, you get an hour break and 2 15 minute breaks if they remember you."
good,"I liked this job because something was different and new every day. There was not a lot of repetition. "
good,"I walk over 10 miles a day with no incentive but to do a good job for myself. I do great work, going above and beyond what my job duty entails. I have learned that being in this temporary job has humbled me."
good,It was means to an end but didn’t really enjoy it. They would give you just enough hours to have you right under full time so you wouldn’t get benefits.
good,"I mostly enjoyed working with the customers, they give you a lot of motivating to want to improve yourself. The hours were already. The management wasn't all great because they act like they didn't know what they're doing."
good,We would run reports off of all of the freight claims and hold the freight carrier reliable against the legally binding contract they had signed with us.
