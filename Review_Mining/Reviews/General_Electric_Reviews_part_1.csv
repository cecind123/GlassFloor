bad,bad experience working there as co workers are so negative and hateful and they managed to create a hateful environment there. even the higher officials are hateful
bad,"Le management est une catastrophe mauvais choix industrielle"
bad,really really bad. mo holidays. less perks. no joy.no fun.horrible place. crazy bosses. no salary hike.stupid people. avoid at all cost. waste of time.
bad,"This has got to be one of the biggest scam companies. They hire you telling you there is NO cross selling. Then you are demanded to sell. They lie to the customers. Provide poor customer service. The managers are fools, and the upper management is a joke. They promote people to management who know nothing about the job."
bad,I worked at GE Canada and the treatment that I got throughout my time there and the experiences I endured were very bad.  Wouldnt recommend to anyone.
bad,"I worked there in the early 2000's when all of the managers/people with solid knowledge of the company were there.  From 2005 to 2010, alot of those people left and were replaced with young kids that were only concerned about moving up the ladder and onto their next project within 6 months."
bad,Backstabbing corporate ladder climbers. Toss out their long term employees like radioactive waste right before they qualify for full retirement benefits.
bad,"Full of old fat guys that are lazy and worthless"
bad,"Terrible company, management is also terrible. Unrealistic company to grow with. Daily routine of work feels like going back to school again. Team leaders and management are also unreliable"
bad,Digital is a GE department that doesn't give it's employees a chance to grow in their IT career. They hired contractors to do the job and pay the lowest rates entry level salary to the new direct hires.
bad,This is a mismanaged company where the people who make the decisions have no idea what's going on.  Too many perks that aren't and politics are awful.
bad,"no work life balance at all. management needs some serious overhead. bosses dont care about you. benefits are horrible, only good thing were the hours."
bad,"Trying to sell from an empty cart"
bad,Find a better place to work. Because of the buy out from wabtec the moral of this company is very low. They are taking a lot of the benefits and retirement options away and cutting wages.
bad,I did not enjoy working for GE Capital. The situation never improved for me there and I had only been there a very short time before looking elsewhere.
bad,"Hated it very much, no more words needed. It was a place ran by children. It was very unorganized, and "
bad,Geen werk-prive balans. Weinig doorgroeimogelijkheden
bad,Supervisor need to spend more time supervising then  locking themselves in there office and sleeping on  Company time and listening to shop Foreman's. Shop Foreman  are only more into favoritism and  what they can  benefit.  Like brides from hot shot drivers and out side  Distributors.
bad,"Working time in GE is associated with constant fear to be fires at any moment due to unstable company's situation, disrespectful arrogant management, lack of opportunities for growth and development as well as huge stress at work, working non compensated overtime."
bad,"J espere que cette boîte va coulé "
bad,"Used to be the absolute best highest trained and respected water treatment company in the world as Betz. Although they provided good continued training, reps were simply numbers, expected to support the bottom line at all costs. Restructuring occurred and top producers were pink-slipped to save money. Business decision was made to handle those reps' customers with a completely different  business unit who did not have the training, nor understand the customer business models. Upon GE's purchase, the ""most admired company"" status degraded. They eventually backed away from the smaller bread and butter clients that built Betz in the beginning."
bad,"""Teaming"" culture promotes cliquish, backstabbing behavior; training and mentoring is sub-par."
bad,Muy decepcionante no cumplen con las promesas que hacen y si exigen mucho de tiempo personal. Trabajas sabados y domingos en cierres. Pesimo trabajo HR NO RECOMIENDO PARA NADA ESTA EMPRESA
bad,"Since this plant is closing its doors as of September, I don't have any observations to make. Management was responsible for this particular branch of GE failing."
bad,The company was full of managers that were managing business from quarter to quarter and ignoring at peril the long-term future of the business they were counted on to lead.
bad,"Be prepared to get layed off at any time,ask the 3500 employees that was lufkin industries at one time,purchased by G.E. ,no concern whatsoever with employees"
bad,They do not care about their empolyees and the benefits are horrible. I would not recomment this job to anyone. Go work somewhere else that will care about you.
bad,GE Lynn is the worst place I have ever worked. Toxic environment and abusive. Manger is a bully and disrespectful.  They expect you to be available 24/7 and work 7 days per week every week.
bad,Maior erro da minha vida ir trabalhar para uma empresa onde a vida pessoal das pessoas é misturada com a profissional. Onde se fala mal da vida dos colegas e onde nao ha rrspeito.
bad,Retiree's had insurance benefits stripped from them. Other benefits for retiree's were reduced. Corporate mentality is geared toward higher executive compensation and not employees. Good old boy network. Promotion due to race and gender - not ability or loyalty. Friends and cronies of bosses get promoted no one else. Minimum increases in salary at maximum length of time. Some employees laid off 1 year prior to being eligible for retiree benefits. It is not a people friendly organization. Everything is geared toward the benefit of GE and not the worker.
bad,Bad place to work terrible benefits knowing everyday could be your last Finding work after being laid off from there is a challenge as most companies won't hire because when they find out you worked for GE they assume you'll go back.
bad,"There are many layoffs and area shutdowns. You are told via emails or web casts that layoffs are coming. Sometimes when shutting down a division, you are able to transfer. Numbers are everything, and if you don't make your numbers each quarter, layoff occur."
bad,Failure to use synergies from 100 year old history and each BU is treated as separate.  GE is lost its direction and desperately needs new leadership/change
bad,"Experience of a life time, unfortunate we had to part ways, due to offices closure. But over all it was a great experience and a great environment to work in."
bad,Terrible place to work. They have terrible management and treat their employees very very badly. They have high turn over because of injuries. Very happy I no longer work there.
bad,we come in we clock in have a 15 to 20 min briefing and we would dispose from there and get our assinments and go from there at the end of the night we would clean
bad,"The worst company I have ever worked for !!! Terrible morale. Management is not supportive at all. It's not the company as a whole, it's the location in Richmond, VA"
bad,I started at GE 10 years ago and every year they are in a state of flux. It is very stressful to work in an uncertain environment. I need a stable place to work that will value by contributions.
bad,"You report to your shift sometimes a hour early, youre told to wait, you wait several hours to get sent home. Then go back again and again to do the same thing"
bad,location closed. The products we produced are no longer being made. There were a total of 8 plants that closed the same time ours did. I would not tell anyone to try and apply for GE
bad,The corporate structure in a old and established company produces a difficult work environment.  Management presses hard with little room  to show your skills.
bad,"GE was a buddy system meaning if you knew someone who worked there you would be treated better and have better pay than someone not knowing anyone, not a fair place"
bad,"As an employee you get a full exposure to the projects. You hit the ground running from day and it is expected to deliver fully with no introduction. Once overcoming the initial struggles the job can be satisfying providing that you don't care about the work-life balance, finance etc. This is a great opportunity for people absolutely dedicated to aviation and aircraft engines. My position is usually for very experienced people and I got it despite only few years outside GE. This is big responsibility and you are left on your own. If you managed to succeed after 2 years you would be consider exceptional."
bad,"One of the most boring places I have ever worked for. There is not only no promise of future hiring (no intern has ever been hired) and guidance, coaching and direction is absolutely zero. You are basically hired to do a bunch of ambiguous admin works and that's it."
bad,"GE is in the process of moving employees from the Atlanta, GA area to California so the morale is down in the office. We are currently developing railroad software. This software in the future will be developed in the California Center."
bad,Nice environment and culture to work with. I learned a lot from day to day work. Employees and each Businesses Leaders were kind and approachable and very accommodating.
bad,"Minuscule to no pay raises.  Glass ceiling at age 45!  Little career advancement unless will connected.  Egotistical, greed driven corporation and people alike!"
bad,This not a good place to work the staff is treated with disrespect . Management  is the worst I have worked for.The pay is not good at all
bad,"This is fantastic company but  I am looking for role to achieve my dreams. the role that could emphasize me to grow,,,,,,,"
bad,"This is a scary environment. They will make you feel secure, while the higher ups are planning for your demise so that they can increase their profits in their pockets and lay off people who will lose everything they have worked so hard for."
bad,"Pesterijen, uitbuiten van macht, demotivatie, hoge werkdruk, niet zo zeer door het vele werk, maar door de onmogeljike hoge eisen en onfastoenlijkheid wordt er met personeel omgegaan."
bad,horrible environment and place to work. i wouldn't recommend this business to anyone. They are defiantly a sneeky company.
bad,Great place to work. Wonderful co-workers. Great benefits.Management is wonderful.needs for company's like General Electric
bad,"Management does not care about the employee or the concept of ""work/life balance"".  The pressure to achieve revenue goals, promotes cutting corners and price gouging by the employees. those who go along with the practices OR suck up to management will do well. Those who stand for good work and proper treatment of customers will fail and be harassed relentlessly."
bad,"Learned many good things of handling customer over phone.learned to handle multitasking things and back end process"
bad,"Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a bug company. Not able to excel. Repercussion when exceeding seniors."
bad,"Really bad place to work. bullied out of job by managers, Not supportive. They don't respect work life balance, There is no job security or any chance of advancement. Its not what you know its who you know. They like to control every aspect of your life."
bad,is pretty good company..... learn alot but left because organization wasent good. move on to better things. maybe it will get better soon
bad,Productive workplace. Can be intense at times dealing with fraud issues. Showing empathy and patience is very important.GE is a diversified and innovative organization. Nice organization to work for.
bad,"Recently changed their name, Terrible management, vacation policy, sick time or personal day use. Unfair quota to make especially for collections and the management shows favoritism."
bad,"I worked in payroll and need to know about taxes, union dues and all benefits .Had to work with people all over the USA. I had great co-workers. Management was great. I enjoyed working with different people."
bad,Training and experience are exceptional.  The opportunities to continue and advance are abundant. Project management was excellent in communicating daily tasks and very safety conscious. Often given the opportunity to communicate ideas and concerns for safety and productivity.
bad,Management is the worst I have seen in my 30 years of experience
bad,"a typical day at work"
bad,"no motivation"
bad,Collect on debts for residential and business clients.  Offered various payment solutions in order to collect on these debts.
bad,"Nothing good to say ,to many managers coming and going this includes the plant manager"
bad,"Took calls from department store clerks, regarding the clients credit card balances, and approved credit increases."
bad,"It is a Company where Career is  ruined and  employees are harassed."
bad,I strongly suggest speaking with past employees before proceeding.
bad,"management is poor, facilities are adequate, CSR goals are not realistic"
bad,I was a design engineer at GE in Lynn MA working under the team called PEC (Product Engineering Center).
bad,Company does not support and respresent diversity. Dont really have anything good to say about the company..
bad,"Training for the actual job was horrible!! Got onto the floor and management had very high expectations. Micromanagement at its finest! This was the most stressful place that I have ever worked in my life! I dreaded going here, and would get physically sick to my stomach most days. I literally had to see a GI doctor because the stress of this job was causing me severe stomach pain."
bad,Fort taux de turn over dû à un mauvais management. Mauvaise ambiance et expérience
bad,"Poor Management with no support from real G.E. headquarters..."
bad,"Dangerous, ppl with no experience were making cran moves with extremely heavy equipment, and many different kinds of toxic chemicals you had to work with and breath every day no management at night and people getting hurt all the time very dangerous place to work the have defibrillators all over the plant also if that tells you anything."
bad,"If you want to feel appreciated for your hard work or dedication, stay away from GE. They do not care about their people and they will not recognize hard work. Instead, if you work hard, they will have expected that of you and want twice as much the next time. This company has absolutely no care of you as a person, the work you provide to help keep the business going, and most certainly not your family. The only good thing to say about GE is they pay good. But when you are mentally abused day after day by arrogant management, the money is not worth it. If all you care about is money, then GE might be a good fit for you."
bad,"Joined GE, as they acquired the company I was with.  Knew within days that it wasn't going to go well / end well."
bad,"fast paced lots to learn great benefits , hard to get jobs done union labor  many trades hard to  deal with to get the task competed .some trades are more difficult to deal with"
bad,"The job was never secure. You never knew if you were coming back to a job the next day. Building is very old and dated, not safe. Management is a joke."
bad,GE is always wanting employees to work overtime. 50-60 hours a week is what they tend to look for over time hours. They demand impossible quotas and expect employees to bust their backs (literally) to meet their satisfaction. Pay is honestly not worth it between taxes and insurance you may as well have a minimum wage job. In just a few months time i have been put on numerous medications to deal with the anxiety and stress of this place.
bad,"GE has challenges at the leadership.  I have worked for large companies like IBM and I understand that there is a lot of extra hurdles to execute sales.  However, the challenges with having a 'start-up' like Current-the group I am part of have been difficult to overcome.  In fact most of the original Sales Executive team have been let go as well as a large percentage of the work force.  I think this will continue to be reduced over time."
bad,"It was a mistake joining GE from the leading EV car manufacturer. If you like a company that loves meetings & politics, this is the place for you. If you like to accomplish lots of daily tasks with no BS politics, GE is definitely NOT the place for individual & team accomplishments. Management in San Ramon is composed of old re-threads of Silicon Valley who are milking the company with little or no results for the stockholders."
bad,Constant threat of being laid off. GE will most likely not be in Erie much longer. Texas is taking what they want out of the Erie buildings. GE management is very poor at best. Run do not walk from this employer.
bad,"GE is a super efficient company, employees always work overtime to meet the tight deadline. Training program is good. People are expert and knowledgable."
bad,"Lip service is paid to making sure the client is happy, yet they also expect you to get the client off the one in less than three minutes while at the same time denying them whatever it is in they called in for. Usually this would be to waive a late fee. There's a cost to efficiency, and the consumer pays it."
bad,"ok place to work. Can improve with diversity and objective  advancement opportunities. Good brand image and looks good on your resume. "
bad,"I had great co-workers and we did our best each day, unfortunately management kept on making cuts to staff and expecting those who remained to be able to handle the work loads with no delays, all the staff on the floor did there best make the company successful however it was a very stressful place to work at."
bad,"Below average"
bad,"I will never again recommend this job to ANYONE! The only good thing about the job is their benefits package, they dont treat you like a person/employee, you are treated like just another person who they dont care about!!! Even after quitting I have had nothing but problems, they WILL NOT send my W2 and are absolutly NO HELP!!!"
bad,"Modular Space is poorly ran. Typical day is spent earning business (and then losing the business because) ModSpace could not fill the orders with due to no inventory or old inventory. ModSpace management demanded we charge our customers top dollar for our aged inventory while our competitors had newer inventory and lower prices...all day, every day!"
bad,worked with ge i learned a lot how to deal with the customers.management is good.hardest part of the job long hours of working
bad,Big company your a number. Management is really a problem with no seasoned engineers. Don’t be a hero you get no recognition for doing a good job. You can move to other departments if your qualified. Skilled trades are under paid and being pushed out. It’s a sad reminder of what it use to be! Government should ban the practice of laying off works as a means to save a $ . icommunities
bad,"It's the most toxic work environment that I have ever experienced. There are teams but no real teamwork. Everyone is against each other and no one takes accountability for their mistakes. Management is just as bad. Favoritism, racism, sabotage,  etc... The money seems great but in the end, being around such toxicity isn't worth it at all. You wants to get you fired or written up for something you didn't even do. It's really sad. But, if you like money - go for it.  never know who is secretly"
bad,"They is lot of difference between in Salary  and  other benefits for off role employees compare to on roles"
bad,GE's culture seems to be one of embracing change and preaching a work-life balance while completely preventing one. I was required to work 88%+ of the year on the road.
bad,Entreprise inhumaine au niveau RH! Les responsables sont des fainéants incompétents.
bad,I worked there as a contracted employee and found that the company is not the way I have imagined it to be.  Arrogant and incompetent people who you had to rely on to get your work done; I would stay away.
bad,If you like being lied to about how many people are available to catch a job and never seeing your family or even your own bed the  this is the place for you. Your days off are taken before they ever even get close. The manager was rude and hard to work with. Your just a number.
bad,"When they hire you as a Temp to Hire worker, you will be told if you work hard and do well, the job will go permanent.  This is a lie.  Personally I excelled at my position in a very short period.  Worked on Saturdays and late evenings.  What you find out is that there is typically only 1 or 2 positions available and despite your hard work, you find yourself in a competition for the job.  When they decide, they will not inform you.  You are blindly locked out of the building by your Badge being deactivated.  No notice whatsoever.  Your agency conveys that while you did a great job, you weren't chosen for permanent.  In my case, they chose a Woman who was sleeping with another Permanent worker across from me.  This obviously ended up a complete disaster.  Very poor management decision making.  Very very cliquey environment.  Not professional."
bad,"The team leaders, supervisors and managers are severely lacking in professionalism and training when it comes to working with subordinates.  Their main challenge is their bad habit of using intimidation and harassment as a supervisory technique.  After 20 years of supervisory experience and training with the U.S. Air Force, I know that intimidation and harassment is not a supervisory technique.  It is usually an indicator of a new or untrained supervisor."
bad,"Would not recommend, very stressful, old school politics play a huge role in the day-to-day business there. A lot of internal rifts, etc. Pushed me over the edge!"
bad,"It's a brutal, hot in the summer, cold in the winter, filthy work environment. Management only cares about numbers, and gives no regard to your safety or personal life. Forced overtime daily, and weekends with only a 24hr. notice. There is no opportunity for growth or advancement, all pay raises are on permanent freeze. The union is non existent, and they barely know the rules/ rights. Team leaders are often extremely lazy, and show extreme favoritism to lazy employees that are regularly allowed to get their own way, with the attitude of what can I NOT do today. Much of the machinery is run down and often unsafe, maintainance is non existent, and even those at the top don't fully understand how to work on and/or fix equipment. The turnover rate is extremely high, and they don't want any employees there much beyond 4 years, they want to keep a constant flow on new hires in place. Senior employees are lazy and often held unaccountable as to what they do on the daily. This place is nothing like it use to be. The only benefit is there are some friendly coworkers that genuinely care. The place feels like a sinking ship."
bad,"Pas de stratégie à plus de 6 mois, culture de la communication sans résultat. Manque de justice et de respect des opérations. Beaucoup d'heures pour peu de reconnaissance. Accepte régulièrement l'out of process qui peut être dangereux pour l'entreprise."
bad,If they promise you that they will pay you something after lay off do not believe. Even if when I call to the headquarter about some problems they did not care. The higher management lies and disrespect people.
bad,"After working for the last 8 years, and having what you thought was a secure future for yourself and employment, you are told that you among hundreds more will not be part of the future of this company. They are known to do this repeatedly and then hire back after lay offs only to repeat the process and not guarantee that you will remain an employee."
bad,"The company protocol is to make as much money as board of directors can handle. There is a culture of little empires and their dictators. "
bad,Very poor management. Racial people get away with a lot. Managers do not communicate updated policies. Poor time management from managers. Managers never available.
bad,"I worked for GE Capital in Sale a few years ago. They went through 3 rounds of redundancies within a year. The management was incompetent and they bullied staff and played staff off against each other. They Managers were making performance-related decisions when they had not even seen the work you do."
bad,"many problems"
bad,"I have no idea how this company is still in business. It's just amazing the sheer level of incompetence at all levels of the business, but most apparent at the VP level and above. Management is only interested in protecting their image, not in delivering results."
bad,"I enjoyed my job but not the office politics. My intent was to retire from GE, but after 20 years, they decided to eliminate a number of positions. IT is not in a good position at GE in general now."
bad,"Long travel with no real benefit."
bad,A silo approach to how work is organized has workers disconnected from other workers. The beauracracy is incredible and designed to give job security to those who maintain the mountain of red tape. Management helps themselves to undeserved lavish bonuses at a time when GE is suffering from extreme cash flow problems and very low earnings.  The cost of health care benefits is extremely high - the highest I've seen yet. The overall lack of fiscal responsibility will lead to more layoffs and cutbacks. There's a huge cultural divide between the Indian and non-Indian workers where the Indians help each other out but withhold information from non-Indians.  I would avoid GE at all costs.
bad,The management is not clear about the road map. Wasted effort due to frequent change in direction. Reward is based on personal relationship and politics.
bad,"GE is NOT a Software company. They are trying hard to become one but is harder when you have to fight to change a hard core tough Industrial Culture into a more fast and flexible one that can get adapted and implement solutions in timely matter."
bad,"Very cut-throat post April 10 when most of GE Capital was put up for sale, too many senior leaders without a seat and not enough seats."
bad,"Awful place with a terrible HR person who did not care about employees at all. Cut throat and uncaring managers. When a coworker was killed, instead of letting me change my schedule to accommodate therapy and help with my mental health, they denied me. Did not want to work with me at all. Took months of therapy and pills and moving away to begin to gain my life back. I hate this place more than I can express."
bad,when employees bring up concerns about safety or how to improve things they do not want to hear it they completely blow you off by saying they will get back to you and never do. there is no communication at all from management about anything. only time you here from them is when you do something wrong. you walk around all day wondering what you suppose to be doing and if you ask no one else knows either.. been their 4 years and things are only getting worse
bad,"Werken op het GE Global Operations Center in Budapest was een leuke ervaring. Budapest is een erg leuke stad om een tijdje te leven en te werken. In de eerste weken wordt je met veel zaken geholpen. Je moet wel rekening houden met hoge werkdruk en veel onbetaalde overuren. Managers kunnen je ontzettend uitbuiten en maken soms misbruik van hun machtspositie. De eisen die men aan het werk stelt zijn onredelijk hoog en je hoeft niet te rekenen op een bonus, compliment of een salarisverhoging. Op de werkvloer zie je veel ongelijkheid, pesterijen en uitbuiting. Het verloop van het personeel is ook erg hoog. Zie het als een leuke tijdelijke ervaring in een fantastische stad. Zo lang er met een knipoog naar kijkt is het prima maar een serieuze carriere optie is het zeker niet. Je bent met een bijstandsuitkering in Nederland beter af. Als je jong bent is dit een perfecte manier om een onvergetelijke ervaring op te doen. Zelf kijk ik er met veel plezier op terug en je leert het leven in Nederland meer waarderen als ooit tevoren."
bad,Poor management makes this place something to avoid. I worked at the division for 10 years and for GE for 30. Lack of material is normal. Customers employees are mostly good with a few exceptions.
bad,"GE operates a very lean business with extremely lean core staffing that requires its professionals to work 50-60 hour weeks. It provides little job security, and a poor work-life balance. It does not provide admin assistance or project management even for large projects which adds additional responsibilities and work loads to its managers."
bad,"I was on a team which displayed extreme lack of professionalism. People on the team mimicked other cultures in a derogatory manner. Team members talked about everyone, including our direct manager, negatively and behind their back. These team members also discussed other people and our manager, with upper management on the floor, laughing, loud, rude, and nastily. "
bad,"Sometimes helping the picking department but my job responsibility was to pack everything that needed to go out.  "
bad,"It was a position in a call center environment.  This was the worst place that I have ever worked in my life. The corporation consisted at the time, of a bunch of crooks.  They stabbed anybody in the back.  Talk about ""Dog eat dog?"" "
bad,"very busy work, I did a work of 3 people, my supervisor told me once."
bad,a terrable place to work horrably managed if they would clean up the manigment mess they would make easily ten times the money they make now
bad,poor manage. poor pay. poor benefits. high turnover. hated this place so much it was sad
bad,"I worked 4.5 years for GE Healthcare in Lake Havasu, AZ. My job was to travel between 3 hospital every day and assist 1 stationary tech at havasu hospital. I would would spend 2.5 hours on the road. Not once did I ever get a chance to go to school to get Vendor training was always promised but canceled at the last minute. Management demands to much to get done without authorizing OT. All the years I was there I worked with 4 different Techs due to them quitting, or getting fire,d and each time I never got promoted. Management knew I wanted to transfer within GE and would come up come up with excuses why I couldn't transfer. My past 4 yearly reviews were great and I was never put on a performance program. The last tech management hired was given a PC Lead title. I had to train this guy for 5 months until he felt comfortable and then he started being a control freak. Feel sorry for who ever has to work with him. He has major control issues. He expects you to answer your phone within 2 rings, wants you to call him to update him where your at at all the times, degrades you if you know more them he does, he's lazy expects others to do his administration work, doesn't know microsoft programs like excel. In all, working for GE Healthcare in Lake Havasu, AZ is a great place and working with the hospital staff, but is a black-hole because of GE management. 3 DI FSE and 8 Biomed Techs have quit GE because dissatisfaction with management."
bad,"The call load is horrible, there are never enough people......Supervisors spend their time screwing around with each other instead of helping, it is a very flat organization with little room to move up.."
bad,"Very poor management created a culture of distrust and backstabbing. Too much red tape to get much done. Overall, very poor experience."
bad,"I worked at GE Grenville for just short of 4 years. Overall, management is very rigid and egocentric- current management seems to be the last generation of kids from Schenectady who sucked up enough to get there.Very autocratic and authoritarian."
bad,"This is a 3PL that tries to pass itself off as General Electric. Truth of the matter is that General Electric Executive Leadership and Management team is abysmal and couple that with the Granite Leadership, it is not a place anyone would want to stay. NO ADVANCEMENT opportunity, this is a churn and burn business. No support from Human Resources on everything from questionable ethics to hostile work and harrassment."
bad,"Terrible place to work! they care about the numbers and that is all. People have died over unsafe work conditions(place is disgusting). Safety is a joke and managers come and go. The managers look down on workers. In my 7 years my money practically stayed the same as management only got worse and less knowledgeable. STAY AWAY!"
bad,"They will allow managers to fire the people at the bottom, when it's the lack of management that is the reason they are losing business, delinquent, and are wasting so much in scrap material and wasting money over-nighting parts."
bad,"- Very bad management."
bad,Its a okay company to work for. Benefits and salary are good. Management is horrible. Never listens to the employees and create drama between co workers
bad,This company was not well run and site is now closed.  Incompetent management led to the demise of the company and the workers were the ones to suffer.
bad,"La valoración más genérica pero que da una imagen muy veraz de esta empresa es la caída de la acción de la empresa desde $60  en 2001 a $6 durante la crisis financiera en 2008-9, para volver a $30 en 2015 y volver a caer hasta $6 en 2018."
bad,"Still too much thinking in terms of short term profit over long term investment. No preventive maintenance, wait till it breaks mentality."
bad,this place is not for the faith of heart. must be on your toes or get cut. all the tech make working here bearable but management is terrible and horrible.
bad,"I became a GE Power employee through an acquisition of Alstom Power. It became very clear from the beginning that most of us from the acquired company had no place at GE and as such were laid off when hard times hit especially in 2017. "
bad,"GE use to be a great place to work.  With the changes in the last number of years, GE has lost focus of where they were going.  Employee moral is the lowest it has been in years.  The new management is not directing the company in a profitable direction."
bad,Answering phone calls all day long with minimum breaks sucked. Also working with a group of women was horrible. Training sucked also. I would NEVER work there again.
bad,"The management likes to say is is a fun place to work it but they never really mean it. yes, they have the toys but everyone is watching and counting how long you are in your seat each day."
bad,"I took the job because it offered a full time job, however at very low pay, but it got my foot in the door so to speak.  Working conditions were not that bad, just lousy pay.  I left at first chance I got for better pay."
bad,"Felt like I was doing outdated and inefficient processes that didn't capitalize on my strengths or benefit my clients. "
bad,"The manager was inexperienced in their position and the consultants hired to work on my team were poorly matched (due to lack of experience), cutthroat, and the managers played sides and angles to try and achieve poorly scoped deadlines and tasks. It ultimately backfired.  "
bad,"Was caught up in a mass company wide layoff. It does not matter what the quality of your work is like. When you are selected for lay off, without an explanation, Your time is up."
bad,"Terrible Management, Harassment does not mean anything and the bottom line I worked my butt off everyday for 11 yrs to turn around and be laid off. What bothers me to the most is that I can look around at any given time and see the same people do nothing and all that happens the your boss come over to you and give you sh#t for doing more. What I would love to see management be accounted for."
bad,Looking from the outside in the company seems to be a great place to work but ince you get in the company you start to realize that you are just a number and you are not important to the company.  You will be micro managed at all times and given different managers that do not know there job so it passed on and ob to others
bad,"micromanaged to the nth degree with NO respect for anyone!!!  Double standards depending on whose butt you kissed....NO respect, poor attitudes, no planning (everything was last-minute crisis mode)."
bad,GEH Management is all about the 'good ol' boys network' and doesn't reward those who work extended hours and go the extra mile. Those who sacrifice for the company are the ones that are let go first.
bad,"poor middle management many complaints to h.r. and nothing done about it in 9 years"
bad,"I hated working for GE.  Took a decrease in pay just to get out of there.  Was bored most of the time and when I was hired they said I would be doing all these interesting things but turns out they put me with a different group which I had no interest in.  Tried to change jobs within the company after being there a month, but they said I would have to wait 5 years before I could change jobs.  When I told them I was leaving after about 9 months, they were then willing to then allow me to change departments"
bad,"GE Capital brings employees on board with a very warm and fuzzy approach. This is a misrepresentation of what comes later.  Management is untrained and workload expectations are not reasonable. Low morale among employees, nasty work environment. The culture is: ""hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.""  Big elephant in the room and you better shade your eyes..."
bad,"bad place to work, no promotion, very bad management, they don't value employees, race is a issue. standing in one place 8 to 10 hours, no paid holidays, will no let u change jobs or switch shifts,no bonus, no reward for hard work. low pay"

I think the corporate people  need to have a realistic understanding about what happens  at the plant  on a day today bases ,its people  livelihood their playing with"
bad,"Managment at Erlanger facility is a joke they have the Ge logo but this place is far from the real Ge.  They promote hostile work environments and verbally abuse employee so think twice before u apply!! The real Ge is in Ohio , the current employees off day one told me how bad it was, I tried to be optimistic being new but soon found out within a few days how bad it was ran!!! Everyone here is ready to quit, I couldn’t believe wat I was hearing , I really looked up to Ge until I came here , wow wat a disappointment and disgrace this place is compared  to wat the real Ge is in even dale Ohio! The floor shop  supervisor here was great and caring but that is where it.stops all upper management , runs employee in the ground and promotes verbal abuse! So good luck to anyone who wants to be set up for failure, hopefully the real Ge looks into this facility and it’s high turnover rate!!!"
bad,"They use to pay very well, but that stopped a few years back. Management there completely sucks and can not figure out anything and dont take any new ideas. The union in Schenectady are only worried about maintaining their positions. Overall... great place for lazy useless ppl, not a good place at all for ppl with any drive or ambitions."
bad,"No good experience, five years company ran same struggling to get management to treat its workers better. Job security limited due to seniority. Work lots of unnecessary overtime."
bad,"Met some great people there. Even a few good to great managers. But the overall leadership was terrible and the cut-throat matrix organization hampered the ability to actually make needed changes and improve the process. Oil&Gas long term employees resented GE buying into the field and long time GE employees chaffed at the O&G types thinking that they were special and only they knew how things were done. "
bad,"Fortune 100 Company...Must be GREAT..Right?  Sure, Great company they are, at least on paper. At the time, I had a concurring offer and yet the management team at GE fought to hire me, and sold me on a dream of what they could offer me, unlimited vacation, great location, all time high profit margins that were on the rise. I signed the paperwork, started the job and a month after my hire date, the sky was falling, All of a sudden even a business phone was out of the budget. I was in the process of relocating my family and started to become nervous as I noticed that employees all around me with a tenure of 20 plus solid years were suddenly being escorted out of the building with no warning, they never saw the pink slip coming. Then a few months after my hire date, I received a phone invite from the HR rep, the director, and my boss, who is leaving to go out of the country for 3 years the next day.  I am told that I along with 2,000 other employees would be let go.  All due to business conditions.  So in one month, this company went from the pie is in the sky concept to the sky is falling.  Stay as far away as you can from this organization, Google the name of this company with the word ""layoffs"" next to it...they literally have a forum where employees gather together to discuss their injustices they have suffered at the hands of these corporate clowns.   I have never seen such dishonesty and coldness in my lifetime.  So glad to have moved on!"
bad,"poor cluture, PC over competence and performance, poor management, constant worry about job security.  Leadership is poor, unwilling to hold anyone accountable for waste, poor performance"
bad,"Very Frustrating company to work for.  You are told early on that your ability  to be promoted is 90% who you know, 10% job performance.  Not motivating."
bad,"Global Research is a great place to work if you are motivated by helping scientists achieve great things. That said, the IT department was poorly managed, fraught with leadership turnover, inter-leadership personality conflicts, uninspiring leaders focused on personal survival, and not in tune with 21st century IT culture. The integration of the IT Staff into GE Digital was poorly executed with confusing and false messaging. GE Digital seems to have no use for the former GE Global Research IT staff."
bad,I moved around I also . I cleaned of refrigerators made sure they came down the line rite put the part n a sent down the line. I worked thru a temp service.they didn't pay enough.
bad,"no accountability of upper management.   "
bad,"It is so mis-leading to read all these positive reviews that are highly inaccurate."
bad,GE is a terrible place to work.  Their Executive Management strive only to pad their wallets and those of the investors. They are very hard on their employees and consistently reduce commission plans making it harder to achieve established goals.  They lay off frequently when unrealistic goals they have set are not achieved.  The employees live in a constant fear of job loss.
bad,"Closing facility due to failed products. Constant rotation of management, none qualified to lead company or product direction."
bad,"Unsafe, wide open nitric acid tank, uptight management, evaluated by pwople who spend literally 5 mins a shift with you. Terrible work experience for me"
bad,"première expérience professionnelle .pas une réussite tant au niveau  "
bad,My overall experience at GE Capital has been average. The institution need to adapt to change in the regulatory landscape.
bad,This place had a very bad safety culture. They do not practice what they preach. The management is all over the place and there is little to no communication what so ever.
bad,A typical day was 10 hours of drudgery. I learned that managements only concern was productivity. The management showed no concern of worker's needs or overall health. Most of the people I worked with were steady workers. The job was very fatiguing with no reward.
bad,"As a software engineer a typical day includes patchwork maintenance on a legacy system. I have been instructed to chance some of my fixes to leave dead code in our system because our safety team and management is oppose to changing to many files because of the extra regression testing that would be needed for proper fixes. Long hours are expected of engineers. Upon successfully finishing a project which is profitable, and where overtime was worked to meet deadlines, no bonus or a low or insulting/demoralizing bonus is given. Because you work with legacy your job is secure, however lacking advancement opportunities and transferable skills."
bad,"The Business Leaders are two faced, they stick up for females and side with females, The leaders do not take employee’s seriously, and every employee is just a number, the company is not like it used to be where it cared for it’s employees and cherished them now they will just hire the next in line just like most other corporate ran companies."

bad,"Or they know that it was in violation and they wanted to try it anyway or they were so stupid that did not know the fundamentals of engineering."
bad,"Great opportunity to work in a highly-matrixed environment. Provided opportunity to develop personal skills, but most middle management is power hungry and will manipulate and step on their reports to get what they need for their own advancement."
bad,No job security. Always talking about cutting back (layoffs). Upper Management (not our site) sending work to other plants in other countries that could have been done here.
bad,Great to be in a company which is the largerst industrial giant and can anytime adapt to the needs of the market. GE has several businesss which can be sold to generate cash.
bad,"Coworkers great, but management was truly clueless and disconnected from how work really got done.  Flexible schedules great, but not as available as they made it sound.  Hardest part of the job was working around the ""bosses"" who generally barked orders and set deadlines but had no idea what was really happening in their group."
bad,"This job was call center support for credit partners under GE Capital from Lowes, Home Depot, JcPenney and others. Shift work was required and knowledge of the credit industry."
bad,Non engineering company that is operations focused with no product development. Sink or swim environment with little support from coworkers or management for maintenance of 25+ year old software. Extremely limited career advancement. Not recommended.
bad,"This company is horrible, They will lie to you in your interview, tell you everything you want to hear and then tell you that it was never said in your interview. However if it comes to something that benefits them they will hold you to every thing you said in the interview like they recorded it and wrote the 10 commandments out of it. No one in the entire plant communicates with each other, Then wonders how things got so messed up. Are Warehouse inventory accuracy last year was 0.5% accurate. It was so bad that SAP would show thousands of parts in a location and you would walk back to find nothing at all, and no one was even surprised. I was actually told by a manager at one time that even though I was paid by GE that I was only working in a place trying to become GE. Because the plant didnt run be GE's standards. They told every employee during training and interviews that they had 3-5 years of solid work ahead and then hired hundreds of people, hired a bunch of temps and then 8 months later got rid of all the temps and 9 months later announced the closing of the plant. They never has any documentation to prove that we had solid work ahead. They just thought no one could live without the product they were making and planned for a major ramp in production that never happened. They rent the warehouse their in, then rented another warehouse across the river for the big ""ramp"" in production. Remodeled and expanded the current warehouse all for this big ""ramp"" in production! Now they have nothing to show for it. Then they told us that we shouldnt worry about the closing of the"
bad,"This is the most corrupt, unethical place I've ever worked. HR is lazy and does not want you to bother them with any issues. The male-dominant upper management system holds a yes-man culture and floor supervisors develop inappropriate relationships with the female employees. In other terms, women get their ""promotions"" by flirting, or even sleeping with the manager, not by their skill set. Women will get promoted before the men will, and it's the men that typically have to back them up because they cant even get rate on their machine, and rate plays a big part in your promotion. They pretty much told me if I didn't like the culture, then quit. So I did, after over a decade of working there. I miss the pay and the clean atmosphere, but it honestly isn't worth my supervisor touching and acting inappropriate with me, or retaliating and treating me like a dog if I dont submit to their unprofessional behavior."
bad,"Terrible management and HR. This claims center could be a huge asset to our community, but employees are disrespected unless they are part of the clique."
bad,"I believe that a job is not worth doing if you are miserable and, Unfortunately, I am.  The pay and benefits are excellent, however, that does not make up for the fact that my rights are violated on a daily basis.  I have tried to amend things and make GE a tolerable place to work, but my efforts have been all for not.  "
bad,GE is your typical greedy company who only cares about money and not the quality of the product they build. Horrible management and union. Just a disgrace of a company!! Not a very good company to work for as far as job security. You can be laid off at anytime. Bosses are inexperienced and have no knowledge of what’s being built or how it’s built. No clue how to treat employees.
bad,"I honestly wanted too retire there along with my 2 late aunts , but I started right after Haier took over & everything was different. They wanted to start us 12 an hr but eventually changed it 14 , which still ain't much after union dues"
bad,"I know nothing about the other G.E.'s but G.E. in Vandaila, Ohio is a horrible place to work. First of all do not trust the union. They are in bed with management.There is a subtle hint of racism in the air and you notice it the first day. The older women that work the floor are mean as snakes and if you are young and pretty they will find a way to get rid of you. My boss was spineless, I took care of him but he never returned the favor.I know for sure that a couple of people there are on drugs and that's scary considering that they make power systems for Military drones. Do not go there the place is a total mess."
bad,Management don't care about nothing or no one but themselves and have very little respect and consideration for other people nor their time. Pay isn't horrible but it could be better. And the parking lot is terrible being you can't some on the premises so lots of people leave for lunch for that purpose. I've never went to school for management and I know you can't make everyone happy but I do know when the majority of your employees are unhappy something needs to be done. And it won't hurt to listen to what they have to say.
bad,"Typical  day starts with your inbox full of  nonsense,that has no relevance to your job. Doesn't get any better. Confusion and Quality issues from The start of your day till The end of your day. The management at best are the poorest I have ever worked with. Don't expect any training . There is none"
bad,"pay is excellent, union protects the people that should be fired. a trained monkey can do almost any job there. culture is one of constant stress, even when there is no reason for it, someone will make your day stressful. they will lay you off regardless of performance while keeping the guy you trained to do your job because hes been at the shop longer."
bad,"Some good people worked there. But most managers, especially upper management, are only numbers driven and the news reports in the past months are showing why that is bad for the company. Trying to do the same thing and expecting different results is definition of insane. Highly matrixed organization where one person can impede the good works of many others. Silos abound and whats-in-it-for me attitude rules. Career management system is a joke unless you get in on a leadership development track early."
bad,"Having been off for four days come back for my four on, and a typical day starts with trying to work my way through the vast amount of e-mails I have which are 95% rubbish which is of no relation to my job. Everything is confusion from start to end of day. Constant quality and engineering issues, management is the poorest I have ever witnessed in a company, they will not make decisions or take accountability. They rely on the shop floor staff to make the decision's for them and when things go wrong , ""which they usually do"" , staff get the blame. There is a bullying culture which is actively encouraged by management. This company is so dysfunctional I am amazed that it survives. If you want training, a good and happy working environment then don't work for G.E Oil and Gas."
bad,Horrible Workplace.  GE stand for good for Executives. Beat on employees so they can make preposterously large bonuses for fictional quarterly results.
bad,"GE as a whole is a good company, but GE Corporate is a nightmare.  Work for a GE business instead (like GE Power), but stay far away from Corporate, it's a nightmare."
bad,"My experience at GE was not ideal. My manager was extremely rude, used expletives throughout the day directed at different workers, and was verbally abusive in some aspects. The shop floor employees I worked with were also equally as vulgar, and it was a very ""head-down"" environment. I'm sure other parts of the company were fine, but I had a terrible experience."
bad,es una muy buena empresa pero solo de nombre porque sus beneficos son malos.
bad,guaranteed 4o hours per week but you barely make any money have a chance to get hired but its hard
bad,Top quality company best in class. Great place to work. Really nice people and really good business model.
bad,"GE benefits were great, pay was great. Overall management is the cause of my review seeming negative. The project i was on was poorly managed which ultimately led to a plant closure. The people i worked with on a daily basis were great and i got some really good experience, it is just a shame that our management team lacked experience and it showed through the poor decisions made at critical points throughout the years."
bad,"You are damned if you do, and damned if you don't."
bad,"I was hired without ever meeting my manager.  In 6 months of working there, I still never met my manager.  He never had time for my site or me.  In short my manager, never backed his people."
bad,"Sadly, all levels of management turn a blind eye to obvious favoritism based on social networking outside business hours, despite these concerns being communicated directly to Executive Management.  Employee's are placed and/or promoted based on this ""networking"" versus their skillset(s).  They do NOT encourage questions that will help an employee to better understand processes, even if it will help you adequately perform your job.  They are very process driven however, processes set in place are outdated, not accurate, and more often than not, make no sense."
bad,Management did not know the job that they were in charge of. Your reviews here were always fabricated and inaccurate as the management did not actually witness the job being performed to rate you. They went by information that was third party.
bad,"Terrible place to work. Management is terrible starting at the top. Culture in Billings is horrible, back stabbing and throwing you under the bus at every chance they get. I wouldn't recommend this job to my worse enemy! Stay clear of this place. I can't stress enough how awful this place is! They hire and fire like its nothing. My manager didn't talk to me for 3 weeks! She sat on the cubicle across from me every day, with her back to me, and never acknowledged me. I can't stress enough how awful this place is"
bad,"Management was set in their ways, HR was tone deaf to problems, and employees were all older individuals who stabbed younger guys for their own job security."
bad,"GE is not willing to fundamentally fix what is broken."
bad,Not a bad place to work for short term but many politics and top down management structure. Not much accountability for employees to complete projects or take on tasks.
bad,"No job security.  Lay off at any given moment  Anti-union, they will take anything and everything away from the workers until it fits their need.  They turn workers against others to promote turmoil."
bad,Trust me. This place is great to work at as far as the work goes. Do not go to graveyard. The management in that department is one of the worse I've ever seen.
bad,"I worked for GE for 16 years and was laid off. The reason for the lay off was one manager didn't like me. ALL of my performance review up till then was ""Superior"" when I went to work for her, I became her LEP. That year all LEPs were laid off. I have tried numerous times to be re-hired, to no avail. I finally just gave up even trying. It seems that an employee that has been loyal for 16 years would be called back in after a lay off, but they have somehow ""Blackballed"" all of us from ever being hired back. They have hired hundreds of new employees since the lay off, but not one of us."
bad,Great environment.  Management was marginal.  There was no job security.  Nice workout facility.  Worked at the banks and the building was awesome.  My division was sold and I was out of a job and not permitted to apply for any other inter company jobs.
bad,Ge was a well paid well benefitted job. It put food on my table for 20 years. I had the best supervisor In the plant and I took pride in a job well done as well as good production numbers.
bad,Used to be a great company - now not good at all  As the company was winding down the quality of the management team changed and was not as good.  The work and the people triedtheir best but poor management decisions were made as evidenced at this time.

bad,"general electric is an impressive place to work, however I'm looking for something, not so hard on the body, I'm a older woman, who's looking for a more laid back job."
bad,"Almost goes without saying given the space that they're in -- banksters who aren't even qualified (i.e., third tier). Management took advantage of government/taxpayer backstop (FDIC insure scheme w/GE Bank Business) in regular course of business yet 'willy-nilly' lays off those taxpayers on a whim. Then asks for more backstop to keep doors open and management well fed after disastrous '08 bets (particularly shoveling fee garbage to FNMA/agencies, etc.) and continues to lay off groups without a thought - Banker Socialism at its best!. Somehow they're able to look themselves in the mirror."
bad,"the most enjoyable part of the job is the people. "
bad,"Inward inspection."
bad,Night shift sucks. Manager was bad. Day shift is great. The manager was willing to train me on anything and was down to earth about everything. He made it great to work there.
bad,It seemed like there were a lot of conflicts of interest. I headed the shipping department and had to deal with several vendors. Our primary (but not best) vendor was the GM's brother-in-law.
bad,Poor management and stifling leadership. Rogue behavior that supported the bottom line was promoted. It was difficult to witness good people hurting and working in fear.
bad,Shouldn't be operating a valve co. ! Basically tarnished the 145 year old Masonielan valve Co. reputation in 5 years ! Closed the doors on 300 employees in Massachusetts and hundreds more in 3 other states in the last few months .

bad,i'm a hard worker the good thing is I have fun work at GE oil and gas company and I allways lean new thing there but the bad thing is they closing out next year.
bad,"Although colleagues were a pleasure to be with, the job role was extremely demanding and the training definitely not adequate enough for the role."

bad,"I was hired as a temp to work at GE. The people I worked with had been there for 10,20,30 years or more. I felt scrutinized as I was a young adult. I worked on an assembly line. Not the best job in the world! My management was great, co-workers were cold and the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to listen to the radio."
bad,The company is very great and the salary is very good. I would advise everyone to apply for this company! They care about their employees.
bad,I applied for one position and they put me some place where I did not want to be so they let me go.
bad,"The all mighty dollar is more important than people's lives.  I did enjoy my career at GE up to that point, but being outsourced outweighs everything.  I heard the experiment failed as well."
bad,"General Electric is currently downsizing and shutting down may of their offices in the US. As a result, I would not recommend General Electric for anyone wanting a long term position. The office in Knoxville was well managed, but closed December 2016"

bad,"The power plant has all the equipment that a utility plant does. Once you have mastered this plant you can work anywhere in the industry."
bad,Very good site at finding the right jobs for you. have not worked long enough.
bad,The bosses are rude and have a bad attitude. They take a long time to help you with what you need and take a long time getting to work. Anything you ask for may seem like your annoying them or aggravating them. If you are late they take an hour off of your check. The supervisors don’t listen to what you have to do and if you had anything planned and let them know in the interview they won’t hire you.
bad,"A empresa era boa para se trabalhar, tinha um salário compatível a função,porém ocoria muito atrasos de pagamentos."
bad,"But not any more.  The union has traded away everything that made it worth putting up with the long hours of very uncomfortable working conditions.  No more retirement, medical sucks, and wages have fallen through the floor."
bad,No apperciation for employees. No direction or training from the managment team. They expect you to perform your job at 100% without any training.
bad,"It was a great place to work until veing sold out. I was there for 6 years without receiving a pay raise. Company didnt care about workers, only product and numbers."

bad,"I learned a lot from coworkers and the job were challenging! We had competitions! I learned how to tack. Management wasn't up to par. The hardest part of the job were, when you didn't have anything to do, it got boring! So I had to find something to do like clean up my area and make it look nice! The most enjoyable part of the job is getting the job done well first( I love to put out the products) and  when I go on break and socialize with coworkers. We were a team a family. And when everyone got laid off, we cried. It really hurt to see someone loose their jobs after all those years. But life goes on to maybe better things. Like working at the post office until I retire!"
bad,"The rules and regulations are different for each person, depends on who you are friends with. Weekends are a must to work, the only time you get off is if you use a vacation day. Management is not around or ever available when needed or if they are there no one can seem to help or answer questions pertaining to the customers problem. The managers are not helpful.The company would be great if the rules set in place went for everyone instead of a select few and actually had a manager that knew what they were doing. It makes it difficult to want to go to work each and everyday when you have managers that gossip, act like they are in high school when they are pushing 50 years of age, and the rules are constantly changing. I use to love working here, but it is becoming more challenging. I guess it doesn't help that your manager comes to work drunk and smelling of alcohol either."
bad,"co-workers were nice."
bad,"I spent some 4 months working in the Xing Jiang province with GE Oil and Gas and they were the most difficult 4 months of my career. We had no Internet, no access to international phone calls and the food and accomodation were definitely below international work standards."
bad,They are cheap dont want to pay you for how hard you work. Ins is too high and no good. management has thier pets and will let them do any thing while others can't. I would not send any one there to work.
bad,Without a degree you don’t go anywhere Experience doesn’t mean anything anymore. Did not stand up to what was promised in the interview whole different view after getting hired.
bad,"Management is terrible, very catty and judgmental of your personal life and beliefs. Pay is terrible. Its more of a call center setting than anything, can only go to the restroom when okay'd etc. Its ridiculous."
bad,"Oldest plant in GE Aviation, heavy burden on plant to produce but without investment in upgrading machines and processes to match demand. Leadership preferred blame and pretend any lack of success being a function of the union and the union employees instead of honest assessments of capabilities and challenges. Lack of investment in upgrades to capabilities to meet requirements and unable to properly/accurately predict requirements/schedule/demand made success impossible."
bad,"Good temp job.  Hired be ready a lot of inside hand washing hand going on. Equipment is so old there is constant breakdowns. Leaders are not leaders."
bad,General Electric needs to do better by their employees. We are treated like we don’t matter and we are replaceable. 3 years ago I was so happy w/this environment. It has changed drastically! Do better GE!
bad,workers routinely pay for poor management decisions. We are always made to pay for reckless deecisions made by mangers that have no idea what they are doing and are quick to assign blame to those under them.
bad,"worked twice for  4 months without a day off - worked every holiday, every weekend - no life work balance. - they will use you up and spit you out , notorious for lay off's -  pay is not that great, company is in chaos, every department was being reorganized  or sold off, or consolidated - difficult to get training, HR department is horrible."

bad,Productive and competitive individuals are let go for sweet talkers.No record performance. All hardwork goes down the drain as the managers change every quater. Its a horrible leadership style without direction.
bad,Working in EHS at GE was difficult. Many practices were just viewed as that is how they had done it for years so it was hard to encourage change. We were trying for VPP status when I was there but with the overall attitude it was difficult. the EHS manager was great thouh. She really knew her field.

Made continual changes to departmental spreadsheets. Plenty of repetitious requests. The place was in term oil. Not a fun place to work when I was there. Morale was terrible. Most all people were hired temps. No benefits and no time off. Rumor had it that the place was for sale. That's what GE does...buys companies, builds them or at least tries and then sells them hopefully for a profit. All at the workers expense."
bad,Demanding - long hours expected. Employees are often expected to take their laptop home with them. Working on the weekend is the norm.
bad,"Co workers are good, new technology, lear many things about the work, no proper plan, not able to balance your personal life and professional life"
bad,"I enjoyed the co-workers and the management had a meeting with their employees to divide the work for each employee starting at 5:30PM and I left a 4:00PM because I started at 7:00AM and finished at 4:00 PM, so the management did not give me any work the first week.  So the time sheet was filled out with 40 hours for general time.  The upper management came to me and told me I could not use that time sheet account.  I was supposed to eat that time with no pay.  So I went to my supervisor and ask what account I could use for that first week.  She told me that I could use the general time account.  So I was stuck between a rock and a brick wall."
bad,"The typical General Electric day proceeds with the task orientation of checking emails from customers, technicians and executives. After emails are adhered to, then customers requests are then arranged. Communication between myself and technicians commences, schedules are reviewed with technicians, then they are dispatched according to locale, demographics, skill and customer request. "
bad,Strong learning culture to help employees develop their skill set.
bad,"Overall good place to work."
bad,I remdled houses and still do time to time for my mother in law who owns the buissness
bad,"Company is all about money, you must sale even if you do not work in sales."
bad,"New electrician subcontractor, the employees often had to wok in dangerous working environment(s)."
bad,No priority to peoples personal life. They want projects to be delivered but the requirements change drastically. No good attitude towards the employees.
bad,"would not recommend this place to anyone. mandatory overtime for assembly line, but no parts do to a lack of overtime on the line that feeds  parts to the people on mandatory overtime."
bad,Stop allowing abuse of power. The management are nothing more than power hungry and are promoted not by their skill level but rather who they know and who they are friends with.
bad,Currently at GE Management roles are based on who you know not what you know.  Motivation is low.  The divestitures have taken a lot out of people and Capital produced the most income so expansion is non-existent. They are finding their way again without effect leaders or vision
bad,It is what it is. New managers watch everything that you do. If they don't like you they will ride your back. You can get away with anything if they like you.
bad,"bad management, great co-workers. The upper management promotes those who follow without questions. Overall company performance affected by unnecessary acquisitions."

bad,"okay place to work, however they should be more forthcoming when hiring people about the work description. you should also be able to apply for a set shift"
bad,"Not a great place to work, major disconnection between managers and there employees, People seem to work against each other instead of team work.  Was not very happy when I worked there."
bad,"The current management is currently too focused on short term numbers management and chasing quarterly profits with little regard to the longevity of the businesses.  They rotate management too frequently with little regard to the knowledge of each specific business and industry.  In 2-4 years most management teams completely turn over.  "
bad,"75hour work weeks/ 6 to 7 days a week."
bad,"Pros: on time payment"
bad,"This company has merged since I left, twice, so any review I make of this company would be meaningless to anyone as the company does not exist anymore."
bad,The culture could be better. There is a major bully culture at GE. Employees speak with vulgar language and say rude and obnoxious things. This happens in every group in GE and the company HR allows it.
bad,"cons beginning to out weigh the pros.  sub par health benefits, work life balance nonexistent.  some pros are job security, GE is not going anywhere, so you are secure with that."

bad,"This company suffers from being stuck in old ways. The culture presented by management and the actual culture are different. You are encouraged to speak up but everyone I've known to do that, ends up leaving the company within a few months, not of their own accord. "
bad,"Working at the GE erie plant is a joke."
bad,The best characteristic of this organization is the deep pool of talent that is present in many functions.  It is energizing to work with such talent in many ways.  Unfortunately this particular part of GE has become crippled by poor upper managements inability to lead or make decisions.  All too often quality talent leaves due to poor leadership that are woefully unable to provide a path forward and believable direction for the teams.
bad,I enjoyed my job here until I started being sexually harassed. I ultimately got fired for tell HR about what was going on with me. After all of It completely made me look at the company different I hate GE
bad,GE is just too large to be run effeciently.  It is very management oriented and no care is given to the folks out doing the work and are the direct line of customer relations
bad,"GE (Care Credit) makes a valiant attempt at promoting a balanced work day with activities that are available during lunch breaks such as"
bad,"high stress and dangerous mentally and physically, enviroment, manipulative and unethical. some employees were ok most were hostile cause i was not related to anyone. paycheck were good"
bad,"Blah, blah, blah."
bad,"This company cares nothing about its employees! If a machine breaks down, they act as if it is your fault that it did, even though they do not provide training, parts or documentation. If things run smoothly, they act as though you are an unnecessary expense. No pats on the back, few ""thank yous"", lots of grief!"
bad,Worked very hard with very little support. GE is a big company but the support system is broken. Management lead by fear.....the hardest part of the job is internal process to gett pricing and orders approved. Most people did not like their job.
bad,"Sr. Product Manager for Medium Voltage Motor Controllers manufactured in Mebane, NC and for MV metal enclosed switches in Monterrey, MX"
bad,"GE will work you to death with no regard for for safety or your sanity. If you are out of work then yes I would take a job at GE, otherwise if don't work here if you have other options. It sounds cool working for GE but after a few months it becomes a nightmare. I have worked for Pfizer, Toyota, CA and many other large companies but GE is the only one that made me 1) hate my job and 2) Cry at work. It is just not worth it."
bad,"Well i learned it was an unfair place to work with a somewhat decent job security and platforms. I did enjoy some of the people i met there. The cafeteria was nice with decent food. the managers tho were a little on the pick favorites, and not base it on work ethic and skill."
bad,"Employees comes and go especially in the maintenance department where there's no structure of whatsoever, department not organized, don't expect a good review regardless how hard you work your butt off. Lost 3 good employees and supervisor in less than a month due to poor management and structure. Don't waste your time"
bad,"interessante Produkte, Gleitzeit, nette Kollegen, Obst steht zur Verfügung"
bad,The plant manager wanted me to take his Green Belt exam for him then when I would not held mine up even though I completed my test first of all the employees until such time as he finally passed his exam. Not sure if he even did ti himself. First time in my life I have ever been glad to get laid off. Glad they made that decision for me.
bad,If you like change - work here. If not move on. Management is all from either France or the US and haven't got a clue of what's going on. They come up with out of touch campaigns that the customers do not want and need. Pricing is so high they price themselves out of the market.
bad,"no comments on role.  Difficult matrix virtual organizations to work with.  Functional silos, operations is responsible for SQDC but non of the functional roles directly reports to operations.  Work flows are a death sentence."
bad,"The Union created a stigma, and being a member burns you from advancement.  Both the union side and company side are unwilling to work together. The environment is toxic to say the least."
bad,"They try to perform innovation by twisting the fundamentals of engineering and when the person in charge advise of the mistake they get rid of him. "
bad,"The temp agency called me and asked if I was interested in this job. There were 2 shifts but I said I only wanted to do 1st.  They told me the pay rate was 14.70 I said I could work with that. Later I was moved to 3rd shift with no pay increase but that was fine because I was a temp and I learned that all the temps were making about the same amount no matter the shift they were working. Then they hired me and I learned all the lies. "
bad,"The work was easy, the set schedule was a plus.  However, management promoted the wrong people.  There was no supervision or accountability.  Management was afraid to discipline employees and there was an imbalance workload."
bad,"I am usually waiting for parts to complete my daily task. I learned that this is not the place for longevity. Management is salaried and workers are hourly. Management has only one shift. The work force has two. Management in certain situations will compress the hourly shifts, which results in less than a full shift for some employees. The culture is on a rapid decline."
bad,Decatur GE is full of drama and problems. They say one team but everyone counts themselves as a team alone. If you work here dont get caught up in the drama and definitely dont take your bosses word for fact.
bad,"Your direct manager can make or stagnify you.  Notice by two senior managers put me on special projects, sent me to meetings and seated me on two senior corporate account review boards.  This earned me SME status five times and $ service awards, all without my manager's support. Policies are not uniformly administered: one team member was warned via email that taking 30 days post cancer leave would result in loss of role and placement in a ""similar"" probably not permanent job; yet a coworker with an issue was kept on payroll/benefits (verified as true) for 365 days and was laid off on the 366 day.  Her role was held so that others could not promote into it.  The remaining 2 teamers did the work all that time."
bad,"Towards the end when the first round of recent layoff began, they were starting this new thing where the Project Managers were managing dozens of projects at a time and most of the Project Management functions fell to the Projects Engineers (like me) and they required us to be PEs on many different projects at once: thus, we were not trained in Project Manger functions before this was thrust upon us; since the Project Mangers were no so busy they were unavailable for assistance, so it felt like being set up for failure.  "
bad,"When you come to GE through an acquisition you have no future with the company.  Only those ""born here"", that is hired in can advance in the company. My unit was moved to Texas and the assets, including 95% of the employees were eventually sold off. They wanted the technology, not the people or the office. One less competitor."
bad,"GE was completely based on financial gains.  This was a cutthroat  organization and a good old boys network.  I was paid well, but the culture was terrible.  I would not recommend working here."
bad,"Anyone looking to get into a management position at GE Schenectady should think twice! The Schenectady campus will be closed down within 2 years the writing is one the wall, all of us managers are looking to leave before the axe drops! The company was doomed by the last two CEOs  this was once a great place to work now it’s a great place to leave!"
bad,"Although the workscope is always challenging, so are the corporate transitions GE has undertaken over the past few years. These have affected not only the ""new"" direction GE has taken, but most of the ""transition"" has been to reduce operating costs and those mostly have been put on the backs of employees. "
bad,Great people to work with on a line. You get no pay raises. Great benefits. Management is really a pain on first shift but any other shift is okay. U can bid from job to job within facility.
bad,Dificultad para crecimiento ya que hay mucho compadrasco.
bad,"The company is extremely wasteful. A good analogy is stepping over dollars to pick up dimes, for the culture there. Production goals go unmet due to corporate leadership not paying vendors in a timely fashion. Then, somehow it becomes the workers' fault that they are unable to complete their jobs."
bad,A very difficult atmosphere to work in due to the economic challenges.  The company had been mishandled for years and now the employees are paying the ultimate price.
bad,"Engineering driven company, believe sales will come from word of mouth for client engineers, no quota on sales dept. for selling engineering services."
bad,"I worked for this company. Generally worked overtime during peak period. Perks are the benefit, but fail to see any career advancement opportunity as there are retrenchment on-going for cost cutting."
bad,"job security is not there, poor management, union doesn't fight or work with you, very dirty place, production work always trying to get more out of you"
bad,Sadly it's a culture that no longer is enjoyable to work at. Everyone fears daily they are going to get the news that they no longer have a job. The team spirit no longer exists.
bad,The role lends to a stressful atmosphere and a high demand for a constant presence with a customer.  Management typically lacks presence and is indecisive when pressed into stressful situations.
bad,Great bunch of guys work there just management does not take care of there employees . Some long hours but the employees work together and get the job done.
bad,"Nice colleagues for the most part.  Crabs in barrel mentality spurred on by insincere management; overworked; underappreciated and underpaid.  Company was cheap -- did not support professional development  -- definitely not financially.  Sometimes professional development was supported on my own dollar, and mostly if I took PTO for it."
bad,Terrible place to work. It seemed like the company did not care about their employees. They were always more focused on making more products than they were on taking care of their employees.
bad,"Always we had the fear of job loss. HR and Manager driven company. Their decisions are final.  "
bad,"GE O&G is stockholder-centric and not customer-centric, at least in the wireline segment. Always had an excuse, never fought for the customer and had absolutely no sense of oil fields 24/7 mentality."
bad,Every couple years you'd get a new manager with a new agenda.  The work was exciting but you never knew what tomorrow would hold.  People who you thought were strong contributors were let go all the time around you and you always worried when it would be your turn.
bad,"They don't hold staff accountable for performance.  Mid-management works extra to carry the load. Upper management pushes performance pressure, cost cuts and prospective work to mid-management.  HR priority is giving everyone a trophy for doing nothing.  They are inexperienced - and making the judgement calls instead of allowing management to do the job they were hired to do. They will pressure you to clean up the problems, then sell you short by sending your work elsewhere (over seas) for cheaper service on the drop of a hat."
bad,"GE has lot of potential to build good software in IIOT. However, management is not focused on what is expected from company. Management and org changes every year contribute to lack of stability and also hamper ability to determine whats best for your career in the long run.Lot of people are in there for retirement with no desire to build any good product"
bad,"Pros: "
bad,"A typical day at work can be very unpredictable as the structure of work is unorganized and too volatile.  You may be given a task that seems straight forward and may seem like you have the correct amount of time to complete, however, you will get railed with changes and expectations along the project development cycle that is not managed nor accounted for.  Thus, resulting in unrealistic expectations, and a setup to fail."
bad,"Typical day at work is not knowing what you are going to do, followed by too much to do."
bad,"GE Money are no longer operating within Ireland, so I am not in a position to offer an up to date opinion, as it is almost 10 years since my time there"
bad,"Warehouse can be a good place to work."
bad,"Short-term focus, always about hitting the quarterly numbers.   Decent work/life balance, able to work remotely on a regular basis."
bad,"Currently the atmosphere is not good due to the announced restructuring plan. "
bad,Salary is not bad.  Healthcare benefits are terrible.  Management is not consistent.  Don't expect to progress very far unless you have come through the FMP program
bad,"Very surprised that the company has so little focus on Quality Systems.  Major emphasis is keeping workers safe, not a bad thing but I believe the primary reason is to prevent claims."
bad,Didn't like the fact that in the Collection Department would have you ask the customer to hold a yard sale or borrow the money to pay the credit card bill.
bad,"Very little in the way of work/life balance, don't respect boundaries, many managers use their ignorance of a subject to protect them from being responsible for a decision (or even making one).  But, there is opportunity to make good money if you're willing to move around to different jobs and/or areas."
bad,"Growing, diverse Company with many business challenges and opportunites."
bad,Company is good to work with.  No work life balance. Watch your back!
bad,"When General Electric took over Dresser Pipeline Specialties, it was like they had taken most of the blocks out of a decently solid foundation. The company was descending into total chaos and a lack of direction when I decided to leave. It's a typical factory job, pretty repetitive but also has some decent people to work with."
bad,"After the acquisition by GE the quality of our products, service, and management steadily declined.  Customers were sold lower quality products and given poor service.  Management continually talked of growth while reducing the workforce."
bad,I was offered a better position with better benefits and pay and could not pass it up.
bad,"Likes to Work ,Friendly Atmosphere,Low Workload,Less Projects,Not a Best Management."
bad,"GE is a leader in Energy and a pretty good company to work for. In the office environment your day is pretty much answering emails and calls. Other GE employees are bad about copying your boss in emails to you if you haven't answered a previous email. When you are a supervisor and spend more time in meetings than at your desk, time to answer emails is limited. I'm in logistics for GE and it is a highly stressful job."
bad,Ok place to work. Hard to imagine spending a career here. A lot of time is spent on safety training etc. Just not a place hard work alone will earn you advancement.
bad,seniors are very good for encouragement.
bad,"Other companys are better to work,, not so good with recent management changes and team leadership not at par with skills and team management skills, managers today at ge are not fit for people managmanager itment"
bad,"Company is continuously changing its objectives and management leading to unclear goals and too much work pressure, expected to work 24/7. lots of restructuring and uncertainty"
bad,"60% of the work force of about 500 employees there were contact workers. They would work for a time and be let go. If you were lucky, you could come back but still under the same contract. No added benefits or up in pay. My position had a new employee every 9 months to a year to avoid having to hire someone on long term. I was the only one in the office that was contracted."
bad,"GE has very little in the way of effective leadership, due to the established practice of promoting people based on friendships , rather than ability. The ability to follow instructions does not necessarily make you a competent leader. Neither does being a good golfer!"
bad,Munca haotica si lipsa sigurantei locului de munca.
bad,Une Journée de travail typique rien spéciale a dire sur cette entreprise.
bad,GE did not bring good things to my life.  worst career move ever too many meetings daily to do workload so people didn't pay attention in meetings because doing work
bad,You have to be physical with some of the jobs that you may be put on but some jobs are laid back if your lucky enough to get that type of job.........
bad,"La general electric è una grossissima Azienda, con piu di 2500 dipendenti, un'azienda che garantisce i diritti dei lavoratori e mette alla disposizione di ognuno lavoratore la possibilità  di crescere .Ma ci sono persone che prendono l'azienda come loro casa che valutano delle persone rispetto a loro razza , loro religione."
bad,"Very rote job duties, not much interaction with other people at the company, very insular and political.  corporate culture was one of fear and competition,"
bad,"Most enjoyable part of working at GE was there were great people who worked there. Management was horrible, never talked to the manager once or did the management give any praise to anyone on the manufacturing floor."
bad,"more on on metrics then the people who worked for them. Need more qualified leadership to diversify the job, more  training to better equip the service professional"
bad,"Never gave raises, there were no way to really advance in the company. "
bad,"Poor management lead to poor workplace culture. Preached quality but never cared to oversee good quality, rather just push for work to get completed. Terrible."
bad,Just another place to work. Not interested in how great a company is. Its like working at any company you come do the work and get paid for it. What's magical about that?
bad,"I fill like they just use people with little to no intention of hiring people. Layoff rates are high. If you are looking for job security or benefits, this is not the job"
bad,"GE capital/ synchrone is same in hyderabad."
bad,"Basic factory job, hard work, did not pay enough. Short breaks and lunch breaks. Insurance was not very good. I don't mind hard work but I believe you should be paid according to that. People were very nice and the ours were good."
bad,GE culture is suffering right now due to the changes and financial constraints. Management is only worried about the short term returns and is not looking at how to grow the company. Leadership does not care about their employees and look at them as interchangeable.
bad,"I worked there many years ago, so I do not think my review would be relevant to the current situation.  Looking at the news today the company is really beginning to tank."
bad,"Confidential information Not applicable  "
bad,"GE is a shareholder driven company and everything else is secondary, we work very hard and long hours to achieve our goals. Even with the decent pay its hard to offset the work environment that is this highly demanding, involving late nights and weekends. In the division I work in and we are such a small group that advancement is difficult and options to move elsewhere in the company is based on your managers approval.  I am sure other divisions might have different work experiences."
bad,The Erie plant is run poorly. Worst culture I've ever worked in. The bosses treat their employees like red headed step children. I am glad the plant is divesting.
bad,"Great people and connections"
bad,If you did not fit into the cliché then you were pushed out. Trained a new employee for my job then told I had poor performance and they fired me.  Never written up or had any bad marks.
bad,Valoración bien una etapa de mi vida lavolar donde aprendí sobretodo el trato al cliente y gestión de documentos contratos y ventas
bad,To much re-structuring. Didn't feel like I was a part of the company. The benefits are great but the re-structuring is bad. Having different managers every 4months.
bad,GE's culture can be overwhelming and will often lead to people leaving the company.  It can be a good company if the culture is acceptable to the enployee
bad,Each job is different and training is very little if you are willing to come to work and do multiple jobs daily then this is the job for you. decent benefits.
bad,"Nothing can be said. Only worked there for three months as a contractor. Communication was OK, pay was OK but not sure if they still exits in Canada.."
bad,"Workplace culture was ok but their was room for improvement, Management was ok. I worked for GE for 24 years full time.Work days was the same we had a production schedule"
bad,"I started when the company was PrimeStar Solar, a start-up company that was developing PV solar panels. PrimeStar was a wonderful environment, the best I ever worked in. GE was a prime investor who later decided to purchase us. GE attempted to assimilate us by changing the way we worked and integrating a layer of management that did not seem to understand how a solar manufacturing company should be developed to be ready for production. Some issues came up with achieving the electrical efficiency needed for production and GE decided to shut down the organization. In my view, that was a poor decision."
bad,This was a college internship 12 years ago.  I would not say I have a clear understanding of the working culture within GE.  I was thankful for the opportunity.
bad,"The management team works through intimidation, harassment and abuse.  The friends & family plan is how people are promoted rather then through skills and integrity.  Company rules are not followed by management unless employee has been targeted for harassment by the management team."
bad,"Grote onderneming, internationaal, weinig flexibel."
bad,"While the people at GE are very competent, the corporate culture is so political that I found that to be stifling to innovation and risk taking.  Also, the lack of diversity was not appealing to me."
bad,The company was in nascent stages with low process and policies in developing stages requiring huge changes. An mnc with huge divisions has to show high synergies
bad,Sales office for General Electric   Product for Industrial and commercial building  segmented. Set up channel partner for GE in Indonesia to sales GE product

bad,"We get 401K, insurance, 3 weeks vacation a year and 3 days personal time. Get one day off, on 3rd shift but work 1st shift hours, management with no experience, very stressful when your schedule has been changed 3x's in 4 months, technology that is not worth anybody's time along with a program that has the warehouse in shambles. With all that said, my job along with 200 + hanging in the wind"
bad,Here i have learnt communication skills. With good work environment and good colleagues. I wan in customer care inbound process. The process was SBI card.
bad,"I found  the training to be limited and co-workers largely too busy to help me get up to speed so a lot of my education was self-taught.I was surprised that a company this size didn't have a more formal training plan in place.I was involved with two projects, one in particular, where I was able to determine the necessary requirements and was able to use my skills to assist these groups and felt that my contributions helped to have these large orders ship on time. That interaction and their appreciation of my efforts were easily the most satisfying part of this job. Once the projects wrapped up, I asked for additional tasks but eventually due to a drastic slowdown in current and planned projects this year, the business focus involved cutting costs quickly and drastically where possible and this included the elimination of all contract employees. I was told that when business picked up again, there would be an opportunity to be called back.I felt I had a good relationship with my manager and was sincere when she said she would like to bring me back when business picked up. I took this position with high expectations to prove myself for a full time opportunity,worked hard everyday and did meet some good people along the way, but overall left the company somewhat frustrated with the experience."
bad,a lot of uncertainty about your position - most all functions are outsourced - GE is a pioneer of oursourcing Amerian jobs!!!
bad,"-Product Branding"
bad,"GE Transportation tend to use legacy code and not keep their older project up to date. the work place environment feels like slow and old.  I seen not one but two managers walk out from under the interns. "
bad,"This job was very stressful dealing with angry customers all day long. Management was always riding you on your Q-cal scores, they ALWAYS  found something to ding you on. Nothing was ever good enough!"
bad,Working environment is good Its good to work with GE Capital but salary is not much more.
bad,"Expect to work 12 hours a day.  Working on weekends is expected.  Very little support from management, hence it is up to you to learn your job.   What makes it difficult to do your job is that gathering of the information is extremely difficult.  Their ledger and tax systems are antiquated with multiple systems and they are not user friendly.  You need to be an excel expert in macros and special function.  Most of your time 85% you will spend in data gathering.  there is very little support.  It is not a good place to work.   If you survive 2 years, I recommend you transition to the GE Business Units, they have a better track record."
bad,"If you have that little green badge good luck working here. Yes there is a big difference between the blue GE badge and the green GE badge. If you have that blue badge you will make more than enough money, you will have great benefits, you will have that slow GE walk because ""Hey your getting paid a lot of money to walk this slow"", and work leave all the hard stuff for the guys with the green badges. As a green badge you will be asked to do everything, and you won't get overtime so be aware of that. You will pay for your own benefits out of your measly pay check, and since your a contractor I have heard you don't get raises since GE has a contract with your company and the price has been set. Also while being a green badge, apply for those GE jobs all you want they won't be calling you."
bad,"They say they want the truth, but they really don't. We spoke up for a co-worker who was being treated unfairly and we lost our jobs for it. Stay clear"
bad,"Weekly meetings good"
bad,"I learned a lot of valuable skills from working in two different departments, so there is room for movement withing the company but it seemed hard to move up"
bad,Poor culture and poor management. This company is good only if you want to move on to something else. GE looks good on your resume
bad,Enjoy the challenging work everyday
bad,"Management is good, Company is good.but I expecting good salary level as per my work performance."
bad,"Worked as a contract employee for 8 months before the company decided to end the contract. Contract employees are treated differently than permanent employees, as they are not allowed to attend company functions unless they are invited by their manager. This struck me as odd, because contract employs were allowed to participate in activities that required donation of time, money, etc. I thought this policy was very unfair."
bad,Entreprise qui se restructure très rapidement cela est un atout lors de stratégie clairement définie.
bad,There were always opportunities for Overtime and to learn new things within the company. But sometimes the process to grow and move up within the company takes a long time.
bad,Aucune évolution à envisager et pas d échanges pour améliorer les compétences
bad,"There was no clear instruction on how they wanted the tast to be completed. "
bad,I did not enjoy my time at GE Capital.  The constraints on timeframe in position prevented me from moving when I wanted to.  Needing 100 % support from manager hinders the ability for changing roles.
bad,Lack of integrity this company ask for us to comply with integrity on their level but yet they themselves will not have integrity for their employees this company is based on nothing but nepotism
bad,"I worked at GE in the Houston area. My first job was in channelview at the jacinto port facility. This was a pleasant experience. The pay was very low but the job was excellent. They then move the entire product line to OKC and I wasn't able to relocate. I then transferred to the field service department which was miserable. The management was horrible,pay was bad,and time away from home was very tough. Time off wasn't even a possibility. No guidance,no chance for advancement."
bad,"Manager not bothered almost ""not my job"" and ""its always been done like that"" attitude make it a very out dated approach to any work ethic."
bad,I wouldn't work here again nor recommend it to anyone.  Upper management are full of false hope and extremely unorganized.  Safety is at the bottom of the totem pole.
bad,General Electric pay is descent although the hours are fairly General Electric may have good production but the new contract doesn’t fit the job family emergency are careless to General Electric
bad,Layoff galore. Always a temporary job. Management was too young for their roles. Very stressful not knowing if you're going to have a job day to day. GE sold 49.95% to Wabtec so who knows what the future has to offer.
bad,My manager was flexible and always willing to help advance my career.  He was one of the best I have ever worked for.  He was fair and understand the work/home life balance
bad,Grace à un environnement syndiqué vous aurez de bon avantage sociaux et un bon salaire mais vous serai congédié au moindre manque d’emploi qui sont fréquents dû a une mauvaise gestion de la production.
bad,The pay is good since you only have to work 4 hours in your shift. Breaks are an hour long and you have 3 of them in a shift. Unfair practices for personal. HR department is a joke.
bad,"Very PC culture.  Managers are terrified to say ANYTHING negative.  Performance evaluation is a joke-it does not quantify performance, its a collection of ""attaboys"" and maybe you should do this differently next time.  Management is unbelievably tolerant of lazy, poor performing workers.  They compensate for giving the better performers more work to do rather than removing."
bad,"The work for hourly employees is dangerous and almost guaranteed to cause health problems. You are trading your health for a higher wage, although the hourly employees they hire now are on a lower pay scale.  There was a concerted effort to get rid of the older, higher paid employees by any means possible."
bad,"As big as a company as GE is, there's a lot of missing pieces from training to management, to safety and QA."
bad,Not a place I enjoyed.  Corp Cash Culture ruined business.  Moved work to Europe because Alstom workers had nothing to do and could not lay them off.  So USA jobs were eliminated to cover the bad deal thaqt GE made buying Alstom.
bad,"GE culture doesn't promote innovation the brand was once known for.  With a top heavy leadership structure, managers hold less and less decision making authority, yet are exposed to most of the risk."
bad,"GE Capital was a great place to work. A couple of years ago, GE decided to divest GE Capital which then reduced the enjoyment of the job. Across all of GE layoffs are occurring."
bad,"poor culture, no job advancement, management promotes only within. hard workers are not only discouraged to apply, but told to consider to stay in their current roles."
bad,"Work life balance is not good. With cash issues within ge, many people have been laid off and more are expected.This makes for a stressful and unpleasant work environment."
bad,Most projects were challenging. The current environment is stressful because of rumors of layoffs  Funding model for employees is not sustainable because overheads are too high.
bad,"General Electric has a lot opportunities to grow but it depends on character of your supervisor."
bad,"GE, in 1984 was a fun, vibrant place to work.  Over the years, GE Aviation has offered several early retirement packages that has reduced the experience level drastically.  Those too young to retire are now extremely overworked."
bad,"In my experience at GE appliances I have held a variety of jobs, that being said the work/life balance is normally steady. As long as you show up and do your job things go very smooth. Management has their own way of running things and they do not listen to your advice most of the time. Benefits are decent. Job Culture depends from section to section."
bad,"this place is clueless.   not doing this out of anger just time to make changes, place seems to be shutting down since change. the maintnance manager was a manager at subway!!!  that should sum it up"
bad,Can be a very challenging work environment. It is fast paced and can be rewarding if you are willing to put in the time and effort it takes to be a part of a multinational type company.
bad,Es wurde viel versprochen jedoch nicht eingehalten.
bad,There was a lack of support from management with concerns about processes or training for their employees.  Resulting in low moral and team building atmosphere.
bad,Only place I never saw anyone hourly or salaried get fired for not hitting production goals and quality goals over 3 years. My area never hit production goals and no one cared it was amazing to witness.
bad,"Lack of communication to staff, Need to know basis and you don't  need to know attitude. "
bad,"Nice place to work but needs more structure and organization. Making lots of changes.  Very festive, just not many ways to excel.  Been there for almost two years but still inthe same department."
bad,My experience at GE was very average. Their is lack of communication between employees. There is no accountability from teams. Needs a lot of improvement.
bad,"I'm a hard worker and I was laid off for performance issues on one of the lines I worked on for one week. I worked there for four months, I was hoping to get hired on any day when I was abruptly laid off, I NEVER called out a single day, I worked till I sweat, and I learned how to do things others hadn't learned working for the company for years. I'm pretty upset. The benefits of working there are you have decent health insurance, you have good pay, and the hours are convenient to parents when working first shift (once you are hired)."
bad,I am unhappy with my current role however there are much better roles within the organisation if you are prepared to travel. The work could be interesting given the opportunity to change roles. The trouble is when they need you in your current role they have a tendency to lock you in.
bad,"Azienda di enormi dimensioni"
bad,"There are no typical days at GE, everyday is different."
bad,productive and target driven. Limited Growth opportunities
bad,"GE Capital, Chennai. is a joint venture company with SBI credit cards."
bad,worked there two years great benefits/pay.  Also good job security
bad,"Souring of PL from Open Market and from HPCL outlet"
bad,"Can learn a lot about product, but very bad with Work/Life balance, bad Coorporate culture. Manegamante birocraticaly oriented."
bad,GE is a decent place to work. A typical day is very routine as you are doing the same repetitive task. I learned to be very regimented and to fit into the system. Management is concerned with getting the job done and nothing else. My co-workers are for the most part good people committed to doing the job right. The hardest part of the job is the lack of advancement potential and low job satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers.
bad,"management is not professional, work is easy ,very strict oneverything"
bad,very demanding management
bad,"Pay is good but they are slave drivers. There is zero work life balance. The culture is to work every night and every weekend. They laid off too many people in the recession and don't have enough staff for the endless projects and initiatives. As a result every exempt professional has the equivalent of 2 or 3 full-time jobs. Management boasts about profitability and its ""lead six sigma"" approach, but their profits are good because they don't invest in hiring more people. It's a sad statement about the low value placed on the people that do the hard work that keeps the company going. I will be quitting soon and I urge you not to work here unless you don't want to have a life."
bad,fast pace calls coming in back to back
bad,Limited advancement opportunity. Typical people contacts for employees were replaced with phone centers and internet interaction. The company has been cut to become a systemized business and does not have people interacting with it's employees.
bad,"Attendance was the least restrictive I have ever seen. Good management. Decent hours. Free coffee, tea, hot chocolate. Shows some generosity. Trust me you could do a lot worse. Benefits were phenomenal. Look to start a family,  you will want their benefits."
bad,"My management was solid, but they had to release me due to saving the washer and dryer programs. I got along with all phases of producing the washer and dryer. Powder Coating was the area I was involved with. I felt comfortable with all supervisers and managers in the APE2 building."
bad,"I'm High Functioning autistic, and it was just terrible place for me. Some good co-workers, but overall management treatment, and lack of understanding of my disability made my time difficult.  "
bad,"The team based systems work well for the company but not for new hires coming in. If someone dose not like you on the team they can fire you during your 90 days. It dose not matter how good of a mechanic you are. It really stinks to have your whole career based upon how well someone likes you. "
bad,"Comme toute société américaine, cette entreprise a une culture d'entreprise très importante."
bad,"GE is continues on a slippery road!"
bad,"I worked for the company for 20 years, but the company has gone through massive layoffs. GE as a whole is not doing well. This is not the company to go work for in its current climate. Maybe in 5 years."
bad,"Rules not consistent throughout. Unions need to protect its outstanding workers,  not the druggies that fall asleep on a continuous  line while working and almost get working partner killed. Ge lost a very good worker...Me. That idiot only worked a few more months"
bad,"GE is a diversified company, so your experience is going to vary depending on the company, region, etc. I felt like the company overall was kind of poorly managed, although individual areas were great. The culture I experienced was aggressive, and advancement was kind of haphazard."
bad,"What should be an amazing company is instead a bloated management structure only looking for the next stepping stone up.  The only thing keeping the company alive is the dedication of so many at the low rungs of the company.  If it where not for the large number of under paid and under-appreciated employees there would be no GE."
bad,Challenging to keep teams motivated and focused on work in the midst of significant changes at GE.  Current management team also challenged to fix the ills of past leadership.
bad,"The future of GE Lighting is coming to an end, and this has been extremely evident over that last 3-5 years. Corporate continues to push a ""Continuous Improvement"" philosophy, which I completely agree with. Unfortunately, they never have a budget to support it which leaves employees drained and discouraged."
bad,GE had some good tools and learning programs but the management and leadership were all connected with too much nepotism and favoritism.  Only the same 10-20% were constantly promoted or set up to get promoted.   All others were just as good or better and were set up to fail or were told to leave the company and not seek advancement.
bad,I learned to become a machine operator there which is about the only good thing about it.  Didn't like the culture there. Benefits started out good but got worse through each contract.
bad,"I think GE in general doesn't quite know what it's future is...it's best to stay away until they figure it out.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with a culture that everyone says they believe in, but only a rare few actually do."
bad,Poor leadership. No appreciation for employees. No support from upper management. Arrogant attitude towards workers. Poor example set by leadership. Fraudulent business practices.
bad,Hostile working environment. Very high pressure. If you complained about anything you we're labeled a trouble maker. Very high turnover. Poor training practices. I'm only talking about Sacramento branch. I hear it not like that at other locations.
bad,excellent place for the freshers or for aspirants from small towns to be astonished with the whims and fancy frills at work and stay glued for a while.
bad,"note to employers, I currently have work restrictions from my doctor. I con not lift more than twenty pounds, I can not do repetitive kneeling or bending."
bad,Muy poco salario y poca promocion de asensos en cuestion de mantenimiento.
bad,"I loved working at GE at first but the negativity begins to grind on you. Management is always changing. People are constantly being let go. Then suddenly, there is a layoff. They call it death of a thousand cuts because they do these mini-layoffs most of the time. It just got old. Plus, women don't report it but there is a lot of inappropriate talk and some touching. Very weird company."
bad,Was a great paying and good environment workplace. Unfortunately negotiations between union and company officials faltered and the plant closed. Company wanted to take from workers and pay half the salary to new employees.
bad,"new in building valves. need more experience in holding there employees."
bad,"Performing duties with General Electric, can be a strain. There are many risks that are involved when building capacitors. The gloves that the company provides are not very safe. There is a high chance of someone being shocked by electricity."
bad,"GE is undergoing staff reductions based on Corporate Share prices and global growth reductions, There's a lack of managerial leadership at all levels and unfortunately some bad decisions are affecting the whole workforce. Moral is poor and the future doesn't look good..."
bad,"Be prepared not to have a personal life. Good work challenge environment. Good knowledgeble team. Sometimes you get lost in the matrix, but depending on the department and project you will have high visibility."
bad,"Business is pretty steady and the job duties is relative easy to perform, and the benefit's are pretty basic. Very little room for advancement, not a career job if you are a single parent as I am."
bad,"Management totalement a cote de la plaque."
bad,"Management could be improved by taking a 100 level management class. Had no idea how to motivate, lead, or be an advocate for their employees."
bad,"Ended up doing a much lower function job than the one I originally interviewed for. New SAP implementation suddenly changed my status to ""unsatisfactory"". Managment has people skills and anger management issues that go unaddressed."
bad,"My review is specific to GE Power & Water.  The business segment I worked in was in Ultrafiltration (UF) technology for water and wastewater treatment, the company was originally Zenon Environmental and acquired by GE Water division in 2006.  The facility is great, and I had the opportunity to make good friends.  I was promoted one time over the 8 years I worked there.  "
bad,I do not feel GE as a whole is structured as this office was devised. The mindset of immediate management was one that stifled growth and development.
bad,GE is teeming with eager young facilitators yet they do not last long. Unfortunately fine young men and women quit the company on a regular basis. The culture fostered by CEO Immelt apparently is to underpay and overwork his junior management team.
bad,Medium size fleet management company in EMEA. Present in 12 European countries with strong alliance to the USA and APAC.
bad,"I like painting , glass paint , fabric painting interior designing "
bad,"There are constant bumps on jobs to where you would lose your job and get bumped to another building or shift, and even lose pay. The management there is horrible, far too many engineers getting in the way of letting you do your work. Lines are becoming swing lines to where employees are bumped and lines will not even be running. I had a supervisor I never saw nor did his job, to let me know what I would be doing that day. There were also a lot of LOW (lack of work) weeks to where the line or building would be shut down for a week or more."
bad,"A typical day at GE starts with work to meet project goals, and ends with meetings with global stakeholders from engineering and drafting teams. Work pressure is on the HIGH END of band and salary - benefits are towards the MID of the band ..."
bad,"A typical day at the call center of GE Money/HBC was sometimes hectic but more often than not, had a balanced workload with clear objectives, proper management and knowledgeable co-workers."
bad,very demanding
bad,Management at it's worst for production employees. Employees afraid to speak up due to harassment of all sorts and retaliation. Dishonest and always looking to point fingers than take responsibilty for their own actions. The Skaneateles Management is still learning what TEAM WORK and PROFESSIONALIZING is. No vacation time allowed for production employees during month of December. Can't wait to retire!
bad,"Good pay, but they will grind you into the ground. They do not value family life."
bad,As the product I was working with was very old and very big I did not have much fun over there as it used to take multiple iterations to finish a project
bad,Une journée typique varie selon la phase du projet.
bad,"My time as a contractor was rather disappointing.  I was generally left alone with minimal help and assistance, and did not feel like I was part of any team.  The work was unreasonable with the lack of resources given."
bad,If you are entitled person who loves hard work and enjoys what he or she does then you definitely should consider to work for General Electric. This place definitely offers a lot of experience working in different places meeting different people and getting to know the industry.
bad,"Poor management, and difficult to move up in. Based off of time and not work ethics. Union is also a joke, wouldn’t recommend if you are looking for a career"
bad,"La culture GE n'est pas ""en phase"" avec une bonne pratique de la R&D dans un groupe où la différentiation technologique devrait être primordiale."
bad,Leadership is out of touch with teams doing the work. Aggressive targets with little support and no investment in tools to be able to do the job. Lots of administrative overhead preventing strategic work. Very little investment in people development and low employee morale. No upward movement; higher band roles are being replaced with roles 1-2 bands lower.
bad,Was a temporary job and moved. Over 2000 people displaced as a result of moved work to Texas. As a result the employment rate has fallen and many have moved as a result.
bad,"If you are looking for a structured and competitive environment that is incorrectly managed, then apply.  If you are looking for a more progressive company with agility and flexibility, I recommend another company all together."
bad,"The company had a high turnover rate, lack of communication among the various departments. People were on edge due to downsizing, Lots of frustrations with HR and training among the staff."
bad,"My time was a little unorthodox. Technologies are interesting and the people seem generally nice to work with. There are some to take their job a little too seriously, and management does not seem to have a good way of planning what needs to get done first"
bad,intended to remain working for years..laid off permanently with thousands of others.  enjoyed working at g.e. while I could.  excellent wage and benefits.
bad,Kaleaero produce parts from aviation. You can be self motivated any time because you know that you are a part of aviation industry.
bad,"Right now is just a horrible time to work for GE. I am being laid off twice in the same year due to my position being eliminated. There is no job security, everyone is worried who will be next. Definitely ""good old boys"" network still occurring in some departments."
bad,"Work is very slow-  Lay Offs are coming in Power.  Job Search is in advance of GE Business Changes to reduce their operating expenses.   GE demands a lot, and offers limited opportunity for professional development. Immediate managers make unrealistic demands, and senior management are not accountable for their poor decisions.  That's why the business is upside down with limited accurate forecasting, few orders,  and a significant cash flow problem."
bad,"Very confused, everyone was an island, left hand had no clue what the right hand was doing.. ever!!! Sorry to see new hires so upset and wondering where to get help?"
bad,"management was not the best, they treat the employees bad. they closed the shop with out notice to all.the people i work with was the best group any one would love to work with."
bad,"From the day GE took over from Converteam i was always concerned, I've never been a fan of large corporations and GE are one of the biggest."
bad,"Just give and give and give until your sick and then out the door."
bad,fun and great place to work overall. Was not a hard job at all. if you needed any equipment or PPE the managment got it for you right away. Work was not hard and very laid back. great company overal
bad,"The atmosphere allows you to challenge yourself to be the best, but minimal rewards for trying.  big company good benefits, but no security."
bad,i have done Sound masking system in GE this is our client place
bad,"I learned my overall skills pretty well with self teaching, also through the senior workers there lending a helping hand when ever i was confused or stuck on a problem related to the work field."
bad,Nothing to say the company closed it doors for cheaper labor in Hungary and China. GE paid and had people from China and Hungary come learn from us on how to build the units we were making just to shut us down so they can build them there
bad,"This company has a history of buying out other companies and then shutting them down causing a large job lost. They will however, give a decent severance package. They are very anti union and do not offer a transfer within the company deal."
bad,"typically not great communication between departments,few hard workers who are enjoyable to work with,hardest part of this job is absolute disregard for safety,best part of job is great pay"
bad,At GE you have a steady work pace. Your paid a low amount for a lot of hard work. Most minority’s dont advance as quickly as others but they’re always selected to train and help those that are promoted above them.
bad,"I loved my job at GE, I just disagreed with a lot of the ways that a temporal employee was treated verses a permanent employee. I enjoyed the fun my co-workers and I had on the job."
bad,"GE is a job. It is no longer a career like it once was. You will never make the money that some people have once made. You will not see $22 or 23 or more dollars an hour. We have not got a raise in  5 years. We finally get a 60 cent raise and they raise our insurance up to 77 dollars a week or more maybe a little less. If you need a job and your not making much then coming to Be at 14 or 15 dollars an hour is good. Take the job. If you can go to school and do better, do it. The sky is the limit. At Ge, the limit is the ceiling."
bad,I worked for a good supervisor he was fair to all. And for me that's all I ask for. But the production manager and quality manager ran him off. He had a ton of skill and I feel that they were intimidated by that. We go through 3 or more Supervisor every couple of years. But the people I work on the line with are great and fun.
bad,">its very good and. "
bad,"I went to work here thinking of retiring from this place. as quick as general electric bought it, they started importing most of the parts and laid off most of the workforce here."
bad,"working in a matrix company doesn't fulfill my goals, with my manger is in some other country and team members in some other cities , it's hard to be recognized and improve in your job."
bad,people curse you out on the phone all the time for calling them about past due account. big cafeteria. some room for advancement. management fair
bad,"Overworked, understaffed, horrible management team, no leadership, lack of training, no days off period! you will work for nine months without days off."
bad,Was only with the company for a short period of time. The job description was not aligned with the work that they wanted done. They weren't willing to have a conversation about it. Left in short order
bad,"Terrible place to work and dirty and out dated, tough work, physically demanding"
bad,"El lugar ofrece retos inusuales, el trabajo no es rutinario!"
bad,professional team in very busy working environment - lots of opportunities for development.  Lots of opportunities to move roles within wider GE businesses.
bad,"Learned a fair amount at my time with GE, enjoyed the chance to develop my professional skill set while learning a different side of an industry which is so diverse and growing."
bad,Not the best working environment. My supervisor was difficult to work with and not helpful when asking for guidance on new systems. Many of the employees seemed unhappy with the work environment and benefits.
bad,"Managment has a blind eye to problems and concerns from their employees, even when problems apparent. Training and certifications come second to getting the job done. It's really sad what has happened to the place I worked at in the last 2 years."
bad,"Very stressful, must be at your desk at all times, unless you have someone release your calls. Also had to sell so many products and only had so long to discuss each persons needs."
bad,"They recruited me away from a good company and laid me (and 12,000 others) off in less than one year.  What does that tell you?  I enjoyed working from a home office but in the end it makes you nameless and faceless.  Not a very caring organization."
bad,"GE is a good place to work. One is treated well, and respected. A healthy work environment is also a positive. I would love to go back to GE if I ever get a chance."
bad,GE just lets people go and doesn't care about families out here struggling to live. The job that I did I enjoyed very much I dedicated a lot of my time to a company that could care less they are making billions of dollars and they are greedy as all can be
bad,"The temp. position was not a good fit for me. I was actually under a contractor and placed at GE. The position could have been great if you had a computer at your start date, training on their systems and people that wanted to talk to you and explain what your responsibilities were. I felt very inadequate."
bad,"Good place to work. "
bad,"General Electric closed its doors Aug. 26 2016. Most of the employees will be able to retire, due to plant closing benefit.30years of service was required. Haier bought out General Electric this was the conclusion Haier came up with. The Bloomington IN plant was no longer making any profits. Due to lack of new product design and high scrap cost."
bad,Company hires you on the basis of team work but contradicts it in everyway. A lot of dishonesty from management and upper management. Told us in every quarter we were doing record sells yet we hadn't sold a locomotive in months. So we were laid off eventually.
bad,Warehouse was very not laid out properly to make the employee's successful.  No one from upper management would listen and turnover for managers was bad.
bad,General Electric is a broad company in both products and geographic locations. It offers challenging and rewarding assignments
bad,"this was a good company to work for, the econmy in 2008 went south and GE had to close all the TFS branches,  really would have liked to keep working for GE"
bad,"Paid very little, was sent to KY to train the employees that were to replace me, at $5/hr more than what I was making.  Was laid off as soon as the employees were trained."
bad,"Worked with leasing, property management and vendors on move-in's, tenant improvement and general Capital expenditures around the property. Lead numerous projects through phases and in many cases coming at or below budget. The hardest part of my job was not being as utilized as I could have been due to my title and tenure with the team."
bad,"Everything takes a long time, very bureaucratic, I won't recommend people take offer from GE. There's layers of review before things come to the delivery stage, very political. There are people who does work all the time, people who seldom show up"
bad,"safety meeting everyday when you come in"
bad,"	Responsible for the accurate and timely review of executed  lease and  loan documents in preparation for booking & funding"
bad,"to much beaurocracy."
bad,hay mucha seguridad cuidan mucho al trabajador realizar actividades  de rutina y mantenimientos preventivos
bad,Worked in  the Recovenyence Department—Stamp States Processed payoff mortgage loans for five states.  Temp job.
bad,learned a lot here and will be willing to work again if get an opportunity to do so.
bad,"Not really what I was expecting, I expected a path from Contractor to full time employee, this does not exist at GE."
bad,dont know how to talk to people. very mean and uncomfortable working conditions
bad,Basically the review above sums up my perception of the company.
bad,The management is great the benifits are awsome.Ive learned alot about the equipment and the training is great
bad,"The people I work with are amazing and I am still there to this day, the company as a whole however has too many changes at once and are unorganized. The clientele can be a bit cumbersome and draining."
bad,"No geral dou nota 5, a empresa em si é boa, salário bom, mas gerencia é muito ruim."
bad,"GE is a machine, and we are all just moving parts to this huge machine. Nothing personal, but, we all just a number at GE. We are look at to produce and all cost/"
bad,"The company culture is dated, and very difficult to merge the generational gab between the millennial and those who have been at the company for decades."
bad,"Despite all the praise that has been written in Harvard Business Journal, Fortune Magazine, etc., I have found that GE is ultimately a bunch of disjointed business units with inconsistent strategy and fragmented leadership."
bad,"great pay, poor upper management.  job security is excellent, would strongly recommend changing out uppermanagment. all in all a good place to work for"
bad,"Managers only push for results and provide intelligent feedback in the final months of a quarter. All other months, you are self-employed. Training was subpar and you are expected to perform with less than the tools that were provided to you."
bad,"This job wasn't for me, that's all. I don't have anything bad to say about them"
bad,"I really didn't like that it was really commission based. We had to meet a certain % in order for our paychecks to look good. In order to get paid , your install will have to go through."
bad,"GE Capital is a very good company but it's joint venture with SBI i.e. SBI Cards is not a good place to work especially if you want growth, security, work/life balance and mental peace."
bad,Working at GE Capital Retail Bank seemed like a great job at first but after one week on the phones it became clear that the specific retail card I was working with was very hard to understand to most of the customers and there were so many things that were never communicated properly which left the majority of the customer very very angry! All of this anger was taken out on the customer service reps. A very hard thing to deal with every 5 mins for 8 hours.
bad,this job is rought because they lay you off a lot. the job security is almost non exsistent.
bad,"the corp benefits are there, flextime etc but management (indeed my line manager) don't care one bit about staff. As a new employee taken on to learn the job I was given no support at all and was told I was not interacting with other depts. (which I was never even introduced too) and they were not exactly approachable people - that was at 3 months review! I wasn't given a laptop for 4 weeks! shocking"
bad,I never once felt like I fit in at GE. The culture seems to be against learning and only can see the world through GE colored glasses. Sometimes the GE way isn't the best solution to a problem.
bad,"A typical work day was making sure everything on the plant floor was working well. I learned a lot about the manufacturing environment. Hardest part f the job was learning how to work with the operators but once you get the hang of it, they are really helpful."
bad,"As an intern I was not directly involved with the operators but from what I saw if you don't want to work real hard this is the place to be. Last I knew the plant was going to be closing at the end of the year, I'm not surprised."
bad,"I didn't care for bill collections, but the people I worked with there were nice and understanding that I had higher ambitions. GE is very good with team building exercises both small and for the building as a whole."
bad,"Dealt with many customers and managed their issues,I have learnt hospitality and keeping patience and satisfying customers around us and their is nothing hard in the job everything is manageable and the most enjoyable part of the job is facing new complexities and challenges everyday and solving it with great anxiety to satisfy customer."
good,"Sometimes you work for a company that looks so good on paper you can not fathom any problems working there. GE is one of these places. Mismanagement, better treatment of certain employees, lack of leadership are the backbone behind GE."
good,"Salary is high, quality of life is low."
good,"Une journée typique de travail est de 8 heures au même poste à faire les même gestes. Je ne suis pas restée assez longtemps pour voir qu'elles étaient les opportunités mais des collaborateurs très agréables, le plus difficile est faire les cotas de la journée et les plus agréable est que certains jours on change de poste."
good,Hard to get a raise u have to bid up on jobs. A lot of people standing around doing nothing while ur busy doing ur job . Pay is awful for the repetitive job functions and management could care less about you. Never felt like a positive environment.
good,"Learning new methods"
good,okay place just hard to balance work and family life. Working 50 plus hours a week can be tough. Senior management put's all the work on middle management.
good,"Low pay long hours no job security. No benefits, best part was that when forced to work weekends they buy breakfast or when forced to work past 7 pm they buy dinner"
good,"The news posts are accurate. Constant restructuring, unknown direction or goals. dynamic work environment........................................................."
good,Worked 7 days a week alot of responsibility and challenges.  GE runs very lean and you often are doing a job that 2-3 people would normally do for any other company outside GE.
good,After many years to work there and give good results you can loss your job. The culture is changing and you are de-motivated because do not mater how good is your job
good,"A cultura é bastante profissional e com foco em inovação. Porém a falta de planejamento mínimo e urgência de mudança constante muitas vezes faz com que os esforços sejam em vão e o impacto em pessoas seja negativo, seja na relação trabalho e qualidade de vida, seja na pressão por resultados independente dos recursos disponíveis e metas possíveis, seja na constante demissão de empregados que refletem a falta do planejamento estratégico mínimo dos projetos."
good,"High collecting standards, great benefits. Only GE for a few months, most of my time was when JCPenney owned their own credit cards."
good,Decent work environment but little management direction for contract employees. Expected long hours with all employees given laptops to work evenings and weekends.
good,"I worked for GE but at Nemours Childerns hospital."
good,"Assignments were challenging as technology changed for each project, such as projects installed in Seattle, LA, Phoenix, Dallas, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Boston, and Australia."
good,very bad managers run the company into the ground. The policies were different from what was going on. Lots of cliques and political issues that complicated tasks and completion.
good,company going thru shutdown changes; not being transparent in my dept. concerns addressed privately with management are taken directly back to the accused. work life balance preached but not practiced; hostile work environment
good,the job I was working was in a competitive position with 4 other people. at the 6 month mark I was let go 1 day before I was protected by law  if you spoke Spanish at this location it was a HUGE plus and the vast majority of the management and employees are Hispanic because of the proximity to san Antonio which is the majority of the population in that area
good,"When I started in 2008 it was awesome, I traveled the world.as time went on the company started to deteriorate it went from upbeat busy busy with 35-45 people working the shop. now at any given time there may be 4-5 people in the shop. and there is an uncomfortable feeling of age discrimination. the lack of skilled labor is frightening. unqalified  people are fixing and sending dangerous equiptment  all over the world for our traveling machinist to work on steam,gas,coal. and nuclear turbines, putting them at risk."
good,"Learned a lot of politics and risk management from management."
good,"I temporarily worked at GECU until I finished my degree. I tolerated the managers micromanaging, short breaks, in office relationships between co-workers that effected the job at hand."
good,"Poor decision making process. There is no ""people factor"" in the company. every decision made  has no consideration for employees. Not sure if this will change when the company gets better management team"
good,"This was a project that kept firing PM's for being honest about the position and reality of meeting deadlines and budgets about the project.   Leadership was in Florida, team in Calgary and extremely disconnected from the actual challenges the development team was facing developing their software.  Cutting corners on ""expenses"" by hiring teams overseas also lead to severe inefficiencies.  Near the end of the project, works 7 days a week, over 11 hours a day with some 18-20 hour days on deliverables to their customers (pending litigation if not delivered) that had a deadline within a week but were in reality 8 weeks away from being DEVELOPED, not to mention tested and ready for launch.  Leadership seemed to thing that keeping staff almost 24/7 would suddenly improve the odds of delivering on time."
good,"Changing of Management almost Ever six months. Saw many unethical things take place at work, more like cut throat .People lining  on reports ,management liing about things being done ,when there not.Management tell people about if they dont like it the street runs North and South."
good,"not friendly, stressful work environment, no work life balance especially in FP&A and stress testing groups, management team is needed to be retrained,"
good,"No-one can make a decision for this company. This is supposed to be a ""startup"" for GE. The old GE ways and Mentality are going to RUIN this great opportunity that this company is trying to create."
good,"This is an overall good company to work for. The only issue I experienced was with growing within the company, but they are very understanding with working with you to further your education."
good,No real mentors.  Everyone stays in a position for a couple of years then moves on.  You are just a number.  Impossible to do your job when you have to sub out work to foreign companies to save money for the investors.
good,"Un dia Laboral se pasa muy rapido ya que cuento con muchas tareas por hacer."
good,call center ditations of  a call center to of credit cards the company allowed to work over time and promote manager bpostion time after time
good,Good company to work for the management team is very supportive and have your back. GE is definitely a good company with a good 401k program
good,"There were lots of fun things about the call center.  The management did their best to make the day fun.  Unfortunately we were chained to the clock and phone.  If you wanted to participate in any of the fun activities, you had to make up the hours on the phones.  It made me less likely to participate in anything with the company.  The salaries were low compared to other lending institutions in the area.  It didn't matter when the benefits were good, but once the health insurance changed it did.  The Charlotte office tried hard to be a friendly warm environment, but it fell short on many occasions."
good,Was too family and click oriented.  Promotion eventually became about who you knew than the job that you performed on a day to day basis.  Management constantly lied and used others to get ahead.
good,"I got to select random units from assembly and run both stress and performance test. I also tested materials before use in production. Problem solving is a big part of this job.  Some of the hardest requirement for this job were the most enjoyable. I got to do something different everyday along side of a routine. My direct supervisor was a great teacher and always challenged me. The majority of the people I worked with were friendly and humble people, and it made the job atmosphere a pleasant one."
good,The company has great incentives. I take incoming calls from customers about their credit card bill.  The hardest part about the job is working every Saturday since I'm a single parent.
good,got a great check but never got time to spend my money two hours of sleep a night and 18+ hours a day. management saw you as very expendable and let you know it.
good,I fear that the production will be moved abroad. The quality of the product is much lower than the standard of work I am use too. The Management are probably the worst I have ever worked for.
good,"Outside all day in the elements in only GE approved or provided cheap clothing, freeze in the winter and swelter in the summer, soaked during fall and spring. Management on upper levels was great, it was the immediate supervisor who lacked experience and hindered the team. Co-workers were ok, some great others out to get you. The hardest part of the job is hours on the road andbeing away from home so much, and keeping up with constant policy changes. The nicest part of the job was some incedible scenery while driving around the country."
good,"Company is not what it seems. You give a company years of your life and they do not care. GE stands for nothing in the end. They have failed miserably in management selections. They have pushed out all the older workers only to keep the new 30-somethings.The GE management team applies unfair practices, discriminates and is known for is wrongful terminations of staff. GE has spent millions to revamp their products which are failing at an alarming rate."
good,"Learned:  To adapt to constant change"
good,"Constant friction between management and employees. It’s a union shop and the union has they’re own agenda. Advancement is extremely slow and it doesn’t matter how hard you work or how much you learn, you gotta wait for someone to either retire or die before you move up."
good,Home based office allowed for a lot of autonomy and seting of work schedule. Although I applied for several relocations to head office felt that I did get a fair evaluation. Out of sight therefore out of mind. Company i worked for was acquired by Wells Fargo and therefore things have changed
good,Very hostile work environment. It’s getting harder to advance at this company. Seniority doesn’t mean anything anymore. You must now take a test and interview for higher level jobs.
good,Spent almost 11 Years there before they closed the doors. Would have had 27 years in by now. First job out of College. Good hard working people. Wish it was still there had good benefits an pay.
good,"It was a great company, but poor leadership added to professional hubris destroyed their position. It was a nice place to work. Coworkers were awesome. Leaders were cut-throat."
good,Management did not help with the collections process. Was given one of the hardest accounts to collect on and no help from GE Healthcare or upper management at GE Capital to help when I got stuck.
good,My position was collections representative.  It required heavy phone contact with delinquent auto lessees.  I was required to maintain high call volume and commitments from the lessees to bring their accounts current within 60 days.
good,"Challenging work environment with minimal opportunities to promote.  Incompetent management team.  There is an expectation that you respond to emails and be available for calls outside of work.  If you are not, your job is in jeopardy."
good,GE is going through difficult time. Thousands of people lost their jobs. The ones who kept their jobs have to keep looking for new position every year.
good,i did my apprenticeship there i enjoyed the general program but sometimes felt like we were forgotten about on occasions and sometimes didn't feel like there was a structure
good,"its a job, it was t the worst or best. but paid the bills and had a devent ammount of PTO time witch was enjoyable. also had compant activitys ect that were good times"
good,It's not a bad company to work for if you can advance but it takes so long to do so that it was more beneficial for me to find another better-paying job.
good,No comment...I do not wish to comment about GE..the people that do the work know what to do and generally do it....the management is another story.......
good,management is poor after the new buyout from Haier  union isnt very strong or reliable although you pay union due from day one of employment. work environment is easy and lad back in  most areas and repetitive work on all lines in various buildings
good,I have never work for such a mismanaged company in my life. Im sure you've heard this saying before but GE will step over a dollar to pick up a dime. This company went from a thriving 1 Billion dollars a year business to barely scraping by. Management has no interest in working with its employees. I would not recommend working for GE.
good,"The last years the culture of GE has declined."
good,"People I worked with are why I stayed. . . collegiality A+++"
good,"There is very much to learn . Friendly work culture , supporting peoples . I learned how to treat people , speak with them , handling targets etc. GE is very strict about safety policy ."
good,An arrogant and dismissive attitude towards their employees and customers lead to their ultimate failure.  They decided to exit the financial services which was GOOD for society.  As this company was completely motivated by self-interests at the cost of its customers and employees.
good,"GE is very old and successful company. However, the company cares longevity and profit more than the employee itself. The company is well known for deep job cuts in difficult time."
good,during my work at the beginning I got some task to improve processes and supporting R&D activities. Unfortunately I didn't get any design support so I decided to learn the usage of 3D program which helps in my task. After few months later I got bigger and bigger design tasks finally I was responsible to construct and design enermous equipments. Those equipments followed the previous solutions reduces the cost increases the effectivity resulted high cost saving.
good,A huge company with lots of opportunities if you are are willing to relocate.  The location local to Iowa had limited growth opportunities and a management team that was stuck in the 70s.
good,"Allowed for volunteer opportunities. "
good,"If working 3rd shift, 12 hours shifts are for you, then this job is great for you. Only 16 dollars an hour on top of that. A lot of things need to be looked at before looking into this job"
good,At GE I was able to learn a lot of new skills and work with great people. However  Management need to improve their communication and give clear directions.
good,Office was poorly managed by upper management.There are a number of ongoing compliance issues that is very alarming. HR within the GE PII division is scarcely available and usually is in the office only once or twice weekly.
good,"I worked at GE for almost 5 years as a Manufacturing Supervisor, and learned a lot about Lean Manufacturing, Team Building and how to build a work culture around safety and quality.  I also had the advantage of working with a lot of very driven intelligent people who pushed me to be better."
good,"Assembly line atmosphere where you are on a line all day either 8,9, or 10 hours dependent upon mandated overtime. Winters are freezing they don't turn on furnaces and summers are hot with only 2-10 exhaust fans working. ceiling leaks and may end up in your work station. Everything that was told to the new hires from orientation that made GE sound like icing on the cake was all a big breathe of hot air. We were told line leads would go through the line and give everyone at least two ten min breaks throughout the day including the legal mandated breaks. this ended up being false. You were only giving a break if you were a friend of the line lead. and when you would ask to go to the bathroom saying you will be quick the line leads would either complain and act like cry babies because you cant hold it or they will tell you they cant do it and they got paper work to fill out and you wont end up seeing the line lead except ten min before break time would occur. you are giving three personal days to last a whole year and thats it until after five years you accumulate one week of paid vacation time. the raises were not official and the Union was roll overs for all the new hires but would stand up for their generation of hired in employees like the people that were hired in around the 90's."
good,"Many ups and downs within the various roles I heard at GE.  "
good,I'm happy with co work mate because has a team work of each and good behavioral attitude but the management system is very poor of processing papers and quality of customer service because of lack of equipment and tools. the most enjoyable of my job is about troubleshooting and reprocessing of mechanical system and also my every achievement  that I fix and function it again of our customer unit.
good,"This job required lots of typing, filing, data entry. Customer Service, answering telephone calls, coping machines."
good,"I have always enjoyed being in a position that kept me on my toes and this was one of those positions. I learned a lot about load centers! Got along with most of my co-workers. Sometimes I was looked down on because I was a temporary employee. The hardest part of this position was probably packing. I am rather small, but after I figured out how to do it, the job became a lot easier. I enjoyed being able to do all the positions on the line. Being able to switch positions every hour let me learn more."
good,A nice place to work.One can learn alot working at GE Capital.You meet and engage with a wide variety of people. The employees truly care about the GE brand.
good,"GE is large and it depends on your team and business unit.  It's not the most inspiring place to work, but it is not awful. If you want a steady job until you retire, if you're able to, go to GE."
good,GE is a company that provides opportunities for people interested in long term manufacturing positions. There are limited management opportunities.
good,"GE is a good place to work and learn new things but really isnt dependable on keeping their employes happy or even temps, its a revolving door."
good,"As a former employee of DPS. I can not really complain , but I wished that there was a mass room for growth within."
good,"Great place to start your career, a lot of leadership opportunities, lacks work life balance."
good,"•	Provide perimeter security around the facility."
good,"If it were managed and the follow through was appropriate, then it would be a fine place to work. All of the skilled tradesmen and women there were very nice to work with."
good,Good place to work in a global environment. Nice place to grow.
good,It is good company to start carrier. Good learning. Flat carrier growth.
good,"Good job to get into, good pay and benefits. The training was the only thing that made me walk away and look for a better trade with better training. Overall a good experience."
good,"Ambiance moyenne et chacun à sa place ."
good,"- Benefits not good compared to other companies which is surprising because this is a big company. "
good,"The segment of GE that was brought in from Alstom has a problem. What was once Combustion Engineering boilers, became AB&B, which became Alstom, which became GE Boilers. Getting help from Windsor, Conneticut, (home of Combustion Engineering) is like getting the broom from the wicked witch of the west... Older generation employees don't want to help, but younger and bubbly employees more than willing to help. Enthusiasm is appreciated, but I needed experienced help. I have average computer skills, and could not navigate for info needed. A can of alphabet soup can be used as a table of contents... I knew of two others that put their frustration of finding data into writing, so I feel vindicated. Especially since one person was less than 40 yr old with a mechanical degree."
good,"ge is a very good company to work  it has a very good working enviroment,and a very strong safety culture,the most enjoyble part of it ge is that the company trains everbody to be a leader"
good,"I think GE cannot handle the size it has. Therefore, everything is in chaos. Salaries are bit lower than what you could get at a similar workplace in the area"
good,The higher level you go the easier the work is. Management is a joke. Great for second shift if you like that kind of life. Drop in pay if you switch to first.
good,"If you think of work under GE Digital, very unsafe place to work especially if you tied on night shift basis (KL Sentral). I find out lacked in management cause pioneer resigned from work."
good,Inegalite paiment mem poste statutaire - interimaire.
good,"There is no good work life balance, people end up working more than 9 hours almost every day and many times also on the weekends. Otherwise amenities and learning wise good company."
good,"The people at GE are great. Very smart and very hard working. Unfortunately the company is going through some tough times right now, meaning more work is being spread amoung less people. Wish all the best for GE!"
good,"Worked in the Lighting division."
good,"Not a bad place at first when I got there in 2012,got raises pretty rapidly, then we hit a wall,union and company always bleeding, that's the main reason I left after 6 years."
good,It'll work for you if you work it the way it works you. My experience was a bit balanced as far as it goes. I had good experiences as far as co-workers and job experience. I have also dealt with situations that could of been avoided if management had done thier job.
good,It has really downsized it’s benefits & pay!!!   Which is why I am looking elsewhere I was told there would be career advancement and there is none it’s about who you know and not what you know that gets you ahead at the GE.  I started with a decent wage and then after a few months my rate of pay was lower for no reason so my pay is a big factor
good,"Great place to work and learn, a person can see the world. It fast paced working environment. I started working in Anaheim CA, shop with some great teacher on the floor and in management. Thank you for my experience GE."
good,"Although GE has tried hard to stay a leader in the many different industrial verticals it sells to  (which seems to be all of them), a streak of bad management has put the company in a very bad position. At this point in time, 2019, the company is divesting as much as it can, so it is shedding jobs left and right. That is unfortunate as many skillful, industrious people are being shown the door after many years of service. This may, mainly, reflect poorly towards the future of the company, as lots of know-how is moving elsewhere, and the people who stay are finding themselves overwhelmed and understaffed, leading them to focus on the now instead of the next big idea. I wouldn't recommend joining GE at this point in time, but I would not discard this industrial icon to come back and thrive again, making it a good work option in the future."
good,Extremely difficult to change the culture of the established management structure. Very set I their way and resistant to change. Great people to work with
good,"Once I joined, I learned a lot... how to use pneumatic tools. The training was excellent. Very clean place to work. Over time was an advantage, No pushing while working"
good,"For such a large diverse corporation I found advancement dictated by network, not competence.  Management is close-minded overall.  This is a review of GE Aviation and does not, cannot represent all of GE."
good,"Some people seem to have better prospects than others.People from EU were highly prized."
good,This business unit was dissolved in 2012. The business spent a lot of time and money on too many things to be successful. Environment was not open to world class IP management strategies.
good,"A typical day at work is working outside with contractors to build wind turbines. From the ground up 300ft in the air. I learned about (EHS) safety, electrical components, bolt troque specifications and all the ins and outs of the wind trubine. Management at times tries to put to much on you. The culture is very fun and I really enjoy the work. The hardest part is being away from my family months at a time. Meeting new people and enjoying the work."
good,Nothing to review union shop was time to move on with my career left for Aerothrust in 2007. Learned a lot about GE Aircraft Engines CFM as well as Marine Industrial.
good,"Eu em particular aprendi muito nesses anos com GE atuando diretamente como coordenador, os dias eram intensos com muitos desafios que realmente precisavam ser encarados com uma visão diferenciada, aprendi muito com meus superiores e ainda mais com meus subordinados, pois desenvolver pessoas realmente é pisar em um mundo diferente, a parte mais difícil foi lidar com mudanças de gerências constantes pois toda empresa estava sendo readequada tornando difícil estabelecer um acesso seguro aos superiores que trouxesse uma ajuda relevante para o dia a dia, o mais agradável foi poder adquirir experiências com pessoas que passaram pela minha vida e que acrescentaram de uma forma fenomenal."
good,Highly competitive work environment with enough room to learn and grow. Job security is not that much but if you perform well you will be awarded well.
good,"Can't say a whole lot here.... the company is going through some tough times and therefore, things are generally quite gloomy over there. IT'll be tough sailing for a few quarters until things get better again - hang on tight!"
good,Great place to work for extra funds for the holidays. Faced paced and Good amount of overtime. Advancement was possible. Nice cafeteria. Management needs more contact with employees
good,"Work place culture is to throw you to the sharks and see who survives, training is provided to a select few that management wants to survive. Horrible culture, teamwork is compromised and financial performance suffers as a result."
good,"I loved working for GE, at one time. It was bright and shining, but he past CEO drove the company into the ground. Lack of employee support, lack of raises, growth for employees, no training, PIPS that last more than 6 months, deplorable HR staff, long, long hours, no fun at all and other issues prevail there. It's too bad, it was once a great, great company."
good,Leider gibt es keine klare Anweisungen. Niemand fühlt sich Verantwortlich
good,"Salem, VA was not a good working environment for a motivated engineer. This GE facility was mainly staffed by engineers near the end of their careers and there wasn't much innovation or progress here."
good,"I really enjoy working on aircraft engines. I've learned to really grow as an engineer at GE especially beyond my degrees. "
good,"Had 4 managers in one year.  N+2 took things personally."
good,Culture was laid back but non-productive. For those coming in to make change happen... good luck. Structure is horrible with little accountability. Alot of room for improvement but if your not part of the good ol boys crew.. you get pushed aside with ideas and they are stolen for credit to others.
good,Oil and Gas has been under scrutiny and cost pressure and reflective on the culture of the company resulting in constant layoff worries and employee low morale.
good,"I don't recommend anyone to join GE as they are very much professional in their business strategy and they adopt hire & fire policy. "
good,"As stated in the title, it is good for your first job, as you are exposed to a variety of projects from different business (Aviation, Power, Renewable, oil and gas etc).  You collaborated with an international team that are experts in the areas."
good,"For the most part they are productive , just don't enforce policy and have very poor management skills"
good,"General Electric is a great company and have a very strong, good well appreciated culture based on Integrity, diversity, customers and meritocracy. However General Electric Switzerland is the result of ALSTOM Switzerland acquisition and the culture is a blend of the two. The cultural transformation is still on going with pockets of hierarchy, power and politics. "
good,"When I joined GE 5 years back from today, GE work culture and management changed significantly. But one thing remain same that GE does not value the employees. Employee get moved to different project without even asking. Lots of bureaucracy in organization and management."
good,"Company has great benefits, they are excellent. Unfortunately GE Aviation is very confused they don't know what they're doing most of the time on a daily basis they're changing something it's like management doesn't communicate with each other the right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing. Don't get me wrong I don't mind being flexible it's fun to learn new things but management expects you to know it without training and unfortunately that can be dangerous. I honestly don't think I'll ever fly again knowing they're making parts for airplanes after what I've seen"
good,This Job is not hard!!!  You have to be in the BUDDY SYSTEM in order to advance........  The advancements are not on productivity.  Job is not hard!!!
good,"it was ok but when I became ill they let me go..i was there for 7 years."
good,"wired place to work, no trustworthy leaders in my team, the bosses always force you to work work and work, but they wont be happy if you ask for benefits you should have. in my team leaders never talk with you about the topics like career path, business skills, personal development or goal and objectives. very strange place. May be because it's the service team, I dont think they are all well educated and with enough leadership experience or trainings, it's not like the GE company I ever worked for in another country, the leaders are trustfull and you can deliver your thoughts and voices, in stockholm it's totally different. i will say here in danderyd Sweden, the team is not good at all...passive but it's true. messy planning and management."
good,GE corporate policies do not insure a significant degree of uniformity in the GE work experience.  Your immediate supervisor will determine if you have a positive or negative work experience.
good,Nice place to work and gather good knowledge.. Healthy foods and gather daily tips for living healthy.. More new things to learn and the management is good.
good,"typical large corporation with its name recognition, however, different divisions within the company can be quite different, overall the company is big enough to run with/without anyone and to buy any one if desired."
good,"In a review delivered to the leadership group by an independent third party analyst, it was deemed that GE Money was a sleeping giant that never realised it's potential."
good,They  would  work you  long hours  6  and 7  days a week sometimes...and   a  loyalty  doesn't matter  to them...there were some  who were let go after 40 and 50 years  of faithful  service before their pension was due.   I  wouldn't recommend this company.
good,"Typical day is very faced paced which normally starts at 5 a.m. and ends at 4:30 p.m. for myself.  The job culture is to do more with less (employees, equipment, etc.). Difficult to get ahead if you are not a part of the clique. Hardest part of the job is trying to meet weekly goals when other members of the support staff is constantly pulling team members from the floor to attend their meetings. Support Staff  members delegate tasks that they do not want to perform to the Supervisor.  Most enjoyable part of the job is working with some very talented team members and support staff members."
good,"You're just a number there. You're a warm body to possibly help keep their assembly lines running, nothing more. Most enjoyable part of the job is definitely your coworkers. Management likely won't know your name much less anything about your personal life."
good,GE has very good short term and long term planning and strategy. The company cares a lot about its market share and profit and less about its employee and and employee benefit.
good,Great compensation but a disfunctional culture. Company grew too fast and didn't anticipate their infrastructural needs and fell behind the times. Gap between senior management and their employees is quite wide.
good,"GE is going through major changes for the better. Lots of new people and leadership joining the team. Some good, but some in key senior roles are truly disgusting and destroying morale. I'm leaving the people, not the business."
good,This company is very disorganized. Not a proactive environment just react to problems. The company is currently working mandatory ot and planning to layoff 3/4 of facility next month
good,"This company is not too bad to work for, but the work remains the same. Each workday is the same task and there is no room for change unless needed."
good,Cant really say much about this co. did not really learn much plus the co workers was hard to work with. Manager was not a good person  to work with.
good,I would work in such a place where job security and work life balance is there. I would like to work with organization where employee gets value for their work.
good,"Hard place to work, don't know if you will have a job one week to the next. Other than that very interesting to see all the components come together to make a locomotive."
good,"As a whole its not a bad place to work ,but it has your usual pitfalls associated with any factory these days, fear of lay-offs and downsizing ."
good,"A typical work day consists of multiple faceless meetings all through out the morning. During that time you try to multi task reading e-mails, web chatting with different groups such as product configuration & drafting that are spread out all over the world. The day can offer a various array of things to do, such as answer field cases, supplier deviation requests or vendor reviews. You may also get some time in to work on designs or BOM structures for current projects. Normally we will have 4-6 different projects going at one time. Time management is stretched to it's highest form."
good,"A typical day at work would be to come in and say good morning to everybody, sign into my system and get prepared for calls. I would see my manager walking around and i would laugh with my co workers on break. The mos enjoyable part of my job is meeting new and interesting people."
good,"Communication was always an issue but when it was running, it was an enjoyable place to work."
good,"Great people and atmosphere, BUT huge corporate bureaucracy and micromanagement. Not worth exceeding goals, producers and non-productive employees are all compensated the same as are the promotions. Benefits are very good but compensation is low for a fortune 5 corporation. Job security is non existent. All a numbers game. By the time you make it to upper management level, you now have become part of the regime and you are required to separate from the non-management employee"
good,"A typical day at work was driving across country. "
good,"Uma empresa muito dinâmica, onde podia aprender muito sobre o sistema de gestão de EHS"
good,"I have been working here for almost 2 years and can honestly say that if your looking for JUST a pay check every week this is the perfect place to work, a lot of the buildings offer great over time, and there are even a few good managers...but if your looking for a career, a job that wont discriminate against those who don't have a college degree, a company where the employee comes first, and career advancement then keep looking and run far away from this company!!! a typical day at work for me was taking cases weighing 40 to 50 pounds on and off the assembly line, doing repairs, and matching cases to other parts. The hardest part is that its hard on my back, ive been hurt on this job multiple times and have been told to basically deal with it, I can honestly say that I hate working for them and cant wait to find an employer that wont treat me like a nobody"
good,"this company is ok, but it not a place i would recomand people to start a career"
good,"buena paga, buen ambiente, buenos compañeros de trabajo, un trabajo que me dejo mucha experiencia en la cobranza y atención  a clientes, unas personas responsables, que me enseñaron a trabajar en equipo para lograr las metas realizadas o asignadas por la empresa, lo mas difícil que se me hizo es que no te daban descanso en ocasiones, lo que mas me gusto fue que aprendí a desarrollarme como persona en todos los sentidos posibles. A tener confianza en si misma, a sentirme mas capas, a lograr las metas que me he propuesto, y Gusto por atender a la Gente, ayudarla, animarla, Gusto por la Cobranza, por las Ventas, y por Atención a clientes etc."
good,"I really liked being a part of GE.  The company offered a great deal of additional learning through its GE University program.  In my situation, I saw how wonderful GE was in the good times.  However, when the Industrial market was hurting, the company showed me I was simply an asset and not really a person.  The responsibility made me a better businessman and I enjoyed working with my client base and growing my numbers."
good,"no review is possible at this time. Online courses are great, informative, interesting, challenging and very fun."
good,"GE Lighting tenia una presencia limitada en el mercado español, y en 1 año conseguí introducir la marca en los distribuidores objetivo marcados."
good,Unique environment and very unique in the management style .
good,"learned great value through working with engineers to develop ""quick fixes"" to rewrite maintenance manual references to incorporate quick ""return to service"" techniques."
good,"GE as a company is okay, however even the full time employees are not very happy with the way the plant is ran. I worked there as a temp and was treated as if I had no value and was replaceable at a moments notice, however was praised by the lines I worked on."
good,This was a very productive workplace. Employees are very well to work with.
good,My co-workers were great to work with and had good communication.
good,"Management had their favorites that they would give projects to and would help advance. Quality team do not want to review deals with you to help you improve. Worked every holiday. Stuck with late night schedule and working weekends. Very hard to get out of that department. If management do not want you to move on, they will find ways to keep you in that department. They would recognize employees who do not deserve it. Tied to the phones and if you're away from your desk too long (for example - going to the restroom when it wasn't your scheduled break time), the managers will come looking for you and question what you were doing. They hold you responsible to track 100% of your time. If you forget, they want to write you up. They made me feel like I couldn't make an innocent human error. Senior leadership isn't even aware of our processes."
good,"Thought this job would be a great way to get my foot into the door at a corp. company. Found out really quick that it's not all it's cracked up to be. You have to bid for your shift every 6 months, based on your performance compared to over 200 other employees. They grade ""random"" calls which was fine for some time before they shipped it all over to india and suddenly half the team is not meeting. They also require you to attempt to sell a debt insurance product, which includes 5 paragraphs you have to read word for word at the end of every call. (which makes up 25% of your overall score.) they provide you a certain amount of PI time, but if you use it you will be put on corrective action. Also if you do get the job, save EVERY single email for schedules, managers etc..for proof, Sometimes they go MIA and suddenly you find yourself on corrective action because they lost the email. So to sum it up, they give good benefits, but really you get screamed at by the customers for 8 hours straight because they charge 29.99% apr and really don't do anything good for customers, and you will be constantly in fear of your job because they change everything from month to month. I am currently trying to get out. I would not reccommend this job to anyone."
good,good company. sort of......
good,Drove a truck 5 days a week dropping off supplies to peoples home they had ordered from the company. The management was fair with us to get the job done and the customers happy. Couldnt make plans much because you didnt know what time you was getting off do to the stops we had that day.
good,"6-2;30 inpsection of turbine parts,driving forklift to deliver or pickup parts to be inspected.The managment needs better people skills and more knowledgw of the work being done!!!!Very good co workers fun easy going.Hardest part dealing with a boss that doesn't know whats happening and tech plannners signing off on rejected parts!!!!"
good,"Work was interesting, team was good to work with.  With the sale of the company and the uncertainty that followed, I learned many new ways to deal with adversiiy in the workplace, which strengthened my leadership capabilities."
good,Travail en autonomie avec beaucoup d'interlocuteurs.
good,"GE was a great place to learn about the oil & gas business, but it is the typical all boys club.  Not very women managers on operational side of business."
good,Management is not good and friendly...They don't value their employees. In top management people are completely waste and they don't even bother if a employee is in problem.
good,"Very easy work, yet busy. Love the environment. Great benefits. Regular pay raises every 6 months. Not much room for advancement. Management is ok. Overall it’s a good company."
good,I've worked there for a little bit more than two years but it is still working to make the market just like it used to 50 years ago. it needs update and acceleration for business.
good,The team was great and supported safety. The Training could of been a little more organized. The hardest part of the job was to worry about job security and opportunity advancements within the last year.
good,"Not a place to work. Accrued vacations eliminated, Pension eliminated, Health Plan has a large deductible. Must fly coach even on flights over 8 hours."
good,Very hot in this company. It is a very physical job you have to be mentally and physically able to do this job. If you have any health problems this is not a good fit for you. You can meet lots of nice people
good,"they hire contract employee which is a great humiliation to me having an equal amount of effort with GE employee but yet the compensation is quite imbalance which lead me to think life is always unfair lol, the tip of management pyramid who ever they are need to change the way they manage(HR, employee work culture, core values ,etc)  if not it will decay fast."
good,"Good workplace"
good,"In the ultrasound refurbishment business; you will find a fast paced and evolving environment. The ability to multitask/manage priorities is a strong plus in getting results and achieving success. You will find a steady stream of challenges that, with the right approach, could leave you with a sense of accomplishment on a daily basis."
good,"Ingresé como Analista/Programador al departamento de Electronic Data Proccesing EDP. Encargado del sistema de nomina, Payroll, programado en Cobol, sistema operativo OS/VS1, Roscoe era nuestro editor para hacer los programas y los cambios en los mismos. A pesar de que las oficinas no eran agradables, teníamos un buen ambiente de trabajo entre todos los Analistas y el grupo de soporte técnico de la empresa. El trabajo era rutinario. En el caso de Nomina siempre había que hacer cambios en los programas, modificar tablas, cambiar formulas de cálculo, etc. Desde que llegué hasta que salí de la empresa siempre me tocó hacer lo mismo.... parchar programas, remerdar programas, resolver problemas cuando reventaba un JCL, ó un programa tronaba con algún data Exception, etc etc etc..... No hay mucho que decir...!!!"
good,I won't say names but i know for a fact how shady 1 manger is in particular they doesn't care about employees  the manager doesn't know anything about the fixing of what this manager expects you to work on while they come in when they want hours after everyone else gets to work ... No advancement once you get hired on knew someone there that gave his all for 3 years and still in the same position as people coming into the company great people on the production floor but gosh that manager walks aound with a chip on their shoulder
good,"If you need a job, and don't mind a LOT of physical work for low pay, this is for you. Anyone can do this job. You can not be a lazy, stubborn, non compliant, abuser of policies type person if you want to work here. you will have to wear a uniform, you have to where steel toe boots and will have to wear ear plugs."
good,"The culture in the Melbourne office is odd.  There is a very distinct line between ""blue badges"", which are GE Employees and ""Green Badges"", which are Contractors.  Middle Management struggle so to work together"
good,"As a 5 year employee of GE; the management team continued to fail in all aspects of working in a team environment. 48 + Hour work weeks, high safety injury rate with a continued increase in production."
good,Long hours good workplace easy work for forklift driver training could use more on hands training. defiantly not climate controlled. 2.4 million square foot warehouse.
good,"Interesting work. Became quite familiar with rotating machines. Management was more concerned about micro managing people than building motors. Culture was de-humanizing"
good,"Die Arbeit bei GE in Birr AG, Schweiz in der Auswucht und Prüfanlage der Rotorenfabrik ist sehr abwechslungsreich und spannend."
good,Depois da compra da Alstom as coisas começaram a piorar...para cortar gastos demitiram sem avaliação da capacidade e conhecimento...e cortar benefícios..
good,"Come in on time, do your job to the best of your ability, and go home. Everybody has their good and bad days but all you need to focus on is the job you're supposed to do."
good,"Although I've not had any major issues with GE, I can tell the overall moral of the plant is way down. Even during the short time that I've been there I have seen management leave, stock prices drop, GE plants closing in different areas of the world."
good,"Working in the Transportation sector of GE used to be good, however recent management has decided to sell off the business, job promotions are at a pretty much at a stand still. My current work schedule is 4 on 3 off, not a bad schedule, however the work life balance and working with employees to put them on a rotating schedule every quarter, so everyone enjoys the weekend is not there, management elects to keep everyone on the current schedule which puts a strain on an individuals personal life."
good,Working at G.E was ok. The people out there are pretty helpful and wants people to get hired on. G.E always lays off so you never know how long you will be there. This includes G.E employees.
good,"Loved the company and the work culture... A bit low on the rewards and benefits part but makes it up with providing the right learning platform."
good,"Supported Sales team all over world, trained customers, sales team, and services about products and how to sell, reviewed customer inquiries and specifications, prepared sound proposals, attended customer meetings, made product presentation to customers, etc."
good,"Overall the co-workers were helpful and people helped each other when ever needed. Typical day started with review of e-mails and job schedule.  Have an informal review with the manager on the important tasks for the day.  While GE provided flexible work hours, it was not uniformly enforced. Most work/projects were short time frame, however, there seemed to be a lack of overall long term direction for the work."
good,"Lack of leadership and a disconnect between front line to middle management and middle management to leadership. Thus nothing changed/progressed until they were to late in the game. Safety was brushed aside until it hit the news, then they fired people with no coaching."
good,"Whenever someone says that they were just a number, they probably were talking about GE. You are definitely just a number with this company. They have their hands in everything. You know the old saying ""jack of all trades, master of none?"" well that's what it is at GE"
good,Depending on the department GE is a good place to work.  Most has a family work life balance.  Some areas have flexibility in schedule.  Pay is okay some areas you can earn bonuses quarterly
good,"Had a very little experience of working with GE (2 years). A good company with system of working."
good,Would of been better if the training was slowed down a bit. Make sure you take a lot of notes. Develop a working relationship with your co-workers is always advantageous.
good,Bel environnement professionnel international et fonctionnement de groupe
good,At this job I repaired railroad freight cars from the wheels up. I was responsible for the general repair to complete wrecks. The benefits for this job were advancement in pay and  job security.
good,"I had the pleasure of working for a team of intelligent, driven, and collegial professionals.  While the company is large, I always felt supported and able to call up colleagues if I had a question or needed help."
good,This was quite a good company to work for until in 2017 the American owners decided to close down their UK Equipment Finance division over the next 12 months.
good,"Overall, great experience. Fast paced, very competitive and learning cultures. Great experience. Completed salaries. Work very long hours each day.  The bar is set higher each year. Very lean culture which does more with less each year."
good,"Interesting products, lots going on but only a few get the green light for advancement.  If you are not one of them, you're stuck in the middle for the long haul."
good,GE expects all employees to go above and beyond their job requirements.  Managers must be available 24/7.  Employees required to taking training - but not on company time.
good,went in at 3pm worked til 12am sometimes longer if they need overtime.i learned how to wrap do inventory management was so involved we workers made everything run smooth.hardes part of job was leaving when they closed down best part was the workers they were very deicated but   there was no relaxing time there it was very busy only time was lunch if were able to take it most of the time we were short of workers and ate when we could it was very fast pace .but I liked it being fast pace the shift went fast .
good,"Managers are allowed to manage people that they are dating. In order to advance, one must relocate to another site out of state.The management team does not manage, they react to issues that arise."
good,"I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work for GE Transportation on the CSX account. This is one of the most stressful jobs, but it makes you better at managing yourself. As with any position, you make it what you want and I strived to exemplify the perfect employee. Every day was demanding, started from scratch knowing nothing and blossomed into a very knowledgeable Technical Advisor for the time I had with the company. This is no job for cupcakes. I loved the people I worked with the most."
good,Sviluppo dlle conoscenze personali su LTV e DCF models ed in relazione alla riconciliazione delle IC
good,"Not willing to give any opinion as of now. will give my opinion after some time. this is not a right time to make any comments. you can understand the situation, why i am not willing to give any opinion."
good,Pay and benefits are top rate as well as retirement/pension. Work environment is clean and safe. Production scheduling and goals are severely mismanaged as well as unreasonable.
good,"Culture creates a love/hate relationship between management and employees."
good,"High stress working on medical equipment with image quality to pm completion. As the years have gone by, the benefits has reduced as well. Higher deductibles less coverage."
good,"GE was a good place to work.Benefits were good, although being hired in as a tier 2 employee was a little disappointing.Thought I had final job of my career, until they closed plant. Typical day at work was pretty much operating numerous machinesused in the manufacturing of ""par 38"" light bulbs."
good,I learned a lot at GE. Unfortunately it felt as though they were too big and didn't care much for their employees.  Pay significantly less than the market value for the work.
good,"Corporate job in a tight environment. Benefits are decreasing along with job security. People are great, but under extreme stress. Hopefully, the new CEO will help and drive this company to past gloryu"
good,"Apparently the place has seen better days, but with the cost out, GE is becoming a dinosaur. The bad part is there are great people working in this company but management is completely out of touch."
good,"I enjoyed he fact that it was a steady job with okay pay,  However management was terrible, most of them were fresh out of college and didn't have a clue about anything.  Also GE is all about making money as quickly as possible and getting rid of anyone at anytime if they feel it will hurt the bottom line."
good,"Daily tasks were: Worked on electric wheel motors, electric haul truck parts, grid blowers, alternators. Helped other areas in the shop, such as sand blasting diaphragms, rotors for steam turbines. For safety crane over head bridge, crane training. CPR."
good,management does not care about employees and GE is not the same since Haier took over.  More strict making jobs a lot harder and paying a lot less.  Most enjoyable part of job is your off on weekends.
good,"Focus is productivity and cost out and less to do with employee needs and concerns.  Very difficult to advance, better to keep your head down, despite what leaders say otherwise"
good,"Some jobs a fun and interesting. Others such as the factory will slowly kill you as you work 12 hours/day just to get by."
good,"Takes good care of employees, needs improvement in pay n benefits and well being. Management is good. Shift timinigs are very bad. Work culture is good."
good,dynamic place to work. no work life balance.  everyone is competing with each other.  good pay and benefits.  constant change in company and management.
good,"Daily schedules were set. However, the tools and people needed did not match their expectations. Lay offs were given at a drop of a hat. Doesn't matter how good or bad of an employee. Your a number there and if your number is pulled..then out you go."
good,"Worked with great people, but management drove the place into the ground with poor decision after poor decision. Quality was paid lip service and nothing more, schedules were more important than doing the job right. If there was a problem, management would invariably up the overtime instead of actually fixing the problems. Sure it was nice to make 50% more than my base salary, but that isn't sustainable. It is no wonder the plant failed and closed."
good,"Not able to catch any big technology trends and made wrong big bets and deals on acquisition and merging, GE water, OG and Alstom.  The management teams only deliver sugar-coated info and don't have the guts to invest on the technology."
good,Ge has a nice culture and a very good company to grow with. work Life balance is somewhat that u yourself has to maintain. salary is also below the market compensation and  you have to do a lot of hard-work to safe your Job in GE.
good,"working place give more knowledge fun workplace "
good,Lead Steam Turbine Engineer working at the GE Salt Lake Shop we seem to get the turbine repair jobs that other Shops do not want due the damage conditions.
good,Albuquerque plant shut down leaving many skilled workers without jobs in their location.  Many had to move out of Albuquerque or find jobs not commensurate with their experience or the compensation they were used to.
good,First job out of college. Hard work with long hours. Great technicians and staff that I learned Many things from. Management was almost non existent and i was taught everything from fellow employees. The work hours made this a very challenging job. 10 hour shifts 6-7 day a week.
good,"Provided an opportunity to gain first hand experience and knowledge with the processes involved in a global supply chain management system. I enjoyed working, learning and communicating with others."
good,"The workload is tremendous .  You have to work long hours to finish the job. Manager needs pre-approved overtime. Manager thinks everything can be done in few minutes."
good,"I know its what everyone says, but in this case its true. They have some of the best people I've ever worked with. How ever the management team is really really bad."
good,"most employees there have the jobs of at least 3 people, "
good,Don't agree with management.  Stagnant careers.  Second year without merit raises.  But you don't really have to work that hard so there is that.  If you are a minority you will probably have people promoting you every chance you get thanks to affirmative action and racial quotas.
good,"GE Capital used to have top-notch incentives and benefits, but over the years senior leadership changed hands and we were left with managers who only looked at their bottom line and not the welfare of their most important asset, their people. "
good,"This was a good company, I like working for them. it was a good environment. Most of the people was pleasant. management could of been better in terms of respect and handling issues on time"
good,"Low pay, always promise of a great outlook and improvement, never pans out. No accountability! Huge in wasting money. No foresight into upcoming business. This is a view of the Controls business."
good,"Aprendí a tener más iniciativa, autonomia y capacidad de organizaión en el pusto de trabajo. La gestión era un poco caótica pero el ambiente de trabajo era agradable."
good,The company is great and assessing and paying property tax across the country for motor vehicles and all GE leased equipment was challenging but they lost the personal touch with management and the lack of communication skills are low.
good,"Overall it was good, except management didn't know how to communicate to others.  I was a contractor so it was hard to not be a GE employee and had to go with the third party company that took over."
good,review mrp requirements for manufacting. Contact accts payable for related issues. Attend meetings with Q A personal for rejected material. Attend shortage meetings for material that is late for production.
good,"Yup, i passed on another opportunity more than a year ago to be overworked.  Usually 60+hrs including weekends and have to work New Years day among others."
good,"Management of this particular site was terrible.  Long work hours, required to come to office on the weekends, ran like a mom and pop sweat shop."
good,Most management lacks good leadership and ethical reasoning.  The people I work with are great but are being tacking advantage of management that continues to invade everyone's personal lives that consume days and nights.
good,This company fabricated Transformers they gave me the opportunity to weld without experience and picked up very fast with my managers training.
good,"Performing effective audits for Treasury Businesses and providing value addition by keeping abreast of the Federal requirements and guidelines to ensure compliance."
good,I enjoyed working there at 1st but the noon shift there seems to last quite long with working till 11pm instead of 10pm but it means you finish early friday
good,They're good in a pinch and have decent benefits but when they eliminate your department you lose your job the same day.  They also don't pay very well at all.
good,Good for me to start my professional career and knowing customer service industry.
good,"It was a great experience, a typical day was dealing with the public. I learn customer service skills. I loved working with the management and co-workers. The hardest thing about the job was having to turn people's light off. The most enjoyable thing was to see the people get the assistance they need to keep their service on."
good,"CT, MRI, Xray field service in OH and PA. I left a lot of friends there when they layed me off just after i built a new home that was perfectly located for the service job i was doing for them. Also, to be noted, i was the least senior man there but still survived 3 lay off years in a row until i was hit with it"
good,"Great working force, but very poor higher management, GE became so big that it is a victim of its size and complexity"
good,This job required 12 hours rotating shifts from 6PM to 6AM for two months and 6AM to 6PM for another two months. It is difficult for those who do not like working long night shifts.
good,"GE employees are hard working / educated, but the internal culture is highly competitive and extremely cutthroat.  Great opportunity for those who are prepared and willing the play the game."
good,Learned working under a decent pressure & extending working hours. 
good,Overall it was fun and as an individual I have learnt some useful tools in handling customers.
good,"A typical day at work including finding correct accounts numbers so checks could be processed into the correct account, opening and sorting express mail, sending damaged checks back to customers so they could re send their payment, changing exchange rates in the computer systems, and going to group meetings."
good,"Overall, this company has its pros and cons, some more than other. The benefits were great, insurance, 401K, pension, time off were all above standards. There were always relieving events throughout the year. A normal day was always busy and sometimes stemmed into overtime. For the most of it, I enjoyed my position and what I did. It was comfortable for a while but as for advancement, a lot needs to be changed. As for the management, I learned how not to treat people."
good,Currently managing Logistics for Americas Region for 9 divisions of GE Oil & Gas.
good,GE is a good company to work for. I need a place that will be more flexible in work/family balance.
good,A typical day here at GE Energy Services consists of looking at prints and verifying a cabinet has been built correctly before powering it up. We verify all the power is correct and if not we get assembly to come back and fix it. Once it is correct it gets powered up and we start downloading code and software. Once that is done we make sure the software is doing what it's supposed to do and run any issues by engineering.
good,More attention paid to achieving projected quarterly numbers than customer satisfaction.  Focused on getting orders to make quarter at the expense of profitability.
good,Im happy at my job for the most part but we have a lot of shutdowns and that financially hurts me. And i nerd a job that I know I'm not going to get laid off every other month.
good,"Just pray you know someone in high places. 10 years spent working 3rd shift, and when a day shift position opens up, the position goes to some bigwigs son fresh out of college."
good,demanding.hardwork.longhours.dangerous.areas.great wage.demanding management.greed. No loyalty. No pension now.two tier wage.up and down work flow.layoffs.
good,"I don't find anything hard about this job but I am a workaholic. People are friendly and management, engineers, maintenance and the manufacturing team all try to keep communication channels open. Very well blended environment."
good,Was blessed to work for G.E. Depressing they are eliminating American Jobs due to greed. I worked them excelled and enjoyed my fellow employees. I learned many trades during my employment.
good,"First 10 years I felt secure in my job, after that the threat of cheap foreign labor and constant workforce union job cutting made for an always uneasy work environment."
good,"1. Job security is not there... "
good,"le poste ne me correspondait pas du tout, mais les gens et le travail peut-être intéressant pour d'autres personnes."
good,The job itself is rewarding and the customers apart from management are great.  Good room for improving your knowledge as they tend to try cutting edge products and services.
good,Great pay and benefits but very hard to have a work life balance. Also a very specific area to work in so career advancements are pigeoned holed to this industry.
good,"I was probably hired at the most volatile time in the companies history."
good,It's all assembly lines for the most part. I personally don't enjoy doing the same thing all shift. They don't pay very well but expect alot. They didnt hire but 1 time a year for the temps so it's not a 90 day full time job if you go through a employment agency.
good,Great company and room for growth many different job opportunities and pay scales depending on what your comfortable doing and willing to learn the opportunities are available
good,"Employees are the most valuable asset this company has.  There are a lot of dedicated talented people working for this company.  I have gained experience of forecasting, budgeting, calculating standard and billing rates, etc.  The pressure is always on."
good,"A pesar de que GE tiene una buena cultura, ambiente y compensación, todo esto se viene abajo ya que con el mal liderazgo a traído una inestabilidad laboral en donde ha tenido que vender mucho negocios (y por debajo de lo que se adquirieron) lo cual ha traído que muchos colaboradores hayan sido despedidos."
good,Great problem domain and smart folks. Perhaps lacking judgement in choosing architectural approaches. Downplayed the role of Big Data and streaming. Using Karaf added complexity to solution.
good,It was just an OK place to work. Did not get excited coming to work each day. The best part about it was the people I worked with everyday. The work environment was not good at all.
good,"Learned a lot while at GE - was free to take on any challenge. Manager was great, the hours were grueling, I loved the people I worked with. Position was diverse"
good,"la possibilité d'évoluer est quasi inexistante dans mon sevrice, et lorsqu'il y a un poste, il est attribué avant même d'être communiqué."
good,A lot of learning. Too much travel. Unexpected late calls. Never knowing when your day is over. Too much fat drives. It’s crazy but the money is worth it.
good,General Electric has excellent work culture but no salary appraisals and restriction between GE transfers. Cooperative staff. excellent work and personal life balance.
good,"Great people, significant amount of changes in the power sector and difficult culture due to debt and tight budget constraints on learning,travel, and career."
good,Perhaps the most valuable skills I ever acquired were at GE. The six sigma program was second to none. They invested heavily in employee education and training.
good,"There is a lot of recruitment activities and work to get through on each day including the attendance of client meetings and regular report writing. "
good,I only worked there for a year. I did not like working in a factory. so it was not a great place for me. I liked most of the people and my manger was kind of a jerk.
good,I asked about differences between an old machine and a new one during a team meeting and was to told to keep doing my part and the supervisor would do his.
good,"Trabajé solo 3 meses en un proyecto de mejora en el área de logística. Los jefes y gerentes me trataron muy bien y siempre estuvieron abiertos para escuchar propuestas y aportar sus ideas."
good,"The people I have worked with in Ge and all its businesses are deeply convinced of the values and principles of Leadership; however, the higher levels of leadership are very inconsistent in their approach to those values and practices."
good,"GE is still a good company to work for, but the struggles in Power are causing major uncertainties.  At this point in my life I need stability and right now GE cannot provide that."
good,Eigentlich ein super Arbeitgeber aber durch interne Reorganisation machen sie alles bisher erreichte dahin. Es geht viel Erfahrung verloren .
good,"Fast paced"
good,After new owners took over become miserable place to work for.slways on your butt for soomething benefits started being took away started loosing money..started deleting jobs
good,"Wait for technical service calls from the shop floor.  Management was not visible.  The culture was knowing your place,  seniority was everything. It was not enjoyable to work for GE."
good,"A typical work day at GE is fast paced and strenuous if standing"
good,Cette usine est dirigé par des financiers et non des industriels. Cela se ressent sur le recrutement et au détriment de la qualité.
good,I think that overall it is a descent company but Management is making it difficult for the employees that work there.  There reputation is getting tarnished because they do not take action when someone complains.
good,"Although working in a small office environment, the sales targets that needed to be met, were at times difficult to achieve. I did have a good manager and the staff were nice."
good,"I believe that I was treated unfairly by some of the staff at the Nela Park facility. While for the most part people were very nice there were a number of that had bad attitudes"
good,Not very challenging as an intern. Did a lot of time studies and lean principle related projects. I would have liked to have done more technical related projects.
good,"GE is going through massive amounts of change and with that comes extreme uncertainty. The new CEO is making sweeping change and ambiguity is a way of life everyday. Where GE was in the past as a 'great place to work' it is currently a very tense place with each day bringing more uncertainty and management saying, just continue to work as normal... contradiction!"
good,"I spent 7 months there.  it was great for pay and benefits,  but day shift workers were cut throat about taking there work from them, as being the off shift.  i also could not adjust to the hours of night shift."
good,"Slow paced and no innovation."
good,"GE is the world's Digital Industrial Company, transforming industry with software-defined machines and solutions that are connected, responsive and predictive. Through our people, leadership development, services, technology and scale, GE delivers better outcomes for global customers by speaking the language of industry."
good,"Trabalho intenso e disponibilidade total."
good,"Do not approach HR about a personal disorder. Leads to termination.Most workers are excellent at their job.Very good benefits, but needs higher wages for this area."
good,A network of cronyism that promotes those who lack skills vs. those with experience. While innovative in some aspects there is no flexibility for employees to express themselves.
good,"The work was interesting but the management was bad and the union did nothing to but protect individuals who did not want to work.  This plant probably would still be open if the management managed the employees better and knew how to run just in time manufacturing.  They did not know when or where motors were to be completed or have the materials ordered to do the job.  They basically hired people that did not know what the company manufactures, no clue what so ever from the mangers to the HR or top management.  Sad for the community that this plant closed."
good,"This was a great company to work for until they sold the financial portion of their business. I would have retired from this company, because they were so good to work for."
good,"The Buyer position is fairly standard, aside from constantly short-cycling our vendors & pushing for expedites without fees. The challenge in this location is that everyone is frequently asked to find any way to make the deadline, but none of the hurdles are ever analyzed to improve the process the next time."
good,Busy. Learned everything about warehousing in 27 years working there. Employees not caring about the job and management letting it go. Wanting you to do more than you can in 8 hours was frustrating.
good,"GE Peterborough was, at one time, a terrific place of employment.   Unfortunately after more then 100 years of manufacturing, the factory is closing.  Management is chaotic and disorganized.  The employees for the most part, are amazing and work well together.  It was a great environment to learn new skills and there was opportunities to change jobs internally to expand your skill set.  "
good,"Tiene un excelente horario de trabajo, ayuda a madres trabajadoras y a estudiantes"
good,"требования высокие"
good,very difficult to get band change even if work hard and smart. but job wise good and we can show our all talents. No negative remarks about company. good company to work if you don't want to move next level
good,"GE is full of great people.   However due to bad decision making by the previous CEO, the company is under extreme financial stress and  therefore cannot provide growth opportunities for it's employees."
good,"An average work week consisted of usually 40 hrs or more, depending on how busy we were.  Each day would start off by checking your emails and getting a feel for the work load of that day.  We would prioritize each job that needed testing or inspecting done.  After each test or inspection we would fill out the proper paperwork and then file them, and send off the reports.  The hardest part of the job was the amount of copying and paperwork.  I learned a lot throughout my time in test/inspection, and learned how to use many different types of testing and measuring equipment.  We basically managed ourselves on this job, we prioritized each test that needed to be done, and tested in that order.  The most enjoyable part of the day was dealing with customers and showing them the inspections and tests."
good,"They don't care about you as a person. You are a number to this company. Nothing more, nothing less. Management and union personal do not operate on a common goal work environment. It is an US vs Them workplace."
good,General Electric is a legendary company with an important role in the global economic. As an employer is a GREAT place for learning. The issue is that learning curve come accompanied by a lack of work/life balance and stress.
good,General Electric is a very fast paced environment. The entire corporation is based around team work. Every unit made is built with a collaborative effort from CEO to laborer. Working at General Electric I have learned team work to another level. I have helped build entire lines and configuring material routes for delivery of materials.
good,"The Knoxville Environmental office was a fantastic place to work but the Power industry has stopped putting money into Coal fired Power plants. As a result, the jobs have dried up, and the company has downsized. The Knoxville Office was closed"
good,"We were paid very well to do our job. "
good,A typical day at work is very relaxed and informative.I have mostly learned self discipline and how to manage and assign daily tasks/priorities to team members. The work culture is one of the best things about the company as it promotes responsibility and accountability to everyone.
good,"Working for GE is just ok, I am not challenged and receive minimal direction or support from my management team. I am looking to leave because I want to work for a company and team that will support and value the work I am performing."
good,"I was there through a temporary service, i loved the job and wished it would-be ked to being hired on. But my assignment ended. It's a good place to work."
good,"Extremely poor management. Strong unioun. Great pay and benefits. Relaxed working environment. Easy work, machinary is easy to repair. Clean place to work."
good,gestion de dossiers confidentiels sur l'europe et le moyens orient pouur la vente de central turbines à gaz
good,"Hard , "
good,Not a bad company to work for. must have a strong back bone as you are working with the publics money and they can be very insulting and cruel. The end
good,"A decent place to work with good work /life balance and decent package."
good,"Atleast in my project, there were not much opportunities."
good,Man ist einer von vielen.Kommunikation ist nich beispielhaft.Wenig transparens.Sehr grosser Büroapparat und zu wenig in der Produktion.Entlöhnung ist sehr unterschiedlich auch bei gleicher Tätigkeit.
good,typical day at the erie ge plant was usually pretty productive. we would start with a safety meeting and then discuss what management would need for us to produce for the day. I learned that working at ge had some advantages
good,"At GE GRC, there is always something that will be interesting. It could be an application driven short/mid term engineering problem that needs new way of solving, or it could be a new area of market that need science and technical understanding before a product can be developed. If you like new things and do not want to get bored with daily engineering work, that is the place to go."
good,"GE is not the same company that it was in the Jack Welsh era.  I leave it to you to determine whether this is good or bad.  There is a significant amount of change ongoing at GE and this is leading to some difficult cultural issues between the legacy mindset and those promoting change and new directions.  There is no question that GE has exceptional technology, however recent emphasis towards digital along with a challenging marketplace has resulted in significant cost cuts in areas such as research and development.  The long term impact of this on GE's competitiveness is yet to be felt.  I cannot say whether I would recommend this company or not, as it is so diverse and has so many different types of opportunities that the ultimate determination will be based on the position and organisational vertical you are in.  All I can say is that I spent several wasted years within the GGO organisation, which I suspect (hope) will be disbanded under the new leadership."
good,Numerous complex job duties with very little support from corporate management.  Upper managers are working managers who understand the complexities of the position but have little or no say in pay raises or promotions.
good,"GE was expected to be a good and fun place to work; like many said is in the US. GE Africa seems to be different, judging from what we were told by those who returned to Africa to work. "
good,"A GE Segurança Eletrônica foi uma tentativa de empreender, mas por ter idéias diferentes de negócio com meu sócio acabou não dando certo."
good,Company needs more review on work/life balance. Does not rely on expertise of personnel and would rather use developed models other than personnel input.
good,"Typisch amerikanische Arbeitskultur. Flahe Hierarchie, aber 150% Leistung gefordert."
good,This company manufactures a product that is designed to save lives and the environment. It was very interesting learning how all the component work together. Not too much of a stressful environment .
good,"No review against the company that i have worked for. It is ok to me. Although, it is limited opportunity to advance or to be promoted to a higher level or management"
good,Its a job. i am currently looking for something else because they want you to do more work than they want to  pay you for. i also find that a lot of their products break down easily because of bad handling within the factories causing for there to be high volume of calls in the call center.
good,"The first few years were amazing.  Then the bureaucracy, decided to close down the NOLA office and move it to Melbourne FL.  All of the members of the NOLA office submitted their resignations.  As a Contractor I was offered a position in Melbourne, little did I know."
good,Good place to start career in management/leadership roles. Management focussed and not much on technology opportunities in-house considering most of that is delivered by 3rd parties
good,"good company ....I learned so Maney things ..about quality.safety....work instructions"
good,I have been part of an acquisition and I think that's a really difficult way to join GE.  The last year provided great opportunities to lead and I have been trusted with a lot of responsibility.  It has also been difficult with out offering clear information on processes or where to find things.  Often you spend hours trying to find out how to do something simple.  The people I have met are great but the hours I have worked are brutal.  I think joining by being hired would be a whole different story.
good,"Was a great place to work, when I first started everyone seemed nice until time went on and then people started stabbing you in the back.  Management sucked got in trouble for taking my vacation time that I was told I had and then turned around and they told me I didn't have the vacation days and they fired me for that.  Nothing HR could do because I was in my 90 days but still it didn't make any sense why I was fired for their mistake."
good,"Long days 10 plus hour work days expected, highly encouraged you work weekends and holidays."
good,"Arbeitsklutur ist Positiv."
good,"When Synchrony Financial separated from GE Retail Finance, the decision was made to close the Texas call center and route calls to other mega call centers"
good,A typical day at work consists of working diligently to build quality units in a timely manner with the assistance and guidance from management when needed.
good,"Once believed to be a place with great potential.   Given market uncertainty and restructuring only time will tell.  Directionally, the digital play should help the company pivot toward new growth areas and create more opportunities."
good,es una empresa con mucho trabajo en ocasiones no valoran a su personal  el ambiente con los compañeros es muy bueno tiene prestaciones buenas la comida de la empresa es muy buena te ayuda con las horas extras te capacitan constantemente.
good,"Highly Professional environment, open to develop carrier path."
good,"A typical day included very intricate and detailed tasks building and testing sensors. I learned a great deal about how circuit boards are made, the conditions in which they have to be kept and the safety measurements in place to stop them shorting out. The management team for the most part were organized well and contributed positively to the workers daily tasks."
good,"Executed multi-million dollar projects installing control systems in industrial settings"
good,I liked the job so new to learn everyday. My co-workers were great to work with. Hardest part of the job was all the travel. Company was poorly managed.
good,"Great place to work made life long friends at GE, I've learned to be a team player and able to work remotely."
good,"As long as you accomplish your job duties in a minimal amount of time, management will not have any issues and will allow you space."
good,Employs lots of people and is helping put America back in the manufacturing arena.  Has broad range of products to satisfy a large range of customer needs.
good,"A typical day at work is not hard, but it's hard for a temp employee to get a job there through MAU. Don't try to misunderstand me I would work for GE in a heartbeat because not only does it pay well, but their employees receive great benefits and are treated well."
good,"A typical day at work would be processing invoices for payment, sending shipments to the states, and sending customers sales quotes for products. In this position i learnt that time management is very important and found that prioritizing tasks is helpful when things get busy. The hardest part of the job was the really long days with nothing to do."
good,"Temporary assignment.  However, it was great while it lasted. Staff were very supportive, always ensuring that proper instructions were given."
good,"Good workplace in terms of benefit & salary. Work procedure & culture is not so fare. Lots of Nonperforming assets."
good,The place was sullen due mostly to being bought out by GE. Was hired in at start of a massive hiring episode and later released in some kind of first in last out campaign. Very interesting work although old equipment. some dating back to WWII. Also foreign owned equipment.
good,this is the place you can enjoy with people by coordinating & training with software packages in order to fulfill their requirements.
good,"I like GE as a company, but for someone with a business degree like myself, there is not much room for advancement.  Most people that advance in this company have some type of two-year or four-year technical degree.  But for someone who is an entry level applicant with no degrees, this is one of the highest paying entry level no experience needed jobs you will find.  So overall I say this is a great company, just not much room for advancement unless you have a technical degree."
good,"I worked for GE for almost 19 years. For the most part it was enjoyable with great benefits. However, when the company is done with the product or service you work for, they will close down the job and let you go."
good,Good name on a resume for the future and good work experience to begin a career but wages are on the lower end. Advancement would most likely involve relocation or minimal salary increases.
good,"During my time at GE, I realized that their Management need leadership training and spend more time focusing on their employees."
good,"A large organisation with typical corporate processes,with plenty of in-house opportunities."
good,"I work in GE Capital as a Operation Executive & my work is "

good,"Sicuramente questa esperienza lavorativa mi ha insegnato puntualità,precisione e velocità nell'utilizzo del p.c."
good,"I learned how to use their system called GEMS (Global Entity Management System), which houses all of GE's legal entities."
good,"As far as factories go, this was a pretty decent one to work for. Plenty of notice for mandatory overtime. Union"
good,Fast paced lean working environment controlled out of another office which limited advancement opportunities.
good,"Typical Large corporation."
good,There is no typical day on the job at GE Capital Corporation.
good,Alta expertise in termini di knowledge e capabilities. Basso livello di people management. Gruppo italiano purtroppo intaccato da legislazione del paese con tassazione troppo elevata a discapito di salari e incentivi.
good,"chiller Maintenance."
good,I enjoyed working at G.E. because I was able to change jobs. I learned  all sorts of new things and was able to teach others the best and safest way to do jobs. I've always like to learn new jobs. I usually perfered replacement operator jobs best because the jobs were always different. I enjoyed all the people I worked with. Management like me because I learned fast and eventually became a co-ordinator so I knew how people liked to be asked to perform a job rather than told. The hardest part of the job was when I was first hired on I was laid-off alot. I never knew if I was going back.
good,Work/life balance was fairly manageable and the office was far enough from the mothership so it was not completely stuffy or extremely corporate.  Great group of people which helped offset the challenging career advancement issues.  Company provides a great training ground for young employees.
good,"A typical day at work is very assiduous.  We have to pay close attention to detail with very little room for mistakes.We must be very alert, punctual, and sensible while having to meet the high demands of the employer for the sake of our customers.We have a constant and on going flow of routine that helps us maintain our daily productivity, which helps us deliver the best quality product and workmanship we have to offer."
good,Good place if you're just starting out. Everyone is taught how to perform to deliverables and they empower their employees.
good,"A typical day with in the GE office consists of outbound solicitation, re-negotiation and cross selling of GE products in a compliant manner."
good,GE is a workplace where you need to be kept on your toes all the time due to its culture of effective and speedy implementation of ideas into actions
good,"mi trabajo se desarrollaba en tras recibir una orden determinada de trabajo,bajo una lista de componentes y palno de caja y cableado,fabricar cuadros eléctricos navales e industriales."
good,GE was a great organization when I worked there. Very fast paced culture with strong leadership.   I learned a lot.
good,I enjoyed the customer contact and working with my coworkers
good,Empresa dinamica que requer muita flexibilidade nas relações interpessoais
good,Typical day at work consist of new issues and challenges in which I enjoy because it keeps me thinking and learning each day. Solving the issues in an ambiguous environment is the difficult part but its because lack of communitcation. Most businesses struggle with this and thats why companies are always striving for improvement. I've learned so many skills from being placed in different and difficult situations.  I do appreciate the challenge of this company but advancement is rare in the department Im currently working. Recognition is also a plus and they care for the employees by implementing Health Ahead programs to encourage a healthier life.
good,"poor upper management "
good,"Accept pages, call customer to schedule service or pickup parts ordered on the previous day to service customer units. "
good,"Overall, it's a good company with great benefits, but you must be willing to work tons of hours with no overtime and no comp time."
good,"GE wind Techs are just contractors for the Turbine owners. Job Security lye's only with the length of warranty given. Upon completion    of warranty, Tech must find another site and relocate or leave GE.  "
good,"UPS SUPPLY CHAIN SOLUTIONS "
good,"GE is a strong company that isn't going to up and disappear on you unexpectedly.  However, if you're not working in one of the core GE businesses life isn't very good and very rocky.  You don't get support from upper management outside your business or building.  You aren't important and you feel it."
good,"A good place to learn many things about process and leadership, with good co-workers."
good,GE can be a great company and has many of the tools needed to succeed. However it must learn to empower the lower part of the workforce (non-EBs) and teach it's Executive ranks to listen more and not be so concerned about the politics (i.e. do what's right).
good,Technical leading a team of professionals and hourly resources.
good,"As a A.M.E. /Production improvement engineer, you arrived to work with the work force, which meant starting anytime between 3:00am to 6:00am depending on the work load. GE is attempting to move into lean manufacturing processes, with a reluctant unionized work force, which highlight two of the hardest parts of the job - long hours and a challenging work force. Your peers are excellent, always providing the help and support required to complete your job. Besides your peers, GE allows the engineer to work with a good degree of autonomy, allowing one to succeed, (or fail) through their own achievements."
good,good comp
good,"I started working for GE through an aquisition. My co-workers are the best, we are a small unit that have worked together well, we consider our selves to be the perfect fit. The culture is quite different from most and there is learning, learning and more learning. There are lots of webx and meeting to circulate information. The hardest part of the job is month end when you just have to have everything done right on time with no room for error, but we always manage to get it done right."
good,This company was a good company to work with and the co-workers were wonderful team players. I learned to park trailers to and from the dock. The hardest part of the job was learning to back the trailer to the dock. The most enjoyable part was the employee gatherings.
good,"As part of a merger and acquisition target in 2005, the process of assimilation was frought with ambiguity and non-truthfullness on the part of GE from the start of that process. Never once was any target company employee made to feel as part of the GE team. Rank and file was by-passed by the influx of GE Specialists who had a game plan in mind, and that was to squeeze target company employee time beyond 40 hours, in a never ending micromanagement of every company process, eventhough the target company was financially successfull from the standpoint KEI's."
good,Resources are not provided to adequatly do your job. There is no organization on the fast growth so you end up spending alot of wasted time repeating tasks.
good,"GEES is a great place to work, there are many exciting opportunities taking shape every day and the learning curve never dies with the strongest and smartest team."
good,co-workers great too work with. just way too much travel for a family man and then start taking away some of the perks of living on the road.
good,Funding own medical. Insurance.
good,lack of management
good,one learns to manipulate components fairly soon
good,"GE Appliances was a nice experience where I learned a lot about how to sell and the workings of the appliance industry. Unfortunately, the business is tied to the success of the retail economy and thus has been in a steady decile based on the 2008 housing collapse, materials inflation, & strong Asian competition."
good,"Company was recently sold, job security is non-existent.  Management goals are chaotic most times.  Limited chance of movement within the business.  Management only cares for salary employees, yet most of workforce are contract employees"
good,"big talk, that's all that they have to offer. stuffed shirts. mostly.  for some reason, the review wants  minimum number of characters to finalise this review."
good,"Bcp Bcp de niveaux hierarchiques... Necessaires ?"
good,Went through many restructuring within ge. Not stable work environment. Executives were replaced with personnel that did not have work experience in the oil and gas field. Alienated many customers.
good,"Fine, good pay, steady work, good hours, no one bothers you, you do your job and go home. You don't have to worry about anything else. If you are looking for a job like that it is perfect."
good,The people I work with are great.All jobs are fairly easy. not a bad company to work for. make sure you show up and be on time. strict on attendance. ty
good,Le management laisse à désiré sans compter les différents clans qui s'y forme pour avoir des conditions de travail adéquat vaut mieux se joindre à l'un de ses clans
good,"My specific experience is no longer relevant given changes at GE.  I worked there for almost 8 years.  Since then, lots of changes occurred and I could not say how it is now, and it changed again after I left too."
good,"The work was hot and awful dirty, got alone With most co-workers. There was to much favoritism there too. "
good,"Very boring. Hard to meet goals. Low pay, a lot of turn over. Benefits are pretty good. The jobs break your body down over time. Very repetitive. Job injuries are always the employees fault."
good,"I worked at the SW Center for Excellence in San Ramon, Ca. Lots of open space but very easy to be distracted because of the lack of private meeting areas. I was on a new project and I must've had a new manager change 3 times in a 12 month period. The technical resources however were fantastic!! Plenty of snacks and free juices, coffee, etc to keep you around and the farmer's market and gym access was but several ""perks"" of working there. The best part of my job was the co-workers I met that I remain friends with to this day. The worst part was the politics and constant upper management changes."
good,"There really isnt for sure job security, you can be sick and come back ro someone ar your job. The management over the line is understand but the management in the offices seemed like they could care less. No job is too hard to learn if your willing but some jobs are very repetitive with no rotations so it getz old fast."
good,"Minha nota no geral é 3, no caso, pelas pessoas brilhantes que trabalham ou passaram por ela. Aprendi muito em 10 anos de empresa, muita coisa boa que será levada comigo pra sempre. Por outro lado, alguns que sobem nas suas costas e te ameaçam se algo não derem certo a elas...(triste) mas isso varia muito de pessoa a pessoa. Atuei em diversas empresas e em cada uma delas, foi um ""curso"" com professores diferentes. Muita gente interessante com idéias interessantes, te transformam...."
good,"Incompetent union rep made work life miserable and GE HR said nothing could be done to resolve the uncomfortable circumstances. GE training is awesome, being a union position there is no advancement. I was employed with GE for over 20 years, yet never felt appreciated for any of my achievements. Unfortunately you remain a number in GE's HR department and never receive any recognition."
good,"GE has been an unstable employer since my hire date in 2000. One week I am working overtime, the following week I am collecting unemployment due to a temporary lay off. The pay has been great and I love what I do. Unfortunately my family and I need a stable job that also comes with job security."
good,"Bon salaire, nombreux avantages, mais culture d'entreprise specifique"
good,"GE was a great place to start my career, however, lately the leadership has been slow to react and struggling to keep up with the times. Leadership tends to not leave and only move around those that have come off a program since they spent money to ""develop"" them. "
good,"Old school attitudes, ""boys club"" atmosphere, alot of rough but good folks making ends meet. Poor management. Peterborough location  closed September 2018. We trained our international counterparts while waiting for our pink slips."
good,This workplace is very competitive. There is no time to relax. This challenges people to come up with work arounds and think quick on their feet. This will challenge you as an individual.
good,This company is going through tough times and trying to reorganize and rebuild itself. It has multiple businesses which are  scrutinized and compared to other companies.
good,good place to work very fact pasted job very repetitive  great people to work for very fixable very willing to lesson to problem's about people and the shop
good,"Uma grande companhia "
good,"My day started with check my Inbox for emails from GE buyers or Suppliers. As a T2 rep. I was responsible for purchase order maintenance, which meant adding or subtracting funds from PO's via Oracle Purchasing. I also took escalated calls regarding technical issues regarding GE's Suppliernet website."
good,"GE was a great company to work for until the past 3 to 4 years.  The financial problems have resulted in lower (or no) raises, small bonuses, and benefit cut backs."
good,I really liked the company hard working culture and competitive environment.  The past year has been very challenging.  Many teams are stretched and financial target continuously increased.
good,Management took only the brief view of things without looking long term.  Everything seemed to have to give immediate returns or they were not happy.  They did give a nice recognition award for the GEnius program.
good,interesting work at a place that had been so important in the building and shaping of American technologies. Too bad the main plant has about 1/3 of people working there than when they did 25 years ago.
good,"General Electric is one of the most competitive and relevant companies in modern America. It's a multi-million dollar company with thousands of employees. Unfortunately, this strength is also its weakness -- I was continually lost in the shuffle, and was never able to become ""more than a number."""
good,"Open work space to allow for easy and osmotic collaboration.  Sometimes can get rather noisy, if your neighbors forget that this is an office environment."
good,"Sometimes the environment is stressful or fast paced. the pay is not enough, benefits are good. insurance sometimes is not accepted. management decisions can sometimes be questionable."
good,"Great company to work for and enjoyed my time there. Would never have left is reorganization had not occurred. Excellent products, management and systems."
good,"Provided great opportunity to explore other areas of the business, and change career focus for the better.  Quality of management is hit or miss, and can make or break your career."
good,"8am in, 5pm out. Work on engineering projects. Solve production issues and answer customer questions."
good,"Bonne entreprise, pour se former et acquérir des compétences."
good,"overall enjoyed working with coworkers, great pay and benefits, lack of management that was only worried about how much they could line there pockets with."
good,"Overall, it’s a great company with lots of options, but where I worked, being better than others didn’t matter if you weren’t talking to the ‘right’ people.  I was very fortunate to follow someone who did not subscribe to that plan."
good,"If you are willing to work 60 to 80 hours per week and then take your laptop home on evenings and weekends, then you can succeed here. They have ice cream socials and other events."
good,"If this was a more permanent job where a layoff wasn't around the corner, I would be staying with this company. Due to the fact that I have a family to support, I need a more permanent job to ensure a good future for my family."
good,Great launch point for careers.  Great co-workers!  Needed move to full time from contract to improve quality of life and had to go elsewhere.  Tried to move full time internally multiple times but was rebuffed.
good,"People are cooperative and that makes the workplace better and let you deal with the workload."
good,You don’t get any raises. They are always looking for ways to eliminate jobs. The benefits get worse every year. It is no longer the company it once was and there is no opportunities to move up with in the company other than on the line.
good,"GE is s good company to work for especially a couple of years ago while it makes profits. however, due to the wrong grows strategies, the company is facing a great finance challenge, the the leaders lost the directions. it needs time for turn around."
good,Business no longer exists. GE sold this particular business and then GE spun off GE Capital and moved in other directions.  Company continues to down size and refocus.
good,Standard corporate office environment with multiple leadership levels and employee layers.  Advancement and training available if your willing to stand out.
good,"I had the honor of working with some top notch engineers and managers. I was involved with some very interesting projects involving engine test, flight test, control logic design, and combustor design.  Unfortunately there is a bloated management structure, with mid level bosses out to save their own unproductive jobs."
good,"Enjoyable place to work."
good,"Job is OK, but its super busy and the sales team I support is annoyingly demanding.  I don't particularly enjoy the job, but the pay is great and I'm good at what I do."
good,"GE is a tough situation due its more management of cash flow as widely reported.  Overall, GE was an ethical company to work for and provided excellent opportunities for leadership."
good,"Na época em que eu trabalhei na GE haviam muitos terceiros e a distinção de salários benefícios era bem evidente e sentida por toda equipe das diversas empresas que trabalhavam lá."
good,"This company is a great place to learn. The work and culture is challenging, the leadership is tough, and the products delivered are awesome. Great place to learn your personal limits."
good,"Growth Prospects are very confusing."
good,Pay does not match the hours and travel required to get to the location.  Safety is important prior to inspections or management tours but standards are not maintained.  Management is weak and between the client and GE staff there seems to be information gaps and confusion in many cases.
good,Ge was bought out by Haier.  The morality of the company has plummeted with many believing there isn't much of a future. It's turned into a starter job instead of a possible career job.
good,"Tough training ground, where you are thrown in the deep end and have to learn how to swim quickly.  New hires will learn a tremendous amount of skills, especially in Finance and Operations, areas where GE's training is considered premiere."
good,"*Friendly helpful coworkers"
good,This is a stressful place to work as management is always changing.  The hardest part of the job was trying to fulfill everything that was expected in a day.  The most enjoyable part was the people and their many cultures.
good,The work isn't hard but there's better work for the amount you make at GE. The benefits are great and they help with your 401k but this isn't a job you can retire on anymore
good,good...flexible.....work from home...but volatile...no work satisfaction....no trust & support.....good benefits & salary compensasation.....no variable pay...
good,My work as to interface between GE materials finance and the government.  I found that GE was not always honest in the negotiations.  I was always concerned as to what management might be looking to do to me since they were not always forthcoming with accurate information to the government.
good,"Not a terrible job, but not a great job. Very hard to move up in the company. Asking to work out of another district during slow times is something that is not tolerated in my district."
good,I am very punchual and self motivated girl with positive attidute towar my lufe and carrre. I am not happy form salary which is given to me by this company i ant fullfill my basice need . Second reason that place is very far from my place .
good,"GE exposed me to new businesses, geographies and challenges everyday.  Great mentors.  Culture is excellent, especially in terms of professional development.  Only negative is location and restructuring."
good,Ge provides good pay but that's it!  GE does not care about family only about profiting as much as they can by any means necessary.  Including moving jobs overseas to save/ make more money!
good,"Great job. CEO does not know what he is doing. Hiring one month, laying off the people they hired plus more the next month. Not the GE that your parents worked for!!"
good,Large company that you can easily get lost in. Many changes happening in the world Power industry affecting job security. GE is trying hard to cut cost to equal the current customer load and new sales.
good,"We were a small company bought out by GE.  The benefits are good and there is a good balance between work life and personal life, however they have decided to close our facility down."
good,"Diversified projects with competitive benefit package and green card sponsorship, good for entry-level researchers; need more differentiation among senior level researchers and merit-based benefit for senior employees;"
good,My work in GE Money is call the customer for the payment of their credit card after the due date is passed. This is target based job which i can may be cant done.
good,"A typical day begins with scanning of emails, listing the daily jobs and ensure completing them by the end of the day."
good,"Satisfaction in supporting the customer, of prime importance in a service/support environment. Good support from work collegues"
good,"This was a straight technical writing position for me. It did allow for me work in a live test environment, which was very interesting. However I felt it offered little outside of that environment."
good,A typical day at General Electric.  I was responsible for different labor intense work. Checking the out going and in coming products that GE shipped to and from different manufacturers.
good,"Trabajo bien remunerado, acorde a la exigencia máxima correspondiente a una multinacional americana."
good,"Working for GE speaks for itself. You can learn and do just about anything across the different business units. Its an endless fountain of knowledge. However, work is your life."
good,It is a repetitive job it gets boring after a while. The environment is what you make it. The co-workers is what makes the job ok.
good,"Management is lacking, seems to drop the ball ALOT. There is a lot of good people who work there and positive changes could be made in their training program but management will not incorporate them."
good,Excelente empresa com presença global e atuação em vários segmentos.
good,"Good learning opportunities, flexible working hours, poor high management, but small salaries"
good,The location and people at this plant are great to work with.  Great work/life balance and some nice benefits (unlimited time-off).  Unfortunately the greater business treats employees like they are replaceable and compensation is lower then industry average.
good,"People are great but the company is still very old in many aspects. Lots of bureaucracy, takes time to get things done. People arent always aware of the latest tech."
good,"pretty laid back job "
good,"GE is a large company with a rich history.  This shows at nearly every level.  The large company results in solid process that sometimes limit innovation and flexibility, but ensure consistent results and predictable expectations.  There is a lot of long time employees that want to maintain the status quo, but the company is actively trying to change this and is purusuing cutting edge work on the ""industrial Internet"" or IoT to drastically change the way work is done.  They also talk the talk about agile development process and are working toward those improvements.  If they do fast enough this will continue to be a great company for generations."
good,A typical work there here was 8:30 to 5pm. Very corporate like environment with a lot of red tape everywhere. Management was okay and fair.
good,"I have never been treated so bad by any global organization"
good,"Upper management is disconnected from the ""boots on the ground"".  Expectations are unrealistic.  Assets are not managed well and dollars are not properly spent."
good,"I was taking care of administration, office supplies, mailing, and e-mailing in English and Russian."
good,"Typical days of work were full very busy. The close would only exacerbate a very busy day. The culture was work, work, work. Very supportive teammates helped make the day go by easier."
good,"Very demanding place to work and very focused on the numbers. A lot of bureaucracy to work through and organization is very slow to adopt change.  That being said, there are excellent training opportunities available and opportunities to transition into functional opportunities outside of your core competency."
good,"The benefits are wonderful, and the overtime is a plus! I enjoyed working with this company, but I need something with better pay, and a company with more opportunity to allow current employees gain higher goals."
good,it was a company with many benefits and hard working employees very kind people good work environment and busy schedule
good,"Work life balance has been very good, but depends on your manager.  Overall experience has been just average.  There seem to be a lot of managers that shouldn't be managers."
good,"From the moment you walk into the door, one will always consider the next step.  The pay is not as competitive as one would hope; however, the potential earnings endless."
good,"many changes taking place in both organization and overall company."
good,"Empresa que oferece múltiplas oportunidades de carreira, e liberdade para a criatividade dos líderes."
good,"- Change is constant. Org changes seem to be yearly"
good,"I was responsible for request for Quotation (RFQ). Negotiation and issuance of Purchase Orders, negotiating each quoted item and purchase packages; Costing and direct contact with the supplier; Development of new sources of supply; Negotiation with internal customers: lead time and budgets.

good,"Gute Verdienstmöglichkeiten, aber viel Veränderungen im Management. Kaum Work-Life-Balance"
good,I would run an automated machine line. I learned to be careful in who you trust in the workplace.
good,"Work in GE was very short for some global review. I learned how to deal with bank customers also met few nice people there, but most of time i was very sick of my job. Was too stereotype so i had to leave very soon. But people rocks there. Had very good times."
good,But corrosive environment in the office and on the floor. Not for the faint of heart. This company is looking for salaried folks who want to move up. Not careerists just looking for a job. This has it's plus's and minus's....
good,"Um dia nunca era igual ao outro. Atendia Norte, Centro-Oeste, DF, Goias e Triângulo Mineiro."
good,An individual gets groomed a lot to have an eye for excellence in his/her role.
good,Trop de reporting - implication trés forte dans le souhait de développer l'activité commerciale de l'entreprise
good,"Large Global company with restraints pertaining to systems and high staff turn around due to lack of procedures and system support. Work life balance is not applicable in most cases due to the above restraints. People are hard working and there is lots of room for simplification to avoid all the manual inputs. Individuals are pleasant and the culture is easy to adjust to with mutual respect amongst employees. I enjoy the learning experence and the exposure due to the above as this has provided me with the opportunity to improve in areas where required."
good,"At the entry level GE is one of the best training and learning organizations around.  It offers numerous international learning opportunities.  However, as your career proceeds within GE, opportunities decrease and bureaucracy sets in.  Middle and senior leadership roles in GE also allow for minimal work/ life balance opportunities."
good,"I learned new software, and a new office environment for me."
good,"G.E. Capital is an inbound call center. As a customer service representative I was responsible for assisting cardholders with making payment arrangements, balance inquiries, disputed charges, and information changes. As a huge call center with hundreds of employees this was my first call center experience. Turnover rate was huge so we saw a lot of employees come and go. I learned you had to be knowledgable of company and card policies. Being able to deal with nice customers and not-so-nice customers was definitely a part of the job description as well. You wanted and needed to be able to assist your client with any questions or problems they were having."
good,Productive work environment and health aware.  Community service and charitable donations appreciated.  Work metrics and goals make you strive to increase results and optimum performance.
good,"Short term contract. This was quite possibly the most disorganised place I have ever worked. Ex military personnel at management level with no experience of the oil and gas sector nor input on projects to pass on. Not there fault one or two great characters however having an alcoholic manager was not the best, one word 'useless'"
good,"-Work Days are Challenging"
good,I really enjoyed working with G. E. Clock in get your job from workleader check work scope and go to work. Was a member of the safety and quality teams. Had a bunch of great coworkers. The management staff was young and eager to learn. Hardest part of the job was sandblasting in the hot sand house. What i learned at G.E. was how to incorperate lean process into our everday job duties. The most enjoyable part of the day visiting with coworkers on break and lunch.
good,"There is plenty of room for advancement at GE if you can survive the poor pay and long working hours, but that's mainly due to the fact that your fellow colleagues are dropping like flies and leaving plenty of holes to fill.  If you prove yourself to management, you'll be able to move around and get more responsibility very quickly.  The catch-22 here is that when you prove yourself a capable employee, they will keep piling work on your back to see how long you can withstand it.  I'm torn between liking GE as a company and disliking my role/division of GE."
good,"GE Transportatio has world class leader programs that prepare employees for what lies ahead. It also is a leader in manufacturing and technology. It is easy to get caught in the lifestyle of GE being your life, so work-life-balance is important when working with this company."
good,"Management are very professional and flexible."
good,The work was always steady and management was very good about giving constructive criticism as well as encouragement.
good,"It's used to be very busy office  for assembly/ repair computers."
good,White collar and Blue collar personnel jockey for positions as opposed to accomplishing tasks at hand.
good,"This was an enjoyable job that I would do again. The management was good when I was there and my co-workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of this job was having split days off"
good,"A typical day at work is busy.  I learned data entry, banking and reconciliations.  Management is averagely good.  My co-workers were fun to work with.  The hardest part of the job is locating payments from some 4 bank accounts which are all not controlled in Auckland.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with good and fun workmates."
good,"GE is a worldwide leader in just about everything they do. "
good,Good work environment but difficult to advance if you did not graduate from one of their leadership programs. 
good,"It's a good retirement job. Change is slow and hard to make. Management is polite, but does not budge when challenged."
good,During my time there I bacame ill and was not there very long.
good,My day generally started at 6:00am to handle the downloads for the office. I worked split shifts so I left between 11:00 and Noon. Returning at 8:00pm to 11:00pm to handle the upload for the collections departments.

good,"Just a company, nothing more. The enviornment can make or break your days. The management now is horrible and even they are under the gun constantly!"
good,"A typical day at GE was to be prepared to go...go...go. I grew up doing the very best I could. There were a lot of turn overs with management and employees. We never knew what to expect for management was very unpredictable. My co-workers for the most part where good hard working people, there for the long haul. The hardest part of my job was not really knowing about managements decisions on time spent there. Knowing I did my part by being at work everyday knowing they trusted me. After all I knocked on their door for a job and I was obligated to be there and I felt proud the day I retired for a job well done."
good,"There is no way to advance over the so called ""GE lifers"" who started life in GE and don't know any better. Mostly workaholics with no social life..."
good,"Like any large corporation, there are bad points along with the good points, but overall I believe it was above average place to work with some very good people"
good,GE was a great company but lost it's strength and direction since 2007. Nice colleagues to work with but the high level management is not as excellent.
good,"More communication with workers is needed, any situation or problem should be attended in a proper and timely manner."
good,"Used to love my job, was happy in it, then they changed my boss which wanted me to do the same job as 5 people together without the pay increase. If it weren't for that I would still be working for them. Production runs under pressure, so its not for you if you cant handle it."
good,"I had a year long contract position as a Data Entry and Analysis Specialist. The pay was low and factory hours (7a-3p). Company was fine. Office was from the 70's and not updated (kitchen=microwave in a cubicle) but other than that, nice coworkers and it was a fine place to work."
good,Opportunity to work with very skilled people. Very diversified work force.  It is nice to work for a company that has made such a huge impact in the world.
good,"when i was at ge they were developing jpax for mpls-tp protocol, the team had started to hire engineers for developing applications to communicate with multi node fibre optic systems."
good,"Indeed, this is very heavy handed. Don't do this in the future. The idea that I have to fill out a review for another company is ridiculous. Why on Earth would I be forced to do this so that I can apply to other jobs? Clearly someone missed the mark here."
good,"Fast pace but a bit unstructured. Compliance driven.  Little work life balance.   "
good,"I worked on short contract and found it a very good place to work"
good,"Mes journées chez GE sont correctes."
good,"The people I worked with where nice and friendly but the management was lacking especially with in the apprenticeship scheme, they might have improved now as it has been over 3 years since I worked there."
good,"The cooperation within the team and other teams was overall alright, even if there happen to be a hot potato/ping-pong culture which can damage such cooperation."

good,"Entreprise agréable dans l'ensemble."
good,A typical work day clock in go to work area complete task and clock out.  Things I liked about the company set work schedule and some of my co workers.  Things that I didn't like lack of good management and equipment .
good,Work life balance is difficult to maintain when designing new products. Lots of bureaucracy and formalities. Experience is highly dependent on your manager.
good,It was a good paying job with lots of overtime. Excellent management and company appreciated the workers. Downside is that I got laid off after nine months of employment.
good,It was a lot of customer-based work and a lot of focusing on accounts not being paid in-full. It kind of bored me after a while and I got a bit tired of talking and no results.
good,was working with great friends!!! Everyone felt like a big family.  Like all families we had our ups and downs but I still wanted to get up and go to work every day!
good,"•	Assisted risk management team, performed in-depth accounts analysis, monitored market trends, and reviewed and maintained legal documents."
good,"I had 10+ years in GE Capital. I grew up there. O loved it. Then it got divested, scandal after scandal, CEO after CEO and now the company I used to love seems to be gone."
good,Was a great place to work prior to the huge divestiture program and accounting mismanagement which resulted in companies devaluation. Currently trying hard to stay afloat.
good,"Decent experience, but to climb the corporate ladder required going backwards to re-start my career where I was 20 years prior.  Difficult to advance without an extended, lifetime career."
good,"It was a good experience and very"
good,"Good Leadership Direction"
good,"It is a very easy, relaxed workplace. The daily work is very repetitive line work. The quality of management varies depending on what line and building you are placed into."

good,It was a good company to work for. But due to foreign competition and some other factors they decided to close the facility in Salem at the 65 years. Just like any company they had room for improvement but overall the company with a good company I work for 4/6 and 1/2 years
good,Cool place to work steady income no problems paying for your work and able to move up in the company. Only thing is you have to go thru a temp agency to become hired.
good,The company takes goid care of its employees. They do family events have trips and provide transportation along with having dinners for the employees.
good,This was a very stressful role in a culture of constant turnover. Employees were expected to manage extreme workloads without overtime and were held accountable for results. Involuntary and voluntary turnover were very common.

good,"Good place to work with a good work life balance.  Interesting and challenging."
good,TBD - I do not have much to say about GE since it has been years since I was employee.  I do not see this as part of my overall experience it pretains to a new job
good,Long calls however helping a customer with credit inquiries as quickly as possible was something I enjoyed. Handling over 150 inbound calls daily with a smile on my face!
good,"Worked at GE Capital for a very short period of time. Overall, good people to work with. The problem was the C-Level Senior Management.  If it was 20 years ago, I would have recommended GE Capital. Currently, the company does not exist."
good,"A pesar de tener una perfecta organzización entre los departamentos, el error de general electric es conservar a los gerentes que dan falsos resultados de performance"

good,"terrible management"
good,Great workplace culture. Friendly place where everyone works together and help each other learn each individual role in the company. Recommend working there.
good,I had great trainingin within GE in my early years.   The training programs are not as abundant these days.   They are been amny company changes over the last few years including the fall of GE stock price and it's removal from the DOW.
good,GE is a decent place to work. they are very well organized and their document control is top notch. management is very knowledgable and most people are a pleasant to work with
good,"Muita pressão, muito trabalho e pouca organização empresarial e reconhecimento."
good,"a typical workday involves several meetings"
good,"The company has gone through a massive layoff at the end of  2017 and a lot of experienced people were let go. C-level management is more focused on the bottom line and the quarterly stock market reports that its people. Mid and lower employees strive to work though the re-orgs, lay offs as best they can. Most were looking over their shoulder a lot"
good,You have to know someone to advance. Job is not secure due to poor upper management. Very slow to react or change with global market and trends. Dinosaur.
good,"Aprendí en GE el rigor, la gestión de nuestros clientes internos, una gestión estricta de mi tiempo de trabajo. Pero también para no contar mis horas. Tuve la oportunidad de interactuar con personas de todas las nacionalidades, lo que me permitió mejorar mi inglés hablado y descubrir el mundo a través de las experiencias personales de todos."

good,Standard post-mba program that was going through a transition.  Learned quite a bit of leveraged finance and good training although below average compensation
good,Good company but opportunities like any company. Some leadership opportunities. Overall good company and advancement is available if you want to relocate..
good,Long hours with minimal support made the day to day stressful. Advancement opportunities were few and far between.  Employee recognition programs were in place and were moderately effetive.
good,Sad to see this once great company struggle so much and the stock price with it. When I was there they were cutting edge in all fields. Hope the infrastructure is still there to recover.
good,The factory had consistent issues between the labor union and the management. The labor unions consistently drove down production and hurt the company as a whole.
good,"Experienced with government regulations and compliance issues with specific chemicals.  Maintaining company and government safety standards involving products and equipment"
good,Good Work Environment and good people and good product machinery and average salary and like moving from on place to the other and meeting people greeting them
good,There are many opportunities with this company and the pay is very good.       Be prepared to spend many hours at work and fight for work life balance.
good,Many years ago since I worked there.  Was a great initial experience.  Solids training and on boarding.  There were cut backs many years as our department was eliminated.
good,"Company does a lot for employee as far as diversity and inclusion. Overall a good company to work for. However, to much time is spent on unnecessary micromanaging."
good,It paid the bills but the management was horrible . I liked my job and I loved the people I worked with but the hours are not for single parents  with small children
good,"Pay is average for a manufacturing business, wonderful benefits. Overtime guaranteed. Room for advancement if you're applicable. Will pay for your college intuition with the program they've got."
good,"For the time period involved pay was low but benefits were good. Great insurance and a company car. It was a typical office setting for the 70's, keep in mind we had no computers at this time in the office. A lot of manual work because of no technology at that time. We were impressed when we got a microwave in the office. Dang I'm old."
good,I really loved working at General Electric  management was very nice. it been over 10 years since i've worked there. from my knowledge the company moved to another state
good,Empresa que em deu a primeira oportunidae profissional e foi uma escola de aprendizado industrial.
good,I haven't worked here for some time so it would be unfair to pass any kind of judgement on their current situation. It was a well managed school when I was there in the early 2000's
good,"I have been working at GE full-time (More than 5 years)"
good,I was brought on weeks before the announcement of the GE Capital closure and thus have little insight. The company seemed in disarray but again this is due to the massive consolidation and layoffs happening during my tenure.
good,"Es una buena empresa, con un clima laboral muy bueno."
good,"I was responsible for monitoring the production batch jobs running on the main frame."
good,"Provided a great learning experience for introduction to PLCs and HMIs.  Also provided an introduction to the industrial environment, providing ample opportunities to develop my skills."
good,"During my career I worked with extremely talented and very smart, knowledgeable managers.  Their focus was on Product, Customers, and Business Objectives balanced to achieve success for all.  In the late stages of my career, the managers came from a pool of diversity programs with limited experience and knowledge of Product and management skills.  Very pleased to work with aircraft engines during the era that I did.  There is too much nepotism in play today."
good,"movaise gestion de l'entreprise, pas de formations précise pour le poste a pourvoir, et un movaise embiance générale"
good,"Average review, it took forever to get me a computer, I had no desk, I worked at the end of someone else's desk. Never was given any work tools. Mostly a calculator, when I used my IPhone to use the calculator app my manager was told that I was on my phone all day."
good,mostly we would build refrigerator on the assembly line. when we was down we would clean the work area around us. Also we could listen to our music as long as it wasn't loud.
good,"Good atmosphere to work, travel from hospital to hospital, a lot learning about repairing parts, you will meet good people,good fun, great future company."
good,The culture is great. Overall GE problems are taking a toll on employee morale. Growth opportunities are shrinking. Will take another year before the work scenario improves.
good,No Commnet at this time I have really enjoyed everyone I come into to contact here at GE they have a great culture and one in which you can thrive in. No complaints
good,All aspects of the work needs to change for the business in Schenectady to survive. Years of neglect and recent external environmental change has nearly destroyed this place.
good,There are many different career opportunities at General Electric. The company will post open positions within the company first before looking outside the company.
good,un poco retirado pero todo muy bien arraigado a su forma de trabajo
good,"Good company to work for. Was difficult to break into some corporate culture, mostly due to being located away from the primary team. Overall, it was a good experience."
good,Grande oportunidade de aprendizado porém mal gerenciado.
good,"Their products aren't so intersting/fun to work with unless you are an engineer, the company is well organized but their salary is not as attract as most of as big multinationals, but again always choose your manage the company doesn't really matter."

good,"Great people to work with.  Easy job duties.  Great teamwork from everyone, everyone helps without even asking.  Just an overall great place to work at."
good,"Every day I Show up to work is a busy day. the business is growing so fast and so many changes that I work on multiple projects every day. "
good,"I did not have contact with corporate and can't rate them due to lack of first hand knowledge. Prior Csuite personnel did a good job of keeping in touch with the field. Present Csuite is trying to manage out of financial issues and has not gotten ""in the weeds"" with the field yet."
good,"Sat un fro\n of a computer all day responding to inbound calls from distressed members due to inactive vehicles. Very high paced. Worked from home. Would recommend to someone looking to work from home, self contracted receiving no benefits."
good,Fast paced...could be stressful...shifts vary...have to hit certain numbers...have to overcome different variables....not always easy for work/ personal things..constantly sitting... micro manage
good,"They give a good show for what their culture and work-life balance will be, but they will make you feel bad for taking time off and you will have to pay to park to go to work."
good,"GE is a good company"
good,good middle manager spot to work with massive number of employees.  good benefits and hard work environment to be in everyday.  can be cut throat at times due to culture
good,"i worked there to only pay my bills and support my children. i worked in that that hot factory to make a living. Good pay, poor environment to work in"
good,A company that was once great is now surviving on reputation more than substance. New leadership is trying to right the ship (and shareholders hope they do) but it may be too little too late; time will tell.
good,"upper mgt not communicate with divisons  nit understand service business and lack ability to negotiate quickly "
good,very busy taking calls from customers who had store credit accounts. They used monitor how long you were on calls and going to the toilet but did pay well and had good benefits.
good,I enjoyed working at the Erie plant. I enjoyed my job. I think better job security would go a long way. No one likes feel stressed about if they will have a job after the next contract.
good,Solid company with good benefits.  Plenty of travel on the solar side of the business.  8 hour workdays for the most part with the occassional overtime here and there.
good,"great place to work"
good,"There are high expectations from employees.  However, successful employees are rewarded favorably, both with new opportunities as well as compensation."
good,"Environment can be very fun at times but also very stressful. The pay is not great.There is a lot of work but very inadequate training. You will have to learn as you go and incorporate a lot of self-training. There are a lot of volunteering opportunities and the actual benefits such as 401K, tuition reimbursement, and discounts are pretty good."
good,Good place to gain experience. Company is going through difficult times and lots of folks are stressed.  Flexible work environment.  Just like most companies it's size.
good,"Long hours and in the midst of transformation, so stability is uncertain. Many great professionals and loyal employees and most are willing to mentor."
good,"Great place to work worked here for over four year i enjoyed my time, great people to work with. The company is going through a layoff which is preventing growth in the company is why ive decided to part of ways."
good,"I added to my engineering knowledge with the technology of jet engine digital electronic controls (DECs).  The most difficult part of the position was to adhere to schedules that were decided by previous engineers years earlier, and that no time was allocated for bringing additional team members up to speed.  This created tremendous stress.  The enjoyable part of the position was to meet many friendly and helpful engineers at all levels who were great to work with."
good,Day at work     - 7 to 3:30 job
good,"Mission très courte, néanmoins intéressante. Charge de travail importante"
good,"Was able to learn about scripting and programing using Linux and Unix based programing.  Involved in networking, installed and programed servers for use by departments needing space.  Learned VMWare building servers and expanding size of servers."
good,"Shrinking  market limited opportunity.  Lip service to Continuous improvement and lean.  Many take aways, no training or advancements, not real opportunity to grow"
good,"It used to be very good place to work, however, in the last 6 years, it has been going downhill.  Metrics driven system and no value for innovation and meeting a date is more important."
good,"Here we are again with another review this company lost its government contract. So what else do you want from me again. I am trying to use this service but if I have to fill this out again, I will use another service."
good,Started out at 7;00 a.m. Manufactured all types of carbide tools. Working with blueprints and a block of steel we machined all types of carbide cutting tools. On the blueprint you would find a due date and would have to have your tool finished by that date. I enjoyed working on my own without supervisors watching over my back.
good,"A lot of arguing between shift lack of management "
good,"GE's Crotonville campus, is a place with a vibrant, great work and learning experience ethos."
good,This is a great place to work but you are constantly in fear of getting laid off and it is union controlled which is good and bad.  Good because they protect you from the man. Bad because you are a seniority number.
good,"Lots of opportunities to do many different things and plenty of opportunity for advancement.  Depending on your role, there's opportunity to work with teams around the world."
good,Good but brief experience with GE . It was a wonderful experience sharing with men of substance. Planification at this office and cooperation is the game of the day.
good,"The work was very easy just repetitive. Plugging wires all day long gets old. Also, business was decreasing showing that it was hard to find work. Most likely due to the switch to LED"
good,Internal completion for jobs and monthly results we border line unethical. Too many people at GE care more about their next promotion than they do about fellow workers and customer satisfaction.
good,"I had a great 5+ years, but then through a series of massive financial errors, the company found itself in huge trouble and had to let thousands of people go, including my whole team.  The end."
good,A work day at GE can begin as early as 6am and end as late as 11pm.  I was able to learn and grow as an independent employee as well as a team player.  Team members and peers represent a diverse culture which fosters respect and professionalism.
good,Very rewarding and fulfilling work load.  Work place culture is rewarding and upper management is very strong and will help as much as possible with delivery.
good,"Opportunity to Exceed:"
good,Great hours and benefits but the management is lacking. No upward movement within the customer service department and the director is not a great manager.
good,For a person who seeks to have access to vast amounts of information and knowledge - it is a great environment for learning.  It is fast-paced and with ever-changing-priorities.  Changing priorities may be a challenge for those who like working on long term projects.  There are a lot of very smart and driven people. It is culturally diverse.  GE does not invest smartly on any internal tool. It heavily focuses on short return initiatives.
good,Fast paced work culture.
good,"it is an ok place to work  work at , I just did not like doing the customer services , and the hours were not the hour I like , and If you need the time off, you had to do by first come first service type of system"
good,i learned almost every job on the line and it was interesting to see how refrigerators are made.i did jobs on the front line and back line. the hardest part of the job was staying awake
good,"Working this job was difficult, Being stuck at a desk for 8 hours a day answering phone calls from disgruntled and ticked off customers is hard work.."
good,"work with high level clients, make changes and recommendations, help your clients evolve and make profits, improve processes and train associates. every day a new challenge and a new task to work on"
good,The management was friendly. I had a chance to work closely with engineering and manufacturing teams and the various departments down the supply chain. Overall it was a good experience
good,"Great company facing tough times for next 2 - 3 years while going through long term strategy implementation.  Will divest several businesses and focus on 3 core businesses ... Aviation, Healthcare and Renewable Energy."
good,"Hourly production facility.  Go in and do your job, opportunity for overtime and other than hot year round it was a great place to work.   Massive layoff or I would have rather stayed.  They left when the facility closed down making $30 an hour.  Great pay and good people to work with."
good,want to search for new employment. I dont think it should be mandatory to fill these evaluations out to be able to apply for a new position. I left GE because I was an idiot. It was a great position but I was not in the right state on mind to be working there.
good,"Facility is loud but the machines are new. Very tight tolerances, worked as part of a team to manufacturer one engine component. Very competitive engineering department. Too many meetings and meetings about meetings."
good,The work environment at GE Transporration was highly stressful. The work that was accomplished was under appreciated. The health benefits were a joke. The only positive for working at GE was the pay scale and opportunity for advancement.
good,"Not much stressful , but career advancement is not much. Management tries to be transparent but mostly they are diplomatic."
good,"Not enough time or resources dedicated to quality of product. Upper management completely unaware of the wasted time induced by lower management. Cost savings is top priority, often at the expense of quality or safety, while executives receive large compensation packages & perks."
good,"Typical US style company. Would be great place to work, however due to financial issues bad days happened. Salary depends on negotiations and company condition"
good,Each person was looking over their shoulder to see who would get fired or removed on a daily basis.  This was the Healthcare market that bought and sold major Imaging assets at hospitals on a National basis.  Nobody on this team was secure going forward ever.
good,I enjoy working here. Good work and friendly/supportive team members. Nice work life balance and all festive occasions and success  are celebrated nicely.
good,This was in 08 and they do not have a location in Cedar Rapids anymore.    At the time the money was super great but i heard that was not the case in 16 when they left Cedar Rapids.   I found most people may not have been paid as well but enjoyed their new employment over there time at GE

good,Very interesting product with diverse experience.  GE is now paying for the sins of the previous management regime.  Hopefully the company will make it.
good,"The repetitive fast paced nature of assembly work was tedious , but the unorganized use of time and resources showed management's incompetence and lack of respect for their employees."
good,"Very difficult to make any meaningful change in your process. Managers are often in ""developmental"" rotations so it becomes difficult to develop relationships."
good,Although I was recently permanently laid off from this employer I am glad I had the opportunity to experience shop life and receive this pay for the 5 years I was employed.
good,Working at GE Aircraft Engines requires good knowledge in Centrifugal and Thermal Stress and vibration analysis. The upper management appreciates hard work and gives challenging assignments.

good,"Job was more call centre related, managing team that have a mixture of KPI's linked to customers service and collection of arrears. Working on projects to improve efficiency of calls"
good,GE is just like any other large company. They are very organized and good with online training. It does have the corporate mindset so you do feel small in the company.
good,Everyone else enjoys seeing this on my resume. The truth is it took forever to get hired and its a sweat-shop.  I don't think I learned anything except how to cover your butt.
good,this job with thru a temp agency and I only put data into the computer but the training that I got was not a lot because the employer was not ready for employees
good,Not much to say about it.  It absorbed a company I worked for.  We developed plug-in accounting packages that would run on mid-size and mainframe computer systems.
good,"I worked at G.E. temporarily during the summer. I didn't get the full ""GE"" experience, but from what I the employees had a good relationship with managment."
good,"I was in Field Services. It is cut-throat and very demanding. What you do is never enough, and if you bust tail - you need to do more. Very stressful and littered with poor management. Maybe its society, but this once great company is being ruined by epically bad hires."
good,Build sub-Assemble per Job order. Transaction completed units to allocated stock location. next take sub-Assembly and build toward customer configuration. Transaction WIP materials from stock locations. Deliver completed customer order to Q.C. Inspection.

good,Good company for those who wanted to accept  the challenge.Work life balance is not too much .Benefits wise good as well as office culture is good but need some work life balance
good,Lots of promotion from within. Can be a very challenging place to work. Many places require six sigma certification. High expectations of their employees.
good,i did not work for General Electric Corporate offices. I can not rate how it was there. I did not have any affiliation with the corporate offices. I did not learn anything from corporate
good,"Very challenging not for the work itself, but due to disorganization, overwork. Good people for the most part. Not so good on work/life balance. Good pay and ok benefits."

good,"Entreprise en pleine restructuration, il est très difficile de la juger en l’état actuel."
good,"Great place to work, lots of turn over and hard to move u. but overall a good place to work to get started and to get experience in a career. Its a good back up if you're in between jobs."
good,Overall good place to work with good people and good projects.  Decent management in most areas.  Workaholic culture can burn people out.  Poor pay compared to similar companies/roles.
good,"This company is a great place to learn. The work and culture is challenging, the leadership is tough, and the products delivered are awesome. Great place to learn your personal limits."
good,"A minha experiência na GE , foi de grande crescimento profissional , pois ,tive contato com uma nova cadeia de produção e um seguimento novo no mercado e pode aprender mais sobre como ser arrojado em processos complexos ."

good,Work seemed very easy as an intern and mostly related to very relaxed schedules. Projects seemed a little uninteresting and were not selected based on preference. Manager was nice and helped when needed.
good,"low advancement,     high turn over rate. inability to foster strong teams or strong leaders. looking for alternate pathways to recruit training, mentor"
good,"El trabajo en equipo muy usado, la exigencia por parte de los supervisores muy leve, en si buena empresa lastima no fue lo que me prometieron en cuestión salarial"
good,"The gas turbine market is not what it was, but the company adapts.  There is more of a focus on equipment supply transactions as opposed to extended scope projects."
good,"You will be challenged by aggressive requirements, aggressive budgets, and aggressive schedules. You will be afforded the best of tools and applications"
good,Regular manufacturing production work. Cool workplace environment. Monotonous at times. That's about all I have to say about this position. Good benefits
good,Great company to work for.  There is so much travel that it is difficult to keep up with the expenses.  Good exposure to new technology.  Good people to work with.
good,"Collecting on unsecured debt ranked against your team mates makes a hostile work environment with strict expectations. Although I did the job for 6 years it was the most unsatisfying job of my career,"
good,"Productive and fun work place . I have learnt many areas of ERP finance from this workplace , also learnt to lead the team by example rather than by command ."
good,A typical day was fast paced and focused.  I was always thinking and challenging myself to do more.  I felt good about what I could accomplish each day.
good,There are many options for work locations and areas of work. You can find multiple choices to match your skills with the various positions and interests.
good,The business began as a start-up telecommunication business and evolved into credit cards and other niche products focused on small to medium size businesses.
good,I enjoyed working at this company.  there was a buzz of excitement with producing a new product every two years getting ready for the RSNA trade show and rolling out the new product
good,A leading retailer of home electronics and appliances with a strong wholesale and distribution network in Oman . Retail outlets are limited in comparison but centrally located
good,Enjoyed my time with GE. First job out of college. Got to travel and see the world plus it was a great training and learning experience for my line of work.
good,"GE is a very challenging environment that pushes you to achieve beyond your stated goals and objectives.  There is always something to learn, pursue or confront in terms of technology."
good,Supporting local workstations printers and basic network support. I supported customers and local staff with issues. I also supported HP Palm devices.
good,Working for such a large corporation certainly has its benefits but also some considerable red tape and processes that absolutely must be followed with little regard to the actual business thus having a negative impact not only on employee morale but also on getting the job done!
good,"They are constantly shuffling folks around and cutting jobs, then turning around and creating more jobs....always looking to cut costs."
good,Clearly one of the biggest companies out there and I found it hard to make changes to processes. For anyone interested in working in a multinational it might feel the right place to be.
good,Lots of restructuring going on right now.  The power market is very volatile and GE is under pressure to be even more competitive than ever.  Lots of competition in the market place.
good,Some days busier then others. You have many opportunitys to move to different jobs in the company in all the buildings on the GE site. Managment needs to trained better
good,"I have been afforded great opportunities with GEIS. Everyone who works here has great heart for what we do, however the management skills are lacking. Many of the management moved to the position from field technicians without the proper schooling. This has hurt us overall causing unnecessary long weeks and missed deadlines. I have moved up and helped tremendously with the reporting issues catching us up from a 2 year backlog in 7 months."
good,"GE Corporate provides good learning of F& A domain, however role alignment and growth structure is quite complex.GE Corporate provided god work life balance in initial years"

good,"The workplace culture is one of constant change.  There are always projects going on to change processes and roles.  If you are not comfortable with change, this company may not be for you.  But if you are open to change and wish to make a name for yourself, it is a company where you can grow and develop.  If you are a go-getter and are aggressive, you will thrive at GE."

good,Produce produce produce results were all that mattered whether it was new business or account control meet the bottom line make the return on investment
good,I learned a lot at this company. The technical knowledge I gain was very impressive. The people not so much. everyone had their own agenda so it was hard to get things done in a timely matter.
good,Although the company was very good but the Indian management was poor. It was late in taking decisions which impacted in the business growth. They were not sure if they wanted to do business or not.

good,"When i worked there I was a temp/contract employee. Therefore, when I completed my assignment 2months early.. i had to find something else to do..The company really liked my work so they let me help the other drafters to finish there assignments. After one month, I was out of job.. they said they would call me back when there was more assignments to finish, but I found a permanent position at different company."
good,managment wasnt the greatest. overall safety comes behind production. meaning if a job has something dangerous that needs to be done inorder to complete it you are stuck doing it.
good,It was a job that fit for me at the time. Hardest part was they did not have a fulfilling budget to allow maintaining operating equipment properly.  They would just let things run until they failed.
good,"this was many entry level jobs that consisted of clerical and administrative duties. Great benefits, and the company had tuition reimbursement."
good,"Suite au déménagement à la Defense, Ge a facilité le travail à distance. Suite à l'annonce de la vente de la totalité des actifs,il a été demandé un énorme investissement de la part des salariés pour remettre les données en tant et en heure à l'acheteur."
good,it was very busy and challenging to get the work out on time.learnt about most of the products in the work shop in the 12 years i was there
good,This is a company predominantly for the leaders. Good to start your career and learn. However very little growth opportunity if you are on technical career path and the role gets redundant after mid-career level.

good,"We assembled commuter cars  and had to get them ready for the customer.  We had to drill and tap the floor to install seat pedestals.

good,GE is a good company but are way behind in the Oil and Gas market. The biggest problem I have seen working in the majority of these facilities is the lack of in-depth job training. There is not a specific person to truly take the time to give a company certified training course on company policy and procedures or how to do the job at hand.
good,"Money is good. Benefits are good.  Unfortunately,It's the most hate filled hole that I've ever been in in my life.  People actually make things up to cause other people problems."
good,G.E had a non impressive culture there production requirements were almost never met due to lack of production very poor union enviroment
good,"A typical day starts with a good cup of coffee, logging in to the system to get to work. I learned that using email to communicate with internal and external customers is a great tool in getting resolutions.   My manager relied on my ability as a fast learner, to work independent. Good friends with co-workers."
good,"Good  company is an international company. They specilise in Steam Turbine, Transport  and Health equipment. In Witbank GE is part of compamy which is building  Escom power station. Their scope of wever the job is not permanent.  Encourage  training  empowering  employees  with job skills"
good,I have been working at GE Energy Connections full-time (More than a year)I enjoy the challenging engineering work that actually makes a difference. I'm surrounded by decades of deep technical / domain knowledge to draw from and learn. I go to work and take on new responsibilities and learn more every day. I believe that the new business direction is taking steps to improve.
good,"GE money bank, is a great employer with Complementary breakfast, lunches, beverages and snacks given on occasion to keep the teams happy. Starting pay is a little to low."
good,A typical day is very high pace. Management is very poor. Co-worker are very easy to get along with. Hardest part of my job is not having management listen. Most enjoyable are the people I work with.

good,NA - Current plant is facing closure due to influx of new product (LED).  GE has been a very good place to work.
good,great and challenging place to work. recommended for learning and career advancement. Work and life balance can be challenging and certain sacrifice is expected from the employees.
good,"General Electric was a great company to work for. Like most companies, they had their problems. Usually everyday I would get up and check my call load for the day and plan my day based off of where my calls were and what category they were in for time frame. I would drive from call to call and repair customer appliances. I started this job without any knowledge in appliance repair and on the job training was provided. Management was lax to say the least. I only saw my boss maybe once every 3 months. There would also be quarterly meetings. A big hurdle to overcome was lack of communication. Usually never worked with my coworkers unless it was a 2 person helper call and those didn't happen very often. The hardest part of the job is really something I shouldn't discuss. The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom (self-management)."
good,"Hard working, nerve racking, everyone gets treated bad. Not fair to all employees. Do not go work there, especially if you are a temp. This company is full of scum."
good,Generally speaking GE is a very good company. But I don't like the GE's way to work because it makes a simple thing complicated.
good,"Extremely professional staff."
good,"Masoneilan has been bought and sold many times, but the company ""Masoneilan"" itself was a great place to work.  The reason I say ""was"", is because GE is moving the Avon facility where I am currently employed, to Jacksonville.  I will be forced into unemployment within a few months. The energy here was always amazing.  I have learned so much from all my peers, and from having the opportunity to work in different areas.  It is very rare to find a company where many employees retired after 30 to 40 years of service.  I am still giving 100% of myself to my job until the time that I will be forced to leave.  I will definitely miss my home here at Masoneilan, but I am also looking forward towards new adventures."
good,"No review.  Been too many years since I worked at a GE call center in Phoenix.  Really, I have nothing more to say."
good,"The people there are great to work with, however the oil & gas industry is very unstable and unpredictable. The site manger is a micromanager and makes it difficult to be my independent self. A typical day at work is very busy in booking meetings. Hardest part about the job is ensuring everyone is happy and juggling meeting rooms based on demand. I loved the people there."
good,"GE Energy Connections designs and deploys industry-leading technologies that turn the world on.

good,typical work day for manufacturing. some days are better than others. management didn't know the operation of the mill.
good,Industrial company with old school executive structure.  Laborers are squeezed and executives reap the benefits.  No reward without moving from position to position.  Quality work is taken for granted.
good,"more motors to dismantle . similarity how the motors are made by so many diff.manufactures. management are there when you need them.

good,"typically a good crew to work with, as far as fellow employees, but as for management and and the company as a greater entity its all about bottom line everyone and everything is expendable based on margins of gross profit. One of the biggest companies in the world because they make harsh decisions without measuring the effect on the work force only measuring the effect on the finances."
good,"This location (Schenectady) provides a unique combination. One can find a variety opportunities, training, and benefits usually found when working for a larger company while working in an environment that mirrors the culture of a small business.  Information is freely shared and cross functional teams work together to find simplified solutions that benefit one or more teams. Most individuals enjoy a work life balance that is reasonable and the upper management strives to provide a productive and rewarding work environment.  One example of this is that the regional leader has taken the time to get to know  80% to 90% of the individuals that work in the building on a first name basis. "

good,A great mid-senior manager role to learn how to run a manufacturing plant.
good,"GE Industrial Repair's Service department provided multiple facet repairs scope for a wide variety of equipment. As the electrical manager, there was a deep talent pole of technicians to oversea, with an extensive customer base. Due to GE's sheer size, and work volume, the ability to ""come up to speed"" in your given field provided a opportunity to also succeed. My most enjoyable part of the job, was the constant diversity and challenges that where presented due to the significant variety of electrical motor's and mechanical repairs that we worked on. The hardest part was that GE upper management did not adequately staff the middle management segments correctly, leading to incorrect manning issues, long days, and not being able to meet their customers needs."

good,my first contact with oil rigs and production and work with co-workers.

good,Worked day shift worked at Jarco Airfoils and that company was purchased by GE. The benefits were great.
good,"Safe workplace and love learning new things,in working with my co- worker."
good,Competitive environment to begin career. Rotational program acceleration career much faster than other post grad opportunities.
good,"GE purchased Altair several years ago, and has since attempted to turn a small/profitable inlet filtration business into a GE business."
good,Good management team - no work/life balance with below average compensation
good,Evening meeting for turn-over each day. Management and co-workers were okay at times.
good,In my short stint there I was handed a project and pretty much left on my own without guidance at some of the issues that arose. I worked though LTI Consulting Company who I think runs like any consulting company in that they drop you in and it is sink or swim. Needless to say I sank.
good,"Batching of work and distributing in to the operators to be keyed., I learned how to work with people and get the best out of them."
good,Good Learning & Work Experience - Great opportunities available.
good,Overall a very good experience. Excellent leadership & functional training and exposure to working on important projects.

good,Typical: Testing/troubleshooting

good,Nice place to work but one will not have flexibility in timings.
good,I Love
good,"As a non-manager I can say this has your typical large corporation experience. This company is large. You will immediately notice when you are lost within the help desk function. The environment is a bit cold. Everyone is rushed, expect some people to run to and from the bathroom, not that you need to. But while your ideas may be great and innovative, change takes time with this massive size, but everything is secure. There is no sway or drop in work, productivity or security. Things are always planned out and predictable."
good,"Here My primary Task is to review/QC of the drawings,"
good,"work days are good there is always work so there is no sitting around. i was trained to work on machinery such as turning and milling. i was put on safe handling course for acid and gases etc. management was the weak point as half the time the employees did not know what was going on within the company. co-workers are all very helpful and all look out for each other. the hardest part of the job was properly trying to get parts for jobs and dealing with the constant changes withing the company such as new machines, health and safety policy etc. most enjoyable part of the job was constantly working on different machines instead of being put to look after just handful of machines."
good,Worked on wind turbines and learned the ins and outs of wind turbine operations and maintenance. The most enjoyable part of the job was the constant challenge and learning of wind turbines.
good,"Great environment, great experience, great company. GE has such widely diversified interests globally that it would be hard to find an area where you couldn't fit in."
good,"Co-workers were great, management needs improvement, hardest part of job was lack of communication amongst managers."
good,"Traveled to job sites to perform any tasked required by the customers. Responsible for the task at hand along with the contractors including reports,time sheets and reports that the customer and GE gets when the job is done."
good,• worked mainly on credit card advertisements and materials for several top name brands.
good,A typical day would be skip tracing and calling and requesting payment on mortgage loans Got along well with others.
good,Global company with focus on growth. Education opportunities online. Continues to work on a work / life balance.
good,GE is all about who you know. Strict credit policy. No matter how much you networked it was difficult to navigate among the different GE businesses.
good,Generally a good place to work for an entry level position. Needs more structure and leadership to enforce pre-determined processes for daily work activities.
good,Contract position. Fairly typical bench tech job. In an older facility that had been repurposed many times.
good,"A empresa operava no ramo de administração de planos de garantia extendida; tinha uma estrutura de remuneração de parceiros extremamente onerosa e pouca autonomia local, o que conduziu a GE a optar pelo encerramento das atividades."
good,"Aprendi mucho en General Electric,hay curso de formación on line y tambien presenciales,se puede promocionar siempre que tu preparación tecnica corresponda y cumplas los objetivos."
good,Company did not reward for results. Excellnt training ground but to many up and downs.
good,"All facets of electrical distributor Warehouse, counter sales, inside sales, outside sales, Switchgear specialist"
good,i never felt a since of family or belonging but general electric does make safety a priority and thats a bonus at any company they pay well with great benefits but they generally make people feel inadequate as theyre employee the leader ship team though mostly nice never stays in one place long enough in the company to develop a work relationship with their employees it feels like theres a big gap between employee and leaders
good,"Ok company, same as most big corporations. The job is more about the corporate culture than actually doing the job."
good,The company is great to work for. I really enjoy the people I work with and for. I've learned alot and was able to grow professionally.
good,"SSE Lab GE was the state of the art Lab for Smart Grid Technology. The virtual / cloud footprint was over 12,000 servers and was cutting edge until the beggining of 2012 when the Smart Grid project was removed."
good,I enjoyed the work and hours until they layed me off bout 4 months ago I drove forklift and washed oil field parts.  I also helped out in the yard and assembled parts sometimes and used band saw to cut parts once in a while.
good,"GE was a good place if you were looking to make a career out of it ,if you like to work at a high speed then I recommend you working there if your a hard worker you will get hired on quickly"
good,I was expecting more mangers involvement in coaching rather than being treated with unfair criticism after someone reviewed 2 calls from another country. I felt as I was just a number to management rather than a person. The managers were always changing and with every manager there were different expectations required.
good,"Was hired into GE, but unit was divested.  So only had a couple of years with GE.  But it is good to say that I was hired by GE and that I received 6 Sigma training from GE.  Managers were fair and it was good while it lasted."
good,"My father was a GE employee for many years, and we were transferred almost every four years.  I was heavily influences by my father and thought his employer was great.  "
good,"This is very much a ""show activity over progress"" type of culture. Self promoters and high ego personalities do very well and are rewarded. "
good,"GE used to be better. With the change in management, company is not doing very well but corporate support and training are not bad. Work somewhere else if you can"
good,"The work is very hard labor and fast pace. It is like doing a work out all day. You can not stop you have to keep pushing yourself. pushing heavy carts back and forth, picking up 10 ib motors every 30 seconds, using heavy drills that will cause pain in your hand even after work all in 90+ heat there is no air. Only 2 10 minute breaks giving. 30 minutes OT daily is mandatory, if you want extra OT you have  to work a double shift or none at all. They definitely do not pay enough for the hard labor"
good,"GE is now a day a good company., I learned to manage people and relation with the union representatives...I always be fair with the workers at all levels."
good,"Incredibly intensive program designed to cultivate the future leaders of the company. Still a valuable development experience but not nearly as prestigious as it used to be. Recruitment numbers are low, limiting opportunities for senior members. Managers are often promoted due to accomplishments as individual contributors, not leadership abilities."
good,"GE is a hard core company very rigid in its culture. Some managers are ok others are very incompetent "
good,"travail intéressant mais service tres désorganisée"
good,"Technical projects are challenging, the company is going through many financial problems and the morale in the company is fairly low. The management is confused and the decisions taken now may affect the future."
good,"Es una empresa que cuida el balance de la vida privada/laboral, muy inclusiva pero muy dificil de crecer"
good,"Great learning culture."
good,Great place to work.  Advancement typically takes place in HOU office.  Sales Management is typically the only way to work remotely.  Compensation is fair
good,Company is trying to address near term challenges without meaningful considerations to longer term issues.  Management needs to delegate to the right people.
good,Company was a great company at one time.  No longer am I proud to say I work here.  It is sad to say the least.  Moral is at the lowest point it has ever been
good,"Nonostatnte il contenuto tecnologico della produzione del sito, le scelte manageriali legate agli investimenti quotidiani e sul medio lungo periodo sono pressochè inesistenti, nonostante si paventi anno con anno un netto miglioramento dei flussi di cassa necessari per pianificare nuovi progetti e/o impianti, di fatto la situazione tende ad essere sempre più sfavorevole, oltre ad una riduzione dell'organico, si sono ridotti drasticamente anche gli OPEX per le manutenzioni a partire dal 2017/2018, con una ulteriore riduzione per il budget 2019"
good,Big challenges and rewarding work but must be a self starter. Be prepared to handle others workloads so that you can succeed in delivering your assignments and goals.
good,"Typical day at work was very full of calls, emails and meetings."
good,"It was an ok place to work. Just poor management who spoke to employees as if they were children. Overtime was never known until late in the shift, so if you had plans you better had cancelled them."
good,"International big company, a good platform to apply professional knowledge and get hands on experience. Wide exposure to different ERP system and different business lines."
good,"Many changes in the past year has made the old GE culture obsolete. Entire divisions are shutting down and there is a lot of uncertainty, but overall a great place to work."
good,"Competitive, face paced production. bad communication between the engineering department and the manufacturing floor, no one quite knew what was going on."
good,"The internship was enjoyable. It was very laid back, but the work was not rewarding. I met some very good friends who I still talk to and working in an old manufacturing facility felt like a time machine."
good,"Heavy phone work, 50-70 inbound calls per day per agent. "
good,"Working at GE is very challenging in many ways. The challenges help me to learn new things, and give me the opportunity to help the company grow. The benefits are good and the pay is decent."
good,Sold division and job security was uncertain. Overall work was good but people was hardest to work with. Needs improvement in many areas just not the people.
good,"I've been with different sections of GE and all are the same, Who you know to be able to move up. The harder you prove yourself, the more work and less credit is given to you. Upper management isn't a team player and looks out for themselves. No support from other sections of the business that you interact with to complete goals. HR has their ""untouchables""."
good,"Not bad, unlimited PTO, work from home whenever you want. Pay is somewhat mediocre compared to rest of industry and management could use a little work."
good,"Was brought on to work in a contract position for 9-12 months. Contract ended after 6. Most likely b/c of the sale to ABB"
good,"GE has been a great place to work. Sadly, it is closing it's doors.  GE went from being overwhelmed with work in 2013 when I was hired to practically nothing now. I suppose largely in part due to the sinking power industry and somewhat in part to past mistakes by upper management."
good,"During career at GE, the work environment has been been flexible in the roles that I have had to work from home and from remote offices.  The opportunity to connect and work with virtual, global teams has been rewarding."
good,I worked in a factory setting and its very stressful and the elements with the climate will bury you if you are not in shape. They don't close down because of extreme heat and I experienced a heat stroke because of the elements.
good,Good work/life balance for employees.  Fast paced environment.  Hit the door running.  Good team work place.  Clients were most difficult part of the job
good,"There's some good people in the crew, but nobody is steering the ship. They don't understand software development but claim too, they pursue  useless corporate mergers, and are really floundering without much of a product strategy or direction."
good,"I e ppla e to work , my position called for independent tasks. Ge did tend to micro manage though, cannot update since sale appliance division to haier corrp."
good,"Gung ho style management.  Very effective type A culture, but sometimes get over their ski tips a bit.  Work/life balance is not great and benefits are not what they once were."
good,Entreprise offrant un bon équilibre vie privée vie personnelle.
good,"nice easy going schedule."
good,I am hopeful that GE will return to its former greatness; if so I would consider returning to this business.  It has taught me a great deal and the people here became like a second family.
good,"Betreffend Chancen und Herausforderungen vom Feinsten das es gibt. "
good,"Good culture & people"
good,Work culture is really open which encourages one to bring new ideas/ innovation to your projects and workplace. It helps in professional & personal growth.
good,"Personally, I think GE is out of touch with the blue colour worker and too involved with airy fairy and superfluous wannabes that populate the office space."
good,Its an OK place to work but a far as advancement opportunities hard to move up in the company. I recommend this job to anyone just starting out as good foot in the door opportunity.
good,"It is better place to learn multiple things starting from hands on experience in problem solving to dealing with customers understanding domain intrinsic queries."
good,"Given the hyper about GE, ""nice"" is not a great compliment. GE has the same problems any large hierarchical organization has. Despite sincere efforts of some in the top management, the culture has been infected by the vagaries of hierarchy. In order to succeed here, you need hard work and a keen sense of political awareness."
good,"Empresa de grande porte, investe em treinamento das pessoas e busca o melhor e maiorvalor para o cliente e para a empresa"
good,"GE has been a good company.  It is going through very challenging times right now.  Overall, I have gained a lot of knowledge working for the company, but, generally, it is a fairly stressful place to work.  The hours can be long, and many weekends are worked."
good,Would recommend engineers stay away from Nuclear Industry and it is very unstable.  The industry is only viable when oil prices are high.  Industry has acquired a bad name for safety.
good,"A typical work day would involve gathering parts to build the pumps per the bom. At the work station I would put parts together with hand and air tools."
good,"O clima na empresa é muito bom, bastante familiar."
good,"management type d'une équipe de chantiers"
good,Great importunity to learn exactly what a GE salesman will sell. There is much product knowleged gained which by being there it great. I recommend any salesman to rotate through a manufacture facility.
good,"Business model; Buy a business, and hire management that have never done that job previously. Bachelor Degree is the only requirement, for management advancement. "
good,"Ge use to be a great company but the ball is going down hill quickly. Employees are jumping ship to other companies due to fear of job, the very poor management and constant strike notices. Good things use to come from GE but they have lost all hope with the management running machines inside now. Its a keep the line going regardless of the issues on the machines type deal now. They have switched their motto to "" Quantity over quality"" Point blank!"
good,It is an easy going job. Friendly environment. Long hours. Hard work when there is a boom in the oilfield. Decent pay. Ability to learn many different skills.
good,"At the time I worked at GE they went through a down-sizing, which is why I left after 8 years.   As Engineering Assistant I was challenged and felt appreciated for every effort I made,"
good,"I really enjoyed this nature of work (Field Service). I love to travel to different places because of this. "
good,overall great company to work for because they were connected to universal so employees were allowed to take their families to universal theme parks once a year which was a plus while living in Florida. the workplace was small with only 1 set of restroom facilities to share and no cafe.
good,management had to go through so many channels to solve simple issues. same problems would occur daily without a solution.benefits and pay were ok but 2 tier pay scale was highly unfair.
good,"Great company, great benefits, fair pay.  As with anywhere, management can make a break your experience.  i really enjoyed the company and 80% of the employees."
good,GE Capital had various processes for handling customer requests. My role was to improve these processes at the contact centre with the help of senior lean and six sigma practitioners.
good,work ethic differs by person - so it depends on what one makes of the opportunity when working here - being at a remote location from the main business office has its drawbacks
good,"Great working conditions, normally. Flexible hours, Unlimited permissive time off (with manager's approval). The only big drawback I found was their allowing a manager to fire someone on minor offences to cover not having to pay short term disability for a joint surgery recovery time when pre-warning was given to ensure the absence would be covered."
good,GE Capital was a good company and the salary and benefits were very competitive. Once they decided to sell the bank and focus on the verticals the morale plummeted and working there because stressful because of the redundancies cycles.
good,"Management team was good at GE.  Taught me much of what is required to be successful in the business world.  When I worked at GE I always found GE to be on the for front of the changing work place, diversity, and inclusion."
good,"fast work, hot environmental,  benefit are good, but you can have a bump any time. Some times have to work overtime without previous warning, Point of absent is ridiculous, one minute late and you get a point, no sick days."
good,Lead Benefits specialist. Great teamwork and great health and life benefits.Great work life balance and was allowed to take advantage of telecommuting
good,"I worked as a tear down laborer and took my assembly test and passed, from there i wanted to get my machinist certificate so i took classes at a trade school and passed the test them was laid off"
good,"For large corporate like GE, cost saving is a very important thing.  Cost saving is not purely a management thing, it is also a technical thing.  Does GE has enough technical accumulation there?"
good,"Wish we had more opportunities to advance, or make a bonus. Not enough recognition for the work we do and training was not helpful at all. love the people i work with but not the job."
good,Management does not clearly mention the strategy. More into documentary. Not good for freshers in information technology. Its better to join this only after gaining couple of years of experience.
good,Moderate place to work.Good working enviroment with good benefits.Salary moderate for base line workers but with good progression areas
good,"Worked at Wilmington, NC"
good,Worked as a lead vibration testing specialist at Evendale location. Work entailed continental U.S. with some international travel.
good,"This job has a great benefits package along with strong job stability. This is not a 9-5 job and can incur up to 80 per week in short bursts.I have never worked only 40 hours per week as an account manager. My co-workers are great, but management tends to have an unrealistic expectation regarding sales targets. "
good,"Exciting work environment working on state of the art technologies in many areas of materials and science.  Working on fundamental science, material modification & development, and revolutionary process inventions and improvements for future products and processes that are charging and the industrial world constantly was very fun."
good,Strong Financials but low entry level salary and constant change in management. Management needs to address morale and become more consistent in their rhetoric.
good,"If you have younger children, you will have trouble working the "
good,Manager will let you work without over managing. Benefits and wages are lower scale for what you do. Job performance not looked at as top priority when promoting from within.
good,The job and pay were great. I wished the work was more steady. I like my bosses but didn't like the tension between union and management.
good,Engine controls group is very demanding but you get to work on things you normally wouldn't get to work on in a big company. because we run so lean you get a lot of visibility for better or worse.
good,Le management n'était pas à la auteur des attente de l’entreprise.
good,"my typical day would consist of Machining punching pieces out of the metal panels making a finished product of electrical panels"
good,"co workers was great but management always changing and No clear directions.  Very demoralising. Hired for a role, but was tasked on other unrelated role."
good,GE is a good place to work at with various job opportunities within the company.  Working in a water filtration plant is quite interesting; the process of creating filters is very important to our environment where it benefits every country and culture. It is a diverse community with respectable and friendly co-workers.  The job positions at this company to perform are generally easy to understand. The company provides a work-safe environment.  You learn why and how important filters are to our environment and health.
good,GE recruits smart individuals and promotes a competitive environment that drives growth and productivity. I had great visibility in the firm and met and conversed with senior leaders in my business unit on a daily basis.
good,"GE donne des opportunités de carrière et permet facilement d’accéder à des postes de management. "
good,great place to work don't understand there hiring process clean work space great training program with a lot to offer need to take chances on the temps that's already there
good,IT was a touch place to work with the constant lay offs and the recent sale announcement.  other than that it could have been a company I stayed at for the rest of my career.
good,"G.E was an amazing company to work for, however when the ipo, and name change went public the company took a change for the worse in how information is communicated by senior management and the way employees are treated is very lack luster."
good,"Learn matrix style working, many people to report to. Good facilities, parking etc. IN general people are good and helpful."
good,"good place but going away. Its a great place and would stay, good ethics, good work life balance and good compensation, It fosters a culture where you can move and experience different areas"
good,"GE Capital has been consistently playing catch-up after their designation as a SIFI by bringing in external talent to bring the risk infrastructure up to par. Given the amount of investment required to become Fed compliant, combined with their relatively high cost of funds, the operating model has proven to not be fully efficient, and the sale of most business platforms reflects this. "
good,"Nice to work. With lots of projects and skillful people around, it is fun to work. Nice compensation too. Will recommend anyone who wants to take a career."
good,"I got knowledge on SAP Testing and even i learnt functional modules like SD, MM and FICO. Inside project we used to go for parties and outing."
good,"Learn to Operate Forklift"
good,The hardest thing to deal with is the bureaucratic nature of such a large company that is driven to meet quarterly goals for shareholders.
good,"Extremely hard working mature culture that is deeply rooted in certain work processes for many years. Culture inflexible and resistant to change / innovation. Several key management positions without adequate understanding of the customer applications and how the company's approach needs to evolve. Greater economic efficiency needed to consistently win in the market place."
good,Working there was great.  Co-workers were friendly and helpful.
good,GE is a good place to work. It provides you various opportunities to grow.
good,A little more challenging than just data entry in Argus. Team is very helpful in teaching new things to contractors. GE moves slowly in setting new people up to system and I got to shadow people for about one week.
good,"Data Analysis not much finance or accounting, regulatory is still a developing entity and combines Compliance some risk analysis and some auditing, but merely touches the surface on all three aspects."
good,"GECIS(GENPACT) is a business process outsourcing company and is a part of General Electric"
good,Empresa com uma cultura GE Way muito forte e uma gama muito grande de negócios gerando uma movimentação de pessoas/posições muito grande
good,"Great company, genuinely promotes work life balance, excellent team structure"
good,"●	Attended to and reviewed  day to day & ad hoc requests"
good,was good work for a big project as material planner and learn more about oil and gas industry
good,"General Electric is a fast-paced engineering organisation focused on delivery excellence and customer satisfaction, priding itself on addressing business problems for some of the largest organisations in the world."
good,"GE provides above average salaries and benefits.  Local management is metrics driven and must yield to corporate management, even if it means neglecting more ""common sense"" issues.  Competition can be fierce, but within the group there is an eagerness to meet challenges and satisfy the customer."
good,An interview would be a better time to explain my professional experiences at General Electric.
good,Inside and outside sales. Calling on big industrial customers. Management was out for themselves which made for a negative working environment. Learned a lot about working with buyers from major companies. great experience. Great to see my efforts get the order.
good,"Was OK for 20+ years, then increased outsourcing of design work left nothing but thankless field support for older engineers."
good,Work the assembly line making refrigerators and parts for them.
good,Work environment was very demanding and depending on what role you assume and location will dictate the amount of hours worked. You do learn alot of on the job experience with great opportunities that are available.
good,This was a challenging place to work. Needed the ability to balance multiple priorities and make quick decisions.
good,"Good Place to work, I learned lot here, it has very rich ethics and i love to work in GE"
good,Good company to work for in safety. The company was highly motivated and tried to keep us employees happy.
good,"Support manufacturing flow. Perform very detailed and involved process for routine quality jobs. Part of a small group critical to quality therefore good job security. GE has dropped previous (good) version of medical package for a lower quality one which can now be a bit frustrating at times. Enjoy customer's engineers witnessing a successful quality process campaign, knowing that their machine will be shipped soon to get them back online."
good,Productive - ongoing support - friendly work environment. Customer focused.
good,We service customers with their credit card needs and give good quality and honest service.
good,Helping internal and external customers daily and also working and helping co-workers daily. A typical day at work is moving associates around to meet daily goals and troubleshooting daily.
good,The experince was good. I enjoyed my time working there. it was just a shame it was only temporary
good,-Quick turn projects with cursory data-driven decision making.
good,My typical day at work is pump out the machine and help support the one that are already out there. I also learned that if there is a tier 1 support group over based seas it should stay there. No one want there help. But if your going to have it make them do more than resetting to the last known good configuration and pass the buck. The best and worst part of working there was the people.
good,"Flexible hours, good company with good values, good co-workers, work long hours."
good,"I have learned many tools and new technologies here,both off-shore and onshore team are very helpful, The best project manager i have ever had. Team building activities."
good,The typical day was full with challenges and projects. The coworkers are very friendly and contribute to the overall greatness of the typical work day. Overall a real world experience in the manufacturing segment.
good,it was a great learnuing experiancethis job had extensive training I loved it nd learned a
good,This is not the institution for a seasoned professional. I strongly encourage recent college grads to begin their career with this company due to its cult-like culture and dedication to GE-born employees. This is definitely a detail oriented company in each and every task and personal expertise is not appreciated here. This is a company full of youth and life that demonstrates a genuine commitment to community involvement. You are truly in control of your career and internal networking is strongly encouraged.
good,Good Benifets and pay but as non union worker supervising union workers was a high stress environment
good,"Smart people"
good,The position was a entry level position beneath my qualifications however was a good introduction from military to civilian life.  The culture is stressful  however GE does provide good benefits and advancement potential.
good,"GE was a good company to work for.  I enjoyed my job and was compensated fairly for the work I performed."
good,"Travail en open space, cohésion d'équipe, team building"
good,it a cool relaxed environment. it was fun and family friendly. i had a good time working there. hardest part of my job was staying in one place for so long of a time.
good,"During my time at General Electric, I worked as a Co-op engineering intern. The projects I was assigned were more busywork than an added value to my department. The benefits and management prospects were however very promising."
good,"Surrounded by intelligent people, most are easy to connect with and some may be a bit complicated to deal with but that's typical to any work place. I learn that employees need to adapt to changes and fast."
good,"Since this position was a Monitoring and Diagnostics position, it really did not require a university degree unless you were involved in Fuel/Air Calculations. It was more of a service position but, it is a good way for an engineer to gain more knowledge regarding turbines. This is more of an entry level position."
good,"Building locomotives is something to be proud of.  Only worked short term contract so I don't feel like I can give an extensive review, but I think it would be a good place for a career."
good,"they were unorganized, they were selling a part of the company so was probably why so much disarray. They also ended the assignment before it was scheduled."
good,Due to recent events in my life they have caused me to reconsider my location. I do not wish to leave GE if possible a lateral move would be suffice. But looking into all option better suited for my family and self.
good,Traveled a little here and there across the states. But I had to take full custody of my oldest kid at the time due to a family emergency. It was a hard job to learn on my own. Another union shop where everyone ignores you and tries to let you fail on your own. But I made it anyway. Then I had to stop traveling for my first kid's sake. I now have four kids. It's not a good job for busy parents.
good,"Poor management skills throughout the company, from direct supervisor all the way up to Hr. Discipline was handled differently in each area and inconsistent. Each area had different welding criteria and processes. Some would use gmaw,smaw,and fcaw while some only used fcaw or gmaw"
good,Was a good opportunity that I had and excelled in.  I enjoyed going to work and accomplishing the goals that were set for me that day.  I learned a lot of leadership skills.  The hardest part of my job was not being able to help all the people that needed it and couldn't because either union guidelines that prevented me in doing so or company stepping in and handling it themselves.  The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the finished product going out the door knowing that I had a part of that.
good,"process documentation and analysis"
good,"The contractor I was working for had recently won the maintenance contract. I feel they had underestimated the amount of people (management) that was necessary to operate. They were having to absorb a lot of the cost of management in the home office because of that. They relocated the original project manager and brought in one making less money, removed 3 estimators and eliminated or realigned other positions to bring their cost down. My position was absorbed by someone making less money."
good,"Was Hired with the promise of a long term a position but shortly after hire ""6 months"" GE announced the closure of manufacturing plant. Extended my personal employment with GE doing field service/ warranty work for product we built in plant, but that contract was outsourced to a 3rd party and was forced to leave GE's employment."
good,Bue a empresa con buenas prestaciones y comodidad en el área de trabajo.
good,"GE Capital is going through tough times through the reorg. My time there was fantastic and secure while it lasted."
good,I worked for GE in it's hay day. In final assembly I was part of a schedule that built over 900 locomotives in a year. That is old news now Jeff Imelt and the board of GE took one of the biggest blue chip Fortune 500 corporations in history and brought them down to a failing business. Pathetic!!!  In my 30 years of service our local UE 506 twice were the smallest business that generated more profit percentage and profit dollars than every business in the corporation. Now they are selling us. Time to get out before there is nothing left.
good,"Regimented systems with specific requirements on how they are to be completed make is comfortable to undertake your generic tasks."
good,"Fast paced work environment, multiple projects "
good,"Confianza total en el trabajador. Autogestión del trabajo, con posibilidad de trabajar desde casa si es necesario. Cultura de empresa horizontal. Directivos muy próximos. El trabajador lidera su desarrollo profesional."
good,Corporate does not care about the workers. Use them then throw them away.Great place while it lasted. Would loved to get called back but that won't happen.
good,"I work a rotating shift in the Lynn plant. While trying to adjust the hours to make the schedule easier, the managers attitude was, ""what's in it for me? "",  as if it wasn't enough to make life a little better for the employee.  Overall, they do have decent pay and benefits, and after over a decade here, I still count myself as fortunate to be employed here."
good,"Great place to work, excellent flexibility, some long days/weekends depending on role and time of year, not a secure place right now that adds stress,"
good,Company and division especially are struggling as anyone can read about in any business website.  Too bad as people are great and culture on floor had until recently been very good.
good,"The job was OK, friendly staff.  However, the hours were long and the work was tedious.  Little to no chance for advancement.  Shifts rotated from days to nights every 2 weeks."
good,"Please not this was specific to Inspection Technologies in PA..  Typically worked 10+ hours a day.  This wasn't an issue for me because I worked heavily with teams in Europe and I could see my value added.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with direct management and managing upwards.  "
good,"Will learn on the job. Given oppurtunities to be placed in learning environments, although stressful will serve the employee very well for future jobs."
good,General electric was an ok place to work the management was very friendly and helped you if needed I quit there to start work at her due to closer to home plus better pay as a temp at the time
good,"As a result of the cost pressure facing GE, the new CEO has a publicly stated objective of shrinking the size of GE Corporate. I don't believe Corp. would be hiring in the near future. But I would not recommend a job here even if you were able to find a posting."
good,It is ok but short-term environment will be intense due to restructuring. Direct management is great as they take the time to support employee growth.
good,GE is a corporate giant and Lentronics is a very small part of that corporate structure focussing on substation data control systems. Very friendly environment and the people were excellent to work with. The down side was that there was very little room for advancement or job satisfaction.
good,"The GE culture is one of constant change/evolution to improve business success.  This provided me with opportunities to evolve as well learning new skills and making new professional connections.  Constant change can also be a catalyst for stress and feelings of insecurity.  I enjoyed the flexibility in my work schedule which allowed for a great work/life balance.  Being such a large company, one did not get the feeling that corporate had much of a personal interest in its employees.  Overall, I was happy with my experience working for GE."
good,"Working at GE has been an amazing learning experience, in that you quickly become an SME (Subject Matter Expert) within 6 months on any given project/value stream. This is especially critical for younger associates who look to build their skillset tool belt. This causes its own array of issues with regard to employee stress and at times feeling as though once you feel comfortable with a job you're asked to take on a different one. Employees work long hours, nothing comparative to other functions of the business such as manufacturing, however are poorly compensated at industry lows. Typically low compensation is balanced out by an employers benefit package. Over the last several years these packages are on the decline with the exception of permissive ""unlimited"" time off. This too is a struggle however where employees are so overworked with critical projects which reduce their flexibility to take  the much deserved time off. The stability of the GE brand is also more recently in question which is causing more and more employees to abandon ship in hopes of getting ahead of a layoff and therefore job market curb which results in remaining employees gaining only more work."
good,"I love cinema and outdoor, so every time this is scheduled. Excitement and fun is on it way to reset yourself and relax with your co-workers, usually two days out of town is best."
good,"I was offered advancement and training and encouraged to further my career. Management was very supportive and the over culture was very positive."
good,Overall the experience was ok. Management never really acted like they cared or followed through on promises. Gloom and doom atmosphere and rules only applied to certain people.
good,Management and peers make it a great place to be a part of. This company stands behind their values and exceeds in every aspect. I've gained a lot of knowledge and grew in my customer service skills because of the leadership and continuous training.
good,"Les collègues sont sympathiques, il y a beaucoup d'entraide."
good,"Not a lot of mentoring to those coming into a new department.   There was some restructuring goin on (typical for GE), so it was a confusing work environment.  I liked working for GE overall through the years."
good,"Work-life balance is excellence. Like the concept of ""fastworks"" but often time it's difficult to influence the status quo. Job security is somewhat questionable with GE is currently undergoing organization changes."
good,"Company is focused on safety of nuclear plants, all of which have been in place since 30 years ago or more.  This is an important mission.  I was proud to have been a part."
good,"Nice environment, micro-management is overbearing, the salary is terrible. When starting employment with this employer, regardless of your past work experiences/years and education, another employee can make the same salary as you with a lesser work experience/years and no degree at all."
good,Good to work in an atmosphere where there is a lot of scope to learn and develop skills and to grow. Regular training programs and professional development.
good,Is a competitive place which can be both good and bad. Some good aspects are a fast pace of learning and development but the work culture can be stressful.
good,Worked with GE for 27 years and for the most part it has been a positive experience. Have enjoyed my part in the process improvement projects. Currently going through a plant closing.
good,"GE es una empresa enorme y como toda empresa de esta envergadura tiene un burocracia y lentitud en los procesos sorprendente."
good,"A great place to build your career, management is nice overall, and there are lots of perks and great pay to go along with the wonderful experience."
good,Good work-life balance as some managers offer work schedule flexibility.  Management is not consistent.  Pay is above average.  Very heavy workload.  Employee benefits are comparabel with industry standards.  Job security continues to be in question.
good,"Start a day with emails, plan you day for projects. Execute and review them. Work extends any where between 6-8 hours. Typical reviews are very informative."
good,Very family oriented for both males and females with lots of virtual job opportunities. Also great personal benefits such as vacations and sick times.
good,"high volume of work.. feels like you are a small part of big machine, a lot of work, a lot of expectations, a lot of pressure, good place to start your career, but be ready to put a lot of hours to work."
good,Great Opportunities  in the power generation industry.   Everyone wants the light to com on when you flip the switch to Job security  is never a problem.
good,"Start the day reviewing emails, respond accordingly."
good,"Good work environment with lots of learning but poor advancement opportunities due to hands off management style. "
good,"A typical day at GE involved many meetings, mostly teleconferences, with teams spread throughout North America and even Europe and Asia. It was not uncommon to have 3-5 meetings a day, every day. GE is financially focused, which explains why they have succeeded for so long, and deadline orientated. This is a company that is full throttle all day every day. The hardest part of working in GE Power is learning that rhythm."
good,can get busy during some months but a very good learning environment for fresh graduate helping in developing profound skills in design as well as manufacturing.
good,Great place to work but in many areas people are doing more and more with less. Some management need to improve style and leadership.
good,"A very rigorous program that provided skills for future job assignments. Hardest part of the job was getting management support as my program's employees, all recent college graduates learned the different aspects of the business."
good,"My experience at GE was exceptional, right up to the point they closed the factory down. Always opportunities to advance or gain more experience"
good,Se adiestra muy bien al empleado y sele delega responsabilidad
good,"Very independant way of working but huge pressure on results."
good,The hours are very enjoyable for first shift and the work seems to be getting easier for people.  Benefits seems to get worse each contract and raises are hard to come by.  Have to work overtime to make a living.
good,"nice environment, team work and good policies, Management is well structured too. My co workers were cooperative"
good,"Bra arbetsgivare, bra kollegor. Projektutveckling roligt att arbeta med"
good,"A typical day at GEHC would involve team meetings and task based work- set by managers."
good,Big company with huge possibilities and opportunities; learning everyday is part of the company's culture. Integrity. Limited responsibility.
good,"Buena"
good,"Currently I am a GE employee in Globan Operations in Budapest."
good,"Constantly changing policies and procedures in an effort to be on the cutting edge, which produces more inefficiencies than efficiency improvements. Internal spam is voluminous."
good,"To much red tape to drive change through the process. Good compensation long hours, lots of stress, little reward and empowerment. "
good,"Il mio lavoro parte da:"
good,"My job is a repetitive line work position, driving in approximately 3000 screws a day , also placing a plate at the bottom of the Dishwasher (also known as the toe kick)."
good,"Travel to/from San Francisco weekly."
good,Start time is 0600 and goes till 1430.  A typical day would be standing for long periods of time with two 10 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch each day.  Great people to work for and great fellow employees.  Plenty of red tape and politics in the company due to the union being present.  The most enjoyable time I had there is my friends and family.
good,"Company fully supports FMP analysts; however, difficult to find opportunities outside of corporate finance. Resigned company due to April 2015 sale of GE Capital."
good,"If you want to get a job that just pays ok (not great) and that you can just steadily plug away for an entire career and then retire then GE might be the place for you.  It wasn't for me though, pay was low, advancement was slow, etc."
good,Good place to work but can be much better. Interns do what interns are expected of the world over but not much help or guidance.
good,"The Job Has its pro's and con's but overall is  a satisfactory work experience , where there is  freedom to work to a certain degree, "
good,"At this company I excelled however, the collection of debt provided situations in which I was verbally assaulted on a daily basis. I learned to approach people carefully and with empathy as some clients were in financial dire straits due to a multitude of circumstances. My manger was highly satisfied with not only my performance but also my patience."
good,"Learned a lot on the simulation aspect of engineering by working on different simulation kits like ANSYS Fluent, Workbench and other design/post processing tools viz. GAMBIT, Tecplot/Ensight and Unigraphics."
good,Enjoyed the challenges of the job and the new skills learned while i was there but the management did not have good communication skills with the employees.
good,"not enough money. it was difficult to survive at those wages, however the management was very helpful and the benefits  were good"
good,"learning about Production."
good,"GE FLEET SERVICES est une entreprise avec une forte culture d'entreprise anglo-saxonne: "
good,"GE as one of the biggest and oldest Corporate Houses, is an excellent learning platform, where you get to learn industry best practices, standards and processes."
good,"GE Capital is an organization that if afforded the opportunity to work for, you will gain a wealth of knowledge, increased professional skillset and business accumen unlike any other.  Great overall learning experience and the benefits and pay is not bad either."
good,"Great opportunity to make money and great laid back, family type of environment. Poor management and sales individuals (not sales team)."
good,Assist multiple clients on daily basis with credit card account. I learned about APR on credit card account can be very high. Great co workers. Easy going management team. Most enoyable about my job is that you are awarded for a great job performed
good,"GE offer a competitive salary, outstanding benefits and the professional advantages of an environment that supports employees' development and recognizes their achievements. GE fosters an inclusive environment where employees have the opportunity to succeed and diversity is embraced as a competitive advantage in the marketplace."
good,"I have learned to work independently, being given the freedom to run my own projects. Management can do better. Too much workload for one person"
good,"A typical day would start with all the postive energy and sharing our learnings with our team members. "
good,overrall company is great to work for just dont start off with a good pay
good,"My job consist of running a low speed machine opening up documents and batching them. Attention to detail is important, and proper dating and tagging."
good,Logging on to a dialer and calling creditors. Management doors were always open. Co workers were very friendly.  The hardest part of the job was having team meetings. I prefer to do my job and go home. The most enjoyable part of my job was smoke breaks and going home.
good,I started my career in GE as a contractor through Tata Consultancy services. In GE I had the opportunity to work in their GE energy systems which made Gas Turbines. I was trained in Six Sigma philosophy.
good,"- A typical day at work: Review emails and act accordingly in responding to such matters on daily basis."
good,They treat their contractors horrible. The job itself is secure.
good,horrible team work. with out team work in a factory setting the company loses out on money and opportunities with customers.
good,The people is what makes coming to work enjoyable. It makes you feel good knowing the devices we build here are saving peoples lives everyday.
good,"A typical day at work is writing documentation and reviewing contracts. haven' really leant much that I didn't know already. Management and co-workers are not very socialable or approachable. Not able to discuss problems or speak to people. No enjoyable part of the job, if there was I would not be looking for a different job."
good,took calls from customers from the usa for walmart and sams club
good,- Flexible working time.
good,Takes a long time to go permanent. May lay you off. Does allow you to work from home when needed. Overall good projects.
good,Work load is heavy most times of the year. Must be able to work independantly.
good,"This is a place where you can disappear if you so choose. Collect your paycheck and go home. It wasn't for me; I had higher aspirations than this. Management is focused on the latest ""flavor of the day"" program/process. At the time I was there, it was Six Sigma. This has some benefits, but it didn't get the day-to-day work done."
good,GE aviation is a great place to intern full-time while still being able to attend classes at K-State. They will work with and train all new employees to work in all aspects of the company in teams and unsupervised.
good,Pas d'avis sur cette question. Je répondrai en directe.
good,Turn on laptop receive my work order drive to first stop diagnosed and repair unit. I  learn how to prioritize my stops to a have a productive day. Teamwork played a huge part of the day just in case unexpected things happen. I enjoy everything special when my inventory audits checked at 100%.
good,Pretty laid back place as long as you do your job. The pay went to market wages so you will be working next to a guy who makes 15hr more than you and complains about his job all the time. Health insurance is very expensive.  On top of the 80 a week we already it will be increasing another 15% the next 3 years. It takes way to long to top out in pay at 7 years.
good,Enjoyed working there.had chance for advancement. Edcation . Paid by the company .   There were some high safety requritment . The company demanded attention to detail. Hi
good,"Structured, slow at times, redundant work. GE Management supplies on site exercise rooms and a game room  with ping pong, video games and activities to do when on break and when needing to relieve stress."
good,"Dimensional modeling on Microsoft sql server coaching to move from java development for BI to industry standard practices.  Project was a moving target and was sent in a different direction in the two weeks prior to kiickoff, along with budget cuts that required the project to be cut very early on.  Loads of potential but the business had to put it on hold in lieu of other budgetary priorities  sadly.  Wished I was able to see it through to fruition."
good,Les rh ne sont pas forcement à l'écoute .mais le salaire est correct.
good,"Company closed do to lack of management, this company was in Peterborough for 125 years it was the flag ship for GE and it built large motors, it has gradually gone from employing 5000 employees to a couple hundred."

good,Ambiente orientato al raggiungimento dei risultati
good,"I have enjoyed my 13 years at General Electric Peterborough, all motors being custom built, I have learned something new every day. Plant closure in September 2018 has allowed me to move on and apply my skills to another company or industry as to which I look forward to."
good,"Good place, though so big it was hard to get anything done there. The hierarchy was such that it often took a long time to get through and see results. Management depended on a team, I had great managers on one team and bad or mediocre management on other teams."
good,I enjoyed working there the environment was clean and safe. plenty of paid time off and good management for the most part. most coworkers were also nice
good,Great Company to work for. Currently going through some strategic changes but still very good. The various businesses gives an opportunity for career mobility.
good,"The office in Paris is international, with pleasant people. The team is  a hard working one, and efficient. The projects are multiple and challenging. Conversion to SAP Hana should come soon which is the next big challenge."
good,Two-tier pay scale people on the old scale make double or triple what you do doing the same job and they constantly complain management is hired straight out of college almost never promoted from the floor so there's a lack of common sense in management and it can be very frustrating especially in a position were mechanical aptitude is critical of course there are no absolutes and does not apply to all of them although for the vast majority this holds true on the good side GE has pretty good benefits and a relatively laid-back working environment
good,"Getting set up in the system, processed mailed credit card forms, processed the information. They would also scan credit card forms, we would have to go into the system to make sure the information was correct.  We forward them to be processed."
good,It was actually a enjoyable job just didn't offer enough money to provide for my family in the big picture. Management was great and co-workers all were great to be around on Daily basis..
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working at General Electric Corporation and GE Capital.   Colleagues highly professional and collaboration dynamic was exceptional.
good,I like to work at ge but the most important thing is the behaviour of staff is soo good they understand our problem and always pleased us at the time of mistakes.
good,"Positives:"
good,"GE is a great company to work for, if you have found the right team and projects. If not, you are working on too many things at once or waiting on someone else before you can complete your tasks. Bureaucracy remains, and they are working hard to change the culture."
good,The culture is good at GE appliances.  Everyone does their part and try to work together for the most part.  In any work force in a plant there is good and bad in each place.  Learning to work with one another is the key part.
good,"Overall, it was a good place to work and learn both the culture at GE and the product. Received a great understanding on how the industry works and what the customers expect."
good,"GE remote work areas leave much to be desired as they are typically small offices with no extras. There are opportunities to move with the company. However, GE is going through a huge change right now."
good,"While working in GE I gained experience in development, operations, architecture, platform support of Informatica and learned many new technologies. "
good,"Great co workers,  great job culture ,great benefits, great job training in the first 5 years,unexperinced management, not enough job advancement, to much favortism."
good,"Work with lots of smart people, A lot of work is outsourced. Wide diversity of positions available in Schenectady and surrounding areas, however, global economy is hurting business."
good,"GE was very structured and process oriented.   The division I worked for was a matrix managed organization so every department had and equal say.  This was challenging because no one division really had authority.  "
good,GE is a top notch company to work for.  They offer excellent benefits and strive to take care of their employees as well as their customers.  They try to make all employees feel included in the success of the company.
good,"Great Environment! I enjoyed my team/everyone I encountered."

good,"good culture and nice people, but finance people got too much power lacking core banking competencies, remote location"

good,GE is a nice company with great benefits and career growth opportunities. The training programs are great and management is very helpful with personal growth.
good,"Broad range of credits to review across all GECC platforms including asset backed and cash flow deals.  Global portfolio offering broad geographic footprint as well.  Working with strong, credible team of risk professionals. Team was tasked to improve independent risk assessment rigor and drive continuous portfolio monitoring."
good,GE is excellent company to learn integrity.  Leadership trainings creates future Leaders.  Work/ Life balance is much better.  Compensation growth rate for technical expertise is average.  Job security is much better.  Managers are continuously running towards given targets.  Job culture is much better.
good,"Good electrical environment work in wind turbines, pitch systems, maintenance of electrical systems , generators etc"
good,"Gran empresa , con medición a corto plazo referente a resultados , nivel de riesgo muy poco para hacer negocios"
good,"I have 5 weeks in and off. I work 12 hours/day. With ge, I learned a good safety culture as safety is priority in every job. There is a good coporation between us and our management. The hardest part of my job is to k in hot season under 45 degre celsius sometimes. I enjoy myself when I hear that the unit we put together works fine and also when our company receives satisfaction report from our client."
good,A Good Place to Learn while i started working in a professional work culture
good,Absolutely wonderful place to work but little opportunity for advancement.
good,if we speak about work it is normal and not pressurized. i learned many things since it is my first work. met different peoples. management we can rate 3 star because shift timings are very suitable for women employees. HARDEST PART OF THIS JOB OS EARNING INCENTIVES COS WHEN IT COMES TO GE . IT IS INCENTIVE WITH WHICH EMPLOYEES MAKE THEIR LIFE. so being eligible for that is more hard. enjoyable part is co workers .
good,"fast work all day. busy busy, busy. all day. Watch co-worker."

good,GE was a good place to work. It was fast paced and the company itself provided a lot of internal expertise.

good,En la empresa es comoda y buenas perestaciones pero quiero superacion por que aqui n hay aumento
good,Worried about having job the next day. Other employees are great just never feel safe because of the company. Threat of company leaving is always there
good,Good company to work for. Chances to advance are plentiful. Only drawback is the 2 tier pay scale that causes new hires to make far less than the other employees causing a little bit of discontent.
good,"-long and fast paced"
good,"Great work/life balance"
good,for the job I was on it was pretty easy. enjoyed coming into work my co-workers were friendly and helpful. I would recommend checking it out if there hiring
good,Climat de travail très variable dépendant de l'équipe dans laquelle vous êtes.
good,"Provides a lot of resources and an environment in which you are on a steep learning curve and can have a high impact in a short period of time"
good,GE historically paid very well and expected extremely high performance in exchange. 60-80 hours per week were common especially if you had any real responsibility.
good,"Great Company with a really good culture. Beginning to turn into a call center dynamic. changing attendance policy for the worse. Changing bonus structure for the worse, lessening the amount you receive."
good,"GE is a fun environment to work at. There's pool, ping-pong, darts, tennis, basketball, volleyball, and corn-hole. This is probably the best place to work that considers families."
good,"Ambiente de trabalho agradável, empresa aberta a mudanças."
good,Love the benefits and pay...not very good communication with hourly employees...family oriented...must be flexible with schedule to work here...............
good,"Most new employees will start in assembly, you can move around after you gain a little seniority. Fabrication was a good place to work."
good,"I am a team player, i learnt a lot on my daily routine. The hardest part was tried to pass my experience to colleagues unfortunately they did not accepted."
good,"Could have started the reorganization of this department sooner. They have supported me most of the time for doing just that."
good,"What I did on a everyday basis was clean around the offices, the cafeterias, bathrooms, and the basement. There weren't a lot of co-workers, since I worked at night. There wasn't a hard part in the job since all I did was clean."
good,"At GE the environment is very comfortable, everyone gets along and I enjoy what I do. Everything flows good it's just hard trying to get some over time hours."
good,"Grooming my skills"
good,Assisting customers with any issues they may have in regards to their credit card accounts.
good,Bon equilibre entre la vie professionnelle et la vie personnelle

Living quaters also arranged by the company. training consultants are helpful and approachable. regular feedback from clients to ensure improved outputs from the company.
good,Aprendi muito na área admistrativa e de arquivos importantes da empresa
good,"GE is going through a difficult transformation. Employee attrition (voluntary and through HR actions) is very high. Management is very transactional and lacks a long term strategy to drive growth and investment. I think you can find better employment opportunities elsewhere, at least until the dust settles and the restructuring plan has been completely executed."
good,"This company offered one of the best benefits packages I have ever had the pleasure of signing up for. The environment was quite stressful due to the high expectation for the number of calls accepted. Quality should over ride quantity when it comes to customer service, in my opinion. Customers should receive quality resolutions instead of being rushed off of the phone so that reps can take the next call."
good,"solving customer quire is some what difficult over the phone. but the company made all the things very easy. and they will conduct some funs, cultural activity and family get together etc. my co-wokers are very jovial and helpfull"
good,"Inicio de atividades as 14:00hrs, trabalho harmônico porém com agilidade, na companhia dos demais colegas, até as 22 hrs."

good,"Out of Business, No more comments to make"
good,GE is full of great people who are amazing teammates.  Move people around too much.
good,"A typical day would be arriving on site at 7 am. Depending on the job you could be part of a team 3-10 plumbers. The work varied but was moslty piping large a.h.u. units using threaded gb, gaswelding and also using pressure crimp fittings.The hardest part was cutting and filling th gb.The most enjoyable part would be when you see your pipework coming together at the end and everything fills with no problems."
good,"Mature, low margin business. Very fast paced and difficult to meet market expectations."
good,i learned many thing is this organisation. various type of formulas in EXEL. i make a work easier and enjoy.
good,"There are so many typical days at work as every day is a new day in collection where you need to indulge yourselves with a different person so overall challanging role.Learned a lot of new things, management is good, co-workers are very cooperative as usual."
good,Hopefully management still values their employees. I know the retirement is much different then it was but their salary compensation is still well above most of their competing companies
good,The good thing about this company was it was fast paced and moved along each day.  There was an opportunity to advance and learn and the good thing was that you could get a new job without leaving the company and moving around to a new business and learn more about GE in general.
good,"All of the people that I worked with at GE Capital were smart, friendly, and willing to help. However the organization was just too bureaucratic for me - too many layers of management which made getting anything done a very slow process. The company also likes to move people around (both in terms of geographic location and job function) without much say from the employee."
good,Corporate restructuring of the group means that GE is getting out of Finance and has sold or closed down most of the businesses.
good,"its very interesting "
good,I had thought moving to the large company the job would be challenging.  I had numerous payrolls with large numbers of employees but the job was just process the payroll it did not involve everything else about payroll that I find interesting.
good,"Could Have Been Better, Longer work hours we could have got better managers but I loved the co-workers, wish we could have worked there more before it moved to another city"
good,"On a daily basis I would balance, update and correct the business customer accounts. I learned the different values of how to keep the customers satisfied in order to keep their accounts with our company. With my management skills of thinking outside of the box I maintained ways with keeping my co-workers energetic with their positions to assure with my training skills that their duties are basic and that our customers satisfaction comes first. There were no hard parts with this job and the most enjoyable parts of this job is where the monthly team outings allowed time for us to get to learn more about each other on a personal level as we builded together as one. "
good,I don't have anything bad to say abt the company.
good,While working with GE it was fun and a great learning experience. I was able to express my ideas and get feedback in order to make ideas become a realty. I made a lot of new friends and learned more then I expected. I was really looking to make GE a lifetime career company but had to relocate a few hours away from the location I was at. Tried to explain the job could be done remote but the company sadly didnt see it this way.
good,When working on the phones and can miss face to face interaction with people. I love having a good time at work while still staying productive.
good,It was a production job that required manual skills. In this work i  learned patience and cooperation with others. The atmosphere was nice and friendly.
good,My review for Business. There is a change post Ge opted to move out which is not employee friendly and business friendly for long term. Serious work is required.
good,No Stability - management constantly changed and eventually an architect without people skills was running the project; Predix was a marketing nightmare forced upon the development team to profit GE corporate versus serving customers the best solutions.  Great concept in theory but horrible implementation.
good,"Unfortunately my experience with GE has been a down spiral experience, managers do not know from left to right trying to make it instead of developing a cohesive work environment"
good,My entire professional career has been within General Electric comprised of progressive employment experiences within power generation working with great people delivering leading edge solutions for our customers.
good,Hard to get hired on if your a temp already working in the company. Like alot of places they have their favorites that can do as they please. Horrible team work alot of bullying and cliques. They seem to care more about how fast they get the product out then the quality of the product. Management doesnt care to resolve problems with employers they just sweep it under the rug.
good,"Desktop support for Alstom Power Chattanooga and satellite site located in Houston, Texas."
good,"Fast pace, always changing organizational structure. Must be able to work with Global teams; you have to always be thinking about your next role and heavily dependent on networking within the company to advance.."
good,"My employment was long ago, so I cannot comment on its current environment; however, at the time, there was no work / life balance.   GE required many hours of work at all levels."
good,I would say that its great to work with GE given the atmosphere. Learnt a lot from the managers and my colleagues. Work culture and Management are one of the best. Hardest part was parting with the company itself. Every single day was most enjoyable.
good,GE was a good company to works is just its contract with GenMed from Namibia was over because of reasons that i personally dont know. But i got alot of experience.
good,GE capital was great while it lasted. I just did not have any room to grow. After a while I have to look for another opportunity where i can grow and learn more in my field
good,"good pay and hours (Half day n Fridays) however the Cheltenham site is currently having a flat period meaning that there are few jobs on site and redundancies are a very real threat. Management skill varies as I'm sure it does elsewhere. Some managers are great, others don't seem to know what their job role is."
good,Très bonne expérience dans une multinationale americaine
good,"GE Schenectady is far from perfect, and the new Plant Manager is out of control.  He does not care about the employees at all.  He actually sends his staff in trying to catch workers not working."
good,"This company was, in my opinion, the epitome of the non-bank financial companies.  This company was a powerhouse but I knew if it was ever to be considered a bank it would shrink GECC as fast as possible, which it has but not soon enough."
good,"The typical day includes a lot of traveling, dealing with customers who are trying to balance costs and profits. Coworkers are loyal and helpful. The hardest part of the job is learning about new products. The most enjoyable thing is meeting new people and establishing professional relationship."
good,Management on site is not in charge. Employees are terrific to work with. Benefits like vacation are sub-par.
good,"Micro Management, contractors are second class employees"
good,"Steady days with mostly 40 hours per week. Some departments had mandatory overtime. All work was interesting and intense, The plant location was shut down"
good,"Great company to work. However, I did not get lucky with my manager and had no advancement whatsoever.  A lot of politics and favouritism in my local branch. A lot of employees left the company recently."
good,"Quick training, stressful and rude coworkers, harsh hours, you never know overtime and weekend hours until the week of, quick breaks, always very hot (inhumane)  but the money was okay until temps were quitting and no new temps coming in so you are overworking multiple jobs and not getting paid extra. Manager has favorites, so a lot of times one worker will be doing 3 jobs and others are barely doing one."
good,Overall this place was a wonderful place to work for. They need better communication with some of their policies to their employees. They need better managers.
good,Ensure post received was logged on the system and distributed within the team. Produced daily statistical performance reports using a management information system. Produced individual team figures detailing performance measures against preset targets.
good,When I started working there General Electric had just bought the site of Converteam and started to spend money on the site upgrading it but everyone didn't feel the site would last and General Electric had just bought the Converteam Drive design with all this unrest people kept walking around saying it will shut soon so moral was very low I left worried about this and a month later General Electric announced the site would shut at the end of that year with all work going to Berlin.
good,"Responsibilities included, management of the tax and insurance phone bank, and liaison for the Dallas Asset Managers. I enjoyed my co-workers, but I was the only female ""black"" Manager. It was literally a ""boys club"" and they were having none of me. I was treated as an out cast. Very qualified for the job as I posted for it and earned the title; but I didn't quite fit the ""profile""."
good,I loved this job but they're unfortunately letting go of all contracters due to a floor moving to Florida. Every day I walked in everyone was always in a good mood and happy to be there. They all do their job really well.
good,"No room for advancement, Co-workers are great. Benefits are good."
good,"If you are interested in Fleet Management and you want to grow in that industry, this is the company for you. You will enjoy the idea of being at a company this is considered a world leader."
good,"Poor management have been raising those past month with a lack of accountability, GE is loosing it's core value as courage and boldeness, people tend to avoid taking initiative for the compagny and try to protect their job..."
good,Good company to work for.  Excellent benefits and salary.  Good working environment.  Flexibility with schedule.  Management is approachable.  Too bad they closed.
good,"Strong global leader that invests in its employees, however, could refocus on building business leaders while minimizing large company political dynamics."
good,I worked from home and now I am looking for a more collaborative environment. I managed over 40 union technicians. I found I was spending 90% of my time on 10% of my people and the majority of the 10% were the poorer performers.
good,"I wish I could’ve gotten to stay there because I left my job at GE. I work in the security department making badges for both Contractors and employees. Some badges were remakes somewhere only because they were old and needed to be remade. In the security department there are many different  forms that you had to access and approve an order for a badge to be made, I love that I had my own space in my own office I worked with some great people and I wish the job wouldn’t have only been temporary."
good,Learn a ton there. Fast paced. The people are very committed and driven and the training that is available is next to none. Hard to watch the latest demise.
good,"Fast paced, fun people to work with. I learned how to read blueprints and BOMs. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the end product I built and having pride in that."
good,"Growth is not immediate, Management is fine, many in the operations are on contractual terms. I am one among them so the benefits which the regular employees are drawing is nt given for the same job"
good,Working for GE is hard no family time and constantly work weekends and holidays. Management is not listening to lower employees concerns and issues. GE should stick to trains and planes.
good,"Too top-heavy of a company, Always looking to save money by keeping the government in their back pocket. The union brothers and sisters took great pride in building locomotive and mining equipment. The company likes to do what they want to, and make their employees feel like garbage as they do so."
good,"Great Company, but nothing is definite. Capital division for reinsurance has no real room for growth. Salary increases very low and pay ok, but on the low end for this type of job."
good,"During my time at GE, I enjoyed my coworkers and the money. Depending on the job, it could be very physicalm and I like to be active at work."
good,"Coordinare le attività di 4 responsabili di operations in Francia, Italia, Spagna e Portogallo a traverso principalmente delle conference calls e tramite la gestione delle metriche KPI principali."
good,Good place to work. unfortunatly there was no real chance of progressing with a full time contract. The factory is run well and all the staff are very friendly
good,I enjoy working at GE Capital retail Bank because I enjoy helping other. I take spanish inbound calls assisting clients with their change of addres of taking their payment or with the balance on their accounts .
good,Strong firm that will provide long-term career stability.
good,"Every day was a challenging day."
good,You will be temp and 80% of that time you will stay that way. Alot of job movement.
good,Nice place to work very corporate place to work your a number not a person.
good,Can't make enough money there they don't pay enough money to make it there.
good,Great work opportunity in a large company that offered exposure to multiple aspects of the business. The work environment provided the ability for professional growth through individual and team based assignments.
good,Ge was a great experience. When I worked there I had a lot of fun and met a lot of great people. I fell through the cracks so to speak when I left GE due to health issues.
good,The company is in serious financial trouble.  Google it.  They are not sure yet how to get out of it.  A lot of layoffs have happened but that hasn't solved their problem.  Not sure what's next.
good,Sometimes I get told I don't have to come in cause things are slow and he always tell me  to start the next day and then I will be able to work but never shows up
good,"Identify project revenue and costs on EF&I projects, analyze variances & reconcile production reports to actual data."
good,"I loved working for GE, unfortunately my division was sold."
good,"I really like my work, I help my colleagues and I look for the safest way for them to do their work, the way you get to your work the same way you go back home. Sometimes it is very stressful and frustrating to work so much and not have the correct compensation. GE is a very good company in some things and in others not so good."
good,"No muy objetivo la forma de evaluacion, la cultura del amiguismo, deja mucho que desear."
good,Worked with wonderful people for many years until I lost my job to restructuring.  Very innovative and creative people.  Always looking to improve and be the best.
good,Good company to work with. Good environment. good system. I learned how to work alongside people more knowledgeable than myself.
good,"Before GE acquired it.....Masoneilan"
good,Nada sujeito a críticas. Não tivemos contato com a alta administração.
good,"Great company and great people."
good,No comment at this time. I have signed a confidentiality agreement that precludes me from making these sorts of statements.
good,I have applied and tuned my six sigma knowledge here with lot of seniors. Learnt about how to take corrective actions and do the analysis of First pass Yield and Quality defects.
good,High pace environment with allot of red tape. Development and personal growth is left up to the individual. Number driven environment with long hours and high demand. This is to be expected as they are a global company.
good,"answer in bound calls,from  merchants,see if clients qualified for accounts co workers very nice. supervisors very nice"
good,"Good team environment. Varied duties during the work day."
good,"Typical day was to wake up and go to companies requiring my services. Documenting hours, allocating budgets resources, and conducting electrical work. I was my own manager** Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the demand."
good,"General Electric è una realtà molto dinamica ed internazionale, questo fa si che le giornate lavorative siano molto stimolanti, diverse e piene di nuove sfide. La lingua inglese è molto utilizzata e hai modo di interfacciarti con persone di tutto il mondo. Questo aspetto determina grande apertura mentale sia a livello professionale che personale."
good,"La mia giornata passava tra telefonate ricevimento clienti e supporto ai vari uffici. Ho fatto diversi corsi d'inglese. L'ambiente era bello e stimolante e buono il rapporto tra colleghi."
good,"Learned some things, But GE has a reputation of working it's employees very hard with extreme hours"
good,"A typical day at GE first consisted of finding out my assignment for the night and gathering any necessary tools to get the job done. Second, I would check over my work area and set my machine.  After that I would weld everything the job called for.  Fitting up small parts and reading the blueprint were the next step.  Double check all of my welds, measurements, part locations, and all work.  At that point I would call for an inspector to inspect that sequence of the job. Lastly,I would clean up and set up for the next assignment."
good,Corporate shutdown the site I was working at. I was with this company for 5 years and miss working with my co-works who made the work fun.
good,Learned a lot about new products and what goes into taking a product to market. Great experience.
good,"GE Money is a good place to work. If you are willing to put the work in, then they are willing to do the same. They have a number of management  and other courses for their employees to attend to help aid their progression."
good,I loved working with people. My job involved talking to different people to learn how they did their jobs and then being able to take that information and being able to transfer that to a written training manual. Also needed to take that information and be able to create a test for new emploiyees learning the job.
good,"Panfletagem em lugares plublicos e privados, agendamento de visita,aprendi ser uma pessoa pro ativa pois a empresa sempre nos permitiu expor nossas ideias,gerencia agradavel e regrada, nossa equipe era como uma segunda familia tinha muita facilidade de convivencia diaria, o mais complicado era visita sem veiculo muito sacrificande perde-se muito tempo,valorizaçao de metas atingidas com premeaçoes e comissoes."
good,"very friendly coworkers,understanding management. Typical day at work was running forklift for supplies to wire operators, filling transformers with sand and heat treating, laid off due to strike,not enough time to keep job."
good,"os meus colegas de trabalho são otimos ,a parte mais difícil foi a gerencia mal estruida"
good,The place is a typical male oriented operation around servicing electronic equipement. Day in and Day out.
good,"Typical day consisted of showing up, being complained at for trouble with the IT dept repairing trailers arguing with management and going home..."
good,"Overall I liked Working for G.E. Wind but, I was hired thru a temp service for only a year contract//"
good,• Conducting Health & Safety reviews for research operations and follow up of corrective / preventive actions to minimise the risk potential in the operation
good,"A typical day at work is to support the Air Data Test Sets by building assemblies and subassemblies.I also test and troubleshooting ADTS.I learned about pressure and the internal parts of these units.I work well in communications on what the management want when they want it. The hardest part off the job is in the beginning,learning the specifics.The most enjoyable about the job is the teamwork.We all work together to achieve our goals. My co-workers were outstanding. I worked as a temp."
good,As with any new location it was a mess. coworkers were very easy going and dedicated.
good,"Parfois environnement de travail trés hiérarchique."
good,work for contract company not for GE. don't know what you need me to say. not going to bad mouth a company. I like working there but pay is the reason I need to look elsewhere
good,"I was only a temp employee so therefor I am not able to comment on any perks or benefits as they did not apply to me. It was a very flexible place to work, supervisor was very fair and understanding of work and home balance. I definitely would accept a permanent position if offered."
good,"When I was there GE Capital has started planning to sell its portfolio and close for new business, I was a victim of this activity and chose to leave in good time."
good,"typical american company where it is the best place to work when results are green. "
good,GE was great but unfortunately their vision can sometimes be blurry.  We could never tell when the next move would be made and who would be affected..
good,"Challenging job due to lack of formal procedures for software testing"
good,GE Capital was dissolved in 2014. My position with the firm as well as 3K others were either initially eliminated or moved to India for out sourcing. The firm doesn't exist anymnore
good,"The sensing division was relatively new so there was a lot of ambiguity in my position.  The systems were unsupported which led to issues and a high level of self-reliance.  However, it was on the cutting edge of technology and cooperation between engineering, operations and finance was necessary and rewarding."
good,"Was one of my early jobs, and learned a lot while I was there.   Had a decent work life balance.   Management was highly skilled and intelligent, but basically was a good ole boy environment and cliquish.   Lots of back stabbing and poor management techniques.  Frequent yelling or derogatory remarks in meetings."
good,Not really a place to grow. Too much turn over and lack of training.  Very unorganized. It would be a lot better if they invested more time in property training their employees to stay.
good,"Fast paced environment with ability to work OT if desired. Normal shifts are 8 hours long, 2 small breaks and lunch paid. Great Family Day activities. Competitive pay, but there are many that are paid on the ""old pay scale"", have stayed in one general job and earn more than an employee with knowledge and experience in multiple areas. First shift jobs are awarded by seniority."
good,"I worked 20 years for  this company. the pay is ok and they provides good benefit.  I ran and learn a lot of different machines.  I operated cnc machines, train new operators, work in the inspection department and operate CMM machines."
good,"Supervisors need more training with the employees. Felt like the manager did not care about the employees, did nothing to raise sprits of the people. Felt like you are being watched all day by management."
good,"Great benefits, solid pay, hard to advance in some areas.  Too many layers of management.  Vision changes occur too often so your goals tend to always be changing."
good,"A empresa apresenta bom ambiente corporativo porém limita promoções e aumentos salariais, o que a deixa fraca perante a concorrência."
good,Demanding and challenging job where I had input in the work that I did and how I did it..  My favorite part of the job was the quality people that worked there and the collaboration that we did to get work done.  My least favorite part was the amount of work I had to do.  I had little time for any work life balance as I worked 60-70 hours per week and took my turn on call.
good,I worked at this job 20 years ago.  All I remember was it was good job to have.  I did well there.  I reviewed customer orders and also customer support.
good,"Great company, and good strategy.  Healthcare business growth had an impressive run since I worked there.  Not the start up culture obviously, but great benefits"
good,"Environnement de travail très agréable, gestion du temps."
good,"Very good working culture prevails there but the only problem is that they usually make freshers to sit idly in the office and the management doesnt look out for the solution of the mentioned problem, otherthan this its a world class place to work."
good,"Great job, one of my favorite. The job itself wasn't bad at all, it was very stressful at times. I learned a lot on the job not just about welding but how what I'm welding works."
good,"I was a mechanic at the Circleville lamp plant. I was involved in the production of  fluorescent lamps. LED's and the EPA pushed out the product we were making, resulting in our plant closing."
good,"The good thing is that, you'd definitely grow when you work there, all you need do is focus and concentrate because you work with less supervision. I learnt a lot while working with GE."
good,Its a assembly line plant and the shifts are straight first shift or second or third. Its clean for a plant but some parts are very hot and vey noisy. same thing over and over again
good,"- Great place to learn and grow."
good,Large company - You chart your career. You must be on top of your career management else you will be left behind. No Job security here. Always be on the lookout for the next post culture.
good,GE is a very large global business with a solid band in the market place.  The people are very collaborative ... you will work hard and play hard.  You have a lot of opportunities but you will have to be willing to sacrifice a lot as well.
good,Good workplace and but not much career development. Salary could be better. Benefits are good and lots of extra curricular activities.
good,"I really did enjoy working here while I was employed. I gained many skills and meet many different people while working here. Working you you learn to be versatile, "
good,The company is always busy and you get to talk to new customers everyday. Management is easy to talk too. I learned that I work well under pressure and enjoyable part is when they let you to be innovative.
good,"i worked on an assembly line, it was a wonderful job at the beginning and then as you worked longer and longer the more people, at GE, they became more into stabbing you in the back as to helping you out. the more they could pull out of you the more they ran there mouths and put you down, it was never good enough, you could never make them happy."
good,"Many great opportunities for those willing to relocate to Atlanta"
good,"A typical day would involve a morning meeting with colleagues in other offices, to discuss open items and determine follow-up actions. Then the afternoon would be spent in the lab performing testing."
good,"Leadership program candidates (graduates and experienced) get promoted regardless of their abilities.Negotiate high on the way in!"
good,"Wish I could still work here. Lack of management, poor leadership,under selling product lead to my job loss. Hired 200 people in one year, then closed plant."
good,"As I said an o.k. place to work.  Most of my co-workers were fun to work with and we made a good team.  However, others were lazy, just wanted a pay check for the least amount of effort. Not a good situation.  It was a Union shop and that was a big part of the problem."
good,"Very busy but very challenging. Change in management destroyed the place. While I always received very good reviews, I hated the process - used forced ranking of A-C and 1-3 to see how you did. Only 10% could be an A1 and 10% had to be a C3 (asked to go). "
good,"During the program, I got to go back to school for Engineering. Learning all the gauges to measure with, designing machines and product, and being able to see a product from start to finish was a experience. GE is their own world."
good,"Working for GE Capital has been a great experience, but it has been recently announced that they are selling off most of the business."
good,"We were attempting to provide requirements management to a new reactor design project.  It was proceeding through very tight and restrictive process controls.  Budgeting may be the problem as the program scope is ponderous, but the management tools are not well utilized when looking forward to future milestones."
good,"I would call customers on the phone to collect overdue payments, or past due payments, and recording  it on the computer and organizing customer files"
good,"Great Company to work for. Great management and good working culture.GE allowed me to multitask and manage multiple assignments, always meeting deadlines. My ability to focus and efficiently manage my time enabled me to work independently without distraction and at an even pace. Now that I am not dedicated to a full-time position, I plan to devote myself to one project at a time, allowing me to be flexible and available to my clients."
good,Work and Life is not balanced. GE does offer many opportunities for growth and development. There is a large turnover in management that that can and does effect work flow.
good,I have held a number of roles at GE Capital and it has given me the opportunity to really expand my horizons and grow professionally and personally.
good,"Day starts with finding out what is to be set up and ran, then finding the proper tools. Then uploading program and adjusting work cordinance,,Feed ,speed, and Offsets. Then Loading Parts and indicating part in. you have allowable setup and run time to get operation completed. This goes on until end of shift or hot parts are completed, depending on Management."
good,Tour the plant looking for problems. Check with supervisor for any work orders if no orders start PM program. PM program consist of checking fluids in all machines.

good,Very fun job good hours I enjoyed the job but it was temporary
good,At General Electric I was a customer service rep. There I was take inbound calls from customers who either wanted to schedule appointments for service repair or who had and issue with the pursing of a General Electric appliance. All of my call were monitored and audited to ensure speedy and effective work. There wasn't anything hard about this job at all. The office where I worked was full of energetic employees whom I had no problem working as a team with.
good,I manage up to 40 employees daily and this has greatly enhanced my leadership skills.
good,I was at GE for 28 years and they were very good to me right up to the end . Great people all performer.  I had many positions and move often which I enjoyed. Not for someone that is looking to ave a life outside of work.

good,"Nice environment to work in . Good exposure. Learn a lot from helping professionals."
good,"The hours, work and pay were reasonable and I enjoyed the interaction with contacts in France and England to review BS and PL analysis.  There were a lot of different processes to learn that I hadn't previously encountered, so I was able to improve my overall skill set."
good,"I worked for GE Oil & Gas not GE Corporate, therefore not able to evaluate GE Corporate as an employee. I had interactions with GE Corporate staff who shared a positive workplace culture but a unstable financial environment for GE."
good,"Had the unfortunate experience of being the only female and was treated extremely poorly as a result."

good,"In the General Electric company in Budapest, there is a really good atmosphere in the office. You can get to know many people from all around the world."
good,"In the field engineering apprentice position, you have to be willing to change your schedule on a whim. Flexibility is key in order to enjoy your job here.

good,"The best part of the job was the direct manager.  He treated his team with respect and did things to make us feel appreciated. He was always fair.  If the job would have been salaried and a few more dollars, I wouldn't have left."
good,focusing on the day to day is not sufficient to drive your career. always look at the bigger picture. Always have to be assertive with management and fight for what you want
good,Nice company to work. Work culture is Ok.Easy access to your managers.Good knowledge sharing and very good team support. But job security is bit issue because of recent business issues.

good,"GE is a fantastic company!  They acquired the company I was working at the end of 2015 and in the last two years I've been with GE I have never in my 20 year work career seen so many changes happen in such a short time.   I suppose this pace is not for everyone but I love it.  You have to be adaptable and flexible, GE will stretch your responsibilities but the culture is one of team work and helping one another. The HR policies are innovative and forward thinking, such as the permissive time off approach for all professionals. Benefits are good, although not as good as they once were. The work life balance could be better."
good,"I enjoyed working at GE Power. The management was good, work environment was good, and there was lots of teamwork to resolve issues."

good,Good colleagues.  Direct management was stifling.  Stressful environment during the sale of GE Capital Financial Divisions.  Call center is busy and fast paced.

good,"GE es una empresa con un gran prestigio, tiene muy buenos beneficiosos y un muy buen ambiente de trabajo, pero le juega en contra que no tiene una estrategia clara que la hace ser demasiado cambiante. Los cambios en cuanto a adquisiciones y venta de áreas, hacen que todo el mundo viva con la incertidumbre de la estabilidad y continuamente buscando postular a nuevos puestos internos que puedan parecer más prometedores o con mayor proyección, al menos momentánea."
good,"Reconciliation of accounts by re-applying the misdirected payments."
good,"great place to work with excellent wages and benefits, however layoffs are a common occurrence so therefore job security is quite bad. the job is difficult but interesting and challenging. great group of co-workers."

good,"First time in 30 years that I was completely autonomous, and treated like an adult. A rewarding experience. Flexible hours. Specific information is difficult to obtain. Repairs on equipment or obtaining software is counterintuitive and communications and feedback from would be sources is vague and cryptic. Sometimes the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. otherwise it was the best job I've ever had. some of the very finest minds and professionals that I have ever worked with."
good,"GE is a good place to work. However, this does vary quite a bit depending on the office location and department (from overall atmosphere to hours to flex-hours etc.)."
good,Place where I started my work in the BPO field. Very process oriented. Good place for everyone to start their careers. Since they will learn discipline and process adherence.
good,"did this before and this continues to ask for each job, Fix this going forward as it is a waste of time and cumbersome especially when a resume has multiple positions with the same company,"
good,Management is a little behind in thinking and still stuck in a command and control mindset and not moving towards empowerment.  Advancement is difficult as few opportunities arise.
good,Overall Good company to work for. The overall feeling and attitude in the company is good. Communication and supervision in the company can be improved.
good,if your ok with factory work its a pretty good job to have the pay and the benefits are pretty good and there is ample time off for holidays..............................................................

good,"Good place to work, good benefits. Good pay. Great people to work with. Enjoy working here because not doing the same thing everyday in maintenance, one day you will be running a group and the next you will be doing PM on it."
good,"Good place for learning and growth. An Ethical organization with strong HR and driven by strict implementation of policies."
good,"GE really gives you great learning. During my tenure there was forced ranking which made every day highly competitive. Even friends needed to compete with each other, which was not a great feeling. After I joined a European company, I felt I missed all the learning. Best place to learn management."
good,just sorting and inspecting materials at the warehouse before the items are sent to the main building to sell to the current customers. great if your self motivated
good,"GE has a brand so it's feel good to work there. Some managers are far better than others , especially those who are not graduates of the various GE's leadership programs"
good,"GE is a company where there are opportunities to advance and grow.  It is so large that you can talk to some people who love it and others who hate it.  It is important to get into a business or technology area where your expertise is valued.  Like most large companies, management decisions are made 90 days at a time (end of quarter) with very little future planning.  This can become frustrating if you let it.  Most of us have learned to live with it and fight another quarter."
good,"collaboration abound at GE.  Managers often change, and never become subject matter experts.  push for collaboration to fill the gaps of management changes and lack of in depth knowledge.  cover key relationships with multiple angles versus deep relationships throughout customer base."

good,"I worked as a contract employee for GE-Aviation in Grand Rapids, MI in the Environmental Testing Lab. I and my one co-worker supported Production and all of Engineering. Our nights-shift co-worker seldom showed up for work, so it was basically myself and one other worker. We functional tested all Production LRUs, and ran Engineering prototypes pre-production units as necessary. We provided all documentation daily."
good,"The work of repair technology with GEincluding all Latin America and quoted of jobs deal with all kind of customers solving issues with the units."
good,"Pese el gran volumen de trabajo, el buen ambiente de trabajo con compañeros y superiores, y la probabilidad de alcanzar los objetivos marcados, hacían que no importara demasiado el exceso de numero de horas."
good,willing to teach and train.  Family friendly. wish would have been able to stay longer to advance in my career. they closed their mortgage division.

good,"My working environment was hectic, but a good group of co-workers."
good,I started working here right out of college and couldn't be more grateful to have been giving the opportunity.

good,Great team to work with.  Daily challenges in a quick paced environment.  Most difficult part of job is advancement opportunities.
good,"Very good professional training and opportunity for learning."
good,"Ethics and work procedure, especially with FCPA in place is highly respected. Friendly environment, but things are done differently in relative to the parent home office; which I think is not good practice for  global company. "
good,"Great culture and executive leadership. Different than many GE companies in respect to size of office (small), culture (better work/life balance), and bureaucratic (its not)."
good,"I am able to attend training, learn  daily, get to know the other employees.  Open door policy. Great work life balance. Friendly employee. Work is not consistent but can often times be busy and allow great overtime hours."
good,"Many resources at your disposal, varied work hours, high output is rewarded. Prepare to work holidays, weekends and vacation."
good,"GE workflow never stops even when production is minimized due to lack of containers being brought to the warehouse, however, work experience with GE personnel proves to be educational and challenging which is a very good thing."
good,"Travail très fatigant, plus de 2h30 de route par jour avec des journées de 10 heures mais belle expérience"
good,Its a good place to work however employee are not getting opportunity for their developement and growth. Employess can not value added their skills in this company.
good,"Fast pasted learned a lot about jet engines, management very supportive, co-working care about what they what they were doing. the hardest part was the long hours.  the most enjoyable part was being a part of something so important."
good,"The best part of the job was Senior Management wasn't too concerned about getting to work on time or impose a typical 9-5 regimen. As long as we could finish our tasks on time and could deliver, work timings were fairly flexible, with even the option to work remotely. "
good,"Good place to work for. They do give out free lunch and things like that. Depending on who's your manager, you can get away with some of the rules."
good,This internship was not the best experience. My favorite part about the internship was being an Social Ambassador. I was able to interact with everyone participating in an internship program at this location.
good,"There are many great aspects to working in the field sales roles in GE's Appliance division.  Unfortunately, the current work environment suffers because of a pending sale of the division to Electrolux."

good,Great training ground for starting your career especially helpful in developing management and leadership skills.Work on meaningful projects that can be leveraged across company. Lacking in work/life balance.

good,I enjoyed being a part of GE appliances. You will learn a lot than your expectations. you will get good appreciations for your achievements.
good,"Great company to work for, highly reputatable and well-recognized in the industrial and energy space.   Strong ethics and hard-working culture, high quality coworkers and management team, you will sure to learn a lot there.  The downsides are: 1) big company takes time to reach concensus and take actions, slow and go through verious levels of reviews; 2) constant restructuring and re-org; 3) in the process to shrinking their capital business"
good,"Professioneel bedrijf met met goede arbeidsvoorwaarden, gezellige collega's, afwisselende werkzaamheden!"
good,"A wonderful place to work, albeit a times a stressful time. Loves to promote within and is mostly based on meritocracy. Long hours are cyclical and not often the case. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with. Great people and very hardworking."
good,Working here i learned how to learn new job skills daily and doing so adequately enough to keep the line moving. You have to have people skills in order to get the parts you need in enough time. The management was not a daily part of the job.
good,Het bedrijf zeer internationaal. Je kunt daar zeker ver komen. Je moet wel zelfstandig kunnen werken en willen. Ik heb daar veel geleerd.
good,"Complicated Rules and Policy"
good,A typical day at work involves multi tasking and a watchful eye on suspicious activity.  I have learned a great deal about the inner workings of an online bank.  I enjoy the management as well as my co-workers.  The most challenging part is the ever changing procedures and keeping up with the most recent changes.  The most rewarding part of the job is that it is not doing the same thing over and over.
good,"Everyone for the most part is nice and willing to help. Culture, other than 1-3 businesses, is stale, so you need to go out of your way to enjoy your job. Overall good pay, and decent benefits."
good,"Foi nessa empresa que comecei a trabalhar, então toda a minha formação como profissional devo a ela, entrei com 17 ano na área de Recursos Humanos e minha principal atividade era a integração de novos funcionários, meu compromisso nessa situação era comigo, com os palestrantes e principalmente com os novos funcionários, aprendi muito, adorava trabalhar diretamente com os colaboradores, conhecia todos da empresa, era um prazer imenso poder ajudar cada um, nessa mesma empresa tive a oportunidade de me tornar estagiária e trabalhar com eventos ligados a responsabilidade social, foi um marco no meu lado profissional, além de ter escolhido o meu curso e ter entrado na faculdade, o contato que tive com a sociedade através do voluntariado, me fez crescer e muito!"
good,"Typical work day was having morning meetings after that, start unloading trucks using a line belt, check to make sure all orfers are correct. take a break, come back and check out a cherry picker, to move received orders to their designated location."
good,"GE zeichnet sich vor allem durch eine ausgeprägte Leadershipkultur, ein innovationsfreundliches Arbeitsklima und ein multikulturelles Arbeitsumfeld aus."
good,Overall a good place to work and much experience gained during my 8 years and 8 months there working in a variety of departments.

good,A typical day working directly with the North American installation VP and Central Region field service director.  I provided detailed analysis and communication of the area results to make sound business decisions.   I worked on short and long range forecast for effective management and communication with corporate leadership.  Managed a team of site accountants and conducted reviews of work performance.  I enjoyed becoming a business partner with senior leadership to help guide the organization.   The hardest part of the job was balancing the work of local leadership and remote corporate expectations.
good,Challenging cross-function and dynamic work environment.
good,"4 six month rotations that were centered on supply chain, operations management, personnel management and engineering. Each role provided a unique experience and perspective on operations and impact to financials.

good,"assignment rebuild bearing/fast pace, demanding,helpful ,"
good,"Excellent company to work for, great learning experience."
good,"A typical day at GE for me was working on different projects with my coworkers. AT GE I learned how to collaborate with different people and different personalities. However, GE is like an entrepreneurial business. So GE's business style is very independent but dependent at the same time. For example, at GE your manager might assign you a project that you don't know how to complete. It would be your responsibility to figure out how to successfully complete the project. However, you will collaborate with a team of people to correctly finish the project. I think the hardest part of my position was actually capturing how the company worked. Once I figured out the company's work style I became more successful. The most enjoyable part of my job was understanding the GE industry."
good,"Loved the Hours, and the people where nice. Great room for advancement."
good,I was an intern in GE Lighting and the colleagues were generally uneducated experienced people.

good,"although i was a contractor, it all and all was a great place to work."
good,I enjoyed my time in GE Money. I gained excellent experience working with the Finance team and had a very hands on involvement in all my projects with them.
good,"Co-Workers is good,"
good,At GE there is almost everything for almost everybody.  Great company to work for if you want to develop quickly and are willing to sacrifice personal life in exchange for acquiring great experience.  Phenomenal leadership but with low tolerance for mistakes.  Provides great tools and training for those willing to take advantage of them.

good,Excellent workplace for individuals interested in finance and benefits.
good,"A GE Celma é uma empresa super agradável para se trabalhar, onde os funcionários são acolhedores e há um enorme volume de novas informações para se aprender diariamente, fazendo com que o desafio e a motivação estejam presentes no dia-a-dia. Alguns consideram os salários um pouco defasados em relação ao mercado, mas por outro lado, são oferecidos benefícios interessantes. Além disso a empresa oferece excelentes oportunidades de treinamentos e cursos de especialização. Os gerentes são amigáveis e próximos, e o clima na empresa é de companheirismo."

good,Union based work place does not reward good work. It is impossible to get rid of sum par employees
good,An environment with multi language learning capability and opportunities
good,Usually something differant everyday. Godd people to work with. Would stop production if there was a near miss and discuss ways to prevent accidents.
good,"They gave me the opportunity to learn new skills and by doing this I earn promotions to become a Lead Hand in a very short period of time. On top of this, due to my honest and reliable performance I was rewarded to be assigned in a foreign country in order to help the new company with the commissioning of the product as well as to establish the product in the new market."
good,El trabajo era dinámico y muy personal ya que valorabas acerca de dar un préstamo hipotecario a distinto perfil de personas.
good,A typical work day involved dealing with routine problems as well as many unforseen issues. Making adjustments and staying on top of every situation to ensure the integrity of the plant was always essential. My coworkers and I always strive to keep the plant operating at optimum levels and safe conditoins. Our management staff usually does not have to do much to maintain the operating conditions of the plant. We work in a very self-sufficient way and get things done without issues. The hardest part of my day to day activities is my long commute. I currently commute 2 hours one way to work and it can get hard at times. I enjoy working at my own pace and completing multiple tasks as they are given to me. I enjoy what I do and am great at doing my job.
good,Good pay and benefits. For field engineers travel requirements are excessive.

good,Most companies are only as good as their employees and GE is no exception. I was fortunate to work with some brightest people in the industry. GE tents to hire the best and then continue to develop them with many training opportunities. It was a great place to mature as a professional.
good,"It was a great place to work, management and staff were wonderful, the work was fulfilling however the business closed in 2015 as GE Corporate wanted to remove the company from Capital businesses."
good,Great experience and I would have liked to be hire as permanent employee. The technology of the product and the business industry were new which provide an excellent learning experience.
good,GE sold my group off in April 2019 and now those of us sold are under the GEcurrent company tag.  Lots of unknown these days and not sure where the new ownership is going.
good,"No longer with General Electric, shut down manufacturing operations 2019. worked here for 20 plus years.  positions included Test and Inspect, Press brake operator, and wire and assemnbly."
good,You are encouraged to Succeed at this company. Now if the Company can stop selling off divisions I honestly believe the talent will stay. All in All It's a great place to work.
good,Cadre et environnement de travail agréable je recommande l’entreprise
good,Big team collaboration but high attrition on the company when it comes to retention of talented people it is a problem you cant sustain procedures and policies with that many changes
good,"Good company to work for as a consultant."
good,"GE empowers their employees, provide autonomy for decision making, provides platform for learning new technology . Provides oppurtunities for working in multiple projects"
good,"Provided a wonderful opportunity to work with talented colleagues on meaningful work.  Unfortunately, the frequent changes in company direction have impacted corporate culture and job security. Overall, I quite enjoyed my time with the company."
good,"Clean and safe place to work, nice employee facilities, good benefits, HR department is on top of employees relations, IT support isn't managed or provided as well as it could be."
good,GE was a good company to work for. The only downside is that since they are a big company every decision that is made is made by looking at the bottom line. It would have been nice if they would have considered the welfare of those who were affected by decision making.
good,The company was actually Lufkin industry's at the time I was hired. GE acquired the company. We built oilfield pumping units. I perform most of my work in the painting Booth. I operated a blast Tech Machine I also worked in the shop Ran forklift and done the maintenance to paint booth and Blast Tech Machine.
good,"Like most companies, GE has positives and negatives.  Despite recent struggles, the rank and file are appreciated and well compensated. Previous CEO and senior leadership have been culled and new leadership has turned the ship around."
good,"totally is it good industries,i have a lurning more work and systemitic work.and my manager also is good work experenced person and my co worker also is good workers."
good,Management was okay. I liked my job until they decided to sell out to a Chinese company and our union didn’t so anything to protect us. The days were pretty short because you stayed busy. Plenty of breaks and food was awesome in the cafeteria
good,"Benefits package very good.  Limited career advancement opportunities."
good,"Different groups support through the company. It was a good experience, the company split to Synchrony and that took on a different culture.  The culture was more in the customer service financial field and help me to learn more about banking."
good,The ongoing financial issues with GE has affected employees and management. Many of the strongest management and employees have left the company with many others actively looking at their options.
good,"I worked with lots of fantastic folks and customers.  Primary challenges were internal corporate issues.  Sometimes difficult to get focus on the right issues vs. ""flavor of the day""  eg. improving product vs investing in non core ideas."
good,It would be better if I was a full time direct hire employee but they are not hiring only using temps. They are a little slow right know so they are not hiring permanent people.
good,It was a fast pace but over all friendly atmosphere to work in. I was given a lot of opportunities to learn new jobs and experience all aspects of the lighting devision.
good,"Working from 8am to 5pm, one hour lunch break and two short 10 minutes breaks. I learned to assemble different sizes electrical boxes according to the order and scheme.

good,"manufacturing of MV/LV Switchgear panels, Control & Relay panels, GE powers the world with the cleanest, most advanced technologies and energy solutions."
good,"Sempre amei trabalhar nessa empresa, mas o critério de avaliação para corte de funcionários se baseia exclusivamente na afinidade em que a liderança tem com seus colaboradores,deixando totalmente de lado o comprometimento, a experiência, dedicação e o amor que cada colaborador executa suas funções e tarefas em prol da melhoria continua da corporação."
good,The experience gained at GE will set you apart from other candidates when looking for that next opportunity.  The rigor prepares you to be success in a high impact environment.
good,"Overall good company with great people but less job security. However, many opportunities to extend your career exposure due to nature of conglomerate company structure."

good,"Hard werken, goede beloning. Prive-werk balans matig."
good,I this job is very interesting. Learned different things everyday. The crew that’s put together for outages were great to work with. Great team environment and very safety conscious.
good,"I enjoyed my time here the work conditions were excellent, any tools needed were provided.  They would give you set tests and leave you to setup and conduct them."
good,The job at times was very demanding the culture was to produce and rewarded you with respect and some nice celebrations for safety and production I wish my plant had not closed
good,place is closing people are great to work with bad management up high.  Did have lots or OT when it was busy but now that is ending in a few weeks the morale of the place is really low.
good,I enjoyed the team work and having access to my manager anytime.  I also trained new employees.  The most challenging part was researching historical information and ensure transactions were legitimate.  The culture allowed me to control my part of the project and made suggestions for improvement to the processes.  Management had regular meetings with entire team ensuring we were all working towards the same goals and getting the desired results.  I learned about financial data systems and using information to help existing clients and add new clients.
good,"High pressure, very competitive when I was there 1988-1993. I was part of a rotational training program, and the pressure to perform and advance afterwards was intense."
good,"Employee friendly work environment and offers flexible work schedule/remote working flexibility. A typical work day is pretty busy with a lot of meetings, but employees don't usually need to stay in the office late."
good,"Good to work here , but no  hike as well as no bonus and travelling time is long , they will care for the employees health and personally . Good management"
good,"The company had respect for their employees. You had to do your job in a timely manner, but not too rushed. Management was fair to all. Good benefits."
good,They started me out on night shift which I didn’t mind at first but I have a little one on the way and needed a job that I could be able to come home at a decent time everyday. However I did enjoy my time with the company. Night shift was relaxed and the employees where always friendly.
good,Provides for a stable employment. Some training on individual development. Training on group development. Training on job improvement programs. Training on systems improvement programs
good,"diversité de la relation clients"
good,"Cannot advance without the idiots who ran the company (into the ground) ""sweating"" the load about ""petty stuff!"" traveled A LOT (Insane amount of travel required as I constantly had high turnover of associates the 20+ years I worked for GE) as they moved people around constantly."
good,"company cares only about bottom line, once you are hired you become a number, floor management is very accessible and willing to help in most any way, upper level management couldn't care less about  associates"
good,Great people and good times. We worked a lot but we were willing to make that place a great place and everyone was on board. Management took care of us and we took care of them.
good,"Change is constant was the very nature of everything i have experienced in GE. The various roles i have played, changing business priorities, people aspirations, technology evolution, workplace dynamics needed me to be well informed, draw up strategic and tactical plans of action to ensure we do the right things at the right adding value to customers, company, people and self.  The toughest part is of adding speed to work especially with too many moving parts and many a times, the organization culture especially for a 125 year old company, things may not move at desired pace and may have conflicting priorities"
good,"I enjoyed my time with this corporation.  I am currently an employee of Solenis LLC performing my job in a similar industry.  The company was fair, but it is very large and our organization was essentially a company on its own within GE."
good,"Good workplace culture, employees have the autonomy to fail fast, learn, pivot if needed and try again. Empowered to innovate products that create value around the globe."
good,"General Electric has been an overall good experience.  I've had the opportunity to do several different jobs, meet and work with bright people from around the world.  Some jobs within GE are much more stressful and time consuming than others.  It's pretty easy at times to let your work-life balance get skewed far on the ""work"" side.  Overall, I would recommend GE to someone who is looking for a great company that they can grow with."
good,"Access to leadership, mentorship, and a large group of field experts:"
good,"Great place to work for until GE divested in a few of its divisions. If you fell into one of those divisions, things got uncomfortable. It is for me as the future is uncertain. "
good,I was a member of a two man technology team.  We provided analytics to the sales & marketing team.  My experience is way too old to matter (late 80's/early 90s).
good,Es una gran compañía en diferentes aspectos con negocios bien diversificados con capacidad de innovación continua. Es un buen lugar donde desarrollarse profesionalmente .
good,it was great I enjoyed the company and co  workers was very friendly and easy to get along with. managers I worked with was polite and good to work with . handle any problem I had right away.

good,"Fast pace phone sales role, refined time management and prioritisation skills, you had to or you sunk.  Hardest part was learning the branch was closing.  Most enjoyable, chasing a target in the last couple of days and smashing it."
good,"Dedicada al resultado del dia a dia"
good,Empresa muito forte no campo de trabalho e investe nos funcionarios. Cultura meritocratica e muito dinamica.
good,"Great place to work and wonderful people to work with.  After 19 years of employment, chose to leave the company because of my last manager (of three years).  Tried several times to take a different internal role, but that manager consistently blocked me and gave me no choice."
good,"Has a great company culture."
good,Good place to work. Lack of organization. Decent pay for what you were asked to do. Paid time off. Usual optional overtime. Availability to learn a lot.
good,I was happy with the job I had at GE and loved what I did. I enjoyed the team I worked with and my supervisors. It was a pleasant place to work and was sad to be laid off.

good,"A GE é uma multinacional americana presente no Brasil a muitos anos. Atuei no segmento da transmissão e geração de energia através da execução de subestações de energia e parques eólicos. Sobre o tempo que permaneci na empresa pude aprender muitas coisas e desenvolver habilidades que contribuiram para a empresa e minha aprendizagem pessoal. Classifico a GE como uma empresa boa para se atuar, porém com foco maior dado a área voltada a engenharia elétrica e nem tanto para a engenharia civil (minha área). Sobretudo, a experiência que tive esses anos nessa empresa foram imprescindiveis para minha formação e sou grato por tudo que aprendi."

good,"The typical workday isn't too bad.  Everyone is pretty smart and ambitious.  It is hard to trust people, as it can be very cut-throat.  Being so large, there are many different avenues to pursue career wise.  There are lots of training opportunities as well.  Decision making can be very slow at times.  There are lots of extracurricular programs like the Veterans, Running Club, volunteer events, etc.  You can be ask active or as inactive as you chose.  The work life balance is pretty good for the most part.  That starts to get sacrificed the higher up the ladder you climb."

good,"This is an excellent company to work with. Salary, employee's benifits and company policy are excellent."

good,"Great and challenging place to work.  For the most part job expectations were defined with minimal micro-management."
good,"Really enjoyed my job and saw a long term future with GE up until they laid me off.  Most people very friendly and helpful. Good place to work but have an exit strategy if you are what they call a direct hire. In tight times, they will look to eliminate you if you are less than three years (vested). Heatlhcare benefits are not that good, but not many are in this age (extremely high co-pays)."

good,The company is great for gaining experience in numerous industries and roles.  They are constantly changing to promote growth and adaptation to the current markets.
good,My work days were always very busy and I learned to multi-task very well.  The company I worked for taught us the skills required for the task they needed accomplished if we did not know how.  That made the job rewarding in itself.  I enjoyed the friendly rapport which I was able to make with my customers over the telephone and we both grew to have a deep respect for each other.  I became the go-to person for many issues as I had so many years experience.  There was a lot of variety in what I did once people started retiring and work was spread-out amongst those remaining in the department.

good,"A typical day at work would be 15 deliveries starting at about 6am and ending at 3pm. working doing deliveries teaches you how to have very good customer service skills, because you have to deal with customers all day long in there homes. The management at G.E were very friendly and very understanding of your problems and situations. All of the people in the warehouse, and in the offices were easy to talk to at anytime. I think the hardest part of the job was that sometimes you would get home real late if you had a long drive home and alot of deliveries. At the same time the best thing about the job was that you never had to stay in the same place all day long, and time was aginst you were you would be trying to beat time instead of looking at the clock and it not going fast enuff for you."

good,". The atmosphere is really light and most of the employees are nice. Some of the mentors are really well, they give you projects to work on and let you have a small amount of freedom. A typical day at work involves random tasks ranging from simple things like reworking parts to redesigning areas or brainstorming solutions to problems. I learned that its important to prioritize assignments because you probably wont be able to finish everything on your plate.

good,"В компании прекрасная корп.культура, но объем работы очень большой: много сложных систем, согласование на нескольких уровнях, жесткие сроки по закрытию отчетности."
good,Good organization.  Change management was slower than expected.  Pay and benefits were very good.  Focus on quality was high.  Difficult to keep all business units on the same sheet of music due to scale.
good,"GE is an American company with many day to day household items as a constant reminder of who GE as a company means this country.  GE has a strong mentorship program, career advancement/lateral movement, and volunteerism culture.  I left GE to pursue career endeavours that were more closely aligned with my own passion, however GE was a great experience I will never forget.  Management was not the best, however it was still a great job."
good,"The company is extremely large and you are a number but the chain of command does make it down to you and is willing to address your issues. "
good,Good environment and good work/life balance. Job might not be very challenging depending on the team but there are many opportunities to move within the company.
good,I am glad I worked at GE for the few years that I did… There is so much to learn and so many smart people to learn from... GE experience was pivotal in being able to take on new jobs in new companies and industries.

good,"If you don't mind going all in, there are great rewards to be had. But I got my promotion by working 12 hour days (shorter on the weekends) and visiting the corporate office on my time off to schmooze."
good,"Although I did not pursue a career here after graduation, I gained valuable experience from a talented group of engineers. They worked hard to make sure I got the learning experience I was looking for. I was able to increase my knowledge and skills in several areas around manufacturing. This plant would be well suited for engineers looking to work for a global manufacturing and industry leader."
good,Worked as a consultant.. it is very nice environment and nice people to work with. very nice experiance working with data teams in GE and i learnt a lot form the team
good,"If you work hard, help solve business problems and continue to learn; you will advance your career. You are exposed to top talent in their fields and it is contagious."
good,"I was working in GE from past 8 years, there is lot of growth professionally, it recommends all emerging technologies and culture is employee freindly, one can find a very good exposure if got into good projects but recently there is lot of uncertainity in GE , which is problem for any employee to think and join."
good,"GE Energy had placed GE Industrial Solutions up for sale so this was a temporary assignment.  The people are good and technical support was excellent - client relations good too."
good,.otimo lugar para fazer carreira e se desenvolver.
good,It was fun place to work with good colleagues and better co-ordination with different teams. Business teams were very helpful and always available to sort out any queries or clarifications.
good,"Worked in HR, Customer Service, Credit, Collections."
good,"Its okay for office politics. You have freedom to set your work schedule. They looks at performance as long as you get the job done, some manager does care about where you work, home or office."
good,"Very Interesting skill sets. Good Pay...Great workers. Interesting levels of management, but overall OK.Wanted to Finish career with GE, unfortunate plant closer."
good,The management changed in the last 5 years at the site I worked at and became more cut throat and everyone was watching their backs and management was not upholding policies or safety concerns toward the Aircraft. But over all the company is a great company to work for just not the location I was at.
good,"General Electric provides high job security with a solid environment in which to learn and grow.           "
good,Hardcore result oriented work culture and demanded long working hours to achieve goals. Hardest part was since was new to finance field it took a little time to understand the products and enjoyable was it allowed person to run the place as an entrepreneur giving freedom to implement new ideas
good,Great company to work for. Learnt a lot of stuff here. Great management who were very supportive and always encouraged you to go the extra mile. Enjoyed my time here
good,"I was sub contracted as a structural welder. We was working on new construction, making the test rooms for turbine engines. All stainless steel metal work. Safety was number 1 on the list."
good,The original company I worked for was bought out by GE 1 1/2 years before I retired and having been traveling every day for approximately 20 years I was tired of traveling
good,"I really enjoyed the competitive envirement and opportunities for advancement,  Structured annual appraisal process with opportunities to win stock options."
good,"it is a very good day of work starting , from increasing your culture , till increasing your scientific and general knowledge the only reason to leave such company is to relocate if you cant relocate within"
good,break room is nice. Management didnt listen to floor employees ideas for smoother flow. The Union is strong and reputable. GE matches up to 8% towards 401k w stock options.
good,This was a contract position which found me on the road for specific account.  There was not much else I remember other than it was either very slow or very busy.
good,"They start out the day with department meetings. They are proactive about safety, and encourage everyone to offer safety suggestions. Occasionally, overtime can be required, so if you like to get lots of hours, it might be worth considering. Management walks through every department every morning and looks at various reports and concerns. The majority of people there are good people. Probably the most difficult part of the job is keeping energy levels up, since the vast majority of positions require standing, and this is even more tiring during warm weather, since it can get hot in the factory. There is the capability of moving up and advancing within the company, and promotions largely are based on company seniority. The most useful thing I learned was how to read blueprints."
good,Team approach to R&D worked very well. Everyone encouraged to contribute. Many working meetings. Creation of intellectual property was very important.
good,"GE gave me a lot of responsibility and growth opportunity that I wouldn't have received elsewhere.  I worked with a great, collaborative team that was open to sharing ideas and providing guidance.  The job was stressful at times, but I enjoyed the learning experience and relationships I built with my team and customers as a member of the GE team."
good,"Build in-depth knowledge in domain, Good MNC, World Leader, Flexible work environment and benefits. New State of art technology work. Regional know-how."
good,"Needs more freedom of ideas, more collaboration of shift work. No training program for maintenance technicians. Upper management skills are lacking knowledge of the job performed."
good,There was poor management all the way around. I one great manager but he retired from the company. I enjoyed what I was doing as I ran the machines. My position kept my brain working n thinking. Had to be alert of what was being ran.
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es sumamente amable y respetuosa."
good,I have learned about work and reporting culture. I have worked at production improvement initiatives. Lean Six sigma professional certified by GE along with project.
good,"Muy buena cultura laboral. "
good,"I would go in, do my safety checks of my crane, after that, i would start moving parts for the workers bellow, so we could keep the production flow moving."
good,Compared to the other oil and gas companies the wages do not compare. Lack of stability when it come to going on field service job. Overall they are a good company if they would compensate a little more.
good,"GE was a very good company, unfortunately I had some medical situation, that kept me out for some time, and the insurance company that controlled the Short and long term disability gave a very hard time to pay me my benefits, after only one situation at the end of almost nine (9) years I was with them. I needed money, and as I said insurance company was not too cooperative.... so I had to quit to use my 401k saving,"
good,I have no review at this time .Im waiting for everything to fall into place and balance out. We are currently going through a transition and it is a little painful.
good,A lot of knowledgeable employees that know their job inside and out. A big push for safety so nothing is ever rushed. The salary is lower than other General Electric site due to lack of jobs in the area to have competitive salaries.
good,The benefits and overall culture are drastically better for the salary job bands over the hourly job band. In the salary position I held there was more professionalism among coworkers and management invested in everyone more.
good,Nothing much to add but was a contractor and they treated me ok. They was a lot of work and at times it was stressfull but some of the scenior people were very nice and cooperative.
good,GE was very fast paced and yet relaxed at the same time. The job itself was fast paced but the people and the atmosphere were   very relaxed. It was sometimes a fun place to work.
good,GE was not a stressful workplace. I was given certain responsibilities and the tools to carry out those responsibilities with little to no supervision as long as goals were met. We dressed business casual Monday through Thursdays and dress down on Fridays. We had a break room with a ping pong table and a little fitness area to unwind if needed.
good,"If you are good at networking you would have endless career opportunities at GE. GE provides education, trainings, coaching and mentoring programs to improve employees skills."
good,"Very busy days ; worked in the title vault releasing titles to customers, worked with the DMV when there were motor vehicle violations "
good,"I first clock in 5 minutes til time to work gives you enough time to change into uniforms that is provided to you. I am given an task to inventory a tool kit that takes close to a week to complete. The  kit depends on how long it was out for service. One kit consist of 8 to 9 boxes to inventory. We work in teams sometime or work alone on that  "
good,"Great place to work. Safe working environment,. Good benefits.  Quality concerned. Would highly recommend  if not for plant intends to close in next year or two."
good,Good place to work but management changes all the time. Have lots of problems with shortages and then they want to blame the employees for the work not being on time.
good,Since I work for GE currently I don't believe that I should be writing a survey. A survey unless positive does nothing but diminish the hard work being put forward by the folks who work for that company.
good,Daily hundreds of checks and calibration to make sure the quality of our products produce. Policy and standard are followed including safety of employees and environment.
good,"GE was a great company to work for. I was pushed to learn more and management had my back.  At times, the company did not provide me with adequate technical training in the classroom.  This was more or less expected to be learned in the field."
good,"Good work environment with good management support.."
good,"Very physical, a lot of power tools, good learning experience, use of chemicals, good safety training, use of every boom lifts, safety harness trained"
good,"In general, each day present unique and fun challenges.  Decisions usually took a while to make, but once made they were followed.  Work schedules were typically flexible, but depended on location."
good,Great place to work just low income. The workplace culture is well-mixed environment. Most of management and employees get along great. There is nothing about this job that makes it difficult. The easiest part is to show up and follow directions.
good,"I enjoyed working there for the most part. I really didnt care for the management staff rotating every 18 to 24 months. The Pensacola facility was a training ground for management. It was a very family oriented culture, which I enjoyed, considering there were well over 200 employees at the facility. The hardest part of the job was that GE insists that when new managers arrive, they are required to make changes. So a proven process was automatically changed, all in the name of that manager retaining their job, as well as appearing productive."
good,"It is your typical Factor, good wage, some good management, Easy work.  Great co workers, lots of different jobs with in the plant.  Easy to learn, Shift work"
good,"It's a spot full of very talented people and a huge variety of challenging projects to work with. Like the opportunity to work on complex and real world problems that really matter. "
good,"Fast paced competitive work place. Fun place to work with good management, hard to advance unless you pass the proper cross code test, even then you have to wait for a bid to come open, seniority does dictate where and when you can get your bids."
good,Possibilité d'évoluer sur son poste et au sein de la société par le biais de formations
good,"Goed georganiseerd multitasken, onafhankelijk werk. Opgedaan en de meeste genoten van de controller ervaring als herziening van USGAAP rekeningen, het uitvoeren van BS onderzoeken, pl analyse om te voldoen aan audit-eisen. Liaiseing met USGAAP contollers en Duitse stat leider, auditor. "
good,"There didn't seem to be much of a work culture.  Everyone stuck to themselves.  However, everyone was also very friendly and helpful if I reached out to them."
good,"Great place to work.  Interesting projects and applications.  GE provides a good work environment, necessary software, current issue PC's and peripherals.  Attention is paid to office ergonomics.  One of the best parts of the job is having the freedom to make choices, ""out of the box"" thinking is encouraged."
good,I began my customer service in the New entry department(data entry of new accounts) and worked my way up to Write Off Accounts with-In Six Years before being down sized by the Company. There was the Two due accounts where accounts had a payment due and was about to go into the second payment due; there was the Three payment due just  before the account went into a write off stage and before a customer would call and make arrangements for either bankruptcy or something else.
good,I enjoyed my time with GE. It was a great learning experience and definitely shaped my professional career.  Worked with some wonderful individuals.  Enjoyed working with organizations in supplier management.
good,"GE employees are collaborative, smart and willing to help each other.  Projects are often done using cross function/cross business teams.  Fair pay, benefits are deteriorating."
good,"GE is a great company to learn about processes, I love the culture and I've been lucky to have nothing but great managers, unfortunately because of the size of the company is very hard to grow professionally and the salaries and benefits are low compared with other similar companies."
good,Striving to achieve a great culture although at times does not practice what they preach. Provides amazing opportunities for those willing to work hard. Extremely competitive. Very young workforce.
good,"Very busy work environment, dealing with uneducated, unqualified, unprofessional upper Management is certainly 80% of the daily demise of all workers at this facility. Moral is extremely low, production and quality control issues are #1, safety and job security are at the bottom of the priority list. The Plant is closing for Business September 2018 due to market changes, and gross negligence as well as severe mismanagement from the Chief Operations Manager whom has a law suit in US for misleading past, and future shareholders."
good,It was a good 3 yrs they gave me a chance to support my family and put food on my table. I learned a lot about how turbine make power . Thank you for the opportunity
good,The company is a very high paced and stressful environment.  Due to the recent Mergers & Acquisitions within Oil n Gas and Power it has created a turbulent environment.  People are great within the company.
good,"strong global company, investing training for employees. Each employee is encouraged to look for new challenges to develop path. their own career path."
good,"High expectations."
good,"Excellent learning environment, however Leadership has been too concerned on short sighted dividends and not enough on long term investment in the company."
good,Excelente empresa para trabajar y crecer. Tiene un ambiente de trabajo balanceado y muy inclusivo.
good,"My supervisor was hoping to find a nontraditional engineering student with supervisory experience to fill a needed position in his department. Perfect! The position included being the programmer for the wire EDM department, producing the control programs to run 21 wire EDM machines, as well as someone to monitor and support the saw and grind departments and look after the 12,000 gallon deionized water system necessary to the EDM process. For 20 months I filled those positions, was paid well and learned a lot about corporate culture. At the end of that term I was offered a regular position, but determined I was unable to sign their intellectual property agreement and still maintain my own prior intellectual property for later development. I left with gratitude for the experience."

good,Great opportunity for growing your career and learning experience.      It is a nice working environment and management really care about their employees
good,"Love GE as a place to work. The employees are relate-able and can make coming in to work fun. The hours on the other hand are ridiculous, and you're not compensated enough for the time put in. Can feel like you're working for nothing. Not enough job security to feel safe in your position."
good,good work environment but the company itself is undergoing a huge transition so a lot of people is impacted by downsize in the last two to three years.
good,"GE has very challenging work environment and it takes best out of an employee as it involved various products."
good,"- Valores"
good,"Passé 7 ans avec cette entreprise, ayant eu plusieurs training et un développement personnel et professionnel intéressant."
good,Competitive would be a good way to describe a normal day. A person had to be flexible to the changing daily production needs. Sometimes though management would wait toward the end of the day to tell people that some overtime was needed.
good,"Awesome people at the site.  Good technical people. everyone is helpful.  I had an awesome run at this location.  I will do it again.  please reach out to me,"

good,"In August 2016, General Electric announced the closure of the Tungsten Products Plant in 4Q17. This closure forces me to look for my next position with in GE as well as outside."
good,"I entered employment at this facility in order to secure a mortgage. I had no intention of staying. However I found the work unexpectantly challenging and rewarding and I stayed. I would continue to work here, however manufacturing is expected to cease in nine months. I enjoy my work and I am very good at it. I am looking to continue in another location."
good,Gave up work in Ohio. Had the PIP contract for work. Had a lot of good people in the Ohio group. Most found other jobs some just retired. Closed Galion Ohio site.

good,"Nice people, flexible work schedule, I've learned a lot working here."
good,Competitive management trickled down to field service causing undue pressure. The company overall is very good at taking care of employees and training is excellent. The supply chain is second to none. I really enjoyed working with the dedicated professionals at GE and learned a great amount about business.
good,Continuous learning and improvements expected. Collaborative environment with many opportunities for advancement.  Cross functional team interactions with additional opportunities to explore different areas of interest.
good,Great opportunity to learn new systems. Usually a fun place to work but there are too many 'queues' and day to day work is treated much like a call center with ever increasing metrics.
good,Fast paced challenging environment. The group I worked with was great. Lots of support and well defined direction regarding expectations and deliverables.
good,Fun place but long hours. Co-workers for most part were good to be around. Paid lunch so we were there for only 8 or 12 hours a day.Would still be there but plant closed.

good,"GE does offer a great work life balance as your off all holidays, sick time, and vacation is offered. GE also allows you to flex twice a month if needed for family needs. GE compensation is not what it should be. We do way more work for the money we are paid. I also believe that promotion depends on who you are not what you can bring to the position."
good,"Always challenging but great. each day I learned  something new internally or with customers.  Management was great.  Work place was enjoyable and pleasant.  Hardest part was when we need to collect a customer, but I do enjoy what I do."

good,An organisation with good working climate and culture. Schedule there used to hectic but the organisation offers vast opportunities to learn and perform .

good,"Empresa boa para se trabalhar, que investe  a educação do funcionário."
good,GE supports employees and empower them to make their own decision that align with the overall company's strategy.If you expect it all to be handed to you and don't want to put the effort in yourself then don't join... Negative people and those feeling they are owed will not do well here.
good,"I traveled a lot while working for GE. The development program was great but there was definitely a sacrifice I had to make in order to be a part of that program. There were many management changes but overall I would recommend GE. At a big company  like GE, top management is likable and cares for the company and the workers - kind of like a politician that is expected to care about constituents because that's part of the job."

good,"-Excellent infrastructure"
good,In most areas of the Asheville plant there is a teaming environment which works great. They do offer walking trails around their new facility and have ping-pong tables to play @ during breaks.
good,Management and my co-workers were great to work with. Training was excellent in terms of quality.  Advancement opportunities were only limited by you.
good,"GE showed a lot of thought and preparation for the combined employee population in its merger with Alstom, ensuring that everyone on both sides were treated fairly, and the combined company is truly a major benefit to its shareholders and customers."
good,"Providing customer service to clients and inside sales customers.  Learned about new systems and ways of using best practices to provide the best service to clients.

good,A typical day is to focus on improving processes and reducing costs. Overall this seems to be a well run organization with much growth potential.
good,"At a sales management level you are working completely autonomously at a pre-tender phase but then the red tape is huge. However an interesting organisation that services the Aero, Oil & Gas, Energy, Water and Money sectors of business where there is opportunity to move within and learn other niche products & services in a completely different field as well as working across several divisions on large projects/tenders combining products. Most of the staff are very skilled in their particular field, friendly and helpful. "

good,"se aprende mucho y hay mucha oportunidad de crecimiento, ambiente retador"
good,this is one of the best companies I worked for. You are always doing something new and exciting. It's very unfortunate that it will be reduced in size.
good,"Trabalhei 16 anos na GE. É uma ótima empresa , que proporciona treinamento constante para seus colaboradores. O rodizio gerencial é contínuo e ninguém permanece mais de 3 anos na mesma função, fazendo com que todos se motivem e não se acomodem com o tempo. O ambiente é muito bom e o nível dos funcionários elevadíssimo, promovendo um crescimento geral com a troca de conhecimentos e informações. "

I took classes to learn more deeply about the product that we manufactured. I felt as though the people I worked with were like family, offered help when ever needed. Management told me that I was an asset to the company and promoted enthusiasm. The hardest part of the job was trying to accomplish everything my job required even when there were reductions in the workforce and we had to incorporate additional work. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to reconcile issues or opportunities that were presented to me giving me a sense of accomplishment."
good,"_ Trabalho dinâmico."

good,"There were so many thing that we did that there was not really a ""typical"" work day. I was able to learn new tools and the proper way to use them along with being able to run heavy equipment. With the way the company was setup, I hardly ever worked with the same crew members from job to job. The hardest part of the job was being gone for months at a time. I did enjoy using the heavy equipment and seeing how much we had accomplished at the end of each job."
good,I have been learning a lot of different coaching styles while working with the Union Employees.  I like the operations side of the business I am in and would like to be involved in more NPI's.
good,"A typical day consisted of coming in and managing the assembly lines - figuring out possible problems before they happened, determining which operators were allotted to the line that day, and meeting with management for general factory directives.  While working here, learning about the core tenets of LEAN and Six Sigma were stressed, as well as learning how to oversee an multiple assembly processes.  The hardest part was juggling all of the responsibilities, as the factory had minimal operators and needed to meet product deadlines quickly as it was oriented for fulfilling special orders.  I enjoyed the comaraderie between the management and line operators to help relieve stress."
good,Great company that gives young students tons of experience and freedom to learn.I worked there for a co-op rotation and gain lot of knowledge.

good,"En tant qu'assistant de Centre, mon rôle était des plus variés et sautait du coq à l'âne. Il fallait donc bien faire et vite, changer constamment ses priorités. J'aimais beaucoup ce challenge mais il était évidemment très lourd à porter journalièrement et je n'achevais souvent pas mes objectifs semestriels. Le management est très changeant, ce qui faisait que je rencontrais donc des managers plus ou moins compréhensifs concernant le poste tenu. Celui-ci m'a permis d'être proche des décisions stratégiques et confidentiels et m'a beaucoup appris puisque je devais prendre de nouveaux dossiers et projets en main régulièrement."
good,"Company no longer available to my knowledge. Great coworkers managers. Versatile work from warehouse work, sales, and engineering."

Managing and coordinating action plans for daily operations, establishing work priorities and ensuring consumer and business issues are handled effectively while meeting cost, productivity, and quality goals.  Directing team efforts to trend complaints and partner with key organizations to identify and implement organization wide quality improvements. My management style is open and honest communication at levels.  I work well with others and this can be seen through the projects and programs implemented. I am able to work in a positive with team members and co-workers. The hardest part of my job was delivering the message of work force reductions. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and watching them grow and develop."
good,GE offered great benefits but job security is virtually non-existent.
good,"A typical day at work involves driving production and order to have OTD."

Innovation and creativity are the hardest and most rewarding part of the jobs I've had with GECRB."

good,The job environment was adequate. All the tools are given to the employees to complete the job. The hardest part was that there was a lot of repetition in the job duties. The best part is that the work hours are flexible depending on what department/manager you had.
good,"A great place to work with opportunity to achieve and be rewarded & to advance your career. A very busy but friendly environment.  Sadly due to major restructure of the whole business I was made redundant. My role was varied ranging from everyday running of incidents that may arise on a daily occurrence to processing the large volume of invoices required to maintain the running of the major sites & branch network Australia wide. Along with the processing of invoices, reconciliation of all suppliers and the maintenance of the  and future forecasting of the budgets.  A very challenging but rewarding position.  I was  an OH&S representative for the site and also assisted with all fire drills and trial evacuations.  At times you would feel as if there was not have enough hours in the day and the life - work balance would be tested.  A can do attitude and flexibility allowed me to always complete the days work and leave at the end of the day feeling satisfied."

The co-workers are good professionals with a lot of knowledge, The management are upstanding professionals, very accessible and they like to teach.  In terms of professional growth, the management doesn't help a lot but the company does.  The hardest part of the job it's the lack of resources, but in some way that forces you to be very versatile.  What I like of the company it's that they give you a lot of space to develop your duties."
good,ARS being a US based process we had to work night shifts which was very different to me as a fresher. It took me about 7 to 10 days to get used to this routine. The training period was the most critical and a life changing one to be really honest. It changed my personality completely. The change in me was notice and was appreciated by the training head and was given a token of appreciation by the company. Once we hit the production floor it was one great experience as we were the someone who helped people when they are stuck in middle of highways. The kind of satisfaction at the end of a call satisfying a customer felt great.

good,"* dealing with customers, repairing turbine engines, can be stressful at times"
good,"As an intern I was exposed to a vast majority of regulations and how a VPP site is correctly operated. I've worked closely with OSHA, and have ensured the facility was in compliance with various other agencies. Within GE, I've witnessed firsthand how a company has a balance of management, and an aging workforce. I enjoyed the freedom of being able to speak to employees, and really get to know the workers and have more of a personal relationship with them. I believe this is an important aspect of having a strong safety culture, and having the workforce trust Safety."
good," great company for advancement,8 hour shiftsgrart training for jobs,"
good,"Very good company to work for. Interesting projects, smart people."
good,Management is great - and great training. The culture of building leadership is the best in the industry. Business process is solid and innovative.

good,Great organization to work for with growth potential.
good,Contacted customers about past due car payments and made payment arrangements. If they did not pay I contacted the repo company to get the vehicle.
good,You are allowed to do your job as long as it is the way your boss wants who is constantly overseeing and telling you that it should be this way when yesterday it was supposed to be that way. No teamwork whatsoever. Each one was trained by a different person and we all have our own way of doing things and yet the shop manager has not taken the initiative to standardize the practice. Might explain why objectives are changing day by day. The hardest part is having to explain yourself. They don't care what you went through to get to where you are now. All they see is where they have to get to from here. Understandable but when your integrity is questioned based on here from there and so sense of there to here it demoralizes the comaradiere.
good,The company is really the best I have ever worked at for the dedication of using Six Sigma principals and processes in meeting goals. The most focused company I have ever worked at to this point.

good,Entreprises ayant une structure assez cohérente avec les ambitions professionnelles tourné vers l'international.
good,"Experience and pay was fine as per to an intern doing internship for 6 months or so. Management was understanding, cooperative and helped to acquire leadership qualities."
good,"Worked in the title & licensing division when the center in Billings, MT was open. Each employee had their own cubicle but still worked in teams. Most employees were happy there. Flexible scheduling if you needed to come in late or leave early as long as you made up your time. Walking path/rec area outside to enjoy your breaks. Team bonding events. Most people kept to themselves, but GE worked hard to promote a positive culture.  Made great friends there."
good,"General Electric is more than a job it's a lifestyle, the culture is very unique. I was very grateful for the opportunity to work there. I would chalk this up to the top three best employers I have ever had."
good,"Coffee machines are great, drink couple of them a day. Snacks are good. Free lunch on Friday, which is nice. not sure if they still provide them now. People are nice."
good,"Plenty of room to grow with multiple progression and self development opportunities. "
good,I'm thankful for the opportunity of being employed by GE. I learned  how being the Oil field operates. That assembling and inspecting our product was the goal. To ensure quality orders with shipped to customers.  The hardest part was losing my job and having to regroup.
good,"GE has it all, a good working environment, good salary, exposure, they really do care for the employees. But the management there needs to be improved, I worked as  an intern in GE, there is one HR for the entire west region."
good,"GE was a good place to work but I relocated to another state. My managers  were always willing to help and show me how to succeed in my job. If did not relocate, I most likely would still be working there."
good,Excelente empresa para se trabalhar pois busca desenvolver os funcionários através de treinamento e forte liderança.
good,"going into work I would line up the work load for completion, but many times it would have to change as most jobs are. The culture was excellent and everyone I worked with were professionals."
good,"I worked in a challenging position requiring critical and analytical thinking, written and verbal presentations skills, and consensus building. I enjoyed working with clients and addressing their needs with solutions that worked for them and GE. The amount and frequency of reporting could be tedious at times."
good,"The job was fairly easy and didn’t require additional work outside of work. "
good,GE Capital Fleet Services was a fun place to work. I looked forward to going to work each day. I always knew what was expected of me and at the same time was recognized for a job well done.
good,IT at GE Appliances is under transition.   All operations are being outsourced with the premise that employees will focus on driving business transformation.
good,Contact low performing clients to identify roadblocks to programs success. Develop business strategy and training to help increase performance. Ensure client is operating program within compliance requirements.

good,"It was secure when I advanced to leadership but worrisome otherwise. Great location, people were friendly, union sucked and ruined the battery business"
good,I worked for a lesser duration for a span of 1 year but the GE culture is great with its leader and lots of patents and its one of the oldest company existing till date being at the top position
good,Great experience in the inventory control area. Close to the manufacturing operation so that I could see and understand what was going on most of the time.
good,Overall good learning despite a lot of changes. Great people. High caliber and smart and they actually took time to teach/ coach. Good work life balance.
good,"It's a big conglomerate and as it goes in every large matrix organizations, you have yourself and knowledge of management in order to maneuver around big personalities and ego; also to know how to negotiate and take risks on certain assignments and in difficult times challenge the status quo to be innovative."
good,"GE was actually a contracting job for me - I worked for a contract company that provided me benefits (health, dental, time off, etc.) - but all of the work was done for GE.  The technology was not very modern, but the working conditions were very relaxed and comfortable.  The schedules were more than realistic and there were actually a lot of very talented engineers, especially older nuclear engineers, that made working there a lot of fun, despite the lack of modern technologies.  I only intended to work there for 6 to 12 months, but ended up working there for several years - so that's how much fun it was, indeed!"
good,Management not always connected to team and fluctuates with individual styles. Fast paced learning curves. Hardest part is keeping up with the changes and current business goals.
good,The facility is highly advanced and the work life balance is great.  My boss lets us work with autonomy and only steps in when we have questions or when employees make urgent requests through him.
good,Not much job security if you don't already possess the skills. You must already have the skills going in and be able to able to change directions on different projects quickly because its fast paced
good,"As a co-op, it is not a sufficiently accurate interpretation of the workplace for others. It was a good company to work for and times are flexible day to day"

good,"-culture very different dependent on location. Dublin office had excellent culture"
good,"One of the best places to learn with ample learning resources and management focused on meritocracy. "
good,"I enjoyed the fast pace atmosphere and the challenge to make my goals. I would recommend GECU for rates on deposits, online banking, and loan rates. Marketing is very good as well."
good,"GE offers a ton. Great pay, amount of paid days off, 401K, Benefits, and a good family like feel helping each other with business and family reallly caring about you as a person. As of the business side a lot of helping each other to be successful."
good,"La empresa ofrecía una gran variedad de ventajas laborales, sin embargo, dentro de la estabilidad que mostraba, se convirtió en una empresa que dejó de presentar oportunidad de crecimiento para el área de ventas, fuera de los negocios de Oil & Gas."
good,Just go to work and do your job. Stay in your lane. Learn as much as you can. Stay on top of your job. Help each other when you can. Take notes and keep balance
good,- Work at GE with a fast paced was fun and more challenge.Unfortunately I work temporarily job at this time.Workplace culture was cool and fun so we can solve the problem even the hardest part of the job.
good,Great place for starting a career. Feel out of mlm place if your not a millennial. The environment is designed for them. Everyone is very nice and wonderfully talented.

good,"Trabalhar na GE é uma experiência muito agradável."
good,Always ongoing improvement teams. Management has regular company status meetings to show projected engine orders. The NPI (new product introduction) is my favorite. Especially the new GE-9X engine.
good,"Es una buena empresa, son consentidores con los trabajadores, la gente contratada es en general bastante capaz. Lo mejor que mejor me parece es la flexibilidad de horario. El ambiente laboral es respetuoso y cordial. En general es un buen lugar para aprender tanto de habilidades tecnicas como interpersonales. Tiene muchos recursos de apendizaje y actividades que apoyan el balance work-life. La cultura laboral tiene buenos principios, desafortunadamente es una empresa muy grande y las iniciativas, la cultura y los valores tardan demasiado en fluir. Algun cliente describio a GE como un pulpo de muchos brazos que no se entienden entre si, y si veo su punto. Los lideres de GE son todos de background tecnico, con la ventaja de que entienden bien productos y procesos, y en general hacen un buen trabajo. Lo que menos me gusto, es que es dificil interactuar con tantas instancias, que vuelven el trabajo muy burocratico. Lo que mas me gusto del trabajo es que es un trabajo interesante, retador, y con apoyo tanto de lideres como de compañeros. Y claro, el salario es bueno y la flexibilidad de horario es un muy buen beneficio."
good,"Ótima empresa, Bom ambiente uma forte cultura de melhoria continua"

good,"The Turbine Airfoil Center of Excellence provided a rich culture to expand the engineering technology - depending on the program."
good,"I learn to be flexible at work ."
good,"Got a good knowledge about the new products, very friendly in nature. Good place to work, working from start of project till end of project. supported many old projects"
good,"I started my career as part of a Global IT Leadership Program.It gave me great exposure working in different GE businesses and interacting with diverse leaders from around the globe.After 2 years of great mentorship and learning, I took up the role of managing the Apttus CPQ  program for Japan to enable transform their current IT systems and revamp the Digital Thread wing to wing.It has been a very demanding but fulfilling experience so far with a lot of learning and responsibility."
good,"Travailler dans un Open Space est idéal pour le travail en équipe. En effet, j'étais directement en lien avec les managers."
good,Daily interaction with team members and leaders made you feel part of the process. There is room for growth. Cultural differences would remind the team of the value of inclusion.

good,"Worked for GE as a contract employee, so it is difficult to comment about the company. Overall, work environment was friendly and flexible. The management was helpful and considerate."
good,I acquired many skills throughout the years that have added to my skillset. Some of the management is too afraid to deal with lazy people so they pretty much do nothing and get paid for it.
good,Great stable place to work where people go to build careers. GE is employee friendly and there's a place for every type of person. Steady work and good work culture.

good,"exciting job with good benefits, lots of interesting projects. job security was a concern over the past few years leading up to the plant closure. I would have stayed with GE had they not decided to close"
good,"Days are undetermined based on how production runs that day, equipment or employees. It's a fast pace place of employment but easy to catch on. There are days that employees are rewarded for their work, just not through pay raise."
good,"Great Company to work for highly productive work place,"
good,I liked working here because its a laid back atmosphere but fast paced on the line jobs. The jobs were easy to pickup after a couple of hours of training. I wish I could go back. I miss my coworkers.

good,I worked 34 years at General Electric. Typical hours in my position were between 10-11 hours per day. The job was stressful but rewarding. I would still be there if the plant had not closed.
good,"Typical construction work environment of meetings deadlines, project coordination. Great communication,working experience with engineers and contractors.I enjoyed working with GE employees in Middletown, NY and engineers who flew in from around the world to work on the grid system."
good,"I worked at a central location for multiple sites. It was not very organized, as this was an experimental situation. Overall, it was a great learning experience."
good,GE has been a great learning experience in the time that I have worked here.  My management team is inclusive and provides challenges interspersed with normal daily activities.  The variety and ability to learn new things is one of the things I really like about the company.  Compensation and benefits are above par.
good,Small team environment with excellent co workers to count on. Support and backing from corporate was there when needed. Decisions was mostly local except corporate decisions.

good,"GE are a fantastically diverse organisation with success in many industries. They produce market leading products and are at the heart of progressive digital technologies."
good,I did my internship there. Waited for my manager to be free enough to meet with me for the first two weeks. He was always in meetings. I didnt know what I was to do there for 2 weeks. That was frustrating.
good,Most of the time we work a lot or stayed busy. I learned different things and was able to be part of safety team among other stuff. If I had the chance to work with GE I will take it.
good,GE Capital is very fast paced and requires patience with clients. Can be very stressful at times. Have to be able to accept change.Ge accepts your interest and ideas. Your questions are takes seriously with Management.

good,"GE Capital understands the meaning of work life balance, there's unlimited vacation as long as work is done, and you're able to work from home. There's also competitive pay."
good,Everyone in dept worked together to meet goals.  Management was great and flexible which added to a wonderful life/work balance.  Would still be working there if the department wasn't shut down.
good,"Salaried employees are expected to be self-driven.  Those that aren't, are weeded out quickly.  Learned to push vendors relentlessly for lower cost and better performance.  Lacks in training for salary personnel not in the management leadership program.  Often a ""sink or swim"" feeling where one is left to figure things out for themselves.  This is often due to the rapid pace of advancement."
good,"very good work-life balance but there is no Job Security. Management is good, not much of politics but it depends on teams, Salary wise, it is not very good but i would prefer as there is a brand value if you go out of the company"
good,"While starting most positions is like being thrown in the fire, if you can take the heat and prove your worth, you'll go a long way. The Flexible Work Arrangement (not eligible to all employees) is great!"
good,It is not about your career… it is not about your job title… it is about who you are…. It is about the impact you are going to make on the world. You want to go into uncharted waters… do things that haven’t been done to make .
good,"Ge Money was a good place to work, in my 14 years there I started off opening store cards in from the UK eg top shop etc, then I moved to Irish GE accounts and there I worked with loans that had fallen into arrears anything from 1 to 7 months behind"
good,Its an excellent company to work for if you can get in. But unfortunately after new CEO too many changes making people feel at risk of loosing their job.
good,"A good place to work had good benefits, and good pay. Enjoyed the work environment and the people I worked with. I was laid off many times over the years I worked there. When I worked for Transformers I was safety representative for my department."

good,I worked 8-10 hours a day. Management was great. Culture was good. Very labor intensive. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the people. The training over the years was good also. There was one on one training as well as on line training.
good,"Like any multi-national, there are pros and cons.  Pay and benefits are great (for now) but that is balanced with a ton of red tape.  Lots of flexibility for work/live balance.  Promotions are readily available for certain skill sets, but can be limited if you're not interested in a management role. You're never really disconnected from the work if you have a company phone.  People change roles frequently, so your managers will constantly change, and processes can break down when owners move on to a new role.  Corporate tends to play chess with its many business acquisitions... one week you're in a great position, the next week you're out the door.  Bottom line, if not for the layoff, I would still be working there."
good,GE has a variety of career tracks that both challenge and provide opportunities for individuals looking for a career across a diverse group of industries.
good,If you want experience with manufacturing and design this is a great place to do it.  Great work-life balance. Sometimes meetings and moving forward can be difficult with projects because company can be very conservative.

good,"Good place to work, lots of good people"
good,I would love the job if it wasn't temp. So many great employees waited almost 18 months to be hired on and were only making 8.00 per hour. Other than that it is a great place to work and I absolutely loved the management.
good,"The culture at GE is one of integrity, ethics, and camaraderie.   Everyone works hard to get the job done.  I always felt my efforts were rewarded both monetarily and through recognition.  The best part of GE Capital is its people.  I was worked with some really intelligent kind individuals."

good,"Excelente empresa, estrutura, benefícios e plano de carreira."
good,"I was fortunate enough to work with a team that had pride and personnel satisfaction in getting our tasks done.

good,"Good flexible work schedule. You could learn or experience a lot in a typical day, especially in the first a few years with the company. Not very impressive management style with some exceptions. Progressive in seniority would be mostly depending on who your boss is. Bureaucracy would be inevitable in such a big company, even though some upper management encourages a small company culture at certain point."
good,The bosses are completely trusting you with your work. They will let you manage your own time trusting that you will not leave the workplace when you know that your productivity is at stake.
good,Great place to work.  If you work hard there is a lot of room to move up.  Great people to work with and great benefits. I learned a lot working at G.E.
good,"Received 2 years of intense leadership experience and training, as well as Financial training, which helped me in my career.  The hardest part of the job is the long hours and weekend work required, but at the same time, you get to see a lot of the world."
good,"In GE Decatur, most days meets you with smiles and friendliness. I have learned how to work with others and I have learned the system of manufacturing."
good,"L'environnement de travail est très agréable malgré un travail souvent répétitif et bridé par des procédures internes prédéfinies."
good,GE is truly a global company that knows how to compete in a dynamic world that is ever changing.  Must be an entrepreneur and an innovator to be able to survive at GE.

good,"Uma grande empresa, correta com seus funcionários. Foi uma grande experiência trabalhar, tive um grande aprendizado"
good,Solid company. I studied GE while in school and I thought it was a great opportunity right out of college. The benefits were good and I thought the retirement options were really solid. I was hired during a boom and I was given a 10% bonus for the cost of living expenses. I of course lost it when the price of oil dropped. The job did unofficially ask you to work more than 40 hours a week but it didn't kill me. However upper management seemed to spend 60 hours a week on the job. I couldn't see myself working that much and being a great husband. I left because I thought that if I was going to end up working that much then I want to do it on my own terms. I left to start my own business. In the oil field I always heard how much greener the grass was on the other side but I'd argue that GE Oil and Gas is a great place to work.
good,Work-life balance is good. Learning opportunity is ok. Dedicated small team for sap doing all type of projects. However new skills are difficult to imlement due to slow adoptation.

It has giant meeting room, dining court, sport center, and any other facilities I could think of in order to push their employees work and live better. Then I walked to my working place, which is in the public relations department. My colleagues told me that GE was imitating the seating pattern of Google company, that was, each employee could signed up for their seat in their area for one day, and next day they could change the seat spot. And the supervisors could be possible to seat near the subordinates. This was a good way to push employees in different level to communicate.

The pay for call center work is higher than what I've seen at other places. The key is to have patience, and be determined to be as knowledgable as possible. If you arent a patient person, dealing with angry customers isn't for you. Aside from that, over all its a pretty great position. It's very simple. You get 2 months of paid training off the phones, and they make an effort to take all the reps off the phones for meetings and fun activities. Most of the management is very nice and understanding."

good,"Processed retail auto loan contracts.  Communicated with credit managers, F&I, sales and consumer to verify documentation received.  Resolved discrepancies prior to funding.  Refer to resume."
good,"GECRB is great on benefits, not so great on pay.  Granted, it's call center work but it should pay more than it does.  Turnover is high due to the stress which should indicate a need to increase wages as it is costly to keep retraining CSRs.  However, if you are thick-skinned like I am, the work won't bother you.  Veterans of the service environment tend to hack.  Folks coming from outside have a bit more trouble.  Promotions are merit based although time does play a significant role.  The only real downside other than compensation is the clientele.  Half want to complain that it took 30 minutes to get to a live representative only to ask a question that could have been handled by the automated system 29 minutes ago."

good,We monitored and performed all the daily processes in the global data center. I had always dreamed of having a job like this and hated when corporate decided to close it down and move to different locations. The hardest part of the job was the changing weekly from day shift to night shift.  The most enjoyable was the ability to learn what ever we were interested in and the company backing us.  I became Six Sigma Greenbelt certified and was the first non-exempt person to complete this task.

Fairly enjoyable pace of work, only occasional sense of urgency when a fulfillment deadline is near or design review comes up. GM seemed really nice and wanted to make sure I was happy and excited to be there. Most annoying part of the job is having to deal with the occasional bugs in the archaic simulation tools for Mark VI engines."

good,"This was a great assignment as it officially marked the beginning of my professional career as an engineer. There was little to no guidance from a leadership standpoint upon things I should develop in; however, it taught me how to become a self-starter and employee that could excel and perform with little direction."
good,"Grande empresa, com plano de carreira e bons salários, ótimo ambiente."
good,It was a very fun place to work at. It does have a lot of work during the month and quarter ends but it helps your day go by fast and do not realize when its home time already. People working there are really friendly and helpful. It gave me a good opportunity to learn in my related field.

good,"GE is a good place to work.  But it could be better.  Management hardly ever interact with employees.  And barely shows employees appreciation.  If they do, it's giving us a T-shirt, a hot dog meal, or sub sandwich meals. They could also pay us more as hard we work. But other than that. If day that it's an OK place to work.  The benefits are awesome.  It also feels good to actually build an appliance for others.  And when you see a GE brand appliance somewhere.  You'll feel honored to know you helped build it."
good,"Historically, GE Capital has been a great place to work.  Smart, hard-working people to learn and grow from.  Most are very collaborative, mission/client focused, and committed to the GE culture.  With the recent divestiture and sell-off of much of its assets, it has essentially become a captive finance unit to its industrial vertical businesses; so it is no longer the financial behemoth its once was.  While much talent has left the business as the assets were sold off, and despite its challenges, those remaining are certainly capable, and remain dedicated to seeing that GE capital continues to thrive, and grow."

good,"Typically at GE we would start our day with a crossover meetings with the previous shift. This gave us the opportunity to identify any issues either with equipment, processes, or even coworkers as we started our shifts. GE is a employee-driven atmosphere that tries to take the management aspect from the workplace and empower its employees from the bottom up. I have taken away many skills from my time at GE including prioritizing work and objectives. GE is not a traditional work environment. It is team driven and therefore requires the team to come together and fix many of its own problems before escalating the issue or issues to upper management. Often times, most issues, whether personal or business related, can be solved on  the associate level. I do not feel there is a hard part to this job in general. The company goes out of its way to ensure the job is being done as best it can be from a safety and ergonomics standpoint. I believe the most enjoyable part of my time as GE was its freedom and empowerment of its associates. I also built long lasting relationships, both personally and professionally, from my time at GE. The company provides opportunities throughout the year for employees to enjoy events not related to work such as Christmas parties and family day events."

good,Each day brings multiple tasks that keeps the days interesting. The most enjoyable part of the job is the document control responsibility.  I have such a passion and quality aspects of record keeping.
good,Best part about he job is Working from home. No commute. This saves me 3 hours of productive time. Work is interesting but difficult to get new creative assignments. Management doen't know how to manage remote employees.

good,"GE's reputation for producing the most business leaders of any company does not fall short here.

I have learned that I am action and detailed oriented, and I desire to meet goals expected of me.  I have learned that building relationships is key to getting work done, due to the fact that I have to colloaborate with different departments with GE to get the specific disputes resolved."

Great training opportunities (especially during good financial years).  Salaries seem to be above average for this area.  At times, and depending on your local leadership, you may have to be aggressive and seek out work during slow periods as it may not come to you.  Very positive culture in general, although corporate can be a little politically correct and liberal for conservative/libertarian leaning folks tastes.  Toughest parts of the job - aging IT infrastructure and inertia (too many management layers) which prevents getting work done quickly.  You may have to interact with many groups to get your work done, and not all of them have the same priorities as you.  Overall, I did some good engineering and worked great people.  I would go back for the right role."

In town days were spent in the office from 7am to 3:30pm. Generally these days were spent catching up on emails or helping other technicians/engineers work on customers equipment in the shop. These days in the office can run slow, and sometimes can be spent just cleaning the shop. On the latter, a day out of town is better in my opinion. There's a lot of different places to see like steel mills, paper mills, data centers, power plants etc. GE pays for everything, there's nothing out of pocket on your side except time. I'd say the only thing that can be tough is the time spent away but it's well worth it for the pay."

Management is a Cycle Process, Domino effect, if One process is not don't right you throw off the whole process So it is cru show, you follow the process. Working with people that have a set mind goal the same goal as you do have a positive vibe, when you encounter a person who hasn't any goals they need direction, only time will tell what outcome but once they fulfill their position you can set back, and manage.  the hardest part of my job is knowing who's is who and what they are about, and if they can work under pressure. the pay is what I mostly like and 7 till 4.
