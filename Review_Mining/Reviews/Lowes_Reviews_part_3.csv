good,"fast past environment , answering phone and waiting on customers "
good,"A company that allows you to grow.  "
good,"The pay and benefits are ok. The reason I want to leave is due to the poor management. I've experienced a bad leadership and there treated you like a number, not a person and you can be replaced any time at their convenience."
good,"Working at lowes can be a fun job if you enjoy customer service and fast paced work. you have to be good at multitasking. I enjoyed my job at lowes, it is always changing and kept me on my toes."
good,"It was a overall good place to work, some of the employees weren't career minded and didn't have a good attitude towards making the company a better place to work."
good,Lowes is a great company that brings a lot to the table for its associates and is overall a company that I've enjoyed working for these last few years.
good,"They got rid of most of the full time positions due to Obama Care etc. The workload for full time management has increased, as I have heard from other friends who still work there. Beware of a new culture and environment. I am not sure what it is like now and into the future."
good,"Lowes was an alright place to work. Had decent to good leadership great work environment., Quick paced environment if you dont mind that, Sometimes you get stuck pulling other peoples weight"
good,"Lowes was a great work experience. As a part time employee and a full time student, they offered me great pay while also giving me the opportunity to practice my sales skills in my position."
good,While frustrating at times the job inspired a feeling of satisfaction on helping customers and associates. But I strongly disagree with the binding of hands with all those managers laid off with a very strict no compete. If Lowe's didn't want them anymore then they should have been free to go anywhere they wanted. Those people showed their dedication and devotion for years and Lowe's tossed them aside and made it very hard for them to get a job.
good,"Only left because my position was eliminated in the restructure. "
good,"Learn fast and quick and you will succeed. Benefits are good, 401k company matching up to 6%. Opportunity for advancement in certain areas. The ability to do your job and do it well"
good,The manager was cool and frequently helped everyone.Over all i enjoyed working for Lowe's as a night shift stocker however i just could not get used to the night shift hours.
good,lowes was a good place to work and everyone I worked with were great people and everybody got along and we joked around that's what made the day go by quick
good,"I was usually able to get up to 30 or 40 hours a week , and got promoted to the customer service desk but with no raise . I saw no possibility of management in my career at Lowe's . The hardest part about the job is standing in once spot for almost 8 hours ."
good,"Good company with god benefits. Hourly shift is 8 hours, salaried shift is 10 hours.  There is room for advancement and potential for growth within the company."
good,"The company is a great place to work and the management is fair the only problem is that, everything changes on a dime and without much warning. The company does take care of their employees very well despite the last minute changes."
good,"Even with the recent management changes... it is still a very nice work environment.  Not many advancement opportunities. Very good benefits, including occasional parties for store achievements."
good,"Long hot days, in lumber you have to take care of the entire department, normally with one other person depending on shifts. It requires 2 people to operate (one operator, one spotter) the forklift, but often times nobody was found or willing to assist. The hardest part was keeping up with every customer when in the department alone and having to cover other departments for lunch or someone left early."
good,"I had never worked retail and thought when I got laid off that this might be fun because I had the Customer Service Experience.  Little did I know working retail is not the same.  You deal with people face to face which can be very stressful and difficult.  I have learned in the last 8 years how to deal with customers face to face because my management has taught me what to do when faced with a difficult customer.  My Assistant Store Managers are the best they will always have your back in any situation.  I have to say the hardest part of this job is when something does not go right in an install or product isn't delivered when it is suppose be.  You call vendors and expedite and still don't get the best answer that you want to hear.  You still have to give this information to the customer.  The best part of the job would be the opposite of my worst day and that is when everything you do to get the product to the customer on time and the install goes great and the customer says that your installers did a wonderful job, you were very helpful and it was such a pleasure to do business with Lowe's and they should be happy to have an employee like you.  This makes your day.  Most of the time the best part is the customers you meet, but I would have to say the most enjoyable part are the people you work with.  They are your second family...."
good,This was a good job.  Very corporate.  You work 30-40 hours per week if you are full time.  The schedule is not flexible; it is done by a computer program.  The company itself is good with time off and emergency situations (they will do their best to work with you).  Team is usually close and take care of one another.  Great entry level and great if you enjoy sales.
good,"Was a part-timer at Lowe's Home Improvement in Middleburg, FL. Always found I was learning on the job, and loved that it was fast-paced. Management definitely was not the best, and often had to page overhead repeatedly to get a response. Hardest part of the job was difficult coworkers to work with and most enjoyable part of the job was when the truck was finally unloaded! Overall great experience, just had a few bad apples at the store."
good,Working there was interesting. I learned the ins and outs of retail business. The hardest part of working at a place like Lowes is the work schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the new people you can meet.
good,Great training on the job . Provide positive attitude . Managers want you to suceed. I wish I could have stayed . But when I had my last child I needed to stay home with her. The only issue I had was when my children were sick and I had to stay home with one . And since I had 5 they looked down on me when I called in
good,"Lower is not a place to make a career out of unless you plan to move up in the company.  Pay is relatively low beginning, like most other retailers.  If you do move up it pays pretty well."
good,"It was alright. I left when my contract ended. Not really much opportunity for advancement from there. The workplace was friendly, though, and that made it tolerable."
good,"There was very little opportunity for advancement, and when the contract met its end I moved on. The work environment was good, and I was especially happy with how kind the staff was."
good,"Job is in retail so always quick paced and dealing with customer service is hit or miss. Paid well, enjoyed most of my co-workers and managers. Hours were rough with a family"
good,Quick paced work environment.  pretty decent hours for a person who didn't have a family at the time. Decently paid when I reached the management level.
good,"Good place to work. Friendly people."
good,Lowe's is typical retail environment where you work shifts depending on the store needs. You interact with customers and team members on a continuous basis.
good,"Overall, I think that the company is not afraid of change and will be around for a long time.  However, Lowe's has not moved to the forefront of change that could improve the quality of our work life.  Managers are still required to work 48 hours or more each week which means an early start and a late finish.  The pay is decent but not adequate for the amount of responsibility placed on the roll of Loss Prevention.  Also, there is consistent change in regional and director positions which makes it more difficult to build a relationship that would result in a promotion."
good,"Great place to work for anyone looking for a somewhat easy going job. Mainly just helping customers with ordering items, Loading to their car, or just helping them find things around the store. "
good,Management is okay. It ca be very fast paced. When you are full time the scheduling can be crazy if you work in the front end or the sales floor. Support positions have the better set schedules. I enjoy the volunteer programs and for most of the holidays free food is provided. Employees have the option once a year to buy stock at a discount price.
good,"Associates are expected to endure long hours on your feet while serving customers in a friendly, helpful manner."
good,Ok place to work. seemed to be more concerned with sore profits than employees hours Team worked with was good people and some of the assistant managers were good as well.
good,"Work days can be stressful somedays and easy and light on other. Management is all over the board with some relaxed managers, some micro managers, and some that have there favorites so they keep the worst employees clear from any disciplinary action and hold accountable the good associates that work extremely hard for the company."
good,"I began this job as a part-time Weekly We, assisting customer's with their shopping needs. Stocking shelves and moving heavy merchandise quickly became part of the job."
good,"Face to face interactions with the customers."
good,"I enjoyed working there, but my manager had no real management skills and didn't know how to order what we needed for stocking. He also didn't like to do physical labor."
good,It's great company to work for. Sometimes management is not great. There are many benefits but there is also to much favoritism. When you get a great manager your set.
good,"Lowe's was a company that was fun to work at and I felt that most of the employees cared about what they did and why they were there everyday. I feel that the hardest part about my job was being trained in so many different areas so quickly. Difficult, but not impossible."
good,nice place like the job rather have worked there full time but didnt work out but i did like it and i would recommend it for others to work there .. learned alot especially forklift driving
good,"My role was the PSI for Lowes. This is an active position. It was fun for me because I am creative, understand construction, liked working with people and providing solutions for kitchens and baths. I learned how to be a team player.  Lowes is a great place to work. The best part was meeting new clients and determining the best design to make them happy."
good,"I worked in 2 separate stores, in different states."
good,I enjoyed working at Lowes. They are very flexible with scheduling. I was in school full time and had a commitment in the Guard and they never denied me of days off that went along with school or the Guard.
good,"Worked for Lowe's for over 10 years that should stand on its own; retention rate within management is high. overall staffing in need, decent benefits good community efforts"
good,"Need some improvements regarding work distribution and responsibility vs salary."
good,"8 - 10 hours works days, met lots of customer and improved on customer service skills, enjoyed being able to get customers what they needed and seeing them happy with their purchases"
good,"Its a good place to work, I would recommend anyone to work there. Helping the wonderful customers find what they are looking for. Great team work with my employees. Working around dedicated individuals."
good,There have been several seemingly random management changes and a distinct predisposed favoritism to the people who work in the morning and evening shifts compared to the night shift which gets blamed for most of the mistakes or short comings whether of not they were the fault of the night shift or if they are the laziness of the other two shifts
good,"Working with the general public by placing or cancelling phone orders. The stress all depended on the customers calling in and what you had to do for them. There are so many processes to follow that it can get extremely overwhelming. Each day you are recorded and have goals to meet both daily, weekly, and monthly. Sometimes the environment can get really noisy which makes it harder to hear your customer clearly which in turn can affect the satisfaction of your call if you have to ask them to repeat or misunderstood something."
good,"Helping customers locate the products they needed, answering quest about all their home needs. I got to learn about new and upcoming tools and products."
good,"part time job for me. perfect job to supplement your pay and wellness goals. Learned a lot about construction, painting and flooring installation. Nice environment."
good,Worked with great people and made great friends. Some opportunities for advancement in departments. Flexible schedules especially for a college student.
good,"This is and awesome job to work out the pay is great and people are very friendly, I loved it here,  And work great with your schedule. Everyone is very helpful."
good,Management was not very good with scheduling me around my school hours or my PT sessions as i were in the Delayed entry program for the military. But overall it was a well balanced environment to work in.
good,"Fast paced but, would rather work hard and stay busy than idle and waste time.  The employees have become friends and it is a joy to work with them.Corporate would treat us to several employee appreciation events thru the year so we did get to spend quality time with coworkers and other events."
good,"Lowe's is not a terrible place to work,but as my son gets older working the hours they require can be a bit of a task. Missing a lot of his night time activities is something I would like to correct. I have the ability to work in multiple departments So I am constantly being moved to other departments when they ae lacking support in those areas. I do not mind this but again It changes my schedule and makes it hard on family time. I love my coworkers and customers they make work very rewarding."
good,Always something new around the corner and really fast paced.  I learned time management and how to show customers what customer service really is.  Management really steps up to the plate when needed.
good,I loved my time at Lowes. The Team and people are fantastic. The Hours and work schedules are not. Lowes has a good business culture and they've got solid work instructions and procedures in place. The new business model is a concern
good,Lowes is a good place to work but lowes looses it hours in the winter and im just part time at lowes so the full timers get there hours first.management is excellent there.
good,Liked lowes. Started as cashier and was promoted. Left for more money at competitors but made mistake in doing so.  This company was good to its employees fir a retail sales company. Learned a lot about sales and inventory control.
good,"Lowe's has an amazing community of employees and customers, the work is fast paced and rewarding.  It is a great job coming right out of school, would be a great career for someone who can take a lot of stress."
good,Working at Lowes was nice because you did your job and you went home where it didn't follow you. The management was good and the pay was alright but it's not really enough to pay the mortgage.
good,great people I worked hard and was acknowledged for it constantly I liked the ability to cross train in different departments to better my chances for advancement and better the store.
good,Friendly staff.  Provided occassional fun activities and celebrations for employees.  A lot of computer training for specific jobs provided.  Computer room available for employees for continuing education. Decent wages and good company benefits available after 6 months.
good,"Decent job if you lack better options, but don't expect a career if you don't want to be a manager. For students this can be an easy job, managers are pretty flexible about scheduling part timers."
good,Great place to to work. Only down side is not enough full time positions. They have mostly part timers. The people I worked with were great. Customers were very friendly.
good,"Long hours, physical labor, intense work load"
good,"Department Managers wonderful. Favoritism on any advancement on who you know, not on how you work. They since then have gotten rid of the upper Management so I do not know at this time."
good,Lowes is currently cutting all management jobs in the US.  They have hired more PRN workers and changing entire management program for the company.  I want to be able to have more opportunities to advance in my career.
good,Lowes is a good company to work for they could use some restructuring of the health insurance but other wise good place to start or plant roots. It is a fun place to work if you are a people person.
good,"Decent work environment. Very difficult to advance. Pretty good benefits and pay. The environment really depends on which locations you work at. They take pretty good care of the cashiers, but they over abuse the floor associates."
good,"Lowes is a good place to work as a starter job, not much room for advancement after the recent restructure. The job is fun but the pay is low. Bosses actually care about you."
good,This review is irrelevant since my work history there is over 10yrs. ago.  They have restructured and reduced workforce since I left the company.  I will say the company taught me a lot about the industry and product knowledge of the merchandise it sold.
good,"This is a great place to work with decent benefits. The culture here is fun loving and about family, work family and the family at home.  As with any big box retailer management can change at any time.  Some of the changes as a company are good and some not.  The hardest part of the job is getting to know the products and where they are in the store.  Some of the most enjoyable are the associates you work with and getting to know the customers."
good,Lowes is not a bad place to work but working on the phone is just not my cup of tea I like working on my feet not used to sitting all day . dealing with the customers and the stores is very stressful at times
good,"this is one of the best places i have worked at, schedule is tight but fun at the same time .  managers are super friendly, everyone is willing to help no matter what department they work in"
good,Had a good time working there from making deliveries to helping out around the store. Often there were company cookouts and parties. Got to meet a lot of nice people.
good,The hours were very long and split shifts.  Had to work too many weekends without having any off weekends. This job was stressful and a lot negative behavior.
good,"If retail is what your planning to do, then Lowe's isn't too bad. Pay is better than most places, but like a lot of retailers understaffed. A lot of times management is not around or very helpful, but that could just be the store I am working in."
good,I learned from always keeping on my toes because it would get so busy and the managers always schedule minimum amount of employees so i would always struggle to help the people on the floor even though i was a cashier. They have really good benefits but i never enrolled in them. We would have cashier meetings every two months to improve ourselves and have a little get together.
good,"At Lowe's you never know what kind of day awaits you, which keeps from ever having a boring day. A typical day would consist of employee engagement and task responsibilities. Ensuring all specialty departments such as Delivery and Receiving are set up for the day ahead without issue. Opening of the store would include all monies being put out along with overview of the previous days business including Sales, Comps, Loss Prevention issues.  Daily Safety Review of all Departments to comply with Company Safety Standards to ensure a safe working and shopping experience."
good,was a good place to work for. I am going to miss the team I have been with for years!! I learn a lot about retail and management how to work with other and to build them up to get the most out of them.
good,"A typical day at work includes getting together with your department manager and going over the days tasks and making sure everything is understood about how to execute to meet the expectations. Helping customers while dealing with tasks. Cleaning up your area before your shift ends."
good,This was a work place full of outgoing people and the values Lowe's carries are always enforced. There is always something to do or customers to help.
good,This job offers a long term advancement system. There are long term growth opportunities for this job. If the home life interests you and you probably think you can sell a lawn mower for you whole life this job is for you!
good,"management is just like any other job, you like some and you hate some. Overall its a good place to work, but its hard to make it as a career. They recently did an overhaul of management and cut a lot of people. This restructuring made it really hard to move up in the company."
good,"Nice place to work, changes happens often, benefits are great. Company is in transition and changes occur often. But it is a good place to work, especially if you are young."
good,"while i was working at 960, i learned various aspects of the distrobution industry. after three month got trained on numerous diff forklifts, i started in shipping department loading trucks with product to be shipped out."
good,"Lowe's has become extremely busy in call volume as sales periods hit and customers are looking for status updates.  The hiring for contact centers is non-stop to try and reach service levels. "
good,I found it to be a productive and busy environment to work in which is always good. There were always opportunities to learn new things about my job while working as a lumber associate.
good,"I worked for Lowes for over 10 yr.  When I was hired I was given unlimited access to my availability.  Down the road we got a new HR manager who seemed to take exception to that privilege.  Long story short, it was a constant battle .......... I had requested time off to have my shoulder operated on (my dime) didn't blame it on Lowes.  HR has stood in my way to rejoin Lowes, said I missed too much time!  PS:  I received an award in 2006 for 100% attendance and then in 2016 for 10 yr. without any work related injuries.  Go figure?"
good,"Nice place to work with great employees who are more like an extended family. There is always someone willing to help out when needed, regardless of what department they are assigned to."
good,Great co-workers throughout the store. Pay was good for work required. Management could be improved in several areas. Human resources was very flexible with my scheduling due to being in school at the time.
good,"Although most positions are part time, I think the job would be good for someone who likes working with lots of different people and likes to stay busy."
good,"I enjoy working with people, overall a good place to work.  The job is challenging and the days are sometimes long but working with the public is rewarding."
good,The Lowes I worked for flowed well until the new Store Manager took over and everyone started leaving. They couldn't keep employees so the rest of us had to work even harder and that took away from the enjoyment of the job.
good,"Positions were rotated well, everyone was fun to be around, but technology was very outdated and slow, some employees were left to do as they pleased."
good,Lowes was a great career path for me. I spent 9 years managing a store and I will say the opportunity for growth and opportunity for change was always present. I feel Lowes is always looking for way to change and ways to grow towards the customer needs in particular the on line shoppers.
good,Lowes is a good company. Most days are busy assisting customers find items to improve their lives. The best part of the job is helping someone find something they needed or showing them how to make things easier.
good,"To work for Lowe's you have to be self motivated.  Since the restructure, there is not much guidance in each department.  That tends to make some people not want to do anything at all.  Team work is essential.  There is a lot to learn but with patience it can be done.  Working with and helping people is the best part of this job."
good,"As a seasonal employee my experience was beneficial from the knowledge required in order to properly work in the departments, I gained a great amount of wisdom while working at Lowe's Home Improvement."
good,In my time at Lowe's i have learned everything I have been able to in order to make myself a better employee. I have embraced all the challenges and jobs my managers have given me and yet i am still making the same amount as i was when I first started and was just a cashier.
good,Lowes is a fun and energenic place to work. Customer service is the culture and a mix of customers is to say the least. the room for groth has changed as the positions have changed. overall a decent place to work
good,"Work day starts at 5 AM, I get my tasks for the day and begin to work on them with my team. The job is always different so the week generally goes by quickly and we usually have a good time working on the assigned resets."
good,"Lowes is a good company to work for as long as you have good peolple working with you. You can make the best out of any situation, so Lowes is a go to job for majority."
good,At Lowe's you're going to learn A LOT about almost everything that goes into home improvement... From plumbing to lawn/garden care. They do a good job of consistently hiring good people with good work ethics too.
good,"Designed and Sold Kitchen and Bathroom Remodel projects. Responsible for Design, Product Selection and Contract building. Responded to Customer Issues after the Sale and during Installation."
good,"Long hours, great people and management, pay is decent, long hours of being on your feet, Management takes care of there employees. Very busy all year round."
good,My days Started at 5 am I had to be on time because I had to disburse and count money. Once done with that there was a lot of paperwork and banking transaction. Lowes for some reason always changed managers. But with each one I learned something new. The last one wasn't very friendly but he taught me a easier way to research discrepancies and wrote me up cause I didn't know about that report. The hardest part about working at Lowes was if I missed one step in counting the self check outs it would throw the whole system off for days. I worked here for six years I loved this job it was easy and the customers were nice and friendly they even brought lunch for the entire store for certain holidays. I enjoyed my coworkers its always good when you can laugh and talk with people.
good,"Fun place to work! decent pay, nice hours... but what made things challenging was to deal with the miscommunication within the store. Between workers, management, and corporate offices, communication was greatly lacking. Sometimes when needing an override from a manager for a particular matter, the customer and myself (as a cashier) could be waiting for over twenty minutes even after making multiple phone calls, getting a wrap around. Just a bad system of doing things"
good,"Lowes is a good place to work for minimum wage. Every co worker is great, which makes it an enjoyable place to work. The job itself, loader, is a decent job for high school kids, or people who do not have an education yet."
good,the company as a whole tries hard to campaign for a there employees and there families to be healthy overall and have set goals and plans for there future.
good,"very fast pace work envronment. I enjoyed working with the customer s to help with their issuses. what I liked about the culture was all reps "
good,the people who work there are really good people a lot of work experience and i learned a lot of stuff and ways to do my work was very nice but the managers were below par.
good,Love the job and it's benefits with discounts and advantages of doing the right thing most managers attendees whenever you needed them to be available always satisfied customers
good,"I really enjoyed helping the public with their projects."
good,Fine place to work in.  Really enjoy working here.  Changes in the last six months have been challenging.  Team works well together in order to give our customers the best shopping experience.
good,"I learned how to to drive forklifts, orde pickers and reach trucks and lots of information that was about gardening "
good,"Great job, they advance from the inside. maybe the hardest part of the job is taking product off the truck by hand and the way the Center loads the truck"
good,Good work place for a second job. Coworkers can often be melodramatic. Great management and slight sense of loyalty to the company appeal to many employees.
good,If you have ever worked for a large retail company then this place will be no surprise.  Lowe's does try to take care of its staff more than a lot of other places I have worked.  However the management at my store does fall short.  There is a lot of favoritism and politics at going on.
good,"The flooring department at Lowe's was a fun, fast paced environment with something new learned everyday. We gain new product and installation knowledge everyday granting us more qualified the more we work."
good,"typical day at work: work hard but have fun."
good,"Very fast paced, high pressure. Pleasant employees. Good benefits. Good atmosphere. Paid time off. High energy level positions not many full time positions"
good,The customer is always there is no if what and but with customer when they get an idea in there head that's what they and there is nothing you can do to change there mind even if it benefits them.
good,Never can plan anything because you never know when you will get off. You rarely get off on time. And not enough help in our department. And if you do get any overtime they try and take it back from you at the end of the week.
good,"hot in summer cold in winter meet a lot of people had to leave do to preemie baby and new management  head cashier was nice,meet my husband there and others"
good,Was not given the opportunity to advance to the level that I would have hoped for. Great opportununity to meet new people in a fast paced environment.
good,If you show up and are dependable you can pick up plenty of hours. It's better to be a part timer than a full time though. Full timers are always scrounging for hours.
good,"Typical day would include a OSHA safety check, setting up power equipment, stocking shelves, and helping customers. I learned how to deal with different personalities. Culture was very good. Hardest part of job was when it got slow. Most enjoyable was when you made a customer happy."
good,"Enjoyed working there, very fast paced for department manager.  Would have liked a little overtime to finish items for the day or week never felt secure in job."
good,"Lowe's Hardware store is a great place to work if you are interested in Customer service and learning about wood, paint, plumbing, electrical devices and how to educate customers"
good,"great company too work for great benefits, good workers, and great managers. they work well with students too. The moat enjoyable is talking to the customers."
good,Working at Lowes was great! Such a friendly place to work and we get to enjoy ourselves and have fun as well as being professional! You get flexible hours and communicate with lots of different people every single day!
good,excellent work place everyone got along and management was great learned a lot short time employed diverse place hardest part was loading trucks enjoyable part speaking with customers
good,"Weekend team is fast-paced."
good,Work a 10 hours a day concern about your life and religion. Work well with management.  Was a great store to work in. Work well with you on time off. Asked favor to do things above your normal job and was glad to help.
good,Overall outstanding place to work with great benefits offered to both full time and part time associates. Lowes provides a culture where advancement is based upon the individuals drive and motivation.
good,Fun place to work for the past 12 years.  Lots of changes over the past year or two.  Not much advancement opportunity.  I want more empowerment to help drive the decision making process.
good,"Lowe's,"
good,For a job to get you on your feet and to start building your finances this is a good company to work at. Good pay and good schedule. Room to promote up if desired.
good,"Lowe's was an enjoyable job, coworkers became like family, and assisting the customers was fun.  Benefits were good for retail, and part-time employees received benefits as well.  The best part of the job was the people: both the coworkers and customers"
good,Work life balance was not that good.  Compensation was subpar compared to same positions at other retailers.  Dynamic LP leadership and a great place to learn.
good,"A typical day at work for me is working inside/outside on register, customer service, helping customers, cashing them out, lifting merchandise into their vehicle, helping other employees, cleaning the registers and any other chores to keep me busy."
good,"The staff and managers at Lowes are nice and reasonable. Its a happy and welcoming environment especially for staff, only thing is customers can be rude especially in school wear."
good,"Good work good people, managers can be hit or miss, it's open door policy, but don't expect anything to be done. I have had one manager constantly on my case since I started, the others all like me. Like I said, managers are hit or miss, but mostly cool"
good,"For a retail position you are paid decently and benefits are not too bad. Unfortunately, the normal retail issues are there, managment favorites and hard hours due to varying schedules. There were days I would leave at 11pm and be expected back at 6am. But overall, one of the best retail establishments I have ever worked for."
good,punch in look down the area where i would be working put away items make sure all the area was fully stock take care of customers with there orders place orders on line make sure the area was clean and ready for the next person to take over and punch out
good,You may often be skipped for advancement even if you have ample experience in said department/area. Also positions can come and go over night making your experience null/void. Also hard to get full time.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and most of the managers were very nice. I had a hard time with there computer system and could not get help for training
good,can have slow days and busy days. A lot of standing up on your feet. this is just another cashier customer service job. some people are easy to work with and others are not. some managers play favoritism to certain employees. I don't particularly care for this. the hardest part of the job is being on your feet your whole shift. Working with people that make your job easy and free flowing is what I like most.
good,I have worked for Lowes for 3+ years and have met many good people that I work with . I also have met many of our local contractors and companies in our area.
good,Lots of opportunity to train in different departments. Fun work environment. Opportunity to pick up shifts in different departments in so desired. Good starting pay.
good,"Great introduction to retail sales and transitioned to exterior sales specialist , selling projects to customers in their home. Able to manage customers home improvement project from inception to completion"
good,"What makes this job great is that everyone down in Lumber works hard together always helping each other out by loading up whatever the customers needs be that a pallet of concrete or a bundle of lumber we always help each other out. The hardest thing about working down in lumber however is that well its hard and often we are under staffed and fall behind trying to help all the customers that need it, but with all the jokes we crack and encouragement we give each other there is never a dull moment."
good,management was good with the constraints that they had with the corporate mandates that they had to work with. It had a friendly work place culture. The hardest part of the job was being able to train new hires as there was no training manual. The best part was when I recieved customer compliments on my design work
good,I really enjoy the work environment. The work is very physical and it is hot in the warehouse. The pay is comparable and they have a geat benefit package.
good,Customer focused culture with safety being the main focus.  Great opportunity for advancement.  Great way to meet new people everyday.  At times can be overwhelming
good,I learned more about different items and appliances in lowes. The most enjoyable part for me was the other employees i worked with. I loved with i was able to work outside in the garden center.
good,"This location has excellent Management. Great co-worker Morale and support."
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work at, they pay well, and it's a good environment. Job can become a little stressful, but overall it is one of the better companies you could work for."
good,Was a nice place to work just not very helpful or geared towards helping employees with family time or personal and emergency situations.but learned alot
good,"It was a privilege to have worked for a great retail environment as far as customers go! Learned so much over the 5 years I worked for Lowe's. Hardware, Lumber, Paint and Home Décor are just a few departments I learned so much in and developed great relationships with customers."
good,It was a great place to work climate controlled environment. Safety is first. You meet a lot of people and at times it can be very busy. Lots of luncheons and store get togethers.
good,"A typical day starts out by walking the appliance and kitchen departments. Then making a work list of what needs to be accomplished that day/week. I look at all outstanding and currant customer orders to see if any follow up is required. The remainder of my day is assisting customers with making purchases and resolving any customer issues or complaints. Throughout the day between customers I work on department maintenance."
good,"Working at Lowes is not for everyone, you have to enjoy interacting with different personalities on a daily basis. Like any job, it requires patience and perseverance. However, working at Lowes is never a dull moment, specially if you like working in fast pace environment."
good,"Lowe's is a fast-pace, customer service focused environment to work at. Face to Face interactions with customers of many backgrounds with various needs, builds crucial communication, and task related skills. Lowe's offers many opportunities, through jobs in different fields, to expand one's skill set and work experience."
good,On a day to day basis it was a 12 hour shift with 3 breaks. I would have to maintain the pace i was loading the trailers in many different weather conditions.
good,"I'm not a very social person, but working at Lowe's was enjojayble for my first 2 years. Once the new store manager came around it felt like all the employees lumped their responsibilities on me."
good,Good place to work family atmosphere enjoyed my job until I was told my position would no longer be part of Lowes plan. Lowes has provided for my family for 24 years plus but is now discontinuing my job.
good,"working here was great, people are very friendly. work can be hard but easy to learn. management is working with you here. customers are also very nice."
good,"They worked with my school schedule but can't be full time without open availability even if you can work 40 hours. you get a good amount of vacation and sick days and even part timers get vacation time, but about five weeks of the year are mandatory work days because of how busy they are but that's retail for you. Management is pretty nice. all in all, a good place to work if you are used to the hustle and bustle of retail."
good,"When working at Lowe's Home Improvement everyday, you have to come here ready to work. On a typical day, it is pretty busy especially on weekends. From being here almost a year and a half, I have learned many things such as training on how to cut blinds, drive a forklift and how to run a register. The management here isn't the greatest in the world but one thing I can say is that they will work with you as far as working and scheduling."
good,"Minus the time we had a manager that sexually harassed female workers all the other managers were really nice and tried to help you any time they could."
good,"I've never seen so much leniency on attendance in my life. This is a great place to work, especially while in school or if you live near by. Great if you are not looking to commit yourself fully to a place."
good,"I've never seen so much leniency on attendance in my life. This is a great place to work, especially while in school or if you live near by. Great if you are not looking to commit yourself fully to a place."
good,"People were very friendly, I learned a lot about the receiving processes and how the order of operations worked.  Hardest part was moving all the refrigerators, and washers."
good,Was a good place to work with friendly people and managers.  Had great benefits and got regular reviews with pay increases. Overall a very nice place to work.
good,"Good place to work if you don't mind the schedule the pay is good, benefits are good.  Customers can be challenging.   Holidays and weekends are busy times so usually required to work."
good,A good place to start that will include advancement options. They offer training for any thing you want to know. Also have very knowledgeable and friendly employees that will help each other
good,they were always having something to show appreciation for the employees. upbeat working environment. ..................................................
good,"Productive and reasonably friendly place to work. However, there needs to be more employees hired to handle the workload/customers Customers are always asking questions or need to be guided to the merchandise they are trying to purchase.  With so few employees available on hand - it's almost impossible to help every customer. Overall - a fairly decent work environment."
good,"Loved lowes and the people. Very simple and easy job. Always reward the employees with lunch. Pay was ok. Managers were very nice and easy to work with ,"
good,Job was okay.  Unloaded trucks and stocked shelves at night.  Pay was low.  Seasonal work.  Took what I could get at the time.  Good company.  Would've liked to work full time
good,Punching in checking the garden to see what needs to be done for the day and getting to work.Watering preening and moving plants and products. Learned a lot about the different kind of plants.Management was helpful. Hardest part was going up ladders. (don't like heights.) The people I worked with.
good,"A typical day is very busy. Lots of meetings, meetings about meetings. It can sometimes be counter productive. I can honestly say that having been given the opportunity, I have learned more  working at Lowe's than I have at most other jobs I've had. The skills I've obtained have made me much more marketable.  The hardest part of the job is getting things done timely.  Having to depend on other teams to communicate status updates, etc can be difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job is my team.  Great group to work with."
good,"Management needs to be well versed in Driving internal retail sales. Must know how to manage inventory to maximize sales opportunities"
good,"Overall good place, but wages not related to skills or worth necessarily."
good,"Helping customers find what they needed for their next project or"
good,This was my first job and a great one at that.  I enjoyed the environment and the culture.  I also enjoyed the people I worked with.  Managers were open and easy going and the company is a good one to work for with advancement opportunities.
good,"I work at Lowes only for a few months. The coworker were great in my stores, the management also. My Manager let me know exactly what she expected for me every day and give me an appreciation of my work either at the end of the project or the following day. You have a great support around, all employee would stop to help you if you need help with something. But it is difficult to get a permanent position in the store. Only the strong, and handworker may expect to be awarded full time role if it happen to be available. That is why I have enjoyed my time at Lowes"
good,Lowes has changed drastically in the last few months. It went from a great place to work with happy employees to a place most have grown to hate. I would not recommend working here.
good,Fast paced work environment that can become hectic depending of staffing during the day. Turnover is decent but pay increase for promotions and yearly pay raises. Can cause hesitation in taking promotions. Interviews are done off simple scenario that might have happened through career but do not inquiry to the interviewees perceived strengths
good,lowes is a very good company great benefits an insurance an lots of other great options. the work is tough in tough conditions but all in all its a great job
good,"I like working at Lowe's in Columbus,oh. because i got to interact with customers,help an providing good customer care service to all,my job required me to ring customers out,  an also load an unload trucks at Lowe's"
good,"Great company that is willing to invest in their people thru training, schooling and mentoring. Their core principals aligned very well with mine which created a long term career with many opportunities and challenges that made you better."
good,Needs to improve on ways employees can advance in their careers. Lowes recently phased out the department manager position leaving many employees on a temporary status
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Lowe's, but with the recent shift in management it has become different. They recently underwent a staffing change and it has changed the culture of the stores."
good,"Typical day at lowes may very, could be slow or very upbeat. I have learned a lot from this company, how to do refunds, how to sell special order product, how to deal with angry customers, problem-solving, product that needs to be picked up later, internet orders, paint mixing, key cutting etc. Management has been all over the place always seeing new faces but our team has always been strong. The hardest thing about my job working at customer service I would have to say is not being able to help everyone there are thing I have yet to learn. Being with a company that big its hard to learn everything when your stuck in one position I've tried to move to other areas of the store to learn but its hard when there isn't good coverage or the jobs you apply for you get turned down. The most enjoyable part I would say is experience I've learned, a lot on my own and with help. People I am a people person i like to help weather the customer is being unpleasant or not i want them to leave feeling better then when they walked in."
good,Learned a lot about ware house management and developed a lot of my personal skills there. Great work staff family environment. I just feel little under utilized is all
good,"good pay, good benefits.  as a manager you work 50-60 hours per week so family is difficult.  loved most of the associates/customers."
good,"Not a bad place to work. Lots of ""he said, she said"" . Pay is good for starting pay. Need to know math skills if in lumber. Great if you like to build things."
good,"Lowe's is great for temporary work or just to gain any work experience in general. As with any place, there are some minor issues with corporate and management, but it's not too bad."
good,"My day at lowe's would start out with a smile and great customer focus,i pick up some very special skills,( rekeying locks, and programing keys, and creating special orders), the environment was fun and friendly, I met some very kind people.  I loved coming to work because it was so simple and the people were nice."
good,Great people. I had a lot of good times here. For the most part I found that the people there truly wanted to do a good job. As long as the store manager is solid everything should be good. The biggest problem was resolved a while back with restructuring of Upper management
good,"great place to work at, many opportunities to challenge yourself.  It has that family friendly work environment.  Full and part time positions makes it easy to work around your schedules."
good,"The job was ok for being a retail job. The paid was higher than the average. Some customers were very nice, come very rude. Theres an employee discount, and managment was good."
good,"Good career opportunities at the stores. Very strong team effort in most locations."
good,I have been with Lowe's for several years and have seen several ups and downs but in the last few years is when majority of the changes have been happening; mostly for the good but some are still unclear. Overall a good company to work for but you also need to adapt with the changing times.
good,I walked around Lowes telling people about products and where they were in the store. I was a very social job which I enjoyed but being on your feet for 11 hours at a time was a little stressful.
good,Employee expectations were clearly stated and management was more than wiling to teach. Scheduling was very good. Hardest part of the job was the repetitiveness.
good,I was hired very quickly and felt accepted just as quickly. the pay was good the hours were good. and the people and work environment was even better.
good,"a changing company, going away from department managers to more part time employees. looking at evolving employees who can meet customer needs on various formats. usually good bonus potential for upper management if you get a favorable budget."
good,This company offers great benefits and there is a lot of room for growth in certain areas.  The culture is laid back and you are allowed to wear jeans everyday!  The campus is beautiful!
good,not a bad place to work and they work around your schedule. managers are apporchable and listen. They take care of veterans and offer excellent discounts
good,Love working with customer and problem solving.  I answer customer questions and provide process direction.  I also ensure that invoices are paid in a timely manner.
good,pretty normal customer service job that requires face to face interaction with customers. Knowledge of tools or appliance is not really needed
good,"it was nice work,  for this company . but hard to get full time.. I like working with the public and great  co-workers there always there when you need them. sometimes you have to work over night, not a lot but at least three times a year for about two weeks each . it was just hard going from nights to days again. The best thing was always something new each day."
good,Even though it was low tech and low pay I enjoyed working there. I got along with the employees and management staff there. It was an exciting place to work.
good,Working at Lowes is very enjoyable. Customers can sometimes rely on a sales associate with there success in a project. Being relied on that much makes it easier for sales associates to stay on point and be ready to give suggestions.
good,You meet so many different people from different cultures. I learn alot from different people that i have met. So many different paints and colors i was able to learn about.
good,"I learned so much whilst working for Lowes. I was a first time home buyer so it couldn't have been a more perfect time for me to chose to work in that environment. I learned about housing materials, plants, appliances, power equipment, corporate audits . I learned how to contact vendors and get credit for damaged merchandise, how to stage merchandise, how to manage a crew of 10 guys at once . Do all of that and at the same time schedule trucks for the next day while running the receiving area smoothly. It was noisy all of the time but there was some great commraderie between myself and those guys and I wouldn't exchange that for anything."
good,"The work environment is friendly and the management was supportive and encouraging. I learned better customer service skills and how to work more efficiently under pressure. The work was fast paced, often requiring multi-tasking. The hardest part of the job was remaining collected and calm during busy hours and rushes. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction from accomplishing the work and helping customers."
good,This company is a good place to advance with.  I started as a cashier while in college and worked my way up through the ranks to store manager.
good,Friendly culture of overall employees. Company willing to work around your personal schedule. Quarterly bonuses and anual pay raises.
good,"I enjoy the type of work I do in the receiving field, every day is a challenge.I do the job to the best of my ability and project a can-do attitude.The company has many benefits for everyone."
good,"Working at Lowe's teaches one to be alert to ones surroundings and to keep a journal of things learned. Other than the main Point of Sale, there are many systems that are incorporated with the company. The largest challenge is keeping aware of the massive staff throughout each day. The best part is interacting with new customers regularly and building a lasting relationship with them."
good,Management has just changed so most managerial positions are closed and more part time positions open. So this is more of a entry level job
good,"Excellent work environment, including but not limited to Management, Co-Workers, Safe and Clean. Management would work with you with scheduling. They would also pitch in with stocking when needed"
good,"Typical retail environment.  Good compensation for work."
good,This is a good company to start your job searching. Their pay is very good to start off even as a cashier and they are great with working around your schedule.
good,"Great place too work , Teamwork All time .   Fun , busy . :) lots of multi tasking could be little overwelment if you have no experience with people ."
good,"Like with any company there are politics involved, but overall this is a solid company. The company has a good reputation and advertising dollars drive steady foot traffic. Management overall is pretty good and care about the associates."
good,great company to work for. you have the ability to advance in multiple fields. recommend to anyone who is interested in learning more about transportation and distribution
good,"Alot of management are like ying and yang, there will be good and bad. But they work with you, and you'll make friends. Just do your work, and talk polite around and to customers. If they give you trouble, call a manager, its their job to talk to difficult customers."
good,No day was like the previous.  A dynamic ever changing work environment.  A safe place to work on all fronts.  The benefits offered were very good.  If needed a benefit Lowe's offered something within the options.
good,"Nice working with people, helping customers with their projects.nice fellow co workers to much micro managing with the Assistant Store Managers."
good,"I have worked for Lowe's for 13 years as of next month. It is not only retail but far more demanding than your typical retail store. The products are more involved, often including installation and delivery services and your customer base expects far more expertise than from your local Target or Wal-Mart employee. There are the commonplace issues of understaffing, payroll tightening, etc. but in all fairness Lowe's has been a fair employer to me. They do attempt to meet their employees half way, the wages are competitive and the benefits are very good."
good,"Clock in, check if we are checking inside or outside. Assist customers, make sure you check the security tag so that the door does not go off. Get random breaks."
good,Good people. Nice work environment. Management is good. Good culture. A system/sop that drives everyone to achieve the common goal. Holiday celebration.
good,Productive place to work for the job is never boring and there is always something new to learn. The management team is great.
good,"work about 12 or so hours, but you are off for 3 days and the best part of the week.. the weekends."
good,"A typical day at work should include daily chores/tasks to be completed. The usual unorthodox customer, who plans to ruin everyone's day, and a lot of hard work. I've learned so much through the years of working, in many different work environments. Management is not in my future. I'm more of a do-it-myself kind of person, not the type to demand others to do my tasks. I do my very best to get along with co-workers, even if they don't try to get along with me. I feel that it is extremely important to have a solid team when working. The hardest part of the job is when there is a problem that I cannot fix. If a customer asks a question that I do not know, or cant help him/her find, it begins to become very difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job is simply that I'm working to take care of myself. There's always a great feeling knowing that I am secure in my financial position."
good,Normal day starts off with cleaning up the department and taking care of any issues that may have came up since last shift worked.
good,Better than average pay for retail.  Poor work life balance.  Full time employees have to rotate hours sched.  Never the same.  Very hard to plan things with family.  Better than average pay for retail job.
good,"I would open the store 5 days a week, and started by running the Zamboni to clean all the floors. Made sure all lighting and fixtures were in working order as well as the entire store. When the store opened they would have me doing multiple tasks, due to being ahead of my required tasks for the day. Such as deliver helper, working in the lumber area mostly, and running the forklift. The only hardest part was cleaning the restrooms."
good,Lowe's is a good place to work if you are looking for a straight forward job with a flexible schedule. I enjoyed working there because the other employees made the job enjoyable.
good,Made a lot of friends on the job while working. Plenty of advancement opportunities for hard workers. Management isn't always up to par but when I left many of the manager with poor logic and management skills were being let go.
good,"Loading/unloading trucks, pulling accessories for delivery demands."
good,"its work, able to pay bills, you find great deals on products that was returned by costumers.  10 percent discount to all employees."
good,"Well organized primary store, good work enviroment. good communications with store manager.  Like all the associates I work with. Clean store, inside and out."
good,Each day is a different experience and it is an excellent opportunity to learn as an ASM. The management oversees a diverse group of employees and focus mainly on teamwork. Hours of a typical day can be long and involve a lot of physical labor.
good,"Great Company, great benefits...They care about their stats more than the Employees. Maybe a different department than CDO"
good,I like the fact in my position I'm able to have different jobs daily. After a day of work I'm able to see a completed project. Helping people love where they live!
good,Management provides very little feedback and interaction with employees. There needs to be daily interaction between managers and employees with desired expectations and goals discussed. Also notice a lot of good employees leaving because of little chance of advancement within.
good,"As i am only able to work on Saturdays i don't really know what the rest of the week is like. While working here i have learnt a lot such as fitting someone for a suit, or helping with the banking. The manager is great and fun to work with, as well as my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with angry customers, however it evens out as you always have those regular customers or even some new ones who are absolutely lovey and understand how hard it can be at times."
good,"Lowe's is a good company to work for. Depending on the location and it's employees, things can get a little hectic. Most of the people are team oriented. Some of the management are so hungry for their bonuses, they'll be quick to cut your hours if it benefits their wallets. Not all the managers are like that though. The co-workers and the customers are what make the job fun. Be wiling to help people, a lot of people. It is easy to advance, depending on who is in charge at the location. I have learned a lot there from a manager's perspective. Head Cashiers are literally on the bottom totem pole of management, yet are considered as managers, just not of the department."
good,"If you like dealing with a high volume customers, sales without commission or the repetitiveness then this is a job for you. Great company if you are looking to get into retail or looking to advance your retail career. Also an excellent job for students!"
good,"I ran into issues with scheduling, and there were a few managers who had poor communication with others in my department.  There were also issues with the space we have allowed with large trucks in congested areas."
good,"customer service dealing with lumber and building supplies"
good,"Large busy store most of time, so if you like to stay busy like i do, then you will like the pace of Lowe's. Above average pay for certain positions with health insurance and 401k."
good,I really enjoy working here. I think we are underpaid for what we are required to do. Management understands but the job is very overwhelming.. over 100 customers and just unable to mange effectively and give the customers the satisfaction they deserve..
good,Just a temporary job but It was fun while I was there I stocked lumber department and also did customer service. Swepted the floors and scrubbed my department
good,Learned a lot  loved the family atmosphere . but the micro management of this story was a bit much . after twenty years it became to Mich and being understaffed becomes to much for emolyees and costumers
good,it's a ok place to work but you have to have the right manager in place in order to move up  and the work is easy  to do overall it's a good place to be .
good,"I've only worked in the one store,  So my opinion is  based on my experiences  there.   We've had three Store Managers since I started, each with there own personality and emphasis on what's needed to ultimately drive sales up.  Overall I would rate each of them a strong 8.  The atmosphere in the store is generally pleasant  and there is a concerted effort  on the part of management and associates to make it so.   Problems if and when they arrive tend to take a little longer to resolve than I would like, but of course that depends on the problem.  Overall it's not a bad place to work. I've never been in a company where there ""line level ""  employees have been with the company for so long.  i.e.   some associates have been with the company as long as 5 plus years.  That surprised me at first  because at that level , there usually a high turnover rate.  But I've been here for going on three years myself so I get it."
good,"Lowes is a great company to work for, on my worst day at lowes i still enjoy the environment that is strived to achieve, management is fairly consistent and lowes hiring process typically ensures helpful people are hired, for the most part."
good,"I have been working for Lowe's just over 4 years.  It's a great place to learn and grow.  Schedules have their challenges.  "
good,Great place to work however lacks in pay. Management is pretty good and listens well to their employees. They have a number of policies in place to help engage their employees.
good,"Able to setup for inventory  and learn the steps to management"
good,It is a food prep work where each day we made food to sell to costumers. Also worked as costumer service and cut deli meats and cheeses.
good,"a typical day at work is usually standing at your register, helping customers or other tasks. Coworkers are friendly and help you out whenever you need it . It helped me learn to be more fast paced and learn more quickly while still keeping up with customer interaction"
good,Management has their favorites and doesn't discipline when needed to. Everybody is great to get along with. Easy going people.
good,"I loved my position in the receiving department, but not as a night stocking associate. Unable to balance life working nights. Mentally, emotionally, and physically draining while working nights,"
good,I had a overall great experience working for Lowes. The compensation is great due to the many great benefits you have for working there. I learned a lot about managing and being more of a people person while working there as well.
good,if working in a stressful environment is your cup of tea then you will love this place new employees are not properly trained and are constantly quiting which leaves the store short staffed
good,Typical day at lowes you come in do your job in a timely manner go home. The management team is great very helpful and knowledgeable
good,Very fun and active work place. People are always up to speed to keel cutsomers pleasant and leveling with the right products. Very good place to work
good,A typical day at work was good. I learned how to work with others and customers. My co-workers were a lot better than I initially thought they would be. The hardest part about my job was making it to work on time while I was still in school. if I had to stay after for test review or something like I would either be late for work or fail the test. this was my first real job and I enjoyed it.
good,"I learned a lot about customer service, and how to approach the different types of customers. Management was always willing to answer any question that I might have. They do work with your schedules as far as college or dr. appointments and with emergencies."
good,"Its a good place to work and learn about common building materials and processes. They hire good people, but not always the brightest or hardest workers. Also they do not hire enough employees, which creates a stressful work environment, often employees are required to cover multiple departments. I enjoy helping others so it has been a good job for me, the benefits are great and the pay is competitive."
good,"A typical day at work consist of directing customers and helping with store inventory, using power equipment: cutting wood with hand saw and restocking inventory with a hi-lo truck. I've learned a lot about different types of home building materials and the hardest part about my job is knowing every product and it use. I enjoy interacting with customers the most."
good,.its a okay place to work at you meet a lot of different customers who are friendly everyone happy very happy I was very happy too....................
good,"A good place to work and learn the retail structure. Seasonal changes two times a year. You need to be and have a creative mind"
good,"Working as a cashier can get rather tedious at times, and very dull on slow periods. Co-workers don't really interact with each other very much unless they were floor associates. Its very hard for females to be promoted of the register, but males are snapped up by different departments within 2 weeks of starting."
good,Nice place to work. You can gain experience in customer service and salesmanship. knowledge about products and how to work within a warehouse is here.
good,Lowe's is a great place to work especially in the retail field. The development is really up to you on how far you want to go with the company and pay I would say is at the high end for being a retail store. The only downfall I think is the schedule as you can work a lot of hours on any given day and a lot of different times so your home life isn't that great.
good,"Well received as a new employee, everyone is very open and warming and also very friendly and eager to help me learn the store and to become efficient at my job quickly."
good,"Learned a lot about how to stock and check inventory. Also, about the different materials used to build a building. Overall, an okay job to work."
good,"Overall a great place to work, upper management and HR etc needs work but not every place can be perfect. Good job security, amazing people to work with, real team atmosphere."
good,The work load in the store is a little overwhelming. Not staffed all the time. If the store were better staffed we would have more sales. Just an opinion that could change the store for the better.
good,Short time working there. Was a good job i enjoyed it. Wish it was not seasonal I will reapply. I dont like this Review Process. I have stuff to do.
good,Lowe's is a fun place to work with a great discount program for their employees. Unfortunately it can be stressful at times when there are not enough employees to deal with all the customers
good,I enjoy working here. There are good people working there. The variety of duties is a good thing and keeps me busy! Always posting job openings.
good,The installed sales office is closing in August due to Lowe's using a central production office to process installation services. My position in the store is being eliminated.
good,"Started off as a cashier, then switched to Garden shop to work with watering plants, filing orders for customers, loading bricks and bags of product for customers. Was given hands on training while working Garden shop. Certified as a Forklift Driver. Transferred to assembly of Wheel Barrels, and outdoor furniture. Was given proper tools to do my jobs, and entrusted a set of keys giving me access to supplies needed for assembly. Pay was excellent, and no micro management. Store management very positive and supportive."
good,I have been doing retail for 15years !! My husband and I are trying to plan a family and unfortunately retail hours and working all the major holidays make for a complicated family life.
good,"The job was enjoyable as a driver but over all the amount of faith put into the company was not returned when needed on my end. Less able people were given jobs that affected mine, and were not held to a strong standard."
good,"Lowes does seem to have eagerness of job advancement."
good,Lowe's is a very nice company to work for. they will work with you with whatever you have going on in your personal and work life.
good,"Great place, great values, only place I will shop even though I don't work there anymore. Lowe's was very good to me during a very tough time in my life. Grateful for the experiences that I had and the knowledge I gained."
good,"My position is roughly 50% retail sales, 25% clerical, 25% manual labor, with design services peppered in. "
good,"The job tests your ability on a daily basis to make decisions on the fly and adapt to the ever changing demands from upper management, employees and customers.  You are given the tools to succeed, but success comes from the store you are placed in and individual drive."
good,"A typical work day includes preparing and scheduling flooring installations as well as ensuring stock levels are maintained at a high level. I have learned much about the legalities of the contracting process over my 4 years with Lowe's. Our Management team is hard working and attentive to associate needs. My co-workers are the backbone of our companies success as a Home Improvement company. They are hard working, caring and Friendly. The hardest part of my job is managing the install process through product ordering, contracting and communicating with installers to ensure the timely and accurate completion of all estimates. Mostly I enjoy seeing the process through in a timely fashion. It is very rewarding when our customers compliment us on a job well done."
good,another fast paced job with knowledge and social skills for customer service and knowledge of store items and operations
good,the typical work day was fast paced and full of work. i learned alot about plumbing and construction.the management was very nice. My co-workers mainly avoided me unless i formalized myself because of my mother working there before me. the hardest part of the job was all the running around. the most enjoyable part of the job was the learning process.
good,"great place to work but if your part time,there's not enough hours toward falls.the best HR manager..I won't mind to work with them again if the hours is good."
good,Great place to work for college student or if your transition from military service. The coworkers are nice and are willing to help you with what you need.
good,"A typical day at work for me included the operation of various lift equipment, the use of computer & scanning guns(LRT) as well as a lot of manual labor. I gained a lot of insight into how a receiving department operates & attained much experience in picking, packing & shipping, plus assembly. "
good,"Too many chiefs & not enough indians...some work...some don't.  They have cut back staff for Lawn & Garden, so intern those of us who are there are required to double up on things that need to be done.  Makes for a long day."
good,A typical day at work begins with me coming in at 5:30 am to open our department. This includes taking care of stray items and beginning receiving the trucks. My co workers come in every couple of hours and we leave accordingly. We get 2 paid breaks and most days we receive an hour lunch. The hardest part of my job is all the heavy lifting from the bricks.
good,"Lowe's offers some of the best advancement opportunities in retail, as well as providing the proper training to help you be successful within the company."
good,"A typical day at Lowes would start with a walk around of the department, and helping customers. After the walk around, we would start an inventory worksheet which would take most of the shift. Once completed the worksheet must be turned in and then the clean up of the department would commence."
good,Every day working here was about the same. it was a lot of hard work but everyone was working hard and pushing one another to get the job done. The people I worked with really carried a family heart as a team and encouraged one another to work hard to get the job done. the hardest part in working was just the labor but having a great team to back you up made the job worth it.
good,Good pay but very intense task orintented  open too many days a year  weekends and nights required would go back to work for them
good,I love that I'm very busy.  I find extremely rewarding to be able to help customers and researching to get them the correct information and products need it.
good,"I loved working there as a teen but they paid minimum wage, just wanted to move forward to bigger and better things. benefits was good for full time employees so i heard but i was only part-time. plus we got a lot of bonus each year."
good,Greet customers. wait on customers.  trained in different departments.  Management mostly fair.  Co-workers for the most part nice and friendly.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers.  the most enjoyable part was helping customers.
good,I was responsible for approximately 25 - 30 cashiers and made sure that the front end of the store and customer service/returns area ran efficiently. Most of the management was great. I enjoyed working with people and loved my co-workers. The most difficult part of my job was conflict resolution with difficult customers. Overall I spent close to 6 years there and loved and still keep in contact with many of the people I worked with.
good,loved working for Lowes. Great place to work and meet people. As always when new Management comes in so do changes. I enjoyed every department I got to manage and learned a great deal
good,"Lowes was an easy company to work for because they are so laid back and you have a little freedom. Management is very poor though. They invest 100% of their time into the customers and 0% into their employees. "
good,Good company to work for best part was getting to know regular customers.They were pretty flexible and worked with you on school schedules.
good,"My position was great . I enjoyed working with the customers and my co workers. My job was to great customers , and up sale them , sell protection plans and sign them up for a Lowes card. The pay was great I made 25,000 base pay around $35,000 in commission equaling $60,000."
good,"good people work at Lowes, Lowes really can work with you of what they need. But u don't get enough hours at the job either sometimes"
good,"Lowe's is a good company to work for. I gave learned so much in a year than I ever had during high school."
good,"Assist Customer with purchases, internet orders, and special orders"
good,Its a great place to work and move up if you're single don't have a family.  Retail and the customers can make your job less enjoyable.
good,"Very fast paced, keeping all team members busy at all times, long days. Not a bad working environment. Move around departments and learn each area of the business."
good,"The shifts were long and the work was demanding. I often found myself doing things that were outside of my job responsibilities. The position I worked was easily the lowest of the pecking order, but I always felt I was doing twice as much work as was needed. I loved a lot of the people I worked with and never had any issue helping around the store. Our position was Loader but I was picking deliveries, pulling orders that had already been sold, cashing people out, helping people find products, unloading trucks, stocking shelfs, cleaning the front of the store, doing returns, dealing with customer service issues, operating power equipment, all while still doing my duties of bringing in carts and loading customers products. Often I worked with customers from sale to load. I did enjoy my time working at Lowes, I just don't believe that the job I working was a minimum wage job. A loader is this companies Six man but doesn't always get respected like the important member of the team they are."
good,"Lowe's is a good company and treats it employees well, good benefits 401k with 4.5% match, dental and vision are very good but their medical is not as good as it could be. For me it was a great job I love the people and most of the managers are good as well."
good,"Lots of room to grow, training available for many different areas.  Help customers find products, give product knowledge where I can, assist with loading onto cart.  Management is very supportive of required days off and availability."
good,"Very competitive pay at management level, overall decent company to work for.  The hours with corporate schedule were terrible."
good,"Really enjoyed working at Lowes. Good atmosphere, good leadership. Very low pay and crazy hours. Wish they paid more. I would of stayed longer."
good,"Lowes was an enjoyable and fast paced place to work with the only problem and the hardest part of the job being the patience of the customers that came in. I was able to learn the importance of time management and how to work with any type of co-worker since any co-worker could be hired, but still had to prove they wanted to stay. Direct store management was friendly and flexible with whatever I needed being a college student. I would have no issue returning to work there if I wanted to."
good,"∗	Provided quick, friendly customer service by answering customers questions, providing purchase assistance and keeping shelves stocked."
good,"Empresa en expansión y crecimiento, con muy buenos valores, competitiva y de mucha expectativa."
good,"As a Lowe’s sales associate I stocked shelves, maintains the sales floor, and assists store patrons with exceptional customer service. As a major hardware store chain, Lowe’s needs associates for a number of different departments, such as paint, carpet, gardening, lighting, and many other departments. Sometimes, and depending on the location, a sales associate with Lowe’s must perform other duties for the store, such as cashier and warehouse work."
good,"I worked for Lowe's for two years and learned a lot about retail, customer service, and general home improvement. My co workers became close friends, and a few managers came to be mentors. The hardest part of my job was dealing with customers. Whether its taking a complaint for something you had nothing to do with, or disputing a clearly marked price, there's always one that wants to make you feel less than human. Overall, not a bad place to work."
good,"periods of slow to overwhelming of customers ,not matched by correct staffing by management ,most learning is self taught,quick turn over of the management team ,to much complaining being done by the employees,hardest part of job is pleasing a very efficient management team ,best part of job is dealing with the local customers"
good,"work with friendly co-workers."
good,"A typical day here at lowes can be crazy, as a head cashier on our busy days I feel like I just run around all day which makes the day go by fast.  However, the concrete floors are really bad for you feet."
good,Lowes is definitely making an effort to change their purpose compared to when I first started. It's gotten a lot better and will continue to as they strive to make people love where they live.
good,I worked at the Costumer Service center and had fun coworkers who worked well with me. I picked up calls for online orders and processed the orders for pickup. It was an enjoyable job but my legs would hurt by the end of the shift.
good,"If you work hard, you will have opportunities to move up in this company.  You must make sacrifices in order for this to happen. With more pay and promotions come more responsibility and that is what is expected as with any company.  Management varies largely from store to store and based on who was hired, an external candidate will not be knowledgeable in the product category as compared to an internal candidate.  Hardest part of the job is the communication gap because of so many people involved in a customer experience.  They are good at celebrating employee milestones and achievements."
good,"A work day at Lowe's is very peaceful , co-workers are   nice,  and managers are always there to help out  , if a situation occurs..."
good,"Lowe's Home Improvement has been good to me for almost 9 years now. I came from a construction background so a lot of what you would learn at Lowe's (electrical, plumbing, flooring, millwork, tools and lumber knowledge),I already knew. They did teach me how to multitask very well as well as patience and time management. A typical day at work would be, working on order management to ensure customer's estimates and orders are on time and handled appropriately, helping customers in my department and surrounding departments with their projects. I usually work nights and the hardest part is the coverage for the most part. Store hours although plentiful paper on , are kept to a minimum for most part-timers which results in one person for two departments most of the nights of the week. So that one person is running around trying to take care of multiple customers with their orders and needs. Co-workers are great, we all get along for the most part and try to help each other out when the other needs it."
good,"fun , pays well, poor management in some stores. There isn't any commission, but there is are bonuses if you comp. Wok attire is comfortable and light."
good,"Very nice environment, you do get lots of freedom and management is very easy going. Only issue that I really don't like is the fall/winter season, they tend to cut all part time associates hours or they would send them home even if you just clocked in. But overall its a nice place if you're looking for a second job."
good,I worked for Lowes for almost 9 years. Not all of those years were lets just say wonderful but when I think back it wasnt all that bad. I made good money for what I did . I started off as a Flooring Sales Specialist making decent hourly pay and commissions; then commissions were taken away. I then went to Pro Sales as a Specialist and absolutely loved it; it challenged me and I loved the hours and the diversity of work since it dealt with the whole store
good,"No day is the same which makes the job enjoyable.  I have learned a lot about the different products that we sell.  I have also learned our computer system which is somewhat difficult.  Most of the managers there are very willing to help with any questions we might have.  The co-workers that have been there more than 9 months are good workers, friendly and easy to get along with."
good,"I am a customer service representative. My job demand a high degree of accuracy. It is important to follow certain basic steps and procedure in order for others to be able to function as a part of the team. As a customer service rep I learn to listen and empathize with the customer. I work closely with my supervisors who are more than willing to help and take every opportunity to improve our  performance.  My coworkers and I work well together we learned how to utilize our individual strengths. The hardest part of my job is my schedule. We operate from a changing schedule each week. Sometimes we are there until 11pm and have to be back at 8am. While my job entails internet order management, filing papers, working on registers I most enjoyed working with customers that I can follow up and solve any issue they might have."
good,Freedom for employees to handle matters on their own. Strong sense of a team workforce. Good benefits and wages. The four week scheduling pattern was a bit frustrating as well as the chain of command. Chain of command very complex and quite belittling to the people at the bottom of the hierarchy.
good,"Great team to work with. Managers, asst. Managers, and co-workers were very pleasant to work with. Really enjoyed interacting with customers.Too bad for the wages and the absence of benefits."
good,"I've worked for the company for over 9 years, starting in the stores and working my way up to the corporate office. I've never had a write up, and my work record is spotless. Despite all this, I'm having my job threatened if I don't meet a certain manager's expectations in the next 30 days. This manager has not liked me from day 1 on his team, and has continuously made things difficult for me unnecessarily. I've been in my current role a year and a half and he still treats me like I'm brand new. I have to beg for more work because otherwise I'd be sitting around, twiddling my thumbs all day. "
good,"A typical day I would go into work, help put away freight, then check around for customers I could help. I also figured many flooring installation quotes for customers. I learned a lot about home improvement, as well as organizational skills. Management was always around if they were needed. Co-workers were mostly very helpful and fun to work with. I met some very good people who worked there. The hardest part of the job was the pace, sometimes it was challenging to get everything done in the eight hour day. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people, and helping customers find what they need. Plus the break room has a TV and snack machines."
good,Lots of hard work. What they neglect to tell you is that you work a rotating shift schedule. Some Lowe's are wonderful to work for with a lot of team work; others treat their staff with little to no respect.
good,"I enjoyed working for Lowe's, the employees were great, and friendly, and I was able to meet and help many different types of people."
good,"Lowe's is a very challenging and exciting place to work. The biggest frustration working there is the high level of turn over.  It seems like a perpetual revolving door at the corporate offices."
good,I liked working for Lowe's but when the Affordable Health Care Act came into effect my hours were cut to less than 10 hours per week and all my pay went for benefits.
good,"Great workers, there is room for advancement.  Many different jobs available.  Supportive management that helps out when needed.  A great place to work for."
good,"Typical day consisted of inventory maintenance and interacting with customers. Learned or relearned many skills for equipment operations, merchandizing techniques, and customer service. Also learned how to use various types of scanning tools needed for sales and inventory management. Although there were a few, most of the managers were friendly and helpful to work with. My coworkers were pleasant to work with and very helpful when working outside of my assigned department. I became a kind of go to guy due to my experience and knowledge. Working with them was probably the most enjoyable part of my job. The hardest part of this job was the occasional irate customers that I had to deal with."
good,The store manager is a really great guy. If you ever need anything I would go to him because HR is not helpful and definitely rude.
good,"Results driven environment with lots to do."
good,Lowe's is a great place to work if you have managers who are worth anything. You don't move up unless you kiss up to the managers. If they cant find a reason to fire you they make sure they do everything to make sure you quit. The most enjoyable part was the discount of product and the pay check.
good,"Moving freight from dock to sales floor.Assisting customers with knowledge about available flooring systems,and installs.product knowledge,management was bias.Dealing with other people that do not want to work.1 hour lunch,breaks not mandatory."
good,Long hard work day but learned a lot more about laying different types of floors i have never done before. I worked with a good helpful person. Hardest part was just getting into the routine and work hours but when the job was done it made me feel good about the job we did.
good,Overall Good Company with decent pay and benefits.  Company is going through a lot of change in culture.  With some growth opportunities depending on the department employed.  On a scale of 10 I would rank Lowe's 8
good,My current position provided flexible working hours during the past year at Greater Altoona Career and Technology Center.
good,Learned inventory management and customer service. Friendly co workers and management. Hardest part being lifting heavy things. Best part was the friendly co workers to talk to.
good,I enjoyed working for Lowes for 12 years. The company provided for and met a number of my needs during my tenure. I would suggest it as a great entry to the labor force type of job. Interested in taking a path into retail as a career? Lowes offers a number of benefits if you work for the right management team.
good,"A different experience every day in customer sales and service. Very busy, which is great for a retail store. I gained a lot of experience in how to deal with all types of personalities."
good,"Lowes was a decent job, there was usually always something to do there. I enjoyed working in the stock room and helping customers. I worked there for 3 years and they went through 3 store managers."
good,"Challenging, fun enviroment, good management.  Learned new jobs, as well new skills for employment. I had a very well rounded experience."
good,"It was a steady job, Very supportive crew members. However there was very little training to help me, to learn the proper way to do tasks. The communication between employee and manager, was lacking. But they were very understanding on personal issues."
good,"While working for Lowe's I was assigned as a cashier in the Outside Lawn and Garden department. When first arriving to work I would put all personal belongings in my locker and then clock in. When getting to my register I would then sign in on the cash register, if there were no customers waiting in line, I would straighten shelves in surrounding area or stand near the register. Upon customer arrival I would greet them and process their transaction and after transaction was complete I would always make sure to tell my customer to have a GREAT DAY! Throughout my shift I would make sure the register area was clean and well organized. Sometime in the middle of my shift I was given a either a break or lunch time depending on how many hours of work that day. At the end of my shift I swept up and took out trash and put back any items that may had been left to their right department. After everything has been completed, I clock out for the day."
good,"Lowe's is a great company with outstanding ideas. The downfall is in the execution by management at a store level. Retail is a tough industry to keep highly qualified individuals. The management went through too many changes to stay consistent. The fellow employees are great and and friendly. Great place to work, just need to weather some storms."
good,"I worked for Lowe's long enough to learn that it is a typical large retailer. If you are favored by managament (which I was) you will move up fast. If not, you will be lucky to get any time off. The management is very hard driving and very customer focused. Lowe's has EXCEPTIONAL compensation but EXPECT TO WORK -HARD- both mentally and physically for it."
good,Unload the truck mainly focus on product coming in to the store.Working at the store is great good people good enviroment pretty chilled. Management is horrible. Little to none most of the time dont expect your voice to be heard working here.
good,"Good place to work, best part of the job were the great people. very family oriented, this included the Lowe's family.  Management could be inconsistent at times.  The hardest part of the job were the incredible amount of demands."
good,"No day is typical.It's based on the flow customer traffic, which is always priority.  Ensuring daily task for maintainance and reporting for inventory balance were done. Training and cultivating the associates.  Also creating new ways to drive in new customers."
good,"Management very helpful, co-workers friendly."
good,"Merchandise and build displays for the sales floor."
good,"The workplace was pretty safe you just have to be alert to your surroundings.  The start pay for me was pretty nice I got that job when I was 18. The one problem I have with the company is it's hard to actually get hired into the company.  I was Seasonal and I applied internally for a permanent position however due to the fact or this is what one of the managers said,  ""we didn't have 4 qualified canadates so we couldn't do any interviews"" for a unload position I applied for. However it's not their faults so I was laid off and now I plan to work at Kroger where I will be in a permanent position and have set work days and set work hours unlike Lowe's were I would would 4 days one week then 2 the next."
good,"it was a great place to work, loved talking to the customers, and helping them when needed, co-workers were great, managent was very good to us, hardest part of the job was when it was slow, makes for a longer day, i like staying busy, makes the day go by alot better."
good,"Worked for 3 1/2 years there part time. The hours can be a bit sparse for the part timers, but full time gets a decent benefits package, and there appears to be room for advancement. "
good,"A 5 to 8 hour day- checking out customers and telling them where to find items."
good,"I  enjoy working at Lowes as a customer service/cashier "
good,Came in each day made sure I was able to provide good customer service to each customer. I would help guide people to different areas of the store as well as handle transactions and place orders for customers. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to work with the public and making sure I was able to meet their needs for their visit at the store.
good,"My typical day at work goes like this. I clock in, check the service desk for returns, make a list of what needs done and show it to the department manager to see if he needs to add anything, then I get started on that list. While working I scan the aisles for customer's that are in need of help. In the flooring department, I've learned exemplary customer service, sales, and how to assist customer's with the decision making products of remodeling their homes. My manager is goal-oriented, helpful, and doesn't make any of my co-workers and I do anything he would not do himself. My co-workers are sales specialists who have to meet a certain budget each month and do not help me with my daily tasks unless they have extra time. The hardest part is having to work mostly by myself due to co-workers having other job opportunities. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a customer leave the store happy and satisfied with me knowing I helped them to the best of my abilities. I highly enjoy my job at Lowe's but I need a better employment opportunity to better me and my family."
good,"Professional but fun atmosphere. Good atmosphere, could be around more to recognise the employees that need to be let go."
good,"for the most part lowes is a pretty decent place to work with, does it have its ups and downs -yes- but its become a stable job and a secure place to work."
good,I worked in the outside garden department where the you it was lovely if you like being outside. Loved cutting Christmas trees and the spring time the most!!!!! You can easily move up in Lowes and management cared about you.
good,"While usually pretty busy, on my down time I would collect carts or organize and restock shelves."
good,"it was always a joyous place to report to work co-workers were friendly and considerate, Management was courteous and understanding when problems arose.  The most enjoyable part of this job was the different types of people you meet greet and assist on a day to day basis."
good,"10 hour shifts,"
good,"Over the last 4 years, I have learned a lot about plants, how to take care of them and how to grow them. I worked with many different types of people at the store, some of which were more difficult then others. I loved working this particular job and getting to learn from so many people."
good,Lowe's is a good place to work.  I've always felt supported by the management team.  The corporate office is a great work environment with a great cafeteria and several amenities.
good,Lowes has grown to their capacity.  They are not opening any new stores.  This means they are not looking to advance as fast as they used to.
good,"This job was decent, pay was adequate and cross learning was encouraged, however mangement was no where compitent always messing up schedules and not planning for busier days. The store manager changed 3 times in one year while I was there."
good,"Supportive management team, fast paced, sales and task driven working environment.  Co-workers are a close family.  My work day consists of helping customers with there needs by using the Lowe's IMPACT model."
good,Working at lowes is a busy place to work. There is always something to do weather its working out in the garden or up in the returns desk there is a bunch to do.
good,"All and all its a good place to work if you never want to advance anywhere in the company. full time is hard to get, always seasonal jobs"
good,"Its a busy but productive environment, management is decent, co-workers are very positive, but lowes is a fast paced job that does require alot of social interaction with customers, but is flexible to an extent."
good,My work environment fluctuates between fast and slow. You meet new people in all types of business so you learn alot. Managers know their job and are not afraid to teach others. My co-workers come from all different backgrounds and diversities. The hardest part is making sure that customers get product in a timely manner so if a truck is late coming we have to make adjustments. The most enjoyable part is interacting with the customers.
good,"Although the benfits are lacking for part time careers, I have found the work environment to be comfortable. The line supervisers and administration are both accomidating to help meet my needs as a husband; and as an employee seeking to further my own career by providing traning and personal advise based their own experiences."
good,Great company to work for great benefit package and awesome discounts. very much enjoyed my co-workers and flexible work  schedule
good,"I worked in the outside lawn and garden area which in my opinion was the best area to work in.  The pay was good, the people there were really cool people to work with. The costumers are real cool. At times it could be really busy. Another cool thing about this place was that sometimes Lowes would feed it's employees during lunch breaks. The problem with this Lowes was the scheduling. Sometimes people had to close one day, which took up to 12 or 1 am in the morning, then open the next day, which was around 5 or 6 am. This happened to me numerous times.  Another problem was that there were too many managers and supervisors. Also,  so of them didn't know how to do their job or they did too much. For example,  I was working in outside lawn and garden, and the manager for lumber put me over there to work without telling my manager. When my manager found out,  which took about a month, he put me back to outside lawn and garden. The advancement is good. I went from seasonal to full time.  Lowes is loyal to it's employees. As long as your doing good or even OK,  they would keep you on as long as you want to. Overall,  this is a good place to work at."
good,"It's hard work but an awesome place to work. I worked Outside lawn and Garden with great coworkers. My Manager was the best I've ever had. He tells you what needed to be done, no hovering and watching over you, he also worked along with us instead of sitting back watching it get done. The hardest part is when it was 100 degrees outside but the fans and greenhouse was a blessing! I enjoyed my job greatly but my surgery limited me from lifting so much and I had to resign."
good,"fast paced, busy, management is easy to talk to, most co-workers are team oriented, standing on concrete for 8 hours is rough on the feet, and legs, The job does require some heavy lifting for most positions. Most of my coworkers have truly become like family to me."
good,"Lowes as a company is a good company to work for, I work steady hours, get good pay, and the benefits are very good."
good,understood how to help multiple customers in a timely matter. was trained a good bit in each area of the business. learned that some people will never be happy or fully understand what is reality or not
good,"Was a pretty fun environment to work in, lots of nice and friendly people and customers. The pay was really good for just a part time job"
good,Unloading and load trucks was my life for a short while. I believe these jobs are for people straight out of high school because no skill just a good sense of good judgement
good,"Work was ok, benefits great, 80% of the managers were not very great. Once Lowes reduced workforce and minimized amount of ASM's they became over worked and it reflected to the team and departments they covered."
good,This is a go between job and didn't have high expectations. Overall a good place to work.Most co-workers are great and Management team tries to do well. Customer demand can sometimes make your day go sour quickly. For me the hardest part is the heat being outside and coming from the northeast. Most enjoyable part is a compliment from the customers.
good,"The main focus is customer service. Without the customer we wouldn't have a job. A lot of tasking and resetting of merchandise to correspond with the changing flyer every week. Good management team and good co-workers. I'm always trying to improve my customer service skills, getting better at solving the customers problems quickly."
good,From the first time I stepped in the building to start training I could see the difference.  The employees and management created a great environment that I enjoyed coming into everyday.
good,"Lowe's is a great place, however, being a season employee there are no set hours. You may work 47 one week, and 20 the next. The management is wonderful. They are great with working with one's school schedule, and they take family time very seriously. The co-workers are very helpful especially those who are new employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is the idea that it will be different each day you go into work, and the hardest part of the job is adjusting and accommodating to each customer's individual needs."
good,"I worked as a Cashier for the front end of the store, the garden department, and lumber."
good,nice environment for the most part. employees are usually selected well and tend to get along. plenty of opportunity to move up the ladder if you want to.
good,"Lowe's was a new experience for me because I had never worked in retail.  Prior to Lowe's I usually found employment in the kitchen of a restaurant as a dishwasher, but Lowe's was entertaining.  I started out as a seasonal outside garden associate but was quickly moved to inside garden and given a permanent position.  Within a few months I had taken the temporary position of Outdoor Power Equipment specialist until a permanent replacement could be found.  I moved from the Garden department and became the Team Leader of Home Decor.  Shortly thereafter both the department manager of Home Decor and Paint and team leader of the Paint department left for medical reasons, so I was interim manager for the Paint and Home Decor departments.  I then moved on to be the team leader of the night receiving/stocking crew, but that didn't last long due to incompatibilities with receiving schedules so I moved on to Product Service Associate.  I stayed a PSA until I decided to work for Garda."
good,"The co-workers I worked with was great and they made my job interesting, but the store managers and most of the ASM's did not work with their employees. They was a ton of staff cutting and all the store manager worried about was the budget and looking good in the region we were in. On top of that, the day-time shift members didn't make work any easier on us, leaving the state of the store up to the overnight team."
good,Lowes is one of the best retailers in the business providing employees all the tools needed to succeed. The management program can be very partial. Great retirement benefits.
good,"my problem with  this employer was management. floor managers or sales vs. floor can have objectives which are at odds. as a sales specialist in flooring, my job directive was to greet customers, assess needs sell measure(flooring) build quote and call customer to close sale,right? wrong! Idiot floor manager thought I should spend my time cleaning up a boxed furniture mess in another department, something fat boy could have done himself. All he does is walk around. The duty of a salesman( who they pay a lot of money)is to sell. After all, we bring in1/3  to 1/2 of all our weekly reciepts, right? I have nothing against work or maintaing my department, its the same work to clean-up flooring as it is to pull sold materials. these are things you do when you are not engaged in a sale. this is called priorities and I know what they are. SELL FIRST, CLEAN LATER!!! RIGHT? RIGHT! Another thing was the odd concept of what was called chinese overtime. you can work up to 50 hrs a week, but your pay tails off from time and a half after 40  to very little by the 50th hr. "
good,"heavy traffic"
good,I underestimated the workload I had to do when I first began. Over time it became manageable and coworkers were nice. Not a bad place to work and the starting pay was the best in the whole area.
good,Always plenty to do. Time goes by fast. Good friends and associates. Best part of the job is laughing with friends and satisfaction from a job well done.
good,"Typical day at Lowe's included helping customers find what they were looking for, lifting heavy products, constantly replenishing freight. Management was on strict orders, and everything had a standard. Many personal relationships were founded working at Lowe's. Hardest part of working here is the amount of lifting, moving, & walking. Most enjoyable part of working here is the great attitudes customers have when shopping."
good,A typical day at work could vary from either a slow day or busy day. You learn alot about home improvements and gardening while working for this company. The management was ok but you deal more with your supervisors than your managers. The co workers were always very helpful and attentive to the customers. The hardest part was working on the slow days because it made the work day drag. The most enjoyable part was assisting the customers with finding their products fast and easy.
good,"was a good place to work but there was a lot of management turnover, can be very stressful at times, and seems to be a lot of running around like a chicken with your head cut off"
good,"Working at the Distribution Center was probably my most favorite job ever. When I moved store side it was a different animal. The manager was a child, immature and wanted everyone to be his friend. He created a bad culture that made it difficult to get people to do their job because he would undermine any discipline."
good,Lowes i what you expect tons of costomers and overwhelming at times but really frustrating when managers cant hold there own i helped building the place. I enjoyed it at times but had to move on
good,"Working at Lowe's has benefited me in many ways. I grew up in the company and have enjoyed working there. It has taught me about customer service, team work and becoming a effective manager."
good,"I enjoy talking and helping people find products, I have learned a lot about how to deal with people in general. The management is really great to work with, my co workers are a great help to with any problems or any thing you need.The hardest part of the job is learning the different programs on the computer. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to customers."
good,"Lowe`s can be a great place to work, but it is largely dependent on your store management team. I have worked in several stores and have thoroughly enjoyed it and also been very disgruntled. A typical day looks like constant cleaning/ recovery/ stocking, while helping customers in your area."
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for. There is a lot of up and downs when it come store to store. You may love one Lowe's and hate the other. I was in two diffrent stores and the first store was like walking into my family every day. The next Lowe's i moved to was not so homie.
good,"knowledge attained can be used outside of work area."
good,"employees are rewarded here,"
good,I've learned that drama is everywhere. Management seems to promote based off who they like the best not off who is the most qualified. Some of my co-workers have became life long friends and seeing them is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"I had to spend a lot of time collating and looking at reports. Research of supposedly missing items took a lot of time. There was a lot of bill out/credit in activity because associates were not allowed enough time to do their job properly. There was a team atmosphere. It seemed everybody wanted to be involved in catching shoplifters, but were frustrated due to the fact that loss prevention is the only one that can apprehend them. Very poor structure of getting prosecution approval. It took regional approval to call the police. We couldn't even get a license number and report it.Very poor structure of advancement. You have to be the top LP manager in your region to be able to go above your position. District jobs are very hard to come by. Assistant manager positions are very few and far between. Department managers are pretty much stuck in that position. Almost a certainty you have to relocate to be considered.  Loved the people that I worked with at store level. Great store manager at one store. Great assistants and department managers. Customer service associates were worked to death for low pay. My district LP manager was not the greatest. High on ability and low on people skills."
good,"I learned how to drive power equipment and the people I worked with were fun to be around. The work day was flexible as a truck unloader, so the day was when we started unloading until we finished. This gave us incentive to learn various techniques to speed up the process to make our job easier and save the store time. Management was usually working the front of the store, so our team was trusted to work unsupervised."
good,Was an excellent experience and position especially for retail. Company valued employees and customers more than any company I've ever seen.
good,Enjoyed working with customers on a daily basis...didnt like the management team they seem very unsure of themselves & didnt take pride in helping others grow in the company which made it hard to succeed there
good,"The overall rating for the company is positive although at certain locations there can be staff, like any company, that is unfit for their role."
good,"Flexible schedule but mandatory to work most weekends"
good,"If you enjoy working with the retail public then this is a great job."
good,"Long days, a lot of work. Enjoyed my job. Some co-workers could be difficult. Others were great! Management was good. Immediate supervisor was great."
good,"At Lowes, a typical workday consisted of driving a forklift to unload the freight to the correct aisles. After unloading the freight, I helped stock the store shelves that were low on product and top stocked the rest. At the end of the work shift I would clean the entire store floor with a riding scrubber."
good,"Lowe's as a company is a good company to work for, but they are more concerned with profit and margins, than with employee happiness. It should be a 50/50 split."
good,"Great resume builder. You will work hard, and you can accomplish what you want to. The pressure is there to accomplish though."
good,every day can be a little better or worse than the last. depends if you like a warehouse atmosphere while helping people buy stuff
good,I worked at Lowe's in order to earn extra money as a part time job. I worked about two nights per week and the weekends.
good,Lowe's is a good place to work with a lot of advancement opportunities. They also offer good benefits for Full Time employees and Part Time employees.
good,"The job is all about customer service, you learn everyday on the job, and you meet lots of people in different industries in the field of labor. Compensation is very inconsistent."
good,Lowes as a company changes business plans to match what the competition is doing. This is not a long term type place to work.
good,Started out working to get a new store opened by stocking shelves and doing clean up.  Eventually ended up in the plumbing department to assist customers with their needs and potentially direct them to other areas of the store. The best part of the job was when you were able to help solve a customer's problem and have them walk out of the store with a smile.
good,"This was a very enjoyable place to work, marred only by the inconsistency in policy. Policies were very firmly established but management frequently misrepresented them to customers creating hostile reactions when customers were again faced with the policies as written and causing general confusion among employees. Additionally, the practice of promoting from within was highly flawed, resulting in many unqualified employees holding management positions. Regional management was completely out of touch."
good,My duties change from day to day. Season changes are the busiest times we have in receiving. I have learned how to operate various pieces of power equipment. Our Management team work well with employees. Team work is very important in our area. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a best friend. The hardset part would be working outside in the various types of weather conditions.
good,You go in and take calls during your shift. Management is very nice and friendly. There are training classes that you can attend to expand your skills and add you to different call lines. Very friendly co-workers.
good,I usually come in and close every single night. They're pretty good with working with your schedule.
good,"A typical day at Lowe's is very upbeat, fun, and always something new. I have learned to interact with a very diverse clientele as well as coworkers and management team. All of my coworkers are very friendly and very easy to interact with. The hardest part of my job is learning the many different types of items we carry as well as product placement. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers."
good,"Management is great, benefits are great, only downfall is you need open availability for advancement.  i enjoy my job very much, just would like something full time"
good,My typical day consists of assisting customer with kitchen cabinets and appliances. Also assisting customer with kichen and bathroom layouts. Outlining different cabinet and countertop products and features.
good,"I enjoyed working in customer service but at times the management did not have any idea what one manager was doing and how the employee was instructed to do things.  Moved quite a bit of inventory around because one manager said this and the department manager wanted that.  I suppose it is all part of the process.  I handle the customer service aspect, regular register and the self check out section."
good,"I was hired under the HR person who came from a different Lowe's who was extremely hard and was almost unreasonable at times. Being a cashier was easy, it was all of the other stuff that you had to deal with that made the job eventually become unbearable."
good,"•	Receive and unload truck Using sit-down or stand up forklift"
good,I learned how to manage employees and handle customers. Co-workers were great but management was lacking. Hardest part of the job was being stuck in the returns desk but I enjoyed working with customers and learning new things about products and services.
good,"Walk the store, make sure stocking of product is complete, follow up and do reports, check e-mails, walk managers, have daily and weekly meetings, training, public relations with unsatisfied or satisfied customers, follow up with employees, be manager on duty."
good,"enjoyed interacting with customers "
good,Left job after two years to advance in a better paying Job with ABC4
good,"-Contact business accounts, order products, coordinate delivery logistics, Maintain quarterly sales quota. "
good,Enjoyable work day is made up of assisting customers in the choice of their purchases by providing knowledge and experience.
good,My experience working at Lowe's has taught me how to work well with others. Lowe's is a good company and great at creating a fun and relaxing work atmosphere. I would highly recommend this company to anyone who has a desire to be apart of a great team.
good,"I have worked for Lowe's Supermarket for a number of years and their desire to help both the employees and their clientele (the people of Greeley) is very commendable."
good,Worked as an HR consultant for the PSE Sales Leads system. Currently leading and implementing an intervention designed to improve sales associates' customer service behavior. Management and sales associates have been extremely helpful and welcoming!
good,"Lowes is a great place to work"
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers they were lively and helpful, the working environment was great, offering versatility. I was able to learn skills and product knowledge across all departments allowing me flexibility and change"
good,"worked there before and i loved it, wish i could make a better career out of it"
good,"Working at Lowe's brings new and challenging experiences each and every day."
good,I enjoy working for lowes. I am going on 1 year. The pay is reasonable and hours are easy to work with. I learned a lot within a year. I feel I can go into any department and with confidence from what I previously learned
good,hours could be more consistent....great fellow employs.....good benefits...days off were consistent
good,"Great company with an excellent working environment and culture"
good,"hit the sales floor running and never looked back"
good,Great job. Got to meet a lot of different people. My co-workers were very friendly. Management did a terrific job with my work schedule and was very fair. I really liked this job because I got to meet a lot of different people and interact with the customers. I only regret that this was a seasonal position.
good,"Did not expect to be working with new people every week "
good,"Lowe's is one of the better paying jobs in Pueblo, but they prefer part-time workers to full time. I need full time."
good,"As part of the weekday team, you pretty much just do whatever anyone wants you to do."
good,"Usually contractors come through the Lumber department and want large orders delivered (most of the time the next day) , so I look up items or walk with them to get item numbers. Proceed to check customer out set up for delivery and they always get 5% percent off using the business account. Most of the time I put money onto the account first (customer using cash or debit card)"
good,"warehouse work"
good,The company was a good place to work.  If you reported to work on time and hardly called out; then promotions were easy to receive: based on merit not on seniority.
good,"I got in when getting in was good. When I first started working there everybody was best friends and we all knew each other. We even had Lowes get togethers each year at our friends places. It was more like a good place to meet friends and develop relationships with our coworkers. We knew everybody really well. It was a very fun job, at least at that time, its all work and no fun now, or so ive heard.. ."
good,If you go to work every day and do your job you will never have a problem at Lowes.  The management does not always have the most wonderful ideas or ways of doing things.  There is a lot of room for advancement if you work for it.  The hardest part of any position is dealing with customers.
good,A typical workday was helping DIY customers get everything necessary to get a project from start to finish that they could take pride in accomplishing.
good,Great bunch of employees and management staff to work with.
good,"A typical day would included being able to transition/move around to different stations or areas of the store to help assist and checkout customers."
good,I enjoyed working at lowes one of the best places I've ever worked I just didn't make enough.
good,I worked the 4AM to 11AM shift so I could continue my schooling. Þe hours were tough but the people I worked with were awesome and my manager was a great management.
good,"Geat place to work. Sold in all parts of store. They didn't want to hire any full time employees, just part time"
good,A Typical day at lowes would be to cover your department and the customers in it. Ensure that they find the correct help and items that they require. By helping the customer you also learn about different projects the customer are partaking in. The hardest part of the job is having to answer a question that a customer has pertaining to a situation you know nothing about. The most enjoyable part is when you can actually help a customer.
good,Ever evolving model and challenging environment.  Can be quite fulfilling.
good,A typical day at work was fun and productive. I was certified at the job to drive the reach truck. Management was ok but I think they could be better in areas such as communication and managing areas to work. My co-workers made everyday fun to be around which made the day go by quicker and also made working easier. The hardest part of the job was sometimes you did not know exactly what your job would consist of and the most enjoyable part was just being around co-workers that love to work.
good,"I work for the company to help me maintain with school, and my living expenses."
good,"I typical day for myself in delivery consist of loading trucks, and delivering the merchandise. We work in a team setting relying on the team to complete daily task. I would say the hardest part of the job would be some of the houses that we go in. Some deliveries are harder than others. Best part of the job is meeting new customers everyday, and getting to be in a new environment with every stop. Things that I have learned would be working in a team, and being able to take direction from others. I also learned about the management side of Lowe's that I wanted to purse. All around good company to work for in the right position."
good,"My typical work day consisted of selling appliances as well as restocking and displaying them. It taught me how to advance my skills in multitasking and customer service. The hardest part of the job was that the limited space for storage made it difficult for restocking. The most enjoyable part was getting to interact with people and also the environment was very friendly. The management, however, completely turned over during my last few months there and they made that previously fun and friendly environment a little bit less than desirable."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of helping customers with what ever building projects they have and making sales. What I learned is how to create orders, measure houses, build crates, and make sales. Management was great no complaints. Everything was kept very professional for the most part. Co-workers there where like family. The most enjoyable part about the job is the work environment."
good,"My day would start off pretty quick, go in do my job help customers clean up and that was the day. I learned to work as a team and that your job is important no matter what you do. management were fine, they helped when you needed and give advice also. team work was great. friendly environment. The hardest part about the job was when it got real busy and you had to do your job and help every customer that you see. I enjoyed working with others and getting bonuses."
good,"Good Company, Difficult to get permanent full time job.  While Full Time not allowed 40 hour work week."
good,Got along well with the employees the customers kept things interesting.
good,come in go to my locker and grab my vest. after I would grab my vest I would to a computer and clock in. then I would ask if they need me at a certain spot. working in retail you most definitely have to learn to be fast paced. you learn about the different products in the store. i get along with everyone i work with. the hardest part of the job is having to listening customers yell at you about nothing you had control over. i enjoy customers leaving the store happy and with a smile on.
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work, and has quite a few benefits as well as their ability to be flexible with scheduling to work with you."
good,You could easily get overtime if you worked part-time. Management played favorites with who they promoted.
good,I really just work on the trucks when they came by unloading them and on no truck nights we were on the floor with the sales aossicate all through I have a lot of experience in that field
good,"Like most large corporate retail chains there is a deluge of nonsensical acronyms, policies, and procedures to get used to at Lowe's.  "
good,I helped people find the materials they needed for their home projects . I found i enjoyed the interaction w/ all the people I encountered and felt good about sending them home w/ what they needed. I was treated like my being there was important and it felt comforting to be needed. Most of the lower floor workers didn't hold much value on their jobs and acted in a manner that was uncaring and unprofessional . It was difficult to feel positive while working w/ your peers .
good,"There is not much I can say negative about working at Lowes, the people are great, the customers are more than likely people you would want to have contact with on a regular basis and the management are willing to help guide you in a direction with constructive criticism as needed."
good,"Customers come in waves for returns and pick ups."
good,"assembling customer orders, load and unload trucks. assist with stocking merchandise. co-works were great helped when needed."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of standing at a cash register or working at customer service. Customer service is very fast paced and can be the most enjoyable job on the front end or the worst, depending on if you can handle chaos that can happen . The register is a repetitive job. I have learned how to multitask more and how to deliver customer satisfaction more than I did in the past. There are several levels of management within the store that work together to achieve the ultimate goal of the store. The management hierarchy works fairly well for the most part. The co-workers are pretty awesome and you can develop a lot of life long friends. The hardest part of the job is being able to tolerate people that are rude and unfriendly. The most enjoyable part is being able to help people and make them happy."
good,"The loader job can be difficult some days they have more than average responsibilities. These responsibilities include returning shopping carts to the store, loading customer vehicles, filling 5 and 3 gallon water bottles, changing trash cans and maintaining the parking lot. Most of the time with only one closing loader. The management is good with their open door policy but bad with scheduling. One of the hardest parts of the job is closing by yourself on a weekend night being literally overwhelmed with workload. Altogether a decent place to work though nice being able to be outside in good weather and move around assisting customers needs."
good,"I loved working with my co workers and my helping my customers.  On the down side, there is no job security for Seasonal employees or hours for permanent employees."
good,Employees can work there for years and not really advance within the company. Can be promised a position and not be followed through with.
good,"Cleaned and organized shelves"
good,"learned great customer service skills, also selling skills. lots of standing and lifting heavy things."
good,"long hours, great co-workers. work can be hard at times, the most enjoyable part of the job is the shift schedules. You know what days you will be off so you can plan to do things on your off days."
good,"Enjoyed my time there, great management, great customers. Paid well, rewarded employees for hard work."
good,"With a rich retail background of success and proven track record, Lowe's has to be one of the more cleaner home improvement stores to shop and work for."
good,Lowe's is great company to advance in. Sometime the management isn't that good. The pay is reasonable and the hours are great in the Spring/Summer season. There are often a shortage in people. But other than that working at Lowe's is a great experience.
good,"-fast paced environment"
good,"Generally I begin my day reviewing the previous day. I'll proceed by beginning my daily focused tasks including potential internal or external thefts that may have occurred. Reviewing any Liability related incidents and beginning investigations if needed. I then proceed with my Safety walk of the facility to ensure compliance with all company policies and procedures as well as OSHA regulations. "
good,"Lowes is great place to work, friendly atmosphere, Managers are willing to work with you. Customer interaction was the most enjoyable aspect of the job."
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work a typical day at lowes is come in check for labels, check on my coworkers make sure they are doing ok. I learned a lot while being at lowe's for 5 years i've learned how to overcome fear of heights,how to interact with people better and how to drive equipment which is my favorite part of the job. My coworkers some of them are the best hardest working people ive ever seen but there a few that just are lazy and wont be a team player which makes it hard on everyone else."
good,"Patients come first always. There is no ""it's not my job"". We all work together and help each other. Economy and healthcare has made my job unstable. The best part of working here is the flexibility in your schedule. As long as you do your job, you can take a day off, go to a doctor's appointment, go to your child's school, etc...."
good,I learned so much when i work at Lowes. I typically help customers with products and give them ideas they can work with for outside their homes. I enjoy the management. They work with me on my schedule. I can go to them if I have an issue. I love working with my fellow employees. I get a long great with them. We work as a team to get tasks done. I love challenges. The hardest part of the job would be remembering all the plants we sell and where to locate each kind.The most enjoyable part of the job is working with customers and hearing their ideas and stories.
good,"I loved working with this company. They pay you very well and make the work environment a fun and welcoming place. The only problems I had with this company was a few members of management. I felt that they played favorites and if you weren't gay, lesbian, or a race other than white you weren't going anywhere within the company. Working for them for about 2 years, at two different stores I was stuck in a part time cashiering position, and wasn't a valued employee. However, not all the managers were awful and most of them actually encouraged many of us to try and excel in our department."
good,"A typical day at work is consulting with store manager to see how many freight trucks are coming in for the week and prioritizing the amount of time and laboring. Making sure the receiving area, in which the freight truck will deliver, is clean and that there is inventory space in the receiving area. Make sure that freight truck has clear directions to the store and is on time to make the delivery. I have to make sure that the requisition number and RDC truck number on the driver's paper work matches the information we have in the store. Consult with my unloading team about the products that are on the truck and how to categorize the products. After the truck is unloaded I have to to make sure all of the special orders that were on the RDC truck were categorized, numbered, and stored correctly in the receiving area. The hardest part of the job is keeping the receiving area clean which takes time. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my team."
good,"Can be as good as you make it, definitely not the worst place to work"
good,Job worth having assuming you're working the A.M. shift and are not a cashier. Otherwise it was miserable. You may be underpaid but in time the compensation evens out .
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is working with the public. Everyday had it's challenges which made each day different.
good,"General customer encounters, encouraged to learn and be a part of more areas of the store.  Some management inadequacies and poor management styles at times.  Coworkers make the job enjoyable and worth the time."
good,"Overall, a good company to work with.  Plenty of opportunities to move up with the company.  Good benefits."
good,Come in and go to a meeting. Then I am put where ever I am needed. I was trained in almost all departments and on all equipment.  I think the hardest part of this job was to find work in the slow months while maintaining high production. The most enjoyable part of the job was the free lunches we got for hitting certain days without injury.
good,"Working at Lowe's is generally a positive experience. I run a cash register, provide customer service and help customers locate items. I get along well with people and generally am not bothered by the grumpy customers. I try to be positive and friendly in all situations."
good,"Typical day is busy and working with plants and people."
good,"My typical day includes training new hires, teaching/coaching/training current associates, looking at sales/margin, working my required reports, customer service and support. I also provide assistance to both non-management and management personnel. The hardest part of the job is completing 120 hours of work in 40 hours each week. The favorite part of my job are the customers. I enjoy assisting customers in finding and purchasing what they need to complete a project. I have learned multi-tasking, organization, operations, and I have even trained for Assistant Store Manager."
good,There is a lot of finger pointing between both crews not doing their jobs.ASM's do not maintain a management perspective with associates. To much buddy-buddy between management and associates.
good,"Overall a great place to work. Advancement available to those willing to work hard. Many great people to work with. Good team environment. As with any job, the target gets bigger the higher you move up."
good,"We unload the truck and stocked the shelves and customer service."
good,"working cash register, pushing carts, working customer service desk"
good,"If you are straight out of high school or a recent college grad looking for a career in retail, you should really consider Lowes. Lots of opportunities for the motivated individual."
good,Required to work all holidays and vacation days are limited
good,"Beautiful campus, everyone is pretty relaxed, tons of amenities on site,"
good,A typical day at work is actually quite fun.  I get to work with a group of wonderful people.  I also am able to work with multiple customers everyday and form great relationships that help build my business. My management team is very supportive in helping me accomplish my goals.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I get the pleasure of meeting every day.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with and engaging with customers about their projects.  Management was not consistent, but overall a very good team to work for.  Lowes is definitely all about customer satisfaction."
good,"Overall, Lowe's is a nice place to work, there are some cliques, you get those everywhere, sometimes though, it seems like if you aren't good friends or close with your supervisors, you don't get treated the same. I enjoy working for Lowe's, but the position I am in will not be a permanent one."
good,"I held many positions at Lowe's I was a stocker, night manager, and I help the receiving manager position and other floor department manager positions. We assisted customers in their projects as well as keeping the store clean and the shelves full for our customers"
good,"assisting customers with purchases, down stocking merchandise to shelves for purchase, zone department, dust and cleaning.  Recently transferred into a new department and haven't been shown or explained the differences between the merchandise"
good,"My typical work day would be clocking in at 5:00 am and scanning the entire store for Inventory replenishment. Printing reports and researching outstanding paid out accounts and validate that everything is correctly filled out. In receiving i would do a Special Orders Bin Audit and validate all products. Every Wednesday is a new store ad so i would walk the store and make sure all signage is up and old signage taken down. I have learned many behind the scenes skills with working for Lowe's it is very intriguing and would love to learn more if i could. My co-workers are very friendly and helpful and i never mind in helping them when needed.Sometimes Management can become difficult when there are several managers with different ways of doing certain things and determining which direction is per company policy. The most enjoyable part of the job is having off on weekends with a retail company, which is unheard of and i am very fortunate with this aspect."
good,Good company to work for. Great returning customers. Employees are fun and easy to work with.
good,This is a family owned business which was pretty interesting place to work at. Always doing different things everyday from my everyday running the warehouse/store to going out to the field and helping install water pumps. Only reason I left was I moved from Woodland to Sacramento.
good,Great place to work very professional. Awsome management team
good,"overnight stoker "
good,Lowes was a great place for me to get a lot of customer service experience. I learned a lot about the product and how to do certain projects.
good,"Great experience overall, but did not feel stable. I feel I was misinformed of the longevity of the position. I was hired to work in a certain department which was never assigned. I was advised my schedule would never change and it went from a stable part time position to 2 days a week then laid off at the end of January."
good,"This position include greeting customers at point of sale, handling cash and 	 credit card transactions, exchanges, while promoting company credit cards."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was the customers. I really enjoyed interacting with different personalities
good,Long Hours. Great company to work for. I learned a lot. Some market directors were good and some were bad. Not everyone was on the same page.
good,"good workplace.I enjoy working with customers and employees to solve issues. Not thrilled with nights, week ends and different days off every week"
good,Good Company on most aspect. I believe every person have person get a different experience no experience is the same. You might have the best experience in the world and have the best career.
good,"I work weekends at Lowe's so my primary task is to assist customers with anything they may need in the store, from finding items, to special orders. Most of my co-workers and managers are pleasant and easy to work with, everyone is focused on working as a team and accomplishing things for the better of the store. The most enjoyable part of my hob is helping customers select the best choice of items that are available to them, such as outdoor power equipment, or appliances."
good,"When they say ""Lowe's Family"", it's real. I love everyone that I've had the pleasure to work with"
good,"I have been with for almost a year and with the position of part time I was fine with that. As time went the position became decreasingly more of a part-part time job since the hours were reduced to only 10 per week. I feel sorry for the ones that have to rely on the income for a majority of their bills. Movement through out the company can be a daunting task since the interview process is the same weather you are coming in off the street or moving to another position within the walls of the company. Don't get me wrong, its a great place to work, the people in management as well as co-workers are friendly, but we work for one reason only and that is to be paid. This company will pay well but from my aspect I see that they are cutting corners to save money in the wrong places. Keeping employees is the best way to reduce overhead and with a high turn-over they are needing to spend more resources filling the holes in the schedule than just keeping the ones they have happy with hours."
good,"I have been working for the same company for 3+ years and Im currently looking for a diffrent career path. I have learned alot with the various diffrent positions with the company. I worked in customer service for 12 months helping customer pay bills, return product, purchase product, order and set up delivaries that work best for them. I was then moved to the recieving department were I would recieve and process trucks, product distribution, delivary load pulling, customer product loading. I was moved to RTM clerk for a few months. In that position I was trained to recieve/process day trucks, margin recovery, process customer returns on special orders and daily product. I would dispatch damaged product out to repair companys for customer owned and store owned product. I was then moved back to our Night stocking crew. I was trained to run all major power equipment and train all other employees on this equipment. Im considered the ""wingman"" to my department manager. I work side by side with him picking up on the difficult tasks he couldnt get too. Most of the associates on this team looked up to me as a leader. The team would work together every night stocking shelves, down stocking departments, and zoning departments. The hardest part of my job is trying to communicate with other managers that work during the day. Its difficult because I dont see these managers because they are all usually gone before I start my night. The job also puts alot of wear and tear  on my body. I need a career that wont aquire me to do alot of physical labor because of my knees and back.  What I enjoy"
good,"Help customers, sales, clean and zone department.  Most of the managers are easy to get along with and work with.  Retail can be a very difficult and stressful environment.  Thankfully, I have coworkers and managers that understand that for the most part.  I have learned that not all retail/cashier jobs are the same.  Working in a Lowe's is very different from working in a Walmart which I did not think before I started working there.  There are some similarities but I defintiley like it more."
good,"a typical day at work can be a little on the stressful side. I love the management at lowes, they will help you in any way that they can. If there is on thing that I have learned at lowes it is how to keep my cool under stress"
good,"Co workers hit or miss, management as well"
good,"Clock in when my it was my shift which varied. I would greet customers and promote our stores card. I learned how to managed difficult customers and still had them leave the store satisfied to come back and shop there again. The management was a little difficult to deal with because we had 10% of for veterans and would have to ask the manager on duty to swipe his/her card which would hold up the customers, other than that everything else was fine. The hardest part of the job was managing all the customers on the weekends and making sure they were satisfied. My co workers were very helpful and were always there for one another. I loved the job because it was fast paced and their was never a dull moment."
good,Helping customers chose and locate materials/items. Informing customers about store products.
good,"I enjoyed my experience working at Lowe's. I was lucky to work with many friendly, professional and interesting individuals, for whom work was made pleasant and tolerable. Management was spotty at times but otherwise fairly responsive to the needs of their workers and patrons. Shoppers varied, most being friendly and patient."
good,Unload the freight and put it away as fast as possible. Management is fine and co-workers are nice.
good,Good pay compared to most retail companies with possibility to move up with the company through hard work and doing a good job.
good,A typical day consisted of customer service and management duties.
good,"At the end of the day it comes down to sales through great products and superior customer service. I've learned a lot about big box retail sales and found that if you work hard and show your potential, the company will work for your advancement."
good,Develope and engage my employees. Effectively manage and motivate people.
good,"not challenging enough. i worked in flooring, tools, hardware, seasonal, outeside lawn and garden, and receiving."
good,The most enjoyable part of the Job was interacting with Customers and vendors.
good,"I work in the deliveries department. I come in everyday and pull all the deliveries that are sold for the next day. Also, I fax our delivery company what we have scheduled for delivery everyday at 2pm and 5pm. On top of that I call all the customers 3 days in advance to confirm their delivery dates. The hardest part of my day is finding an associate to help me pull a large order from a certain department. All the co workers I work with are nice and fun to work with. The most enjoyable part of my day is helping the customers."
good,This was a great place to work except I had a hard time carrying 80lb buckets of paint up 40 foot ladders.
good,"A typical day as an employee for Lowe's for me was making sure i provided the best customer service I am capable of. I worked in the outside lawn and garden center with. During my time there, I gained knowledge of when and how often to feed, treat, a lawn and garden. Management always kept an open door policy, and everyone helped one another (cross training). There have been times I would spend a few minutes in the lumber department helping a customer rethink  an idea that the lawn and garden department could not solve. The hardest part of the job for me was the very slow days. The most enjoyable part of the job was that rewarding feeling knowing I was a big help to a customer."
good,A typical day at work for me there would be a busy one doing my best to answer customer questions and directing them in the right direction. I've learned a lot about home improvement there. The management is great and they all work together to manage the staff well. The co workers there are very divers and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job would be trying to find the solution to some very difficult customer concerns. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working with the plants and being outdoors.
good,"A nice place to work, structured and good people to work with."
good,The company offers different opprotunities to learn new things as well as advancement into other areas of the company.
good,"Management is easy going, fast paced, very busy, goal oriented."
good,Part time job while going to college. It was one of the better ones to have in the area. Management changed a few times but overall it was a really decent workplace.
good,"I liked Working with all of my Co workers and management"
good,The company is considerate of their employees time in terms of payment but they do not provide an acceptable amount of flexibility and almost overuse their employees they do have. I didn't learn much because the training was informal but I did find that there was a lot of freedom on the job for one to decide their own work habits.
good,"Starting out at 5:30 am, get the store ready to open before 6am.  We on average deal with hundreds of customers, answering questions, estimating quotes, and pulling orders."
good,"A typical day at work involves greeting customers and assisting with  any shopping needs. This includes but not limited to directing customers to appropriate day/aisle, advise on product use and helping with loading when such assistance is required. Everyday can have its learning eperiences  as one tries to meet the shopping needs of diverse customers looking diverse products. Management and co-workers are co-operative. This ensures a conducive work environment resulting in high productivity .However  the hardest part of the job is when you need to rely on another Associate to meet a customer's needs but at the time of the request you find him busy. The delay in meeting the customer's needs is unpleasant. It therefore follows that meeting the customer's needs promptly creates a sense of fulfilled assignment making it the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,I enjoyed a lot of my time spent at Yoders met a lot of people from all over as learned a little bit of everything there.
good,"Co-workers were great, very nice people. You have ""regulars"" and get to know them very well. Great customer service atmosphere."
good,"A typical day is spent ringing up customer's purchases or performing returns or helping customers with finding merchandise they are looking for. I learned the value of patience. Management does what it has to do. The co-workers I have are good, hard working people. The hardest part of my job is occasional lulls in customer interaction. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping a customer find exactly what they are looking for."
good,Every day is filled with customer servicing people as well as helping stocking shelves as well.  Fork trucks and other power equipment are used on a day to day basis.  Management is slightly over worked with an extreme amount of tasks to hand out.  It is difficult at times to keep everyone happy but I very much enjoy the fast pace environment.
good,"Safety awareness based company, loading skids of merchandise into trailers."
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Lowes was the supportive culture and serving the community
good,"An excellent company to work for, with managers who genuinely want to see their employees succeed"
good,"Great place to work advancment is always up for grabs, try not to apply for unload associate"
good,"Good store management, but inconsistent corporate support.  Days can get really busy with lots of rude customers at once, but co-workers and management make it bearable.   "
good,"I was getting paid $9.12 an hour, I was a college student and when I asked to move some hours around the manager took me from 39 hours down to 10! "
good,"Changed prices every day."
good,"I help customers when needed, stock shelves, perform regular store duties as needed. Primarily unload trucks during the evenings and organize all the freight for the day stocking shift. "
good,Good company to work for.  The hours worked for my family and the work pace was fast and always something to do.
good,"Great place to work."
good,"always on the go, i've learned customers are always right .the management was okay.  trying to get more hours was the hardest part of the day."
good,Customer service is the key to a happy Lowes life. Most of the people you work with are great and friendly.
good,Good company and great people.  Health benefits were not so good.  I only left for medical reasons.
good,"assists customers with their purchases, ordering and locating merchandise. Management and co-workers are professional and friendly. The hardest part of the job is not being able to make every customer happy. And the most enjoyable part of the job is assisting customers"
good,"A normal day at work was building customers orders and stock inventory shelves with built products.  Used hand-tools for assemble products and fixed malfunctions and problems for customer products.   Used a blueprint to build and repair outdoor power equipment (Lawn Mowers, Water pressure, and etc.)  My co-workers were absolutely amazing I had great communications with one another.  The hardest part of the job I would have to say is the management and scheduling.  Due to a retail environment I was scheduled while going to college and it interrupted my class time, though I had changed schedules multiple to maintain school while working.  The most enjoyable part about Lowe's was using power equipment such as Narrow Aisle Lift, Forklift, and more.  "
good,Great people to work with. Management is understanding and easy to work with. 
good,"My work day was loading customer's merchandise into their vehicles and using the cash register."
good,"I had the opportunity to work for the company and will say, I miss it. It is a good strong company. I learned a lot in both corp. and store side situations. I will always be grateful."
good,"A typical day at Lowes would be non stopping, constant work. Lowes is a home improvement store so customers are in and out all day. One thing I learned working here is patience. The hardest part of the job was being in outside lawn and garden during the summer. The most enjoyable part was overtime. All employees was nice"
good,"This job consist of a twelve-hour working schedule of packing and unpacking items that were later shipped to retail stores, Also record inventory using hand-held computers. There is alot of squatting and lifting of heavy objects, constantly. Employees are encouraged to be consistant while working at a productive, fast pace. Management is caring and show that they really care for their employees."
good,"As Maintenance there never is a typical day. Each day brings it's own challenges. I learned the importance of managing a budget and how to manage staff. i also learned how to deal with coworkers according to their issues, everything has to be prioritized."
good,"i like all jobs had, learned all aspects of jobs had, lowes had few great coworkers,"
good,The pay is good better than most retailers.  Work life balance is poor if your a manager Lowes pretty much owns you.  Lowes promotes the wrong people a lot of power trips going on with area staff.  Lowes needs to evaluate the way management treats their employees.
good,Responsible for overall Operations of the store.  Overseen merchandising of entire store.  Hiring and overseeing associate relations.  Was responsible for all Assistant Managers.
good,"As a performing manager at Lowe's, I assisted in growing the gross sales of every store that I was involved in.  At the Estero location we increased sales by 22% in two years and in Cape Coral, exceeded the sales forecast goal set by corporate by over 6% in 2012."
good,"2nd largest home improvement warehouse."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Lowes, but was only there a few months.  Store management had clear direction, positive re-enforcement and communication was good.  There was a huge break room to accommodate such a large staff."
good,This company is good and stable.  Management were mostly from Southern States and understanding them during training was kindda difficult. 
good,"The store was a great place to go to work , than management started getting over whelmed , and the job got very ugly"
good,"Lowe's had determined their current business strategy would not keep them competitive going into the future. They decided to become a multi channel retailer and were currently moving into their second year of this process . The process included changeing their service model , expanding their e commerce offerings and growing both commerical sales and in home sales . I believe they are correct in their determination that their business model needed to change and time will tell if the course they chose was the correct one. Their largest challenge will be if they can execute the proposed changes."
good,"The work condition are ok , the staff are really Friendly .I learn a lot from the bosses"
good,accolades to company policy about cross-training to other departments and advancing within company
good,"very good work environment, professional but laid back employees/ coworkers. management were more like friends then authority but did their job very well. best part of each day was the satisfaction of completing my work load n seeing the results. hardest part of my day was unloading the couple thousand piece trucks but at the same time enjoyable."
good,fun place to work
good,"Waiting on customers, managers always checking on employes and customers, Really enjoy my job and co-workers. Team work is always there. I really enjoy working with and helping customers."
good,I enojoyed working for Lowes although a seasonal position I made the best of it and started work relationships with other employees who a mostly well natured people.
good,Not alot of physical labor as a cashier. Great company and managment.
good,"Lowe's is an equal opportunity employer with a strong interest in meeting the needs of today's home improvement shopper. Teamwork is necessary and expected. A satisfied customer is the best reward. Lowe's strives to be competitive with technology, but this continues to be an area of opportunity for the company. Overall, not a bad place to work."
good,"i got on great with my fellow employees the job was easy but management were not always honest,"
good,I would clock in and start stocking the shelves with items and makeing sure that they are all straight and aligned. i would then be put onto the cashier and work there for a couple of hours until we closed then i would mop and sweep the entire store before closeing.
good,"I am a speacialist with good leadership skills, and knowledge of overall product, my job is customer focused and to ficilitate as much sales as possible., my co workers are great"
good,poor communication between departments too many drivers let go or quit
good,"Everyone is great to work with. However, the management, and the scheduling is horrible."
good,Overall Lowe's is a good place to work. It's not perfect but I don't think anything can be perfect.
good,Management is sleep deprived. Some decisions are questionable. Training store assocs needs to be upgraded....
good,"I work in delivery department so everyday is a different day and you really dont know what to expect ""which I enjoy"" some things are the same i.e. the people you work with but we definitely deliver appliances to some wild places. What I have learned the most with this job is dont depend on your GPS, learn your area like its the back of your hand. Management is ok. They look after your best interest. Same goes for my co-workers, its like a family bond you form with each other. The hardest part of the job has to be the driving distance, but I enjoy driving so thats not really a problem for me. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customers face light up when we deliver them their washer and dryer cause now they can finally wash the pile of stinky clothes they have piled up in the laundry room."
good,A typical day at work would be assisting staff with problamatical questions and or concerns.
good,"Loved working at lowes. The environment, co-workers and management were great."
good,"I liked working at Lowes, most of the people I worked with were nice and the management were good people.I had a raise of $.40 after 90 days, which they told me most people didn't get, which put me over $13. an hour which I didn't expect. I probably would have stayed there if they hadn't cut the drivers hours from 40 to 20. I worked 40+ for 3 months, they hired 3 more drivers to cut our hours down."
good,"Visiting customers, managing 10 stores' Pro Desks. Building relationships with customers as well as store employees. Disliked the driving and the lack of support from the area staff."
good,go to line start your work how to use a skillsaw a nail gun clappin drill management not to good co-worker some was hard to get along some not hardest part of the was the clap every other payday friday we got a hour for lunch
good,Overall a really good place to work. If you are looking for a team based environment then this is it! The management at the time was more worried about their own bonuses then the employees but that management has since been booted out.
good,"Bring product forward, answering customers questions, giving quotes, learning how to change pins out on door nobs, making keys, stocking shelves. Getting into the computer to look up product and making sure it was available or the availability . Knowing the hardware and suggesting ways to improve a customers idea. My co-workers, if I had a question they would help if time allowed them. Learning from the customer, and having the satisfaction that I helped and put a smile on their face before they left."
good,"it is a very good place to work, nice people good benefits. The only issue is that they dont have the proper leadership in their managment"
good,Very Productive; fun and was able to really interact with the customers closely.
good,A good company to work for.Great training on how to work with a diverse group of people.
good,Consisted mostly of assisting customers and performing routine maintenance tasks. Work environment was balanced and management would offer me flexible schedules to factor in school. I learned many specifics about products we sold and could offer sound information to customers. Management was cooperative and willing to help employees with issues and coworkers were usually helpful and willing to work over issues such as schedule conflicts.
good,as a place or company to work for a good one but like all work places the meridian store i worked for the store mgr and some lower and hr played to many games.
good,"I believe my customers are number one, they are fun and don't rush you on some days"
good,I enjoyed working at lowes the only downfall was nearly impossible to obtain full-time and sucky benefits.
good,"unload trucks, put up stock, put up overstock, load trucks."
good,"typical management duties ! personel management , ordering merchandice ! customer satisfaction !"
good,I enjoyed my work but I have a desire to advance my career.
good,I really enjoyed this place. It was a very fast paced environment but I had a lot of fun while working here. There was always room for advancement as well as overtime opportunities.
good,"A typical day at work is dealing with installers and installation issues, making the right decision for the customer. Lowes has advanced in the technology field, you learn something new everyday with changing of technology. The management team leads by example and helps wherever needed. The hardest part of my job is warranty issues. The most enjoyable part of my job is customer satisfaction,"
good,I worked there for three years. It was a good experience but the company could learn to value its employees more. I worked in almost every department of the store.
good,Good place to work.
good,ok place to work for but pay wasnt that good starting off
good,"I worked in the appliance department, picking, loading,unloading,putting away appliances."
good,At Lowe's I start my day by checking my company email and my Order Management to see what is in store for me that day. I provide customer service as well as advice on flooring projects to customers most of the day. I also sell installs for flooring on a daily basis. In addition to completing assigned task by my manager I also keep the department clean for the customer. I have learned alot about flooring and gardening during my time at Lowe's. My co-workers are all very nice people and they will try to help you when they can. Overall Lowe's is a great place to work.
good,the head cashiers were cooperative but the deptartment managers were rude.
good,"Cool place to work, great for working around your schedules. Met some awesome people there."
good,"As a weekend sales team member, my job was fantastic. I went where I wanted to go, did what I wanted to do, and as long as I helped customers and team members, I was left to do as I wished. However, for those who work cash register, the story is different. They aren't given their breaks as they deserve, are forgotten on register, and there is never enough coverage. So, if you want to work here, avoid register at all cost!"
good,"Truthfully, I enjoyed my time at Lowe's for the most part... It was a fairly friendly atmosphere, the compensation was more adequate than that of many other employers in the area, and it was remotely easy to obtain a full time position."
good,"Fast paced, high interaction. This company has a strong emphasis on creating and maintaing a safe working environment and culture."
good,"I love my job, I love meeting new people all the time. Getting to talk to people and help them find everything they might need. Manager is willing to work with your schedule."
good,Morning meetings kicked off the day we would be assigned what line to work that day and any relevant news about work the company etc would be shared. Management was always in constant contact with one another trying to make everything run smoothly. Good workers friendly welcomed me day one and started showing me the ropes funny people trying to have a good time during long days. Working induction three was the hardest part of this job constant bending up and down carrying heavy items to the belt got grueling after 12 hours. Working the jack pot doors with a co working was a lot of fun and interesting 12 hours in the back of trailers loading or unloading gives you a lot of time to talk while you work.
good,"Usually started day getting appliance deliveries ready by pulling all appliances and accessories, printing loading tickets and supervising third party delivery drivers loading truck."
good,"My co-workers and management are all very nice, Lowes is a great place to work, I wish the pay was better, I like working with people, hardest part is propably the lifting of 5 gal buckets....."
good,"Lowes i entered work and jumped right into mixing paint and assisting customers, i learned how to learn from different departments and aspects of lowes not just paint. Management there was okay, the store manger was more concerned about employee well being than dept mangers, the hardest part of my job was closing by myself due to hour cuts in each dept, i enjoyed most working with people, customer interaction and helping them plan projects and execute them."
good,Lowes was a great company to work for.I managed a few different departments while working at Lowes. The hardest part of the job was the late hours.
good,"Hard to advance in company, low starting pay, boring during slow hours"
good,Great experience with a solid leader in Home Improvement Retail.
good,This company knew that I am a single parent and worked with me so that I could attend functions for my children.
good,"A typical day at work consists of cleaning my work area and returning merchandise. I learned to follow store policy and procedures, and Management needed training also. I had some of the best co-workers, we all were team players, the hardest part of the job was to quit. The most enjoyable part of the job was to tell a customer he could not return stolen merchandise."
good,The co-workers was the main reason why I loved working there. They were always nice and easy to ask for help.
good,A typical day at Lowe's includes providing excellent customer service. Completing tasks such as freight and other paper work.
good,"A typical day at Lowe's consists of usually a quick morning meeting to discuss goals for the day and numbers from the previous day. I learned a lot of product knowledge and home improvement tasks from other employees. At my store Atleast management had its ups and downs. Very few of my bosses micro managed me. When you do your job no bosses bother you very much unless it is for a project or task that has to be completed. If you keep up good work bosses will have your back to the fullest. No accountability for mistakes. The hardest part was probably not being able to go outside the building on your breaks only on lunch. The most enjoyable part would be with working with fun, knowledgeable co-workers."
good,"Lowe's was a great place to work! Great people, however management was not organized and they had there favorites. Pay was ok but they don't pay enough for the things you go through."
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work. Retail hours can be tough, but they pay well in comparison to competition. Work hard and you will have an oooortunity to advance."
good,"I loved this job. the perfect combo of customer service and job satisfaction. it seemed like everyone did they're jobs amazingly except the department i worked under. the drivers that used to be there were cry babies. they had the easiest job, drive from the store to the delivery location, the drivers hardly ever assisted in the installation of product but took all the credit. I would proudly come back and work harder than ever now knowing that those empolyees are nolonger working there for obvious reasons."
good,"A typical day at work ??? There is no typical day, it is always different .It is very rare to have a bad day."
good,Unloading the trucks with other hard working individuals. Dispersing the freight throughout the store is priority number one. The safety training and regulations are great. The negative side is not enough workers to cover the sales floor.
good,"The store I was hired to work in is the largest sales volume store in the greater Syracuse, NY market. With a diversified employee base, I was able to rebuild employee trust and morale that had been sorely lacking prior to my arrival. My position involved heavy recruitment efforts to select the best candidates for all open positions, and the enhanced customer service levels that were consistently attained were testimony to those efforts."
good,"del. stuff to customers help in store as needed great place to work nice people, management is allways stressed out and rolls over on employies"
good,"I loved coming in to work and having contractors come up to me challenging me to find them better deals. I would contact vendors and corporate to find the best deal possible for my customers. In doing this I increase sales 4x each month. I got my contractors to purchase four flooring installs each month instead of the one install each month they were originally purchasing. I loved when customers came to me with a challenge to overcome. Also the store's motto was ""One Team One Dream"" which I believe is a great motto to have."
good,"I first started working at Lowe's through my seasonal employment with the company, after my seasonal period was up, they offered me a permanent position with the company. Daily work consisted of loading customers with bags of mulch, and also cleaning up the department after closing. My only problem with the company was the management. Aside from my actual zone manager (each zone in the store had a different Assistant Store Manager overlooking them) the rest of the managers gave very vague, and confusing instructions, and often gave instructions that contradicted their previous requests."
good,Clock in around 2pm and help customers until 7pm. After 7 we stock until 11pm and prepare the store for the next business day.
good,steady work pace some what slow after opening rush easy to grasp as far as learn something new
good,"A typical day: Loading & Unloading Freight, Windows,& Doors. Stocking & down stocking windows and doors. Cleaning & Maintaining my work area. Assisting customers with their windows & door service needs. Taking special/custom orders for customers for their windows/door needs. I learned to be patient with customers desires for their specific wants for custom treatments for their orders. I also learned that this required patient, active listening, attention to detail to fulfill their needs, so they would be satisfied with their purchase and my service. I found my co-workers to be very friendly and very eager to help, especially if I needed help at any time. The hardest part of the job, but got easier as time went on, was working with customers that had many specific requests for their custom orders. The most enjoyable part was the satisfaction of seeing the customers pick up their custom orders and see that they truly loved it, so I knew I did well in helping them & listening to them."
good,"Time management and inventory control. Perfecting the core of customer service and training my employees made managements jobs easier. The hardest part of my job was dealing with complex and involved situation, but also the must enjoyable."
good,Liked working there. Good starter job for young eager person to work
good,"I unload new shipments, bring freight to the floor, and stock appliances. I learned how to operate a Forklift, Order Picker, and Reach Truck. My coworkers are nice people. Hardest part of my job is the physical demand on your body but I like a good workout. Time flies when you are busy and my job keeps my busy,"
good,"Great place of business. The mangers doesnt reconize your good deeds, as long their names are mentioned and you gets NO credit"
good,"Job consisted of stocking shelves, helping customers, and keeping the department clean."
good,Nice work environment. TOO many bosses no one really accountable.
good,"Early starts and hard work were typical. Learned all safety rules are there for a reason. Lots of politics in management, a bit of of a good ol' boy network with poor communication. Most coworkers all good and hard working! Lots of heavy lifting of large refrigerators in tight areas were the hardest part of this job."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and all of the customers. Lowes has good benefits and values customer service.
good,The job pay your bills that it the job can be diffult at times the worker are friendly
good,Was enjoyable to help inform and design projects the customers needed help with.
good,It's a place that I get to go work on a weekly basis knowing that I'm going to be treated with integrity and respect.
good,great co-workers; excellent customer service program; flexible work schedule
good,"A typical day at Lowes has varied as I have worked there. Over the past five years I have worked at Lowes I have held different positions. I started off as a loader in the garden department and worked my way up to a full-time employee in the seasonal department. In the seasonal department, I was the team leader which required me to perform certain tasks such as: help manage the employees in the department, keep inventory of the items in the department, and provide exceptional customer service. Upon going back to school I realized I needed to spend more time with school and took a job as the store's assembler. In this position, I am responisble for assembling all of the stores displays and customer ordered items."
good,Lowe's is very customer service oriented. I like that they are interested in their customers. They have high standards for their associates and the safety for them as well.
good,"cashier. nice co-worker . helping customers , stocking , loading truck"
good,The hardest part of the job is the excessive heavy lifting and very little time to sit and recooperate from the deliveries.
good,"It's a great Part time second job, but not the kinda job to support a family on."
good,"they work well with school schedules and days off. If they don't, it's usually because the computer system they switched to went down and they didn't get the request. If you talk to your manager though, they tend to try to help. Sometimes. They like to change your schedule the day of or the day before with out telling you. Then you end up late, and it goes on your file. Thats the biggest issue."
good,"A typical day starts with reviewing yesterday's sales to determine what areas where shopped and what areas might need replenishment. Next, the daily tasks begin of stocking, helping customers, performing cycle counts, maintaining safety standards, and much much more."
good,"This is a great place to work, but getting promoted is the thing that most people don't have time for. It takes a long time to move from position to position in the company."
good,"Working with customers is very rewarding. I like the interaction with people to help them find what they need and to learn interesting things about their projects. I have found the variety of shift work difficult. Because of the nature of the business a consistent schedule is not really possible. My past work experience in a totally different environment was more consistent. The variety of things to do in a day is interesting as well. Problem solving customer issues, addressing concerns of cashiers and keeping up with the required responsibilities keeps me on my toes. On a negative note...at times the lack of positive feedback on performance is disheartening. Sometimes the requirements of the job seem to shift without adequate training to address them."
good,It's an ok place to be! pay is good for being a seasonal cashier :) ALWAYS work weekends! :(
good,Not a lot of room to grow but it's a good working environment.
good,"A typical day at work is a productive day, a day when customers come in and I interact with them, having that customer relationship, cleaning after myself, for exapmle after using the cash registers, making sure it's clean. I've learned how to work with people, and to help those who don't know there way around the store,I've learned to manage with people who are having their days, and to do team work."
good,Great learning experience with HR.
good,"Lowe's is a really enjoyable place to work. The employees are friendly and helpful, and most of the customers are enthusiastic."
good,I enjoyed my experience at Lowes the managers were great and got to learn about how the other side of retail works. My co- workers were very helpful and we all worked together to get things done. It was one of the best teams I have ever worked on and enjoyed every minute of it. I learned alot about hardware and how everything comes together in that enviroment.
good,"my typical day at work, is to be standing at the entrance or exit door of the store, checking that customers do not take any merchandise out of the store with out paying for it, also I have to validate that the merchandise that customers are taking out is the same that the one in the receipt. Also I direct customers to the appropriate department."
good,Enjoyed the job because it was close to home. Customers were nice. Was not happy when I got laid off.
good,"Working as a Receiving Stocking Sales Associate, Lumber, Building Materials Sales Associate. Unloading freight, stocking in the correct department. Giving exceptional customer service through my knowledge of general construction. Interacting with customers answering any questions they may have had for the project they were working on."
good,"Management can be better, but overall Lowe's is a great company to work for. Very flexible, great pay, and benefits."
good,the benefits and pay is very good and the employees are nice.
good,Shipping and receiving type of work in which if you have worked in a warehouse before you will feel right at home.
good,this was not my favorite job i had due to lack of good managment. I would have done alot better then they did.
good,"Lowes is a great place to work, but in order for it to be seen at it's full potential, you must have dedicated managers. If you don't have great managers it will give the company as a whole a bad reputation."
good,"Great place to work , best place working in Retail. Customer satisifaction"
good,i've been working at lowes for over 3 years. the manager's work hard and everyone seems to enjoy working with each other
good,This was the best company iver ever worked for and wished to had been able to stay with them except the fact that the shutdown several stores.
good,management was sketchy at times but everything else was good.
good,Their overall atmosphere is friendly. You can move up fast if you are good at your job. This company is excellent to work for. I made a mistake when I left for another job offer. The grass is not always greener on the other side.
good,"At Lowes, you sometimes wear multiple hats.  I worked specifically in Delivery Department as a rider and helped install and deinstall appliances in customer homes.  Some days they would have me on the floor helping customers, stocking, or fronting up the shelves."
good,"Learn how to drive a Forklift, needs better pay rate, more managers in charge of the jobs of the others, good forklifts in good conditions for the job.!"
good,"Good benefits and investment opportunities. Paid holidays, vacation, sick time for full time employees. Management is not the best but improvements are being made everyday"
good,"Working for Lowe's allows a lot of opportunity to gain knowledge about home improvement, and general ""do it yourself"" knowledge that would otherwise be hard to come by. A typical day at work involves lots of face to face customer interaction, as well as a fair amount of walking and manual labor to re-stock or load large orders. I would say the worst part of my experience working at Lowe's has been the management; consistently avoiding their duties and generally not being the face that such a large organization needs at their stores."
good,working for lowes was great it allowed me the opportunity to grow within a company. Management seems difficult and will not always listen to employees needs
good,They're working on improving things. Everything is constantly changing but the overall environment I work in is amazing. I love who I work with. I've never worked with a better group of people.
good,You really need to feel out the situation of dealing with customers and employees to not get in trouble by saying the wrong things or things management is decent
good,At lowes we have a liking to certain things to be done certain ways such as organization and making sure that the customers know what they are getting from their orders. This allows the customers to find better deals and give great feedback and constructive criticism that we love to get to improve on everything and anything we can to make it a better experience for the customer.
good,"With the right kind of training of employee and manager this store can and  will achieve great sale record. After working there during my term I found with the proper tools,and training I excel."
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe’s. A majority of the staff were kind and friendly to talk with. I came in did what was expected and then some then went home. What I did not like and observed daily was management blaming head cashiers for their mistakes. That bothered me. There is one person from management who does scheduling and that person is awful at it. Either not enough cashiers or to many. Needless to say, their management team needs to be revised.  They are wonderful people but they need a refresher course on their daily duties..."
good,Love working here and love  all the different aspects of it and it has a lot of learning to offer. Job security isn't there and the advancement opportunities lack
good,I love the people that I work with at Lowes and the fast pace of the company.  I believe they could put a little more into the training of employees for growth in positions.
good,"A typical day at Lowes in the receiving department entails a hard, physically demanding job that requires you to stay on your toes to keep up with the required freight flow rate."
good,"Great company to work for in the begining until you have been there a while and ask you to volunteer to work outside of your hours you were assigned without notice and you refused, they would find ways to punish you for that. Other than that, great place to start."
good,"started my career at here and it has been a great experience I am quite thankful for. Great work life balance. "
good,"They have flexible hours for those going to school or semi-retired like myself. The pay is average to retail. Management is easy to work with and responsive to needs. The only drawback for me as a part timer is the constant revolving schedule you never know when you are going to work. I've worked six straight days and have had 8 straight days off, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to there schedule. Other than that it's a great place to work."
good,"Work/life balance is great, but stresses on the job make it harder than it has to be. Lowe’s scrapped a perfectly good product location system with precise bin locations over this past summer only to go back to the original bin location system they started with in the first place! Lowe’s to keep the most wanted items in stock all of the time!"
good,"Great coworkers, good work environment, friendly management, adequate job training, store is kept clean, employee safety and security is a high priority."
good,My experience was generally good.  I suggest this job for a college kid or high schooler.  Most of the time it is a lot of heavy lifting and just assisting customers.  Employees are generally nice people.  When dealing with customers it varies like any other retail job.  Pay is nice at 11.85 when I was working in 2017.
good,I worked in the back end operations of Lowe's as a receiver I had a good schedule Monday thru Friday and was lucky to work with a great group of people who were like ke family toe even though I am no longer there I still keep in touch with most of them
good,"The good part was you mostly worked on your own, with little interference from your supervisor. The bad part was management, especially upper management."
good,I unloaded trucks at a high volume store in the evenings and my actual manager worked days. All our problems couldn't be addressed until the night stock manager arrived halfway through our shift. The back area was never set up for us so we always had to move day receiving stuff around just to be able to unload our truck. It usually felt like no one cared about my crew. One coworker and i saw 12 people revolve through the other two spots on our team in 3 years.
good,There are many wonderful people who are employed where I currently work. I don't feel I was adequately trained before I was out on the floor. Had to learn the area on my own. Don't receive any direction from my manager. Didn't get proper training on the use of their particular system to look up items or place orders....I also need a more consistent schedule
good,"Be vocal in what you want to learn in each department to obtain success. If you do not try to learn new thing, then there can be no room for over all growth in your career."
good,"The work environment is constantly changing, fast paced, and no day is ever the same. The expectations set are fair for the pay during training mode then increase and get dumped on you with minimal guidance."
good,"Not a good enough pay to live off of especially with the low job security, but overall it is a consistent and enjoyable work environment and workload. Management is definitely not the best."
good,Overall a okay work place. There is always stress on the job and schedule constantly changing. Overall work environment is positive and culture is good.
good,"Very team oriented, typical retail job but easy going environment. Company shows appreciation often to associates with lunches, raffles etc. Benefits available even to part time associates."
good,"Great management "
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's but due to some unfortunate incidents I had to leave, if the circumstances were change I would go back, I like the people."
good,"If your partime you get the left over hours from full time no matter how long you been working there.pretty good about breaks and lunches. Enjoying helping customers"
good,"Constantly looking for items that can't be found or often back ordering...crews dont work together. Working on special orders is ok but overnight dont stock items in are it should go, so you spend many hours looking for products"
good,"A very good place to work!!! Advancement good."
good,It was a great place to work. The employees are very nice and welcoming. Pay is good but the hours are not be very flexible. Other than that it was a nice place
good,Lowes seem to take care of their employee's. The store is always busy which makes the time go by fast. My coworkers are great to work with and easy going.
good,I have enjoy working there. You get exercise and a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. there's a sense of family with the summer picnics and rewards meals they have
good,"Good benefits, sometime poor management, not always a good work/life balance. Huge learning experience. Other employees are generally very pleasant to work with. Currently many changes happening within company. Overall I would recommend to others."
good,Management and technical skills are supported and advanced.  They want to be on the cutting edge of technology.  The Support Center is a good place to work.
good,All around I love my coworkers and the people that came in it was a good job and I highly recommend really wish I would’ve stayed Will gladly go back.
good,Awesome work environment as long as you enjoy the retail culture. Lowes is always supportive of employee advancement. Cross training encouraged to enhance the customer experience.
good,"Honestly I didn’t have any issues while I worked there. Employees were fun to work with for the most part, a few bad eggs but I always enjoyed coming in and working."
good,Lowe's has many different departments and I worked in commercial sales.  Direct sales pays more and it forces you to learn all of the other departments.  You build relationships with the community and your success is fully depended on this.  It is a fun and dynamic place to work.
good,"A typical day at work involved display assembly, customer interaction, punctuation and professionalism. I learned how to set up displays due to employer specifications.  Workplace was accepting but demanding in terms of punctuality. The hardest part of the job is having to manage customer expectations at all times. The most enjoyable part of the job is working hands on in displays and customer interactions."
good,Lowe's is a educational fun place to work. Their are so many different departments to learn. Each department specializes in something different for your home. It's also the place where my forklift and really machine experience started.
good,I appreciated the community support and the opportunity to work with great people. The fact that Lowe's released their HR professionals tells me that they have changed their values and are putting themselves at risk of liability relying on the store management alone to manage.
good,"Only had a problem with one the head cashiers gossiping about me, she also did not do her job which often added extra stress on me and most of all harassing me. Thank goodness I don't work there anymore."
good,"Lowe’s was a good environment. I enjoyed working there and helping the customers. Working outside in the garden, I was outside a lot and I enjoyed that."
good,"This is a great job if you are under the right management! As long as you have managers that are encouraging to keep learning and foster growth. You should also be open to learning from different departments and see that as a positive thing! Staying in one department does not allow to learn enough about the company and how to move up. My experience overall was good because of the collaborative work environment. Be a team player, not a man/woman for themselves, and smile often...it pays to be kind."
good,"Overall a good company to work for."
good,Its a good place to work. A lot of changes coming and not all are good changes. It used to be family oriented but it has changed a lot. No days off are the same no planning anything that's not out 2 weeks
good,"Loved the job and the people.  Always learning something new.  My favorite position was Installed Sales coordinator due to the work load, I love being busy."
good,"I really liked this job, mostly because of the people. Management shows they care about you. It’s a lot of hard work, some heavy lifting, really need try to work fast, and make sure all areas are complete or you will be there till the store opens. Coworkers will always come over to help you, but you have to try hard pull your own weight. Pay is pretty good. All in all I’d recommend!"
good,Lowe's pays well and has career advancements if you would like a career in retail.  If retail is your thing Lowe's is really good because unlike a lot of retailers now you receive Thanksgiving and Christmas off paid.
good,"Great learning experience, professional staff and good training, learned how to operate a forklift and very safety oriented. Management was very helpful and always available to assist."
good,Overall for my experience at the time of taking the job i found it to be an excellent job at learning the ropes for retail. However the paths for improving my position were not the best.
good,Good place to work but hours were all over the board from between 5:30 am - 11 pm varies day to day with weekends included. Management worked along side of others when needed and easy to converse with.
good,"As an assembler, assembled various products for sale in the store or for store use. Required ability to follow written assembly directions with each product."
good,"Fun place to work, co workers are great, most managers are great. good culture around safety and customer service. Flexible hours and accommodating conditions."
good,"My typical day has now changed. My position was moved to overnights.I have learned so many things about home improvement, but my highlight of any day would be helping customers and building wonderful relationships with my customers. There are really no difficulties to working there. I have done just about everything there is to do from building and setting up the store from a concrete slab to a profitable company."
good,"To sum things up... things change without notice. Rules change, positions change, and you are expected to roll with the punches. Hours aren't the greatest. Only closed for Christmas and Thanksgiving day."
good,"I've had a lot worse jobs. Good people to work with, happy with my current manager and store manager. Main concern is their nonstop ""restructuring"" and eliminating entire departments and positions."
good,Lowes was an awesome place to work for. Great people and great management but over time the company has change and the policies change with it as well it’s not work and life balance anymore
good,All employees are very willing to help you learn how to adjust to their systems and the store culture. I enjoyed working here before the store in Shippensburg PA closed.
good,"I know each company will be different but the store i worked at had the best employees and they are like a small family to me..........."
good,"great place to work at especially in this area. filled with great people that are willing to help anytime. they have great benefits, pay, and rules. you will usually get out on time and get enough hours to sustain a normal lifestyle."
good,We have heard that they are doing away with delivery drivers and going to a 3rd party. This has already happened in other departments and employees were given very little notice (notified when they clocked in that morning).
good,"The hardest part about the job was the manager, or at least doing the things he made us do after we got done. Next were the pallets, sometimes they were easy and would take you like 2 hours to do."
good,"It can be stressful at times but good employees make it worth coming in. Can be very fast pace. management is okay, Company going through some changes so if you go in as part time you might not get many hours."
good,"A typical day at Lowe's allowed me to clean the parking lot, assist customers, and receive daily assignments. The most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere."
good,"Lowes work/life balance is lacking, but you get a lot of benefits and a stable work environment.  There is room for growth and bonuses are given about 2x a year if the store meets their sales goals."
good,"Good working environment.  Helpful managers.  Good benefits.  Friendly atmosphere, meet interesting people, good products for healthy living, good discounts and frequent sales on quality products."
good,"Lowes is a wonderful company, as long as you understand the nature and mission of the organization. Customer service and retail are difficult markets, unless you are empathetic, motivated and a self-learner."
good,Lowes was a great first job for me when I finished high school and was flexible with my hours during college. Like any retail job you get your fair share of crazy customers but its a great way to bond with your co-workers who will start to feel like family. I worked on the front end as a cashier and eventually graduated to the service desk. You will become a master at problem solving while working the service desk. Gained great foundation skills for future jobs.
good,Very fast working environment with room for advancement. Management is very fair. The company continues to grow and expand which creates a lot more job opportunities.
good,As far as retail goes it’s not a terrible place to work. The advancements are are to come by and sometimes the management is less than stellar. Also sometimes the customers are hard to deal with.
good,Enjoyed my time there just wish it offered full time position I came as a part time seasonal after 90 days became part time permanent but only 24 to 25 hours a week I stayed until something else came along but overall I enjoyed my coworkers and I loved the customers
good,"Great coworkers and management"
good,"Lowes has friendly staff, store manager is awesome, he is very helpful. Overall nice place to work. I have very good experience and I learn lots of from there."
good,"Appliance delivery is a two man team,  and is strenuous.  Your day may include many stops, with pickup and haul away of old appliances. Your day may include many stairs on each delivery. You just never know what to expect until you load your truck."
good,"I like working here a lot of the employees are really nice and good about trying to help you out. Manager wise they all try their best to be as efficient as possible, but as a cashier it was hard to make plans for future reference because of the lack of set scheduling for the time being at least."
good,"Standard retail gig, customer service 'til you're blue in the face and sales wins the day.  Days tend to drag with rotating shifts.  Shifts can start as early as 4a and end as late as 11p."
good,"I enjoyed working there and the coworkers were friendly and helpful. It was a seasonal position with good pay, I would recommend a job there to anyone"
good,"While working at Lowe’s, I have learned a new operating system, met great people and felt more like I played an important role in the cashier team. My co workers were helpful, the department associates knowledgeable and management staff stood behind their employees."
good,When clocking in for the day you have 6 minutes leeway.  The customers are very important to the structure.  Each person has there own specific job to do.  The hardest part is being asked by a manager to do something time consuming while still helping all customers.  The People you work with for the most part hard a nice attitude and are usually willing to help with anything that is needed.
good,"My tasks at Lowes was relatively easy, but there were some tough times. My task was to unload the whole Truck with three other people. If the truck loaded by the RDC was big or disorganized the task was slightly difficult, but for most part easy. Management at my store was good, fair, and easy to communicate, but with a few exceptions. My Only complaint is how the RDC loaded the trucks were very unsafe."
good,Lowes was a great place to have a first job out of high school as they worked with my college schedule and trained me themselves so I did not need any prior experience.
good,"Steady pace, a great way to get experience with management of difficult situations. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the last minute changes banana last overall job duties and functions are easy."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me representing the company with excellent customer service to our customers. I would direct customers to what they were looking for. When they were ready to check, I made sure that they had a great experience and found everything they needed. I would ring up their purchases and call for loading assistance if it were needed."
good,Great company to work with and benefits are great. The only thing I had thing about the job is the sudden and sometimes drastic changes the company makes. But it’s a great company to work with and you can make a career out of it.
good,"Lowes is a great company. Just like any other company your managers is what makes the experience. Depending on your position you get forklift experience. They use 3 different types. Narrow aisle, Counter balance, and an order picker."
good,"working on the sales floor can keep you busy. Always people walking through the door looking for some help, whether it be some advice for something they're building or just what to buy for a project."
good,Good company but advancement opportunities stop at Management level unless you are able to relocate. If you are able to relocate the opportunities are limitless.
good,"unloading all delivery trucks using power equipment, Put all merchandise away or for special orders, tag with customers name and find a bin location. Do all paperwork related to product. Keep receiving clean , sweep empty trash ect. At close of day prepare receiving for night crew."
good,"Family-oriented, friendly  environment, always something to do or someone to help, customer focus Around the Clock and a great team of people to work with."
good,"Great place to work. Coworkers for the most part were great. It's like a family. Good pay and great benefits. The only complaint with lowes is the smart mouth,know it all customers."
good,"Lowes was a great place to build a career, if you were customer minded.  The team in the stores builds a family type atmosphere. Must have skills to multi-task and work hard."
good,"If you're going to work retail, Lowe's is about as good as it gets. It's a big company, so there is always someone to turn to for support. The managers get spread thin, but they were always respectful to us. They didn't micromanage. The pay and benefits were available, no matter what your job was. There are a variety of jobs too. So there is something for everyone to do for the company. Just don't let them put you on the customer service desk. You'll be making the same rate of pay as a cashier to deal with a lot more misfirings and complaints."
good,Corporate and upper management change continually...but the Lowe's family...the store employees make it a great place to work.  The direction the company is going is counter intuitive and will loose customers...the only thing keeping them are the store employees.
good,"not bad but not great, some people dont do their job so you have to pick up their slack. they arent bad people, just lazy. and most of the time they dont follow the rules"
good,We have as much fun as possible while still making sure we are running a safe and successful place of business. This is really a great place to work .
good,"Must be a self starter - can be fun at times - good bonus structure for all levels - benefits are good "
good,"learn time management, routing."
good,"Every department other than checking is very heavy work.  If you take the job in a certain department, you are expected to do the work.  Stocking is very physical."
good,Enjoyed working there.  Great benefits and did not take stress home at night.  The people that you work with are the best part.  There have been a lot of changes in the last few years and many long term employees are no longer there which is unfortunate.
good,"As a part-time employee at Lowe's Home Improvement, balancing work and personal life is a breeze. Working in Customer Service, multitasking is a must. Some days you are required to pick up the slack from call-outs, but at the end of the day we come together as a team and make it work."
good,I leaned a few things every day at Lowes especially working in lumber. I love and miss my customers and the pets I got to be familiar with. The days went by fast and the other employees were very friendly and helpful. The lifting of heavy items i found a little difficult. Over all I wish i still worked there.
good,"It was a good place to work, but I was told I'd be hired as a driver and the job describe was not as I was told It required loading, unloading pulling inventory, etc."
good,I know that in the future when I look back on my experience with Lowe’s I’ll appreciate the experience. I really do appreciate the advancements that I’ve made in life and with my work.
good,I have enjoyed my time with Lowe's. One of the best companies to work LP for. Several recent changes has made it a little less enjoyable. Pay is better than most.
good,I gave Lowes 9 years and they laid me off.  Why? I started as a dept. Managet and made Asst. Manager in less  than 1 year.  Please give me my job back.
good,I loved working there because of the hands on work. I'm a very active person. I played 4 years of football and other sports as well. I'm very energetic.
good,"Everyone was really nice, willing to teach you what you needed to know and there was always a chance for improvement or switching duties if need be. From inside to outside or in the front to in the back."
good,I enjoyed my experience. My position was removed from the company along with the program it created. It was a lesson learned I would not take back for anything. I could have gotten another job in company but chose to take severance package and move back home because of my personal life changes.
good,It use to be THE company to work for. But the last 2 years have been nothing but downsizing and layoffs. The company is still performing well but job security is at an all time low.
good,"It’s not a bad place to work, decent pay and they don’t try to kill you. But you still have all the chiefs running around trying to get a rung higher on the ladder"
good,"It's a good place to work, but a lot of stuff changes very frequently without much notice. Management, depending on what happens, either communicate either very well or horribly, no in between."
good,"Prior to 2008, Lowe's was a great place to work. You were treated fairly and had ample advancement opportunities. After the ""great recession"" the company has floundered about attempting to re-define itself for an ever changing marketplace, with very limited success from an employee's perspective. Corporate direction appears to change nearly every year with aborted attempts to re-invent home improvement retail showing lack of commitment to foundational retail/customer service principles. This has created an environment of management by consensus and perpetual lay-offs and reorganizations, leading to employee dissatisfaction and job insecurity. Under current management you only need to look at Home Depot to see your future as an employee, the simple playbook being followed is to copy number one to become number one. An unlikely path to success."
good,"...that is beginning to change a great deal in the past 2 years."
good,Working at Lowes was one of the best jobs i had because it taught me a ton about customers and how understanding their needs is the best way to help them.
good,"I worked as a salaried Manager.  I enjoyed my responsibilities and job demands, but it did put a stress on my marriage.  I was only scheduled 9.5 hours/day, but it was impossible to complete my duties in that time.  Most days were 11-12 hours/day.  The advancement possibility was present, but work/life balance was sacrificed for that possibility.  Lowe's overall was a great place to work...good pay, great benefits, but it came at a price.  I was a victim of Lowe's propensity to ""cut costs"" at every 4-5 years intervals.  I made too much money, so I was let go.  Lowe's gave me 2 weeks separation for every years service, but refused to pay me the 600+ hours of sick pay that I never used.  Basically, I was punished financially for refusing to call off work.  That left a sour taste, but overall, Lowe's was a rewarding experience."
good,"Lowe’s was a cool job. Very laid back. Friendly and inviting environment. Management could use a little TLC but nothing major. The pay was decent. As long as you was doing your job, you had nothing to worry about."
good,I really enjoy working at Lowe's but need a full time job I can rely on to pay bills. My check is never constant but I have learned so much. Most of the worker's are friendly and willing to help you learn and I love running the forklifts. I think they should do rotations so you can learn each department. Some people have been in the same department for many years.
good,In Merchandising it can be a tough job buts its rewarding to see the final result of the hard work you put in at the end of the day. Rests keep you busy and the servicing helps to bring in more profit.
good,Management when down the drain felt like i was no longer valued and like certain managers would single me put. They also couldn't schedule correctly. which is a shame because otherwise the work environment was fun and you could feel accomplished
good,My experience there sucks and they didn't get the best of me out mainly the position they gave me. No one helped me when I asked for it. The managers don't really help out
good,"Theres a lot of rules breaking on the favor of management, never in favor of the employee.  They only care to look good for their bosses, dont care about employees."
good,"Intentions and goals are attainable, for this company but there is a lack of development for associates.  Professional sales skills are being demanded with no support training, they are not hiring sales professionals to fill the specialty jobs.  It is in need of more enrichment.  The hardest part of being a sales specialist is finding strategies to meet the ambitious sales goals they are holding you responsible for."
good,I love working for Lowe's and have for the past 9 years. Their ability to change and adapt will always keep them on top. I have worked for a lot of locations and have always loved the people I worked for and with.
good,"Hard working, dependable. Company going to 3rd party contract for deliveries. Corporate decision. Cut my hours. Corporate saves money on trucks, fuel, man hours."
good,"I've been with Lowe's since Feb, 2018. Worked as seasonal, transitioned into part-time regular. I like people that I work with and see every day. Pay is quite fair for a retail establishment. My benefits include: "
good,"Easy work, low pay. My hours were relatively stable, most positions were not. Very simple and repetitive work that is not at all challenging. Able to meet many interesting people."
good,Good work. Helpful management. Annual reviews could happen more frequently. Pay increases the only negative. Hours are a plus for me. Also have weekends off in my position
good,Customer service rep in Tool dept. and sometimes Hardware. Enjoyed most of my co-workers and management was decent. Working with the public sometimes challenging as with most and public affiliated job.
good,"My personal experiences with Lowe's have varied, as I have worked at two separate locations; one of them is easily the best place I have ever worked for, and the other was easily the worst. It all depends on who your managers are and what position you're in."
good,"I loved working at Lowe's and greeting customers and inquiring about their needs. And making sales."
good,A decent place to work at not bad at all I learned a lot of good and useful things. Management was decent at my store and they provide pretty good benefits with okay pay.
good,"I worked for Lowe's for 10 years,  worked my way up to a nice management position then one day, bam! My position was dissolved. It's a pretty good company to work for, but they constantly scrambling to keep up with home depot. Often making rash decisions that are later changed back. For the most part, I enjoyed my job & the people, just didn't feel much job security."
good,A fairly relaxed environment where employees received the training necessary so as not to have to be continually watched over or be told what tasks needed to be performed
good,Good as starter job advancement is difficult so you would work some job for same pay for a couple years before you moved up unless your one of the managers favorites
good,"Overall a great place for a retired man, like myself to work. Hours change day to day, so it's hard to try and work a planned budget. But on a 1-5, I'd give Lowes a 5."
good,"Management was the only problem with my job at Lowe's. They were inconsistent with scheduling and when the changes were made, they don't notify you because they would change them the night before."
good,"The best part of working here is the great benefits they offer. I appreciate that my manager seems invested in helping me learn more and do my job well. Unfortunately we seem to always be short on cashiers so no matter what your job actually is, you'll likely end up on a register too frequently."
good,Lowes have many opportunities for growth. I worked with Lowes for 9 yrs.  Lowes has an excellent  training skills for all employees for every department.
good,Throughout my time at lowes I have learned alot. It has always been a secure place to work and everybody there is easy to get along with. Interacting with customers is the main part of the job and because of this you are able to become well antiquated to dealing with many situations. Management has been confusing at times but for the most part is pretty solid. The most enjoyable part of my job was the hours and the coworkers i worked with.
good,"Super nice coworkers, very helpful environment to learn in. Standing for long hours and very early start time. Enjoyable environment for an everyday job."
good,I had a specific manager that was terrible at their job. The company and job as a whole was fine. overworked but adequately paid. the upper management was helpful and courteous. Helping people love where they live.
good,I learned a lot about customer service and management skills at this job...I moved from freight loader to dept manager in 6 months time...I was in charge of hardware dept and tools..
good,Lowes is my current employer. I enjoy it there but I feel like I have ran my course and would like to try something new. It's been a great job that has helped me improve my team skills.
good,"I learned a great amount about team work. IF you are a hands on type of person and like to build things, the assembly team is the one to join. The culture was one of sharing and getting the job done. Customer satisfaction was number one."
good,Great place to practice daily job tasks and dealing with customers from morning to evening.  Having to answer different questions about their home projects were good.
good,"a typical work day "
good,A good store manager makes the job that much more enjoyable. Someone who sets the example and would never ask you to do something he wouldn't. Inspiring and caring.
good,"Things have changed quite a bit these past few years. The changes they're making are just stupid and will cost them the company if they dont wise up, and go back to their roots. That being said. I did love working there. The pay was decent, I enjoyed my coworkers and managers, tho the store manager when I left was a real see you next tuesday. They offered benefits that were decent, you could go to HR about anything (no HR now so thats gone) could swap shifts with people, and for the most part people were content. I will say, working customer service here is stressful with the level of ridiculous customers are. Also their theft policy is just a joke. The only thing I hated which is why I left was they promised me a position and filled it with a managers kid who didnt know what they were doing."
good,Lowes pays really really good for a retail job. One of the best of you ask me. I started out as a seasonal cashier and I became permanent after I had my baby (yes I started there 7mos pregnant). The had very flexible shifts and my direct supervisors were the best. I would recommend this company for anyone who wants to make good money for a regular customer service job
good,During my short time at Lowe’s I have learned so much and made a few good friends I am happy that I had to chance to work for them. I will never forget everything that I learned with my short time their.
good,Worked at Lowes as an assembler. There was all the time to assembled items for the store or the customer.  Staff was nice and willing to help when needed.
good,Pleasure working with associates and a pretty upbeat work environment management is the only thing that needs change besides that good  place to work.
good,It was a fun place to work but the pay didnt help at all. Especially getting bi-weekly pay. It doesnt help pay your bills or stay up with your bills. But was fun to help customers.
good,"Lowe's offered flexible hours, which helped because I was working two jobs at the time. Pay could definitely be better. I wanted to become a SME (Subject Matter Expert) or move up, but that wasn't available."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Lowes.  I decided to make the move to another company which was closer to home.  It was a good place with good people.  Management had their struggles, but it all worked out in the end"
good,"Lowe's is a decent place to work. I was able to work hard and advance relatively quickly. There is a gap with the lack of applicable training made available to associates. In my particular situation, I have obtained much of the workload of my manager, and I am expected to cover roles of associates that have called out or found other employment. The staffing model is such that there often more customers in the store than associates to help them, which causes more stress to the associates works. Under the new CEO, many changes have been made that seem to have affected the work/life balance of the people working under him in the stores difficult to maintain. While the store I work at is not yet affected, many stores are employing a new scheduling system that does not give you set days off, or any guarantee of two days off in a row."
good,"Worked here for a year, I've had great experience with costumers and coworkers. Makes me feel good helping costumers feel confident about the project there working on."
good,"Enjoyed my job, interacting with contractors and customers to ensure a quality job completion every time. Lowes gives you the ability to always put the customer first."
good,I am very grateful for having the opportunity to work here. It was a good experience and place to hone my skills at. I would come back if had the chance.
good,Hardest part of the job was the constantly changing of store managers. Each one had their own  style and vision but none were consistent with Lowes values or at least values that were relayed to us
good,Every Single day is a new adventure. You talk with so many different customers some new some contractors. Its always a task to make sure you give the customers a great experience. Lowe's strives to give the customer the best experience they can give. Everyday comes with its own challenges that can be completed with union between employees. The hardest part of my job was to maintain a safe and smooth running front end. Aside from helping customers I give cashiers breaks and lunches as needed. Also I make sure the registers are stocked and ready to use for cashiers when they arrive. The best part is watching customers leave the store with a smile or hearing stories of how their remodel came out which makes me happy. I have learned many skills working at Lowe's including how to be a supervisor I never pictured I would be one but hey there is always a chance. I learned how to maintain a professional attitude and make sure to treat everyone fairly and equal. Management is a big help and they are there to help you finish task that you can not do on your own and they also teach you new tricks that you can use to better the experience for customers.
good,Relaxed work atmosphere. Staff made it a fun place to work. Management was always open for suggestions on improving work place efficiency. Management was extremely helpful and gave the employees support when Interacting  with customers and trying to resolve complaints.
good,"Great place to work... loved the hours and people. Customers"
good,The vast majority of customers were wonderful to deal with. I made many friends through work and was genuinely sad to leave. Department managers and assistant store managers were all great to work with and super helpful.
good,Lowe’s was a good place to work when I was there but seems completely different here in Florida. The people I worked with up north were more untuned too their jobs.
good,"Worked for Lowes 10 year, started as a stocker finished as an ASM. Great company to work for. I would recommend Lowes as a great place to work if you are looking to start a career."
good,Overall the experience I had at Lowe’s was a good one. I started as a part time in paint and in three years I became a department manager. As with any large store there were good and and bad workers pleasant and difficult customers. Retail normally has a rotating schedule which can be exhausting or inconvenient.
good,"The only thing I really didn't like about this job was the customers, a majority of which were entitled and ride."
good,"Good place to work over all , friendly environment, room for improvement,  10% discount for employees, 1 hour lunch,  good management,  very clean environment,  friendly customers,  good for home improvement products , good tools."
good,I love working for Lowe’s. The only thing I don’t like is how in organized our corporate staff is. We get direction at the beginning of the week but then get some totally different direction by end of week.
good,"The typical day changed from day to day and hour by hour sometimes. I did everything from running a register to handling customer complaints. Because this was I first management position a learned a lot from my store manager. He took the time to show my how to manage different kinds of people. You can not manage everyone the same way. "
good,"This job was a little difficult, so it's better for the younger people a lot of working without power equipment. I let this distribution to take another position closer to family."
good,I worked in delivery so it was always   Stressful . Never had enough people for the job always over loaded with  deliveries . Witch made your day long and harder to do.
good,Retail is a position that keeps you on your toes and can change at any given moment.  The hours are tough on a family life but the management skills gained are priceless.
good,"There was no typical day at work."
good,"Typical work day. Part time employee. Start at 4 am. About 4 others on my team. Most days only a few show up. Some never even bother to call and at least 2 to 3 late everyday. I was the only one on time most of the time. This made it difficult for the others who did show up on time. Opened boxes and stocked shelfs till time to get off. Company provides 15 min break.  Most of my team took 20 to 30 min or longer if they took naps. Real laid back environment if you are that type of worker and want to take advantage. You can work extra hours if you want as they have more part timers than full time. I got asked to work extra 3 or 4 days a week. This way they can get more work from you without providing the full time benefits. But if you need the hours that's a plus for company and you. I liked working there, however workers that do not get disciplined make it tuff on the others and I let this get to me. Should have ignored it and would go back if I could."
good,"I enjoy working for Lowe’s. I work in an RDC in shipping utilizing forklifts to load outbound trailers for stores. I usually load 5-12 trailers at once, so the ability to multitask is essential. The work is extremely fast paced, especially in shipping because everything in the DC funnels through there to get to the stores. There is always plenty of opportunities for overtime, especially from February-October. 50 hour work weeks are common during this time. Company match 401k of up to 3%, employee stock purchase plan and decent benefits are nice. You can also get bonuses for doing well on your performance. I do think they could pay a little more for the work, but the overtime usually makes up for the difference. Also, it seems tough to move up within the facility unless you know upper management well. Most supervisors have the “do as I say, not as I do” mentality. "
good,At my store management was good.  Morale was great and had lot of great people to work with.  Salary is good with opportunities to become permanent after season was over.  Standing on my feet for eight hours in one place was physically hard for me for my age.  Otherwise its a great place to work.
good,"* The pay for a specialist is decent.  "
good,"Lowes Home Improvement, Whitby, is a great place to work! I have gained real world experience with customers and management staff, and have always been treated with respect. I manage a team of cashiers, loaders and other customer service associates. Departmental associates always come to me for help with customer issues/care. I am able to calmly distribute unfortunate information and offer the customer something in return."
good,I'm a college student who just turned 20 so I haven't had a lot of job experience but Lowes has by far been the best job I've had. they provide me with good benefits and good job security
good,Lowe’s is a great company to be apart of. Many things people don’t realize is how much managers trust you. Many times you are working with no supervision. That shows they trust who they hire and that makes coworkers feel important. At my current job location Lowe’s new haven 0593 we do great with sales and safety goals that we get parties at the end of the month. This included food and drinks and just a place to relax out back. Overall a fun and loving group of people
good,"I think if you have been at Lowe’s for a year or over that you should get a raise. I personally bust my back at Lowe’s and never even get a compliment from any one at the store. I give out compliments all day. I love my job at Lowe’s, I just wish I got paid a little more."
good,"It's pretty fun, co-workers are nice and helpful. Most of management is really reliable but a few can be tough to work with. Have questions then just ask, everyone is always up to help. Customers are, for the most part, fine and friendly but some can be really rude. Mostly slow/steady until summer when it gets stupid busy(they call it the 100 days of H3LL). I would recommend this for someone either starting out job searching or looking for a career as there is opportunity for advancement you just have to keep an eye out for positions. Keep in mind they try to do internal hires first, then look outside the company for people so your odds are very good if you find a position you want."
good,"It was overall an okay place to work , some issuesvwit management , lack of communication , moving up in the company , was more favoritism than dedication and hard work.in moving up here .. needs improvement in how they treat employees"
good,not bitter.... wish I was still doing the job I loved.  I think they cut a program that was beneficial to the company.  It was perfect for me in every way living in a small town.  I'm sad about being made redundant.
good,Pay was equivalent to position held.  Customers were focused on heavily and customer reviews were analyzed and used to make better store decisions.  Room for advancement.
good,Working at Lowe's I was surrounded by people that were considerate and managers that were understanding. It is one of the first workplaces that I am actually not mad to go into work for.
good,"Its was nice with how friendly and helpful co-workers were, great pay and hours, not much to live on but overall good. Management was a bit off with them not keeping their word."
good,"Very nice co-workers, and excellent Management, but all of Cooperate is bringing the company down, making unfair rules for all of the employees, to comply to the whole ""Customer satisfaction,"" while not really caring about their employees."
good,Not every day is the same each day brings new challenges and new customers with similar or different problems. I love to help customers to find ways to fix their issues.
good,"Decent job with friendly co workers. Great learning opportunity for me. Learned a lot about building fences, dry wall, hardware and also learned how to drive a forklift. Pay wasn't very good."
good,"Overall i enjoyed working at Lowe's.  Enjoyed working with all employee""s.  I believe they paid  reasonable wages and had good benefits.  Especially for management."
good,"At Lowes I was given the opportunity to work with people from my community, I learned how to properly greet people that enter the establishment and how to work with people from different perspectives. The managers at Lowes do a great job at making sure everyone is working on a task but if someone needs help they search for another employee to help instead of helping the employee themselves. The hardest part of the job was dealing with frustrated customers. When a customer is determined on getting their return or need a sooner delivery time, because sometimes you're only capable of doing so much. The most enjoyable part of the job at Lowes is when you get the opportunity to help guests find the parts they need to fulfill their project. Its nice to see the guests smile when they see their project coming together."
good,"You will learn a lot at Lowe's about all sorts of different products and how to do almost anything in your home. With the new CEO, they are aligning more and more with Home Depot's ways in a positive way. They are working to bring better balance to your job/life and added several supervisor positions to each store earlier in the the year 2019. I would recommend the company."
good,Lowes is a great place to work if you just want a job.  They do offer great benefits.  A Lot of follow up entries in computer management that seem to be a waste of time
good,"Some managers are great to work with. They will micromanage you but in times of need they will dig in with you and assist to fix situations. When there are emergencies, if you are a diligent employee and get your work done they will work with you and provide assistance. However, some managers will need lessons on communication, ethic and performance. To assist them with realistic expectations and proper management of staff."
good,"A very challenging  and rewarding position, each day presents new opportunities to meet customer needs and provide knowledge on several different products."
good,"My job required I spend the majority of my time outside of the store, but when I was in the store interacting with the other employees it was always a positive experience"
good,"I have worked for Lowe's Home Improvement for five years now. In these five years I have worked at the Lindale, Tyler, and Longview locations. Each Store is unique in the culture as it is set by the store manager. Lowe's as a whole is a fantastic company who hires excellent employees. The store's all thrive for success and work as a team to accomplish their goals. All in all if you enjoy a team environment, problem solving, and character development then I would recommend working for Lowe's Home Improvement"
good,"I am still employed with my part time employment, I believe its one of the best paying retail jobs in Indianapolis.  I enjoy working here because it is fast pace, time goes fast, learn a lot about home repairs equipment, outside lawn and garden. Management is okay, scheduling has become a concern since corporate office has taken over instead of  schedules being completed by management team in the store. The hardest part of the job is standing on concrete flooring for long periods of time.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the public."
good,Management is helpful and supportive. Fun environment and not too stressful expect on weekends/summer holidays. I would recommend this job to a friend. They pay was great too.
good,Enjoyed working here more so than any other retailer. Management has a great morale. Moving up in the company is a pain do to the lack of reasonable raises or promotions. Must reapply and compete for higher positions and only get 25-50cent raises yearly in same position. Part timers may get close to no hours all during off seasons and full timers MUST have fully flexible schedules in most cases.
good,"Had a great group of folks to work with. Sometimes received mixed messages from management. For example wanted us to help all customers anywhere in store, but also wanted us to stay in our area?"
good,As a customer service representative i would learn about the store and then help the customers. then i would help the customer find a merchandise if i knew where to find it. I also worked in the garden center pushing carts and  loading merchandise.
good,"A typical day at work was very repetitive and had an ever growing list of side tasks. I learned how to associate myself better with co-workers and customers. I learned how to work with a large amount of equipment.I learned much about time management and safety protocols. Some middle management were lazy, and others were definite go getters. It was a mixed group. The workplace was a friendly environment with many different people, with many interesting attitudes. The hardest part of the job had to be the plumbing stopping up often due to customers flushing plastic packaging. Devastatingly disgusting. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be the sense of accomplishment after getting a large amount done."
good,"Lowe's is a rewarding part time employer. They are flexible with my hours around my primary job. Some of there equipment could be better maintained. Over all, very good job."
good,i liked working here. had a sense of pride since i was hired for a new store and helped put it together before the opening . i would recommend anyone working here
good,The best part about working at Lowe's is the friendships and family you gain.  There have been so many changes in the structure that has caused low moral and the only support is from your coworkers.
good,We unloaded semi trailers everyday and had everything all palletized and sent to the different departments in the store. The Trailers usually ranged from 700-1300 piece count trailers.
good,Très bon environnement de travail - emploie stable
good,Work was seasonal and always started with watering. I learned a lot about house plants. The hardest part was that there weren't enough people to help the customer. I enjoyed the work because I was a gardener. The weather made it hard
good,"Lowes is an enjoyable place to work,  Management for the most part is great and work hard to ensure employees have what they need.  the pay is low, which is to be expected for retail."
good,Enjoy working with other employees who are generally motivated to do a good job of helping customers and their needs.Enjoy helping customers with their electrical questions and problems
good,The company went thru 2 and on a 3rd phase of change so I can only say yet to see what will happen. I do enjoy my job here but I need to keep working for many reasons.
good,Excellent place to work with supportive management team and staff. Many opportunities to grow and learn my field of expertise. Genuine friendliness and customer care.
good,"To assist Customers with directions product information and check out.  To zone area, re-stock and get store ready for next days business.  As a Self check-out cashier.  My duties included to keep machines functioning, assist customers, and  balance main c/o register."
good,Its a good place to work. Good hours if you work and want them. Managers are amazing if you ever need anything. Any questions get answered fairly quick.
good,"It pays well enough and as long as you do your job and follow the attendance, you're going to enjoy your time with Lowe's. The management team is what will make or break an individual Store but overall, the values of the company are respectable."
good,"Lowes is a fun, active work place with opportunity to learn several tasks. No e staff and customers. Excellent customer service not only from lowes but the customers and the vendors as well."
good,"I sold tools, hardware, electrical components, plumbing components, paint and paint supplies and everything else in the store. Lowe's has a hard time with people leaving their department and selling the multiple service solution but if they cared more about customer retention than labor expenses they would be way more successful."
good,"Lowes is a great company to work but it all depends on the location. A typical day at Lowes of Yonkers NY is based off of coverage. As long as there is coverage it will be a fun and easy going day. The enjoyable part is having nice, understandable and respectful customer. That put a smile on my face and give me spirit to do everything I can to help them leave the store with a smile as well."
good,"Very fast paced, often heavy phone traffic."
good,is friendly and the manager will help in need a very busy days especially weekend harder part is that theretime customer have bad moodbut over all friendly
good,"Typical job related hurdles but an overall good environment with many benefits, room for advancement, community resources and educational availability."
good,"Lowe's is a very good company to work for. They provide benefits to full time employees, and they are very flexible when it comes to working around your schedule. The management is very supportive and will almost always have your back when it comes to customer issues."
good,"it was an ok job for a while but they are missing alot of qualities for working happily and joyfully"
good,I was felt they had favorites at the company and everyone wasn't treated fairly. Everyone was not on the same page most of time and communication should of been better. Only thing that was great at the company was the benefits.
good,"Feet stayed wet, uncomfortable.hot in summer cold in fall"
good,"as with all companies. it is who you work with that ""make or breaks"" most companies. However, job advancement is seldom seen within a store. Sales goals are easy to obtain barring any unforeseen act of nature."
good,"Starting is simple, you go through training and have managers throughout the store who are willing to help you most of the time. Dealing with customers usually went smoothly."
good,"The job itself is very enjoyable and there are many career advancement opportunities. In only 2 years, I had been promoted 3 times and was 1 step away from Store Manager. The culture at Lowe's is that if you work hard day in and day out with a smile on your face, taking care of the customers' needs, you will succeed."
good,can be frustrating trying to get a hold of managers at times. sometimes you have to handle difficult customers. other than that the communication between everyone kinda sucks its not too bad
good,A typical work day in Lowe's is rewarding and challenging.  The focus on building the right culture and not just focusing on the direct result creates better leaders.
good,"Fast paced sales position working with customers and contractors to create kitchen and bath remodels. Most frustrating part of the job was working with slow, antiquated technology."
good,A typical day working at Lowe’s was clocking in and immediately getting to work ethier cutting wood for customers that’s need a certain length of wood or helping coworkers and cleaning up the lumber area
good,"•	Participated in Due Process Hearing Requests for the State, reviewed and completed all activities which included working with the Regulatory Department on monthly reporting"
good,Overall Lowe's is a good company to work for.  Typical management issues that are everywhere.  Fast work environment and face to face with customers.  Vacation and sick pay are a plus.  Lack of training for some people and positions.  Overall not a bad place to work.
good,"working for Lowes is a wonderful experiences, you learn a lot on how to provide for the customer and how each product works for a pacific job to fit the customers needs."
good,"Lowe's is an average retail store. It has enough variety throughout the day to keep you interested, and is a good enough place to work. The best thing about Lowe's is the customer service environment. Most associates I work with like their jobs, and everyone being relatively positive is much needed."
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for and I would recommend it to anybody looking for work. They look out for their employees and do everything in there power to help their employees
good,"The department I worked in was most busy during the summer and fall. Management has changed over the years, the ASM's are all a wonderful group of managers."
good,"Very busy in the summer but great coworkers make it better. Can be a little caotic but the mangers are mostly understanding and have your back. They always make you get your two paid 15 minute breaks and your hour for lunch. Always got 40 hours a week, but scheduling was all over the place. Could be moring shift one day then evening the next. They do try to avoid night then morning though."
good,"Enjoyable work place."
good,my time at lowes was very educational the home improvment business was something i was not use to until i started working there. but it can be very difficult working with people who are in demand of specific things.
good,"Project manager:  Meet with customers onsite, Help design the project to their satisfaction,  order materials, schedule deliveries and contractor installation. Work in detail with the customers and their concerns. Be the Liaison between our company, suppliers,contractors and the customer."
good,Management was great with scheduling if you had another job....Comfortable and welcoming to work for the company..It was a great place to work for during the holidays....
good,"Lowe's can be a rewarding ploace to work.  It has great family like atmosphere amongst employees.  A typical day consists of reverse investigations, operational controls, coaching employees in safety, shrink control programs, follow up from previous conversations."
good,A decent place to work... The buddy system seems to come into play a little too much in management! Decent pay and great benefits with 401k... Lots of work expected of you
good,this is a great part time/ seasonal job with great benefits and good pay. i learned that team work is very important as i am great when workimg with others. management was great.
good,I really do not want to go into detail. It was a big box home improvement job. All the bells and whistles plus all the drawbacks. Good people to work with.
good,"The staff is great, I love the team members I work with. But there is a huge struggle on hours. They fluctuate a lot and its rarely what they promise. The possibility of full time is slim to none and the likelihood of moving from part time to full time is even less likely. And management pretty much is at a loss at times as to what they can do. "
good,"teaching, coaching and training was a big part of the Lowe's success.  Balancing the customer service factor with tasks was a huge challenge every day.  Management was not consistent with their instructions and were not considerate of daily customer transaction versus task completion.  Limited labor force was always a challenge. Seeing customers leave with their entire project and a basic understanding of now to complete."
good,If you like working freight all day everyday this place is for you.  The store I was at freight came in everyday and my manager would always leave it for me and the other guy to put away.
good,"When I was a Sales Specialist in window coverings, first thing is to check the computer for any orders or flags that would pop up. Contact anyone that needed a follow-up or needed to be informed of anything in between helping the customers on the floor."
good,"the customers were always friendly and appreciative, coworkers and management were consistently helpful, i very much enjoyed my time working in the garden center at Lowe's"
good,Great place to work good benefits but management can be lacking there tends to be a favoritism and if you work in places like Lumber or the Garden you best ask for a good raise.
good,"Job eliminated - about to be separated. Friendly environment"
good,Lowe’s is a retail job that takes a lot of patience and discipline. You find all types of personalities and situations that you may face. You have to be able to shoot for the goal in the end.
good,The work is a times challenging and fulfilling hard work and comradery Lowe's offers plenty of learning opportunities to train it's emplyees to be the best
good,This was a super short job for me. It was only ever meant to be temporary. I was a little sad to go because I worked with some awesome people. I loved my store and most of my managers were amazing. Except 2. But those 2 don't out do the good. I loved the fact that it kept me busy and I honestly could work at my own pace. Only the bigger stores have an over night shift and that shift is even more peaceful and slower.
good,Positive workplace with potential for advancement and good benefits. Can be a fun place to work with a lot of different personalities and backgrounds. I was able to work in a variety of departments and learn many different skills along the way.
good,"Tough to adapt to the varying times on their ""Matrix"", or work schedule. Schedule bounces from as early as 5am to as late as 11pm. I've been there 10+ years and have been afforded the opportunity to advance as far as I care to. Currently am a service manager and soon to be reclassified as a supervisor. Still hourly and paid a decent wage.  Excellent health care options , eyecare and dental benefits availed tho every employee as well as bonus programs to all. Only get one weekend off every 4 weeks and one Sunday off every 4 weeks.Days off change every week but the pattern of days off repeats every 4 weeks"
good,"typical day on the sales floor is taking care of customers then stocking shelves, nothing too complicated"
good,A great place to work and get a firm understanding of all things loss prevention. They really take in the whole perspective of all things loss prevention related from safety to operational loss.
good,"Can advance quickly.  Can change positions, cross train. Start early end late. Work Holidays. Overtime only when needed. Diverse group of people to work with."
good,"Talk about a fast paced environment."
good,"Over seen Daily Operations Hiring, Scheduling Payroll Over seen the front end, Receiving and Delivery areas. Coached and Mentored new associates. Job was fast passed but was fun to work"
good,"Customer service in the home improvement retail setting, great if you want to try something different or if this is your field. I worked at the competitor and I chose Lowe's over them but chose product selection at the competition."
good,I was a cashier at Lowe's Home Improvement for a year and a half. I was stationed at a register every day and greeted customers as they entered/exited the store. I learned how to quickly count change and how to process various methods of payment. The managers were fine but I did not see them very often. The hardest part of the job would be resolving issues with upsets customer without getting upset myself. The most enjoyable part of the job would be helping customers find items in the store with assistance from the Lowe's app.
good,"Good place to work, some management are problematic but most are great. Some sales associates only care about customers when they are at their desk and then don't care after they leave."
good,I honestly loved all my co workers at Lowe's but I felt I couldn't advance my career any further into this company. Also it is very fast paced especially where I worked we did not have a stock crew and a lot of times you would cover 2 or more departments.
good,Lowes was a part time job to help pay the bills while I was in college. For the most part they worked around my school schedule and gave me enough hours to survive.
good,Company has a new CEO who is working hard to change the culture at Lowe's. He definitely has everyone focused on taking care of customers & distinguishing ourselves from competition with our customer service. New CEO has a 2 year plan to make Lowe's more competitive in the home improvement marketplace.
good,All employees are fun and nice. Great job. Easy to run the cash register and custumers are great to be around.  The customer service is excellent and fast.
good,"This job requires you to be able to help customers with their home improvement questions and projects. I work in Order fulfillment, which covers online and in store pick up orders. The main objective is to process orders and have product staged and ready for customer pick up. I have learned a lot about the products that we provide. I enjoy learning and helping people ""Love Where They Live."" That is the Lowe's motto. Most of the employees are very helpful and make working there enjoyable. One of the biggest obstacles that I've encountered is when an associate is busy and cannot help fulfill the orders since I am stationed in an area that has to be monitored to prevent theft."
good,"I've been working for Lowe's for over a couple years now. I've learned that the best way to get anywhere at the job is to do your job and do it enthusiastically and quick. Remember to stay safe however while being sure to get things done in a timely manner, because sometimes the job may require you to work with or around heavy power equipment or doing taxing physical labor. Customer service positions almost require you to have dabbled with the subject of the store area you're working in; i.e., if you're working in or around the Electrical department, you should be able to answer a customer's question when it comes to electrical issues or wiring. Or, get used to searching around for an Associate that does know."
good,Overall LOWE'S is a good place to work. The company is now under a new CEO and seems to be moving in the right direction which was not the case while I was there. Time goes by fast there as the store I was at saw over 1500 people a day and 2000 on the weekends. The shift schedule can be tough and the 2 days off you get are spread out in a 3 on 2 off. One big downside to LOWE'S was the removal of Department managers which leads to a lack of vertical advancement; but they pay well above the other big box stores which kind of makes up for it.
good,"Working at Lowes was GREAT different every day. Challenging rewarding work if you paid attention you could have fun while you worked, I would be happy to return to Lowes if there were more hours available."
good,Great team to work with.  Some of the managers really cared about their employees success. I really enjoyed working there and learning about merchandise I otherwise might not know.
good,The paid training and working conditions are the same as any warehouse. To put it simple: Do your job and you won't get fired. There are rates that you have to reach in order to keep your job. You have to maintain 100% or better during your probation period which is 75 working days. It really is not that hard reach
good,"People are always smiling when working. Store Manager is amazing, Management cares about their employees. The only thing that I would complain about is the lack of hours."
good,Nice place to learn about the building trade.  Must be a multi tasker and work multiple departments each day. People were friendly and associates were nice.
good,"working in retail is great. To be a full time employee, you must work a flexible schedule, meaning you may be scheduled to work different days of the week and different hours on each of those days. Part-time workers can have a set-schedule, meaning their work schedule stays the same for which they are available to work. but it can be a challenge to find a full-time retail job with set hours. One would have to choose which is better for them I love retail work and would recommend it,"
good,"Lowes has a great workplace environment with some interesting characters that make everyday an interesting time, unfortunately the management is passable at best and can sometimes make your day awful, that and the fact that you're expected to do whatever work needs to be done even if you're not in the same job. (The part timers are expected to know and be able to do the same work as the full timers and Salesmen) can lead to some stressful work days, but luckily they're very forgiving of mistakes and pay decently well."
good,"Depending on what your looking for with respect to careers, the company can be a decent starting point that offers both store and corporate opportunities."
good,There is never a dull moment in this position. Talking with customer and helping them accomplish the Lowe's goal Love where you love is the best . and the worst is the opposite when they don't love where they live.
good,It was a nice place to work with many options for life/work balance. Many options to advance in the company and to different departments.  The other associates were very knowledgable and willing to teach.
good,"the work is fast paced, but doable. I enjoyed the experiences and would still be there had it not been a scheduling issue.a very clean and competitive work space."
good,training in customer service was great benefit to all of us. most jobs are not secure because of sale in a season. hardest part of working there is that they don't offer that many full time positions.
good,Its a good job but can be hectic. Management is good they're getting there. It's faced pass so being on top of things is key. Different roles may be easier or harder.
good,"Hours are set by shifts. Must complete daily stocking and assist customers, sometimes schduled alone on your shift. It was a suffient job for getting back into workforce after being stay-at-home mom"
good,Helping and interacting with the costumers was the best part of the job. Working in four different departments gained so much experience and knowledge i can use at other jobs
good,Work day includes helping customers in store. Developing contracts and selling flooring.  Clean and maintain department.  I enjoy the fast paced environment.  There is no time to get bored.  Lifting the the heavy boxes of flooring can be difficult.  A lot of good people work at Lowe's
good,I loved working here until they changed managers . This by far was the best place that I have ever worked .you are allowed to more around and learn the whole store
good,Lowes was a fun place to work at and they worked well with my school schedule.  Only had problems with them when they switched from department managers to zone managers. That was a cluster.
good,Lowes is a good job..but the work can be hard depending on what you do. Pay is decent but u max out quick and cant progress after max out pay. Work environment changes with the weather.
good,It was a good part-time job with flexible hours. The people were friendly with good attitudes. I enjoyed working in different departments .It was a competitive work environment.
good,"You get out what you put in, all though things have changed and still trying to figure out what direction we are going. Hard workers are not stand outs any more, all focus is on sales, results and customer service. You still have to keep the store looking good. Focus is on having a clean, safe, well stocked store while providing results."
good,the people were great management was pretty good you have pros an cons in every job the training could have been a little better the pay needs to be better there is room for advancement just need to work hard to get it overall its a good company to work for
good,"I was a very dependable and hard working employee, but feel if I would have had proper training, I never would have been let go.  I knew my job and rarely called off."
good,"Pre-opening shifts are challenging but are an opportunity to fine tune your productivity. Employee camaraderie is strong, and managers are reliable and friendly."
good,"A typical day consists of helping customers find where things are in the store, ad answering basic questions.  I've learned a lot about lawn & garden.  I really don't think there is anything hard about working here, other than remembering where some things are.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people find what they are looking for."
good,Enjoyed the customers and coworkers and enjoyed going to work.  There was something different every day.  Learned to deal with customers from all walks of life.
good,Able to advance and move up the ladder. Started as a part time transitional job. But I stayed for 13 years. Advancement possible if you play the good ole boy game..
good,Creo que deben aumentar el sueldo y mas prestaciones y mas capacitaciones al personal de ventas
good,"I would arrive, pick up my tools check in with manager and other employees. After learning what was expected of me that day, I would begin my day."
good,"I love where I work.  I struggle with work/life balance due to the rotating schedule, and staying open until 10pm for far too many months.  I believe they offer many opportunities for advancement."
good,They have great benefits and also give you a discount that is 10% off your total purchase . Just do what your told and you’ll be fine when working at Lowes it is a easy job but like every job has its ups and downs
good,"High energy and fast paced, no 2 days are the same. Great company culture and great benefits like an employee discount and hour long lunch breaks. A rewarding company to work for"
good,"Lowe's is a seasonal store, work load varies from day to day according to managers on duty, the weather and location of store.  Great benefits for part time employees."
good,I really enjoy working at Lowe's. All of my coworkers are really nice and I've learned a lot about all things electrical working in that department. I'm a student and they are really accommodating with my schedule since it changes every semester.
good,"I didn't enjoy my time with Lowe's for one reason and one reason only: hours. The hours were so inconsistent I was unable to plan my life around my work, which is why I left. Other than that, the pay was good and I dug the vest."
good,it wasn't a bad place to work just very poor management. god benefits for you and your family. good life balance plus job as well. really good people to help you learn the job well.
good,It was a great place and i hope will be again.. Recent events have made it not as enjoyable for myself.. Alot of ups and downs recently... I hope everything gets better..
good,"Lowes cared about its employees the missiob statement s were, we are apart of something bigger, be who you say your are,listen intently andcscence and respond  correctly.  Opertunites TO BE PROMOTED IF YOU PUT IN THE WORK.HELPED ME TO UNDERSTANDCBEHAVIORS AND HOW TO CURVE UNPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIORALLY GAVE ME STRUCTURE"
good,"Competitive nature in sales situations. Train to succeed. Immature, cutthroat teamwork from less invested coworkers. Clique rich personnel. Customers will keep your attention."
good,"My day at work would start at 4:00am and would end around 1:00pm, give or take some overnight shifts. I learned how to operate heavy machinery, safety tips, and customer service. In the short time I worked there I had an excellent stock manager, and efficient and friendly coworkers. If I could go back to help out for another summer or even part-time I would do it in a heartbeat."
good,I liked myjob there but it got eliminated   I enjoyed all the people that I got to work with and felt comfortable with all the job resposibilities that I had to perfrom on a daily basis
good,"This was my part-time job, from 6-10 pm started as telephone operator and back up cashier, promoted to cashier ans after 3 years moved to money room to set up 22 cash registers, daily deposits and print reports for Management."
good,"I don't have any thing to say about Lowes, I liked working there. it had its good thing and it had its bad things. Pay wasn't the best. never let you have any over time, and you always had to work weekends."
good,"Love the team, focus on building relationships, customer interactions, training and ability to build your own business. SERVE leadership model is a focus."
good,"Lowes is a great place to work. Love working in various areas of sales, great managers and coworkers. It is fast paced but fun at times so the day passes by quickly."
good,"As an assistant manager it was a difficult job at time but the pay and bonus made it worth while quick advancements for those who wanted to put in the time, I really enjoyed working for Lowes"
good,"Supporting the Sales floor with Receiving, Stocking, and Deliveries.  Put freight away in a timely manner in the morning.  Unload LTL trucks that come in and receive the product in the store system. Make sure Deliveries has the correct product and gets out the door in an efficient manner."
good,"It’s nice working in a place that respects all people. However, poor management is a major reader for high turnover. Low pay and favoritism often outweighs the appreciation for the dedicated employees."
good,Made lots of connections and friends. Store Manager micromanaged to much and seemed to only care about what made him look good. Other wise it was a good work environment.
good,I like working for Lowe’s and need to work to help out finances at home.  Sometimes I am stressed as  since remodel there is no 1 place I can be to work on the computer to get the customers their products to complete their remodels.  Also I now have to pull heavy products and need help.  That doesn’t alwYs happen as others are very busy and can’t help.
good,Ok for college students or retired workers that have no set schedule to follow.  Management is unable to stay on same page.  They hire handicapped workers but standard interviews you have to excel at interview to be picked. Schedule is made for three-four weeks out.
good,Lowe's was a productive workplace. Somedays was slow but mostly it was busy on the weekends and that's when the workplace will be very quick paced.   While working at Lowe's you have to keep in mind that they are very important customers such as contractors and construction workers that always shop their and you have to make sure you make them feel helped and satisfied with their visit at Lowe's.
good,"I was seasonal. My contract ended after six months, but I did enjoy my experiences there. I was given forty hours per week and the position was active but not overexertional"
good,Lowes has been an amazing job that I truly do enjoy other than some managed issues. Its fast paced and you are always doing something or learning something new. There are also so many opportunities inside the store.
good,Some of the jobs I did were great because I wasn't part of a department that continually was under management's thumb. We worked independently. Other jobs were totally micro-managed. Trained several managers but was never given a management opportunity.
good,"it is fun place "
good,I loved working for lowes. there was always potlucks and contests for the employees. management could have been trained better which explains why the cashiers and sales associates don't really know anything either about what they are doing. the customers were always so friendly too.
good,"I help with the set-up before opened to public, was very fun. Management would have meeting and info for new and up incoming events, I always felt like I was part of something bigger, more like a family."
good,"wonderful place to work, I would still be working here if I had not relocated to another city, I was employed with Lowes Food for many years and would return if I had the chance."
good,"Has good days and bad close to home. Rarely have enough staff, but layed back and friendly people to work with. Working public holidays is the biggest down side. But that retail"
good,too shady for me  management sucks at commutating. benefits are great working with customer are great just poor managing skills management need improvement
good,A Nice Company to work for. I've worked for Lowe's for 14 year. This is not a company that I wish to walk a away from. It Has been a great place to work at.
good,Depending on the management of the store it could be a nightmare. But if the management team was good it was a great place to work. Benefits and discounts were good.
good,"I’ve been here for about a year I enjoy working with the people, management is outstanding, the team that I work with is really good to work with "
good,Working with Commercial clients.  Pricing out the job scope and the product needed to complete the job.  Scheduling delivers and pickups for commercial customers
good,"Fairly basic retail experience. Good benefits are available. Company has changed drastically since I left though, full-time employees are rare now. Great while I was there though."
good,"Lowes taught me alot about retail sales and contractors,realtors and home owners who let me work alongside various specialty workers such has electricians,plumbers,carpenters and general contractors"
good,"I left Lowes to further my career in Sales. If my position would have been commission based, they could have paid me more. I really enjoyed the company and my managers."
good,"They taught me how to operate all the different lifts, including a forklift. They showed me how to always be kept busy. They paid decent and gave part time employees health and dental coverage which very few companies do."
good,"I worked with Lowes for 8 years, it helped me get through college and offered me a full time job when i graduated. There is room to move up and they offer many management tiers (lower,middle and upper)."
good,I loved working there just had to leave cause of colon surgery and it limits my abilities but the management is very well and benefits were also very good except for medical for my condition
good,I think that Lowe's can provide some good learning opportunities and advancement for the right person within the right location. My position was only a seasonal position.
good,"I only worked at Lowe's for a few months.  I enjoyed working in the outdoor lawn and garden department.  As a seasonal employee, I wasn't there long enough to enjoy the benefits.  I would work there again if a better opportunity presented itself."
good,"My position was a CSA II so I would typically work the floor and assist customers with questions about products and sales. I really enjoyed being in the paint department because I could help customers mix paint.  "
good,"The store is basically good.  You are always busy in flooring. In the am you put freight away, check your emails, make a list of people you need to call back and follow up with. You need to document on the computer the outcome of your calls. Then you must work on any estimates that come in. Management is always on your case about sales and follow up. They change managers every couple of years. So once you know what the manager wants a new one comes along. You then have to figure out what the new manager wants, Which is always different. The only reason I stayed is  because of some good managers and employees I work with."
good,"Love the outdoors and working with plants. Fast pace which I like not a fan of standing around. Very knowledgeable of plants, have always loved working with them so this job fits in to what I like doing. On the other hand your hours are swing shift hours which is very hard to get use to. The pay is decent but could be more since you bare the elements cold,hot,rainy ect."
good,Lowe's is not for anyone who does not really want to work. It's not a bad job but you will stay busy. It does have excellent benefits that are very reasonably priced.
good,"I have worked for Lowes for going on 7 years, it has its ups and downs just like any job. I love the ppl I work with they make it all worth going to work"
good,Good Enviroment and good customer service ..very likely to rejoin the staff .. managers we nice .. very good place to start a job expericence and enjoyable pay
good,"My job consisted of greeting numerous clients every day, many of them repeat customers, as part of the Front End Customer Service Team. The cashiers' team truly was teamwork in the best sense: caring, supportive, always eager to help with a problem, sincere fondness between team members.  It would be hard to decide which was the most fun: taking care of customers?or working with a smart, friendly, professional team? It's a great place to work!"
good,"The management team work with college classes and working hours.  Work place culture is great, but management many time seen detached during the working hours with assisting in complex customer issues."
good,I like working for Lowes. It a nice place to work if your into the the DIY or houseware items. They appreciate their employees. Pay is decent if you don't mind a little labor.
good,"Lowe's was a place where you can learn a lot. It always nice having your usual customers, but also getting to see plenty of new faces. It is a place to build relationships with customers, but also give great customer service."
good,It is a great environment to work and they pay fairly but the only issue I think would be that they do tend to give they're employees inconsistent hours.
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work. It gives the skills for obtaining great customer service and other day to day challenges. Typical day at work involves following a list of tasks. All levels of management have heir own way of wanting tasks completed,. The hardest part of the job is not being able to make executive decisions."
good,"This was a very fast paced job, which was expected for a seasonal summer job in the garden center.  There was always something to do and the shifts flew by.  Some of the management was wonderful, while other ""managers"" were lacking and you couldn't help but wonder how they got into their position.  I loved working with the plants, since I am a hobby gardener at home.  I hated that Lowe's was a much more wasteful company than I ever would've thought."
good,Lowes offers great benefits for both full time and part time employees. they are very flexible with your schedule and provide a friendly and inviting work environment.
good,It was not a bad place to work when I was there but over time the place has changed so much it is lacking structure. Management at times needs to get out of their way and make the right decisions
good,"I love my job. I would recommend this as a work place for anyone who is willing to learn new things quickly. It is a very competitive work place, but that’s no always a bad thing. We all try to work together as a team, and build great work relationships. Everyone is always helping someone learn something new in this job. Management will help you out with anything you need. They’re a great support system. The hardest part of the job is learning everything as quickly as possible because a lot of people take their time and at Lowe’s you need to learn quickly. The work place culture is very divert. Lowes is one of the highest paying companies as well. They also offer benefits to part time and full time employees. The do a lot for their employees who are willing to work on holidays. They are very pet friendly. A typical day at work is fast pased , quick thinking, and tons of customer care. I’ve learned how to work quickly and very responsibly. I can say that this job is a very great job if you plan on staying permanently."
good,"I worked at my unloader associate almost a year. I am really enjoying work there and yet luck I have a great mangers they are really friendly and courage us finish the truck at least 3 to 4 hours, but only issues is the pay hours they are shetty. The unloader associates should be desires at least $15 to 20 per hour."
good,pull delivery list pull and stage delivers.load items to be delivered cheek list to items loaded sign delivers out remove old appliances and install new appliances
good,"It was a great opportunity to work with the public.  One of the best feeling is to be able to help a person ""Love where they Live"" and be able to help make that happen.  My days where based on making sure that I achieved all that needed to be done and making sure that the store ran in a safe and smooth manner, coaching and training and helping develop the team.  As a manager I felt like working with them gains more respect from your team.   The hardest part of the job was Time Management and ensuring that you where able to get everything you planned was accomplished."
good,This company was a great place to work. They are making some changes to policies and need to inform their employees better but over all it waa a great experience
good,Lowe's is a great entry level customer service job and offers great benefits to their employees. Lowe's also provides a fun way to implement training using company created Nascar themed quizzes and refresher courses to keep employees updated on all company policies.
good,"I learned communication skills, how to please the customer in any mater. Management wasnt  the best on getting back to you when you had a question and not always easy to find. The workplace was steady and i was very open minded on everything around me. The hardest part was being the only cashier at some points and just stressing on if i was giving the customer my most attention because i worked at a fast pace.Working as a team had to be my favorite part , i had the opportunity to work with amazing caring people."
good,Lowes has been a fun place to work.  Great people to work with.  I was hired as a seasonal worker so unfortunately I don't get the hours needed to support the family.
good,"Great place to work and advance in a career , but with only one weekend off a month and rotating schedules the work life balance is tilted more toward work."
good,I love working here it was fun but the only thing I didn't like the way I didn't get to work my full hours during the night shift usually i had to work that shifts because I had school but I was cut-off maybe half an hour or maybe rarely even an hour just because our management wanted to leave early that's the only thing I have a problem with.
good,I really did enjoy working here. The only thing that made me quit was the pay. But it is not bad at all. And the other coworkers are friendly and easy to get along with.
good,"Good job, very satisfied with my time.  Worked with good people.  Enjoyed returning customers and helping people find what they needed.  Appreciate the opportunity."
good,"Lowe's is a fantastic place to work. There are friendly coworkers, the campus is beautiful, lots of work with cross-functional teams, and a fantastic corporate culture. There are plenty of amenities on the campus, including multiple cafes, coffee shops, on site pharmacy and nurse. They really support their employees, there are tons of opportunities for promotions and/or advancements cross-functionally. There are opportunities for flexible schedules and pay is decent. 401k match and stock options are also available."
good,The pay is very good. The management cares. The customers can be over the top from time to time. The benefits are great. Easy to be promoted. Good place to develop your skills.
good,Work alongside with great people. Hours are flexible and management will work with you to accommodate your work life and home life. Overall Lowe's is a great environment to work in and you'll gain great friendships from it.
good,"Lowes has always been good to me. I was able to become a mentor and move up in the company.  I feel like when someone higher up has a disagreement with you, they sometimes come after you in the wrong way.  I've always considered myself an asset to Lowes and worked many long hours if needed to meet the store needs. I hope they will go back to what made Lowes great and number one in retail."
good,"A typical day at Lowe's is busy depending on department and time of day. It can be fairly slow later in the evening, and super busy mid day. Weekends are mostly packed with customers and it can be non stop, but also depends on time of year. Management is pretty great and understanding at the location I'm at. They are all goofy and kind and caring. It's a pretty great  place to work, coworkers are helpful, friendly and have great  personalities. The hardest part of the job to me is the inconsistent schedule and not having any time to spend with my family. Full time has weekend rotations, but as for seasonal and part-time, they are stuck working weekends and not really having a home/work life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job I would have to say is working with the people I am blessed to work with. They are knowledgeable and kind and funny."
good,"Employees only receive 10% discount, and I've worked at places where I've received up to 40% off. Some of the managers are the kind that just point and say ""go do"", which is part of their job, but I'm sure we all can appreciate a manager who works with us at times when we are busy. Otherwise, the co-workers were great, it was a  great environment to work in, and would recommend it to a friend."
good,Lowe's is a low stress environment and perfect if you are a part time student. There is not too many opportunities to advance but the pay is decent as a part time job.
good,"Lowes is a good workplace in retail, can be very physical, and even stressful at times, however good staff and flexible hours depending upon job title."
good,"I'm very thankful to have worked here for my first job. It's just that sometimes the structure is shaky, and compliance to employee need isn't there. It's middle of the pack."
good,"A typical day would be 6-7 meetings.  There is not enough time in the day to be able to get all of your work done and all of your meetings.  Sometimes you may have to answer emails or get some of your work completed at night."
good,"This was a good place to work temporarily. Not a very professional work environment though.  There are many uneducated individuals with big egos who talk down to other employees. As expected, a few carry the majority of the work load in these stores from my experience."
good,"Serious lack of hours for part time.  Promised 25-30 hours and only received 8-16 hours a week. "
good,"I would work flexible hours.  So I worked in the early morning to last at night, when the store closed.  I watered the plants indoor and outside, two to three times a day.  I love gardening, so this job was, right up my alley.  I enjoyed tending to the plants and greeting people who came into the store.  The management was helpful when you needed them.  Most of the people I worked with were helpful and friendly.  The hardest part of this job, was having to load heavy bags into a customer's car."
good,"Flexible work hours along with a good amount of vacations days. The pay was adequate for an entry-level position. My fellow coworkers and store management were very encouraging and helpful during my introduction to the store. Work provided to be sometimes difficult, but helped me with problem-solving and thinking on my feet. The job was very good overall."
good,"Busy, lot of worry from upper management about the wrong things it's very corporate like decisions trickle down from big wigs and make no sense to the average worker"
good,Wish the hours were more consistent and the pay was more coming in. Had a great experience. Most of my counterparts were awesome people. Management really cares about their employees.
good,Was happy to have a job while looking for something more suitable. Management was decent and generally a fun place to work at. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers ( good or bad)
good,"This had been the first night shift job I had ever done, and I had gone into it a bit naively - especially when it comes to stocking heavy appliances. It was a ragtag group of people, but they were ultimately good hearted, and I learned that overnight is a lot harder than I ever expected. Don't make the same mistake I did and assume night-shift jobs are easy to manage just because you're a night owl."
good,"Very relaxed place to work in, able to wear casual clothes to work. Does tend to get busy during the holidays due to sales. But there are plenty of slow periods throughout the day."
good,"It's a pretty good company good benefit health insurance, life insurance 401 k stock purchase plan all around a good company to work for wish I was still there"
good,Start shift by unloading freight trucks then go to sales floor and help assist customers and perform basic sales knowledge to the best of my ability. The hardest part of the job is unloading the boxes and straining physical abilities but the most enjoyable is helping and providing knowledge to the customers.
good,"my job description at lowe's was ordering, stocking, mentoring new associate, and helping customer either finding product or giving the product knowledge on how to do the product"
good,"I worked is several departments such s Outdoor Power Equipment, Plumbing, Electrical and Hardware/Tools. On the other hand the management team need to work as a collective."
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work. I highly recommend it, especially for young folks just out of school who aren't going to college right away. You can move up pretty fast if you are a hard worker and the the money is pretty good."
good,its really hot in the trucks during the summer an cold during the winter. the people are fun to work with i made many friends. its a good environment to be around and the pay depends on how hard you work.
good,A great place to work. Kept me busy. Loved helping customers with creativity. Pressure is on you to make your goals. A fun atmosphere to be in with your co-workers.
good,"Day to day depending on your position and your shift it usually consists of facing shelves, doing any freight that might have come into the store at whatever time of day. As a cashier it's as it sounds, typically making sure you are doing transactions properly and you always have enough money within your drawer."
good,Lowes is a laid back place to work and the employees are helpful if you don't know the answer to something. I worked in the garden department and loved being outside in the sun.
good,relaxed work environment
good,Fun to work straight out of high shool but unless you are middle age don't play on making it anywhere in the company. But the benefits are amazing and the vibe of the whole store is awesome. Pay isn't great
good,"Honestly this place was great to work at, some if the floor managers weren't great but the store manager was great. They have decent benefits if you're eligible for them."
good,"Not a bad expierience. What I found was most of the time my plumbing dept. Was understaffed. Not everyone was a team player not pulling theirwork load. Favoritism advancing and most associates walked on egg shells due to the store manager. I have never seen the turn over until I worked at that particular store. 45 yrs. In the plumbing trade managing many, many men and that was very foreign to me...none the less I always went above and beyond"
good,"Lowe's offers a job where your coworkers know what they are doing and help to make sure you do. Every shift you know what your going to be doing, with little to no surprises."
good,"It was a good job for the summer , would recommend for someone else for work there. All of the staff was friendly and helpful. I personally rarely had problems while working there."
good,In the Pro Services Department in which I was employed no two day are the same.  Generally there is always something to do for those willing to stay busy.  The most difficult part of the job would be not being able to successfully help every customer with their project. While at the same time helping someone figure out how to solve a problem was enjoyable.
good,"i was a part-time cashier. depending on the front end manager, i had sufficient hours and she worked me in around my full-time job. when a new manager took over, even when she had my full schedule of what my hours were, she wouldn't work with me. "
good,"The company has excellent benefits, but my position as part time temporary (Seasonal) did not qualify.  Management was supportive and appreciative of efforts."
good,I enjoyed the pace of the work and the ability to continuously learn from the position and other coworkers. I would say that the only problem was when new procedures where implemented the management was not on the same page and it made it confusing for the staff.
good,Great people to work with. Everyone helps each other out. Hardest part of the job is completing reports and dept. punch lists. The most enjoyable part is solving customers impending dilemmas.
good,"I really enjoyed my time there even tho my  job was seasonal. Had a blast with the people i worked with and assembling items in the back. "
good,"Not a bad place to work. Hard work is rewarded, and so are good ideas. Mandatory breaks are a great time to regroup yourself. Training provided in many areas that help to further your career there"
good,"At least at my store, it is not a bad environment to work at all. It is a corporate culture that is much more laid back than private sector hardware stores."
good,Lowe's is very customer driven and expects great customer service from all of its employees. At times you will have your busy days and slow days but there is always a good crew of people there to help and support job functions and difficult task.
good,The people and customers were great to work with. There was a lot to work on and learn. The store manager was the nicest guy. It was hard to be on feet the whole shift. Working with certain employees made the day go by fast.
good,"I loved working at Lowes. Most of the managers were awesome. Some not so much, however the good usually outweighed the bad. I would definitely work there again. The benefits were great. The discount was good, and overall pace and feel was good everyday.."
good,"Very fast paced environment during seasonal employment.  At my time of employment great hours, coworkers and managers. Very flexible with work schedule."
good,"A typical day at work involved operating power equipment like a forklift, helping customers around the department and store, and making sure everything is stocked for customers to be able to shop."
good,"Productive and fun workplace. Everyday is different, typical day at work starts with your walk to your department, make sure you do your daily 8's, and then prioritize work load base on your daily 8's walk without sacrificing Customer Service as your priority."
good,working with contractors difficult to do job properly due to be under staffed assisting in other areas in the store  typical day at work involved assisting customers in the store over the  phone or email and fax.work place culture was always putting out fires
good,"had a good lunch area, people were friendly, they had good training's, paid vacation, 30-40 a week, they dont like overtime, managers are pretty understanding"
good,Its a good place to work minus the mixed schedule.  The hours worked were not the same each day depending on what position you work in. Friendly staff and customers (depending).
good,"Very understanding with school conflicts"
good,"The position was just offered a few hours a day.  It was an experiment  position and only offered to a few employees. The job was great , just wasnt enough hours to make the bills"
good,"A typical day at Lowe's Company is not always ""your typical day"" at work.  There are always new challenges that you face when working in retail environment and how you manage them will determine whether you are successful or not.  Lowe's has given me that ability to root cause opportunities and then showed me how to put best practices in place in order to eliminate those hurdles.  With all that being said, I have learned a lot over the course of my 14 year career with Lowe's Companies.  Through all the different levels of management that I have accomplished within the company, I have been able to build a successful pro services business that has allowed me to be at the top of my market as well as top 5 in my region."
good,"The culture at Lowe's is ever-changing.  If you do not like it, just wait 2 weeks and it will change.  The people are great, there is a camaraderie, and the pay is fair."
good,"The hardest part of the job is the corporate rotation for scheduling, does not work out well for employees with small children or young families. Most enjoyable part of the job is the customer base."
good,"While I didn't have a problem with the work, there seemed to be several employees who did and complained a lot about it.  It made it difficult to complete some tasks and several times getting the training needed to complete those tasks."
good,"Worked at two different locations. Mansfield, Pa location was amazing. Had the most amazing coworkers and managers. Augusta, ME location had terrible management and coworkers didn't work well together."
good,"Lot to learn from if you want to succeed, many opportunities of growing, job security, cross trainig."
good,I have worked at Lowe's for 2 and a half years. It has been a great place to work with good in store management and compensation for part time employees like myself. I have no regrets about working for this company.
good,Other employees made the workplace fun. They make you feel at home and help out when stressful situations occur. Management doesnt communicate but other than that I love lowes
good,Good people to work with. Not what I want to do with my career and no job is perfect but I have very few complaints. The managers seem invested in your success.
good,Good place to work at employees are so nice and friendly they make you feel like family. Management is very helpful if you ever have any questions they are always willing to help
good,"Just OK"
good,"Lowes has been a great place to work for me, but it just doesnt pay me what I am looking for. There is also no pay raises that I have received since being there for 7 months."
good,"The company was a great company. It was a contract position, so i had to work part time. I was in the outside lawn and garden department. I still talk about the times I used to work there."
good,"As with any retail company, customer service is number one, but it can also be those same valued customers that make the day hard. I have never met a nicer group of coworkers, ad they are one of the main reasons I stay at my current position. There is lots of opportunities to move departments and advance. Some policies and procedures need to e uniform as to get everyone on the same page."
good,The company does a decent job of incorporating the workforce in the daily business of the store -letting people know how things are going- mostly optimistically
good,"Fantastic Manager there. The most difficult thing there was dealing with thieves and difficult customers. But, the majority of customers were decent and agreeable. Retail requires a different energy than I was used to; perhaps akin to the energy required for teaching preschoolers."
good,"Lowes was an awesome job to have. they really worked with you. The over time can be horrid at times, and unfair. The money wasn't amazing, but it was doable."
good,the place is great place to start the only thing is that management can be very annoying at times. nothing is really organized in the store theirs constantly no coverage at any times which forces you to cover multiple departments and can be become very stressful. but in overall it was a good experience.
good,"I learned some cool stuff working at Lowes. I could have used more hands on training, but I figured things out and asked for help from other employees.  The work can be stressful at times but compensation is good."
good,"Typical duties include helping customers find merchandise and come up with solutions to their home improvement projects."
good,"LOWES was a great place to work,  liked working with the customers,  and other associates. Management was great in the beginning, they let you know that they had your back. "
good,The store and the management at this store was very supportive while I was there.  If management changes the support can change.  Therefore you never know what you are going to get.
good,pretty a standard retail job  all positives and negatives included.  Some individuals over zealous no home-life type that you have to watch out for.  typical retail job with environment included
good,An overall good place to work.  There can be a lack of communication at times with management.  Coworkers are what make the atmosphere wonderful for customers and fellow employees.
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowes and the co-workers were awesome and so friendly. I also enjoyed helping the customers in anyway possible for them to have a nice experience during their shopping experience with us. I would assist them in helping them find whatever it was they were looking for and explaining to them any questions they may have had about a certain item, help them order what they wanted, etc."
good,"My experience is that mostly everyone in the lumber department where I worked, had some type of pre-existing relationship in some sort of fashion. This seemed to inhibit newcomers from advancing past the ""clique"" that had formed."
good,"People are great, management changes every 2 years or so.  Pretty straight forward job descriptions and opportunity for job advancement.  I enjoy the people and the employees."
good,I unloaded trucks in the morning and stocked the shelves with a good group of individuals. It was a fast paced job and everyone worked extremely well together.
good,Great Management and very friendly customers. Always exciting to help people with their DYI projects. Hardest part of the job is working 6 or 7 days in a row before your next day off. You do get rotating weekends off so that is nice.
good,"Part-time would be great for college student or retired individual, while full-time makes for an excellent career with great benefits. CSAs have better job opportunities through Lowe’s after a specified amount of time with the company, but few ways to move up otherwise."
good,Great place to work very busy. Work all shifts day and night . If you want to exercise this is the place you do your share of walking depending on the job you do. Co-workers are great to and if you want to advance you can. Crew management are great too people you can talk to if you ever need help in any aspect of your job environment...
good,"Lowe's is a challenging and rewarding company to work for. Everyday presents a new challenge that requires teamwork and resourcefulness to solve. Everything from the large management team to the employee appreciation activities is geared at creating a family environment in the workplace. A typical day consists working with customers one-on-one to put together projects. The entire store functions as one big team to take each customer from the brainstorming stage of a project to installation and completion. The only challenges of working in such a supportive team centered environment are managing to simultaneously keep up with the timed orders, while assisting multiple customers at once, and having to frequently check quotas."
good,Pay was good. Hours was way to long. Not a good work life balance. Hard to get into store management program.!!Leading the team was great experience for. Helping customer was the best part of the job for me. Plus you you get to learn from them as well.
good,"Great environment, lots of potential for success, you get out of it what you put in, it is a competitive environment for promotions etc., however they are available if you work hard"
good,Lowes can be a laid back place to work sometimes but majority of the time you will always be helping a customer or working your department. If you ever have a problem management will come help and teach you what you need to know.
good,"I absolutely love working at lowers, but it does not have the benefits or pay i need to solely support myself or my partner currently. My co-workers are wonderful, the managers are so friendly, and the environment is super safe and everyone is courteous. I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a job! I love helping customers, and i love being trained and certified on power equipment."
good,I liked working here.The days went by quick because the customers always kept us busy. I spent most of my time stocking and finding products for customer.
good,Lowes Home improvement is a great place to work and has many opportunities to interact and learn about customers while helping them find what they are looking for. The work environment is great and it is easy to get along and communicate with my managers.
good,This job is good for college students and people whose are close to retirement. If you are a young or experienced  energetic person who know how to sale this job is great for you. The pay is ok it depends on your job title or position. During the  interview they grade you based on your experience you encounter in life pertaining to the job.
good,"Many opportunities to get your foot in the door as a seasonal employ, then if you shine and work hard, they will keep you on.  Continue to look for opportunities to move up."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Lowes. You get what you put into the position. You have employees that will drag you down with their miserable retail attitudes. If you choose not to listen, you will really enjoy your time at Lowes. I enjoyed my co workers and putting the effort into making my work enjoyable and productive."
good,Fun work place. Can get very busy and stressful during spring and summer months. They are very good at working with your schedule if you need to switch a time or something comes up
good,Loving environment . Family orientated .safe and they treat their costumer with a lot of love . And Most Of they have each other’s back and that why I would recommend people to work at lowes
good,Good place to work . great if you enjoy customers and like working with people .  good chance at future advancement and mobility.  good benefits as well.
good,It's a nice place to work and easy to move up.The hours arent that bad and it is not hard to get the days you need off off if you request them in a timely manner.
good,I was given long lunches even on short shifts. The management were good people to work for and usually understood if something came up and were flexible with hours.
good,I have been with lowes almost nine years and have been around several stores and thousands of managers and staff. This location is the best I could have ever been a part of. They are so supportive of each other. I will miss them.
good,Working at lower is whatever you make it out to be. If you have a bad attitude and slowly do your jobs you need to take care of that day then it makes for a long day. If you do what your suppose to and help customers on a side then it will go by fast.
good,My overall review of lowes is its a good place to work if you stay doing what you're supposed to you. Shouldn't have very many many problems It was pretty cool.
good,With any job you'll have your good and bad experiences. Generally at both of the locations that I've worked for everyone got along and it felt like the people you were working for actually cared for you. I had a coworker pick up my shift so I could study for finals. Those are the type of people you work for.
good,Lowe's store #2400 is an easy going workplace with few busy days and a fair amount of lulls in business. Management generally works well with the lower leveled staff of the store to provide adequate scheduling. Paid breaks provided. Great benefits. Easy work.
good,"Overall Lowes was a great working experience. The most enjoyable part of my job were the customers. Lowes has great programs to assist its employees with furthering their education, which I took full advantage of. I would recommend Lowes to anyone."
good,"Followed corporate planograms and world class merchandising standards "
good,"I was a return desk associate, but I on occasion was a back up cashier. At night we had to re-stock items. I had to gather carts from outside. If the department was not buy you would be sent other areas that needed help."
good,"It was a great place to work. I left because I found it difficult to get a position at a store closer to my home.  The management were great and everyone worked as a team."
good,"Productive and fun workplace"
good,"amazing place of work, team members are very fun and friendly, easy to get used to and no reason to be ashamed of who you are. Managers are nice but no way of going up the ladder of command."
good,"Great working environment and team, but company is greedy in the sense of compensation and hours available for employees which inhibits good workers.."
good,"Team work and goal setting, fun place to work if you do your job to the bet of your abilities. However,  management team does not work together. It has become a ""it's not my job"" mentality."
good,"Been good to me for 12 years. Not as much room to grow with them eliminating several positions and departments. I recommended to people who don't mind a retail schedule, but at this point in my life I would rather have holidays off with my family and not have to worry about not being there for the holidays because of my work schedule."
good,"On a typical day at Lowe's, I would work has a cashier to customer service and sometimes fill in for Head cashier. I also helped out in the paint department. I loved working with the people at Lowe's. The hardest part of my job is dealing with rude customers. I have worked in the customer service for most of my life that I am able to handle these types of problems."
good,Enjoyed my time working at Lowe's. have great relationship with management and Associates. I look forward in going to work daily and  serve  the customer with exceptional service.
good,"Be ready for a fast passed environment. The management team seems to like micro managing, meaning watching over every little thing you do, but only certain people. Only friends of management seem to be the promoted or protected ones."
good,"Compared to other retail companies, Lowes is a decent company to work for. Lowes offers career advancement and many benefits that other companies do not offer"
good,"I am grateful to be employed. This job has giving me something to do since September 2012. It is a retail environment, and if you like helping people love where they live, then this job is for you."
good,"Worked in the lumber department, and was continually busy trying to keep items stocked, loading drywall or concrete, help customers find products, as well as work on a list the department manager would write up."
good,"Difficult hourly scheduling, 05:00 - 23:00 open. Clean and friendly working conditions.  Good training for product knowledge.  Would definitely consider returning to work for this company."
good,I didn't have too many problems working for Lowes. I received annual raises that were better than most companies in this area. I got paid better than most jobs also
good,"It's cool thanks. Good place. I don't feel like writing about them, why are y'all making me do this. I am trying to move on. I made a mistake when I left."
good,Management is good and indoor and outdoor work is a must. they have values and a commitment. customer service is a must everyday and the job strives from this
good,"I've been working for Lowe's since August 2017 and I've come to learn that working there has ups and downs. Ups in the terms that the people are nice to work with and your always on your toes due to the ever changing situations (You will never get bored). However, it also has its downs in the fact that if you work part time, your hours slowly slip away once December and January roll in which means less money in your wallet. It's also very hard to advance your career. I know I have tried at least six times to get a full time position at Lowe's only to be rejected."
good,Lowes is an okay job and a okay place to work. Corporate was too much involved. The cut backs for certain departments hurt. The pay could have been higher.
good,"The pay compared to other companies like Home Depot, was absolutely higher. Good customer focused company, however noticed a pretty big employee turnover for manager during my working time there. This lead to some inconsistencies and negatives. Other than that pretty simple job for the pay."
good,It was appliance delivery and setup.  I enjoyed my routes and was given the freedom of planning them out.  I had a great helper and we were considered the best team.
good,"On a typical day of work I would clock in and start my ""to do"" list. I would rush through what I needed to do so that I can make my department look nicer and help out other coworkers. The workers were outstanding and were entertaing to be around and I didn't mind going a few extra steps to help them. Management was fair and always had an agenda, but they would take time out of their day to attend to specific departments or customers. The hardest part of the job was constant people, both fellow employees and customers, asking favors and directions while I was still working on my ""to do"" list. However, the most enjoyable part was associating with the same customers and coworkers that were kind and had a outstanding personality."
good,"The changes corporate is bringing is all for the stockholders and the top 5% of upper management.  The changes are hard on the floor employees, they have a ""work harder for less"" mentality now."
good,"The three years on overnights were the best. It was a challenge to turn around a department and have it ready to open the next morning for business.The majority of the work was forklift and it was common to spend several hours in the "" bullpen "" organizing it after the store opened each day. The year or so on days in receiving were good because of knowledge acquired."
good,I really enjoy working for Lowe's. I have had no major problems with working here they are very accommodating to my family and school needs. They pay very well for what it is that you are doing whether it is working the floor or being a driver they take care of you.
good,the store i work at was a training store and always had a new store manager who always know best and would treat people poorly. this caused all of the exp. people to leave the company.
good,"Lowes is a decent place to work but advancement can be hard. A typical day consists of register operation and providing assistance to customers. "
good,Excellent culture to work within. The safety culture in the store is always improving. Great opportunities to coach and manage staff. Enjoy learning challenges that come with the position
good,"You are always busy from the time that you clock in until you clock out. There is no standing around talking to others. It is an overall great place to work. Just like any job, it has it's little issues."
good,"Come to work to work, they will let you know if your not working fast enough,or safe enough. Ask questions if you are unsure, they will gladly show you what they need you to do.There is no such thing as a typical day, the hardest part of the job is not to get complacent."
good,"In the beginning, working at Lowe's was a fun and productive place to work.  Over the past year, however, they started moving the management team around to different departments and it started to take it's toll on production.  Leadership began to decline, and overall moral soon followed.  I loved my position and what I did, but overall store performance was in decline when I left."
good,"Hours scheduled were extremely varied and inconsistent, which made life hard to financially budget accordingly...When a full-time position became available, I was not considered, which was a great disappointment due to the face that this was the main reason I chose to apply for a position with Lowe's."
good,It's typical of today's retail environment.  Duties are normal for retail and hours can be fixed and controlled if necessary.  They also offer more flexibLe options too.
good,"Seven days a week including weekends. The benefits for full time workers are reasonable , however, the salaries are low."
good,"Its a good place to work for the time being while looking for something more permanent, had good coworkers, the management was good. its a job that keeps you busy"
good,"My direct supervisor was good to work for. If one shows up and does their job, no hassles were given. Sometimes prizes were given out for accomplishing required tasks. Easy work, was not rocket science."
good,"Productive, positive, engaged with an enjoyable working relationship.  Partner closely with customers, employees, and co-workers to address issues, concerns, and collectively working together for the betterment of the store to create a positive shopping experience and work environment."
good,"Typical night starts off slow, then proceeds to take off. very good people, learned different tasks such as what is needed to be done in order to maintain the store. Overall a very well rounded job, would recommend."
good,"Most of the time the management is great. Things changed my opinion as of late, when lack of communication caused an employee to be injured and no co workers stepped up to check on the injured employee and the manager continued to yell unprofessionally at the injured employee. No Respect."
good,While the crew and night manager were an amazing group of people some of the day time associates made the job much more difficult then need me. Most of the time we were under staffed as a crew and given even more work load on top of that. which was previously the responsibility of the day shift. The upper management never seemed pleased with the progress that was made and just attempted to undermine our work when opportunity arose. Over all the job is not horrible however it can be made much more difficult than need be.
good,"Good place to work and fine tune your ER background.  Very High multi task position with a multitude of processes and good experience in HR, benefits, payroll, and ER."
good,Pulled ordered to be shipped to store. Picked up heavy item every day very physical hard work   Management sometimes showed favoritism.  Started training on the hardest most physical job in the department. Bonus rate not always fair
good,"Lowe's is good place to learn different skills. I started as a ""Weekend Associate"" and left as an associate in ""Tool World"". We all tried to enjoy our time together on and off the clock."
good,"Start work at 7am till when we got appliance delivered. You meet all types of people. Some management was good, some were lazy. The hardest part of job was dealing with bad management. The best was meeting all kinds of different people."
good,"I pull freight to the floor and stock shelves, drive an order picker, use an LTR gun to scan for inventory replenishment. Everyone I work with is alright, my boss is pretty awesome though, I could stand to make more money however, i dont get paid nearly enough for working the overnight shift and the amount of stuff i do, im way overqualified for this job."
good,"I was an up and coming dept manager working towards promotion when suddenly in Jan it was announced that all dept manager positions were being eliminated.  Those of that wanted to were eligible to apply for a newly created service manger position.  Basically we were given more dept to run and given the same power and access an Assistant Store Manager would have  but did not receive any more money.  In addition, the roles were not clarified and we were going into the busy time of year for home improvement, March through August.  Our store is high volume so as you can imagine it was one chaotic mess.  Management turnover has been over 60%.  Hard to learn your job functions with rotating managers let alone work at getting promoted.  I will miss my co-workers but its time to move on."
good,A typical work day is long and busy with helping customers love where they live. I learn something new everyday that helps my experience. The management is great besides for a very who are a little lazy and arent helpful. They stay to the culture that was left behind by the founder. There is not a real hard part about the job except making the customers happy when they leave but the most enjoyable part of day is when i can make a customer who had horrible service on the floor have a better day when they leave the store.
good,I unloaded trucks in a timely manner at nights for the night stickers to stock it before morning. We would unload the trucks and place the parts or whatever it was onto pallets so the noght stickers could come get them to place them in there correct department.
good,"My short time at Lowes was during their Summer seasonal hire. The environment and Customer base were pleasant and co-workers were kind and welcoming. Management was understanding and flexible. Pay was exceptional. As a cashier, I was placed in the front end of the store, the Lumber Department, and the Lawn and Garden sections. During hotter days, fans were provided, and heaters were available on the chillier days. Overall I enjoyed working there. I only wish they had kept me. At the end of the season they dropped me and told me I was welcome to come back next season."
good,Fun place to work. Good management. Rewards are given for continued customer service. Support and training are always available. Open door policy is there.
good,"Benefits are ok, work/life balance is good, and onsite cafeteria is nice. Lowe's is moving in the right direction with its business model and products, but still has a way to go on the work culture side of things. Its definitely not a bad place to work and the dress-code is lax, but many departments still manage ""butts in seats"" and not the work being done. This is not the case throughout the company and heavily depends on your manager."
good,"Sales service position is customer focused. You need to know about your dept. and what you sell. Helping people needs to be your focus.Must be use to retail hours and week ends. appears to be a good company, steady sales and bonus opportunity ."
good,"Awsome place to work, associate do their best to service the plubic. Everyone helps each other to complete their tasks. Every day is something different."
good,"Public retail not open to change, inivation when they say they are.  Several projects were done over from lack of communication from the next person up the ladder wasting time and payroll."
good,"A typical day in customer service is quite busy. However, you are likely to get two breaks if you work more than five hours. They normally show great appreciation to the employees"
good,Lowes is a great family working environment. Part time positions and even cut more around the holidays. Lowes is alos fun to work at kid workshops on saturdays great luncheons for staying safe
good,Started as a dishwasher and enjoyed it. Advanced rather quickly skiing what I love cooking. The pay was great. If I didn't have to move I would proudly still be there.
good,"Lowe's is a nice place. It has it's  good and it bad as all do. The worst thing I have had to deal with is customers that lie a lot just to get a discount or to not look bad. But this, I guess, is just part of retail."
good,I was a part-time employee and all the managers i had were really understanding with my school schedule. They were really understanding on days that daycare wouldnt watch my son because he was sick and i had him until his mother got off and i came in late.
good,"I loved working for Lowe's as a seasonal employee.  It was when I tried to get hired on full time that the store took a hit in my book.  They want to keep good employees but won't provide an ""in"" to do so.  I had a decent work schedule and they really worked with you if you have another job or school or need a day off for personal reasons like a doctor appointment.  They are very understaffed though and that resulted in a lot of stress that wasn't needed.  Over all I loved working here and wish I could have stayed longer but as my seasonal time ended I needed to find another job."
good,If you don't mind working long hours under management that is chosen based on the favorites system then Lowe's is the place for you. It's unfortunate that management looks to push their responsibilities off on their employees and then looks for solutions to form.
good,"Lowes is a fun, medium paced job. You meet tons of new people everyday. They pay well, but that's because the hours you are scheduled are VERY inconsistent one week you work 12 hours the next u work 25 hours. Your pay checks are never consistent."
good,I started as a seasonal temporary employee and wish that there had been a chance for full time employment.  This is a good company with good benefits and I enjoyed my time there.
good,Its definitely not a bad place to start or even if you're looking into long-term. work well enough and i'm sure the recognition will follow no matter which department it may be.
good,"Lowe's was a good place to work.  Could have been better, but staffing was always an issue.  Never seemed to be enough staff.  Schedules were fixed, but they are retail hours.  You work nights, weekends, and some holidays."
good,"able to train"
good,Learned many new things switching departments etc. Management was fair and pay was decent. Hours varied especially if you were close to 40 hours they did not want to pay overtime
good,Lowe's is a decent place to work. It is a reasonably relaxed environment where you get to work at a good pace in a stress-free atmosphere. I loved working here.
good,"It's an easy-going job.  I like the people I work with, and they're very eager to help.  I learn a lot about the products and helping the customers. It's also good for your health since you're on your feet walking 99% of the time."
good,"Paid vacation"
good,The most difficult part of my job is trying to get those who do not know what my team does to understand what they do  and why it is important to the stores sales.
good,"It is a busy day with many different aspects to it from customers and helping them, keeping the store ready for customers at all times, to "
good,"12 hour shifts, responsible for 19 departments overall, 150 employees on the payroll (per store) fast paced, a family company. Good benefits offered, community involvement."
good,It is a good job because of pay and most of the coworkers are relaxed but management is a bit razzled most of the time and scheduling can be a hastle.
good,Lowe's is a good company to work for with good pay and benefits for full-time and part-time not many jobs offer that to part-timers. Good environment.
good,"Lowes is a good place to work, just doesn't pay enough for the workload that is placed on you.  At times it gets too busy that you cant learn other departments or the store needs to do more cross training with their employee if they want a more productive staff"
good,Lowes is a good company to work for.  They have great benefits and great starting pay.  Lowe's is a very customer oriented store. Lowe's also has a lot of volunteer opportunities.
good,"I  was a manager  in the paint in home decor. I managed managed 8  "
good,"I had a positive experience working for Lowes.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and the atmosphere.  There are a lot of repeat customers whom I have gotten to know personally.  Overall, a great workplace."
good,Theres a lot of drama and the company seems to be going downhill. The company gives great benefits and the flexible hours are good with your personal life.
good,"being a larger company, was a very versatile workplace, always busy with something, never boring.  Management for the most part will"
good,"I really enjoyed my position and training new employees at Lowe's. Lowe's has done some major changes corporate wide and many of us were going to loose our position and we would have to apply for an open position and start over at a grade pay. I decided it was time to leave there. I didn't want to move back words, only advancing forward."
good,working for lowes was a ok job. i worked in delivery so it was a bit more stressful then in the store. The managers at the store were pretty good and always would help
good,"The typical day is always customer service. When not servicing customers, employees are front facing products or stocking shelves."
good,Lowes is overall a great company. The employees are hardworking. If the majority of management displays servant leadership then you will have an enjoyable experience.
good,"Assist customers with home improvement needs. Stocking shelves and resetting product as seasons change. Pricing product. Retrieve product for customers while observing all safety precautions set by company."
good,"a normal day for me was helping in any area I could, sometimes covering 2 departments at a time. learned a bit about everything.as far as advancement their idea was putting you somewhere to cover a gap in staffing , then if it wasn't a good fit for you it was hard to get out of that situation"
good,It would be to long. I appreciate the opportunity however. To summarize though it was just a job to pay the bills until i could get something better. out five stars i will give it a 3 and a half a four on a good day.
good,"The fun part of the job is helping customers find a solution to fix or repair something they are trying to improve or repair.  For example, a customer who is trying to mount a TV to the wall but has lost the screws and has no idea how to mount the TV to the wall and/or the TV to the bracket.  Another example is trying to help a physics student in high school find the parts necessary to build a mouse trap car for not much money."
good,Worked there 10 years and hopefully 10 more.  Worked at 3 different stores and met a lot of great people. Great sales culture and very knowledgeable staff.
good,"A typical day at the store is one of taking care of customers, and seeing that their needs are met urgently and courteously. The workplace culture can sometimes be dusty and dirty.  For a female worker,  the hardest part of the job can be lifting or pushing around items that are heavy.  The most enjoyable part of the job is in fact the customers.  Some of them can be quite delightful."
good,"The company is great to work for. You feel valued as an employee, but sometimes the chance for advancement is slim. The benefits are great, and your pay equals what you do."
good,"J'ai travaillé Chez Rona, ce fût pénible avec mon équipe, je ne me suis jamais senti aussi mal ailleurs, pourtant, quand je regarde les autres équipes je les envie... Personnellement je n'ai pas eu beaucoup de reconnaissance de mon travail, Et Je suis un peu blasé. Je n'aimerais plus revivre cela ailleurs. Je suis quelqu'un qui sait garder son stress, qui aime travailler, qui aime vivre en communauté, mais on me fait passer pour ce que je ne suis pas. C'est insupportable! Je ne généralise pas toute l'entreprise, au contraire, mais j'en veux beaucoup à la manque de gestion de mon supérieur de son équipe."
good,"Lowes is a great company to work for, if you have to work for a retail chain. Location I was at had good managers, good employees, and decent HR people. They do not hire enough people, so don't expect your shift to ever get cut early, and don't expect to be bored much."
good,Working in the store as a cashier was so much fun. I enjoyed all the employees and the customers. Working as a CDO Operator was very stressful and will never get that line of work again.
good,I worked in outside garden. I like my position. though the 5am shift didn't work for my family and lifestyle. I'd prefer a mid shift. like 11am-7pm. I likes working with the plants and merchandising and working as customer service associate.
good,"Physical work, gets you out of the store. Work until you are finished, unlike rest of employees, who are fairly restricted on hours (39). Had many 50+ hour weeks."
good,Great Company to work for.  I never thought I would leave.  The people and the company purpose truly made the difference for me as a leader.  A company that seeks to never stop improving.
good,the hours were long and packing the trucks was hard work but rewarding.  getting to work in the distribution center gave another perspective on how the internal aspect of lowes operated.
good,"Great place to work and learn new skills. Great way to work on customer service skills, computer skills, and product knowledge. Good community between co-workers."
good,The hardest part about working in Lowe's is helping the customers find what they need. What i learned to help alleviate that issue is try and learn the layout and general placement of products in each department to at least point the customer with you in the right direction. Be good at bouncing around your department to help all customer you can while straightening and stocking your department.
good,"I enjoyed working for Lows, nice atmosphere, good place to meet new people and learn new things. I recommend this job if you like meeting new people. I learned a lot about customer service."
good,"Lowe's was fast paced. They placed me everywhere in the different departments. I was sent out on delivery to help appliances deliver and set up washers, dryers and other appliances. In building materials I off loaded company trucks which included huge bunks of lumber. Also delivered product from those trucks to the proper departments. Worked with Commercial Sales Reps to help assist all of out Lowes contractors."
good,I really wish I got more then a seasonal job at lowes! The hours & pay were great! I would definitely apply for a full time job if I could again!  So laid back too!
good,Good place to work. Flexible schedule and hands on training. I would have stayed but i knew it was seasonal. Management told me to be positive and check online for open positions.
good,Day starts off fast with no slow down.  Constantly moving and juggling multiple projects at one time. You meet many different people with different backgrounds. Learned a lot from fellow associates.
good,Lowes is a fantastic place to work. Ive been there for 13 years and i still enjoy every second of my job. We have excellent coaches and higher ups which in my case is unfortunate seeing as how I'm in a management in training role. A little bitter sweet.
good,It was a stressful job because the customer would come in angry and since I worked at customer service I would get all of it. The people working there are nice and teamwork is a must at that place.
good,Nice place to work... Fun and friends... Their forklift and reach truck is slow moving and annoying. The internal corporate was sleazy. othere than that nice place.
good,Honestly enjoyed the atmosphere of this work place.  Superiors will listen to complaints and amend the their best abilities.  Offer much training and multiple advancement opportunities.
good,"Great place to work, just wanted to get a regular work hour job. I always enjoyed the people I worked with and most of the management was always helpful."
good,"Excellent place to shop, both management & floor workers have the customer 1 st ! You can learn a lot when you figure out where to go to find it. Mgmt. is more concerned policy than production"
good,My time at Lowes was enjoyable but at the same time a little too slow for me. I like to engage in employee interest and growing a little more. I left Lowes to join the military.
good,"Good place to work, I like it here. I am paid well and live 4 km from the store. Training is very good and compensation is fair. Don't know about the benefits yet. Will know next month"
good,basicly help customers find tools or right products to help fix there homes orprojects that they are tring to finish lean to stock selves while taking inventory
good,Good company in retail industry. Company offers good benefits and stock options for employees. Room for advancement and related training to do so. With a diversified work environment.
good,"When I got hired on the job, I started off as a Head Cashier (which was a front end manager and oversaw cashiers, money till, and balancing a steady work environment). Through time I became a full time customer service associate that over saw returns, customer orders, management and balancing a happy customer service. "
good,"I have worked at Lowe's for 14 years.  I started as a sales associate and worked my way up to Electrical Department Manager within the first 3 years.   The workplace is team-oriented and I enjoyed being a leader.  I learned a great deal, from retail experiences and customer service to managing employees daily.  I concentrated on developing a rapport with my customers and contractors.  I enjoyed the challenge of developing orders and making sure they were always completed in a timely manner.  Probably the most difficult part of my job was balancing daily chores and customer needs, but I was determined to succeed.  My biggest regret is not having the opportunity to advance due to changes in leadership structure."
good,Lowes is a good company to work for pays well and has good benefits.  Just the scheduled hours are awful.  Never a steady flow of hours.  Sometimes your working a lot of nights to close.  Rarely a weekend off or daytime hours.  Seems some employees don't have to work nights and have a steady set of schedule time.  Others hours fluctuate weekly.  Makes it hard especially for me to stick to my diabetic schedule.
good,"Daily job tasks , easy going management , paid 30 minutes of break time . forklift training for most employees , bi-quarterly pay raises , great cafe in lunch room"
good,high paced environment with good clients. Great co-workers who helped get all product selection down and their part estimated so I could put final proposal together  and make presentations to clients and work through all issues and get to completion of overall project and sale
good,Working with customers providing them with a different kind of experience. In doing so I customers would contact store management to thank me for the service I provided to them
good,A lot of uncertainty with job positions eliminated every few years.  That cut into room for advancement.  Your abilities and skill develop would depend not your supervisors.
good,"Working with Lowe's gave me invaluable experience with product knowledge, customer service and how to work seamlessly with other companies, organizations and other departments. More so than anywhere else I have worked there was great insurance benefits as well as assistance for schooling, childcare and even help to quit using tobacco! I believe they do amazing things for the community as a company."
good,Started as a seasonal worker and if you show that you are a good worker they will hire you full time. I went from unloader/stocker to delivery driver in 6 months.
good,"good place for a first job or a creer good people  co workers and mangemnet, as long as you show up on time and do your job, pay is decent and have decent healt insurance get to help customers in many way that you dont think of untill you help them and they come back in at the end of what they was working and justhe smile and thank you is worth it"
good,good place to work pay could be better benifits are good management not to bad work diferent days and nights each week good people to work with and job is always there
good,"Typical day at work: "
good,"Lowes don't care about their employees,  especially the staff.   Lowes has good benefits, that is the only good thing about working for lowes..  Pay is decent but the way employees are treated is not worth it.   You have to take alot from customers and mgrs don't support staff.."
good,There are some good people to work with but the pay is not all that for some of the jobs you are asked to do. Plenty of hours with low pay. Benefits are a little high as well
good,"Was a decent place to work. Friendly co workers and learned a lot. Can be hectic and stressful at times, but all in all no big complaints. Superiors worked around my schedule and that was the biggest plus."
good,"worked for the company for 13 years and would have continued but lowe""s got rid of my position and only gave me 2 weeks notice so I am finishing out my time till the end"
good,This is a good company to work for I'd you're a people person and can continuously push and drive sales while smiling doing it. I just did not have the personality type to be that pushy with people. I always liked to be left alone while shopping in stores and never could forget how I like to shop
good,All around alright place to work. Pay is good which helps the rating. Management can be iffy when it comes to either knowledge or if they're willing to help with tasks.
good,"The environment I worked in was a mix of professional and laid-back. Management made sure we all did our job, sometimes other's jobs, but they never breathed down your neck about it, unless of course you didn't do your job. I would definitely recommend working at Lowes to my friends and others."
good,Good place to work very stressful. Took away too much time with my home life. Too many changes for the company with employees. They stopped caring it was more about the dollar
good,"Typical at Lowe's would be spending time with the team in the mornings. Help them work a little freight or walk their department together. i found it a great time for training, but also a great time to lean a lot about the employee and their goals. Then l I would walk the sales floor helping customers and watching the teams engagement with the customers. I would also respond to emails and look at reports. I tried to spend 3\4 of my day on the sales floor and 1\4 of it looking at or working reports. The work culture has been the most difficult with all the management changes, it has put a heavy load on staff.I enjoyed working with Lowe's ,the staff, and the customers. I just hope they can get back to their core values and live them."
good,Very relaxed job. Very friendly people to work with. Great shift hours. The only downside is if you are part time the insurance isn't that great. The pay isn't that great either.
good,"My job is awesome, I am wanting to move further in the company and they are holding me back from it. Management is so so, care more about their friends then doing what is right for the company."
good,Loved it wished I didn't have to leave (due to personal obstacles)overall good experience everyone like a family schedule hectic at time but made it work for me.
good,"Managers are awsome at Lowes in Gaithersburg ! "
good,"Working at Lowe's to me was more like working with family. It is a great company to work for, but it can be stressful if everyone isn't doing their fair share of work, which is he hardest part of the job. Its enjoyable because the employees there make you feel at home and actually care about each other."
good,lowe's is a great place to work. the employees and management are great. they work really well with any type of schedule and there is always something fun going on.
good,"Meet new people everyday, clean place to work..................................................................................................................... Learned how to operate different machines and drive fort lift. The hardest part was when the company get crowded, The enjoyable part was meeting new people"
good,I enjoy being able to help customers see a vision become a reality. This is done by following up on all orders to ensure the product is obtained in a timely manner.
good,i don't know if its different being a guy but the girls there would be gossipy and fake to your face and try to learn info about you to take to management to get you introuble or fired
good,"Like working retail  enjoyed people supervisor sometime has to fill in other area and department, Cashier and pick up drops. Pay was good and work fine we had stock shelf as well and place orders."
good,The harder you work there the more that is expected of you so be careful! Most employees were nice and caring but the morale was horrible due to the expectations and lack of appreciation to staff.
good,Love working with the people I do.  With all the most recent job layoffs there is no room for advancement and my job is being cut in January 2018.  Company does offer get benefits until they started their cuts.
good,Excellent training and adherence to policy in a fair/equal manner. Busy and diverse job duties keep the job from getting dull or mundane. Good employee support.
good,"It's a good place to work now, managers are good people, like my job and know most of our customers who seem more like friends than customers. Troubled waters at Lowes is making me look for new employment. Job security is very uncertain at this time. Cuts have come and are still coming.  I would have liked to retire from here, but I don't think that is going to happen."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, but I did not get enough hours for the travel I had to endure each day.  This is why I had to leave, but I would have stayed for more hours.  I appreciated the support I received from the management and other employees."
good,I have learned how to use many tools on the Genesis program as well as excellent verbal communication skills. The work culture is great. They celebrate birthdays and store milestone with food.
good,I am just looking for a more consistent work schedule.  I have enjoyed working with the customers and the other sales associates. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers trouble shoot problems and finding a solution.
good,"I enjoyed working with the people at lowes , costomers, and co -workers,coworkers were willing to help you any way they can,very easy going, wish I could have stayed"
good,Not a terrible place to work if you don't mind working weekends and holidays. Management changes a lot as do associates. I enjoyed most days because I love helping customers.
good,"Lot of recent cuts and restructure. Typical retail environment do more with less. Had great managers, had not so good managers... It really depends on the leadership of the store"
good,"Very active work place, there's always a job to be done/ someone to help."
good,The job involved assisting customers with hardware department questions concerning products and how to be best use the items. Sold locksets and rekeyed new sets when consumer wanted to use their present keys. Assisted in Tool world department also.
good,"I was thankful that I was given the opportunity to have a job. I was unemployed and searching for work, and Lowe's gave me the ability to support my family 20 years ago when I needed a job desperately. At the age of 39, it was hard work for me because I am an experienced restaurant manager and I had never worked in a warehouse setting like it before."
good,"Was essentially a swiss army knife for my summer position. Would unload trucks, get carts, help lift items to cars, or work the register. Management for the most part was reliable but one boss wanted extraordinary effort while being very disconnected from the employees. "
good,21 years with Lowes has flown by. I thoroughly enjoy working here. Due to a recent management corporate restructuring many of our options are now limited for advancement and I am once again after 19 plus years a customer service associate with the heart of a manager.
good,more room to grow in company being a new company in the country. for full-time and above positions pay better than competitors. allow you to take time needed off
good,Good work environment and team oriented. Flexible with students and their schedules. Management is friendly but likes to micro manage. Overall a good place to work.
good,"if you are looking for a part time job within the range of $10 to $12 Then this is a great place to work,friendly environment and very enjoyable, only issue i had was that they did not do fix scheduling for part time employees"
good,"help customer love where they live. ring out customer, place orders, answer phones, pull orders, call vendors, call customers, front face, down stock."
good,"Lowe's wasn't a terrible place to work, I did have an interesting 3 years there. Management thinks they are all that. If you are anything below a specialist, you are basically the scum under a rock."
good,"Merchandising, Downstocking, Leading by example, Coaching, Training, selling, delegating tasks, following up on delegated tasks, promoting credit, promoting our In-Home Sales, promoting Pro Services, helping solve customer complaints with the customer and being available for the staffs needs."
good,"Working at Lowe's is pretty decent . You never know what to expect but of course treat all customers with the same respect. There are many slow periods throughout the day, sometimes it may seem as if you've been at work all day and sometimes it may feel as if it was a piece of cake. The hardest part at Lowe's would be when a manager constantly picks at you for no apparent reason, always having things to say about the younger crew. The most enjoyable part would be when other managers treat you how you should be treated and rewards you for your accomplishments."
good,Lowes is a great company to work for. I always felt welcomed. The pay was great for a part time job and the management was friendly and helpful. The employees were friendly and fun to be around.
good,"All around decent place to work, had some great bosses who knew how to work with customers and employees and some that didn't treat customer and employees as well as to be expected."
good,"I moved back to Houston from Huntsville where I worked for The Home Depot, and Lowes actually paid me more money for the same job I did there! I was elated about that at first, but after working at one of the busiest locations in Houston for seven years my mother passed away and I was let go for missing more than two days in a row by the store manager! I LOVED working with each and everyone of my fellow associates, but when the store manager called me into the office after KNOWING my mother passed away from cancer she asked my why I was missing days and coming to work late. I received several awards for customer service and secret shoppers in my years with Lowes, so despite this store manager I would still like to go BACK to work at Lowes!"
good,"i start my shift by making sure my work area is clean so i can work"
good,"Shift 4 a.m. to 1 p.m. stocked freight and assisted customers with their questions and went home, no problems with anyone. The hardest part of the job was just getting up early."
good,Good company to work for. Human Resources was a bit difficult to deal with but overall managers and assistants were pleasant.  They had a great online education program so that staff could learn other areas to help promote themselves.
good,"Work environment is pretty good, coworkers are great. Poor scheduling habits, though I cannot say if this is a corporate problem or a store management problem. Day-to-day scheduling is not great."
good,Standard retail work but with fun people as coworkers. Fun events to go to as well to be part of. Living in Washington we had monthly BBQs that were amazing to be part of. We even served the customers hot-dogs and hamburgers.
good,"I was over the plumbing and electrical department, daily I would assign task and duties to associates coming into work, as well as I had to make sure the department met budget every month."
good,I do not know why I have to review my current employer to apply for another job.  Then make e tell in detail a minimum amount of stuff??  Its stressful and the new changes in structure are causing people to lose jobs.
good,"Working at Lowes gets rather repetitive. You maintain a clean well stocked department while assisting customers. You do learn about all kinds of building products and proper application and uses. This is helpful for around the house knowledge. Supervisors were always in a bit of rush and demand the impossible, but your try to deliver to their expectations. They do promote a healthy happy workplace culture.  The hard parts of this job are simple, dealing with language barriers and try to find the exact product someone is looking for. It can be rather enjoyable though. Nothing is better than when someone brings in pictures form a completed project you helped out with. Knowing you provided the products they needed to make their renovations come true is rewarding."
good,I enjoy my work experience at Lowes. There are some issues that need improvement but it would be a corporate decision.  This is a part time job for me. I trust I will make it through probation period and become eligible for benefits.
good,"I worked in the kitchen design department, temp. Hire, taught myself 20/20, met some nice people and would have liked to have been asked to stay on but they had a full dept."
good,"the work environment with other employees is wonderful.  Most employees have a great work ethic to where they are there and working to where they do not randomly call out.  We are well paid for our knowledge and skills and work.  We are crossed trained for better customer service.  "
good,Most of the time it is your normal retail environment with stocking shelves and zoning.  There are some customers that don't treat the employees with respect.  The management team and the employees are good.
good,"Nice place to work. Very Agile oriented. Friendly, helpful, and extremely knowledgeable peers. Relatively casual dress code (jeans and t-shirts, as long as they have the company name or collegiate), ""Dress for your day"". Outlined work from home guidelines. Very family conscientious."
good,Tough work but friendly environment. Fair communications between all staff.  Fairly thorough training procedures.  Customers are mostly friendly and patient.
good,Good company to work with. Always changing with the times of retail workings. Technology is always being updated to stay updated with times and younger generations.
good,Lowe's is a fun place to work if you enjoy being around people. Everyone is usually very friendly and the opportunity for career advancement is always available. You just have to reach for your goals and go after them.
good,"I enjoyed working for Lowe's Canada, they were always really accommodating while i was going through school. However, I did sometimes feel there were people in leadership roles that didn't always have an idea of what they were doing. Not bad for short term."
good,"Friendly associates, good work environment, very good benefits. I lived close by and was able to ride my bike to work. Good exercise. Hours for weekday tem were good for me. Had time to go to gym and play golf."
good,"Would recommend to others to work there. Great mamagment, as well as employees. Great Benefits and no hassle using them. Great place to further your career."
good,Lowes is a good place to work. Just ready to seek other opportunities   I don't mind change at all but over all unsure of the stability of the company
good,"Great workplace with fun, productive employees. Helping customers with their home improvement is satisfaction enough. Recommending what drill and screws you need to make a project work, giving them the right saw blade to cut certain materials, instructing them how to repair and leaky roof is all worth it to know you helped a family."
good,I enjoyed working for Lowe's for the four years however there were management issues that can be addressed to make it a better working environment as with its competitors also
good,"I enjoy meeting and helping new people."
good,"If you take advantage when opportunities present themselves you can go far with the company. Good communication skills, problem solving, team player and self motivator."
good,"Overall a great company to work for, a lot of professional growth opportunities. Company offers many great benefits (vac, stock, sick pay, health, etc.) Very fast paced, environment."
good,"I enjoyed working in the outside lawn and garden department of Lowes. It was a simple, fast paced work but was perfect for a student during the summer."
good,"Helping customers love where they live"
good,Working at Lowe's was a typical part-time or full-time job. Mostly mundane tasks that were simple like just focusing on the customers and making sure the store was clean and safe.
good,"Lowe's used to be a wonderful place to work, but with all of the recent changes they have made, it makes it almost impossible to enjoy working there.  Hopefully the company will figure out what direction they actually want to go in and then realize their employees are the backbone of the company."
good,The management there was pretty good they were very nice and helpful when I was getting use to the new job they had me moving all over the store because they realized my potential would have loved to stay but i was a seasonal position the Co workers there were nice everyone worked as a team
good,"Enjoyed working with the customers, and co-workers. Great benefits. Always something to do. Able to bid on different departments, which helped learn about a variety of products and consumer needs."
good,"fast paced, great opportunity for success. if you do what you are supposed to do, and do it well you can be greatly successful. in some locations the management can be part of the good 'ole boys club where if you are on the outside you will not succeed. If they like you, you are in."
good,"It's a decent place to work for if you're a teenager, pay is descent for retail, I'd say management is more better than walmart, walmart wouldnt let me get my CDL while working for them but Lowes worked around my schedule."
good,I moved to the top sales spot in the company in less than four months. I had a guarantied 13.00 hr + an a commission check that equaled my salary if not exceeded it. some of management didn't care for me that much because I worked less hours and made more money than 20 year veterans. hardest part of the job was the schedule. one day you worked 6am to 2.30 pm. the next day you would work 3pm to midnight and come back in at 6am. absolutely enjoyed the money when I had time to spend it.
good,like working there. good environment. has great customer and good working people that work there. lots of heavy lifting. they keep  you busy the shift goes by so fast
good,"unload trucks put up stock "
good,Lowe's is a great work place with good benefits but they have brought a contracted company in Simos which is who iam working for at Lowe's i love the work place the people the safety is there first priority  but to also come in and have a safe positive productive day..
good,"Worked 8 to 5 unloading trucks, opening crates and boxes  readying merchandise for the sales floor. Learned inventory check in, etc.. Management was consistent, competent, and treated staff well. I enjoyed the team-work in handling particularly heavy jobs."
good,Job was very fun and wages were competitive. The only reason I left was because they would not allow me to work part time when I went back to school. Overall great place to work.
good,"Busy work life at Lowes, always helping customers and pulling orders. Not a bad place to work, however it is a dead end job."
good,"Lowe's was great for me. I worked at a couple of stores across Canada, and the work never changed. However, management has their cons for sure (might not apply to different stores but it did at mine). Overall though if you want to work Retail, you might as well work for Lowe's."
good,"It was a pleasure to work for this company. I enjoyed going to work, even if it was at 3 am every morning. I knew it was going to be busy, whether I worked the dock area, going to customers' house to unload purchased merchandise, or helping throughout the store with our customers or inventory."
good,"Good place to work with a variety of tasks and responsibilities on a daily basis.  Management is good, and they are good about granting days off when needed."
good,My downside to this was being forced off of 3rd shift. They told us that the company was doing away with overnight shift. I found out that other stores in the company still had overnight shift
good,"I was a cashier for Lowes for 2 years. It's a very relaxed place to work for, theres plenty of downtime in which you're expected to zone your area. It was a pretty chill job."
good,"Not bad for what it is. That being a low level job. Pays descent. Nice People. Working in assembly is flexible, low stress, and everyone is easy to get along with."
good,I am a little disappointed with the HR department. I told that I could transfer my job to another store location. Due to my mother's sickness and so far I have been pick over by the Pembroke pines location three times. I didn't feel that it done properly.
good,I overall enjoyed my years at Lowes. Met alot of great people and learned alot from eployees and customers alike. The store management was overall good
good,The pay and benefits are good. They are getting better at training employees and improving on procedures and policies.  Recovering from a management re-structuring.
good,As long as you are in certain positions work life balance is good.  There is an old school mentality of management that is still pervasive within Lowes that doesn't fit current working environments.  An unwillingness to change.
good,A great place to work if you are passionate about sales and people.  Opportunity to advance career if you are motivated to take responsibility. I learned a lot and enjoyed my job.
good,The work environment is ok. This job is a seasonal job so there is nothing much to say about it. I like the people I work with and I get to meet people.
good,"Vast differences between stores, good and bad. Management needs help since the restructure that took place however, the pay is pretty good for the type of work."
good,Overall Lowes is a great establishment to work for I just think that management could be better at putting better help around the store. Put more workers on busy days and times.
good,"I've worked at Lowe's for over 2 years on the Unload Crew. It's been a good experience, but I honestly can't recommend the job. They don't treat the unloaders fairly and expect far too much, but I always did more than expected because I'm that kind of person. I received lots of praise for the managers, but at times it felt like they only praised the crew when they needed something. Overall if you need a decent job with good hours and a set schedule and don't mind back breaking work, check out the unload team."
good,"I worked in several departments including paint and electrical. The workplace was fairly decent as far as job security and learning. However, there was not a lot of room for advancement, at least in the retail environment. Also, there was an overall relatively low area of motivation for employees. Nevertheless, it was a good place to learn about Home Improvement as it is an everyday important area to master."
good,all around a great group of people to work with . Engagement with the team n activities by the store to boost moral. also includes quarterly bonuses which most companies do not offer to their employees.
good,A typical day at work isn't bad. It's one of the better retail places I've worked for. Customers can sometimes be frazzled but are generally great customers. I've learned a massive amount of things that I never thought I would learn or need to learn. Upper management doesn't have the greatest communication skills and need to improve in that area. The hardest part of the job was learning to operate the heavy equipment required to be proficient at my job. The most enjoyable part would be the coworkers and the family type environment that was created.
good,"I lived in Greenville when I work for Lowe's. I had a great team I worked with in my department. I worked in many departments because of my knowledge of architecture and construction. I started looking for new employment when I was passed over for a position not because the other person was more qualified but cause 'He know more people"" as the hr person stated"
good,"I loved working at Lowe's, my fellow coworkers were amazing and we really formed a family at my store. The corporate management style was not very good in my opinion, and that trickled down into the management style of the stores. I would recommend working here but after a while it gets old."
good,"Great work environment, the managers and other associates really work with you and around your schedule. As long as you show effort you can make it far in the company."
good,"Working for Lowe's taught me about professionalism, and a strong work ethic. On a typical day, you may come in contact over 100 customers. There may be slow days, yet there is always something for you to do. Managers are usually very friendly and helpful. Always offering advice for you to use in almost any situation that you may encounter. Overall I would recommend working here as a entry level job."
good,Good team work. Good paced work.   A lot of shift options.   Safety is very important.   They always have work. No lay offs. Good policies.  Good work performance bonus
good,Lowe's was my first job and I think it was perfect for that. My managers were typically only looking out for themselves which i think was the only downfall of my store.
good,"Lowes is a good place to work for except for a few things here is the list."
good,"check build list and gather items to be assembled.  Assembly products in shop and put items away in pick up later or deliver areas.     "
good,Great place to work amazing people to work with. New management structure is very confusing and alot of employees are confused with who to go to. Overall great place to work
good,working at lowes was a good experience. learned how to move heavy loads quickly and safely with the help of coworkers. management and staff are open and friendly.
good,"Started with Lowe's after I had been laid off from construction. Good people, good company, good pay for what it is. If you have knowledge of product and willingness to help others, it is a good spot."
good,"At Lowes, i learned more about materials used in certain projects and also learned quite a few DIY tips and tricks. I enjoyed seeing what each customer was working on and had creative ideas for."
good,Good Management team that clearly defines roles and expectations.  Good work and Life balance.   Excellent team members.  Pay is above average and in line with competition.
good,the typical day at lowes was unpredictable with all the new faces coming in and out of the department store. Management was fair. The hardest part was some times had to pick up others duties. I enjoyed dealing with customers
good,Lowe's was a decent job depending on your position. There was advancement opportunities to receive different positions throughout the store. I would work for them again if I needed to however it would be a HUGE pay cut
good,"Lowe's was by far the best large retailer I have ever worked for. Great benefits, great employees, clean environment. I just thought there was to much favoritism being done within the management team. I also enjoyed the customers that shopped there."
good,I spent many years working hard for lowes. I held many positions. I enjoyed each one of them. I enjoyed the hours and the pay. I enjoyed the customers.
good,"We worked for 8 hr/day, we had daily stand meeting where we discussed what we had done yesterday, what are doing today, do we have any blocks or no, apart from that work was very smooth, it was a web development with automated testing, management was very friendly and cooperative, saddest part of job was they used VDI."
good,"Loved what I did there.  I would work with customers on many levels of their repair, replacement or just new homes.  The customers are what make this place awesome."
good,"Working for Lowe's has been fun, so far, though the coworkers make it, for me, not the job. I've never really enjoyed retail, but I like the people I work with. The scheduling isn't that great and it's hard to maintain a balance for sleep and home life. I only have about 30 minutes with family a day, if that."
good,"Lowe's offers a tangible platform for its employees throughout its stores to gain customer service experience whether with sales, returns or administrative, while always challenging us to hone in on our skills. Its fast paced environment quickly has you learning the ropes and never ceases to throw you curve balls. But again, it's just a hardware store."
good,"no stress, short hours are given within  our open availability. can't have two jobs while working here. If you are satisfied with a small income without stress  then this job is for you."
good,Retail fast paced but amazing customer service. The hardest thing about retail is the change in schedule depending on the needs of the company. I find enjoyment in solving highly complicated and sometimes stressful situations
good,"Worked as a Customer Service Agent as well as a Sales Specialist and Trainer.  Many changes at this time, and we are working thru them as best we can."
good,Its a nice company to work for. I don't have anything really bad to say about it. I enjoy going to work and the people I work with. I would recommend Lowes to anyone.
good,"Working at Lowe's I experience  a good work environment. With managers that were willing to work with me on schedules as well as training. They trained me on basics for the service desk and dealing with customer issues, as well as admin information so I was able to help with admin paperwork when we were short staffed. I enjoyed being able to work with good coworkers as well as learn more and get more experience."
good,"I did not work here, I worked at lowes foods , but I can say the experience is great when I walk in and shop, it just takes a while at times to find someone who works there"
good,"working to motivate, lead, and inspire with customers and associates and try to become a better person everyday. by improving and never giving up is my ultimate goal."
good,I loved establishing a relationship with my customers.  I still miss them. Managers will work with your schedule. Pay is exceptional but average income for part time workers.
good,"I love working for Lowe's. I have learned so much from life skills, management skills, selling skills, to home improvement skills. Lowe's has an inviting environment and I truly look forward to going to work and helping customers love where they live, work, and play."
good,"Typical day at Lowe's can be very hectic. Learned to multitask better. Hardest part of job, was not knowing enough about certain products throughout the store."
good,"A typical day at work is based in customer interactions and associates support, I learned communication goes a long way, an effective manager leads my multitasking, delegating and leading by example with an open door to customers and employees. the hardest part is the long hours, the most enjoyable is the customer experience,"
good,Great Work-life balance. Worked around my schedule while I attended school full-time. Never had an issue with work scheduling. Starting pay was better than expected with no experience as a cashier.
good,"What I liked best about Lowe's was that you always had the opportunity to grow. You could cross train for any postion you want, pretty much. I was very versatile there."
good,Management can be good and bad. Co-workers make the job better. This job allows you to get creative alot. You can learn quite a lot from working here.
good,"My time at Lowes was not wasted. I learned a great deal about tools, trucks, time management, and customer service that i have found to be really helpful. I can also say that i can rely on the associates to be fair and helpful when asked."
good,The average workday is fairly easy going but there are members of management that could use extra training as far as how they treat employees and helping out when needed. When short on staff some management doesn't help as well as talk down on other employees.
good,"overall a great place to work but after management restructure no clear line of advancement.Flexible with shifts,fixed day schedule for all Full time employees"
good,Would come in stock with forklift help customers sometimes make orders of product for manager load customer's on a daily basis go too meetings help out any way I can
good,I used to water the plants in the green house area. Made sure the plants were free of disease and water them. Also I used to help customer pick plants and answer questions they had.
good,"As my first retail job, Lowe's is definitely different than sitting at a desk.  Loading mulch, cutting wire,carpet and blinds, I think everything I do aside from cashiering is fun!"
good,"Enjoyed working for this company, store leadership was awful but was able to put up with them.  Enjoyed working with associates."
good,Over the 12 years that I work for Lowes. And it's been an exciting and challenging development. Lowe's is a company that continues to follow along with the market trends and tries its best to stay ahead of the competition.
good,"A typical day:"
good,Typical day consist mostly of giving great customer service.  I have learned a great deal about the remodel industry in the last 16 years. There is room to advance into management positions.  I have seen the culture also change in the last 10 yrs to where we strive to offer installations services in doing complete remodels which saves the customer from having to find contractors themselves.  I think the hardest part of the job is notifying the customer that their product has been damaged in shipment and they have to wait another 3 weeks on product. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was knowing that I took care of the customer and made them want to return to Lowes  and growing that rapport with the customer
good,"Lowe's is good company, but has struggle to reward it employees recently. The company was good at advancing it employees, but have shift it focus more to external promotions."
good,"Completing daily tasks to assist customers on their DIY projects including zoning in your department, picking special orders, assisting in special orders, answering phone calls, prepare for visits from Upper Management and assisting more customers!"
good,"Lots and lots of customers to help.  Faced paced and challenging, which was exactly what I was looking for.  The products were varied and of excellent quality."
good,"While working at Lowe's I managed to go from a part time seasonal cashier to a sales specialist managing into the millions of dollars in product and sales.  While i didn't know much about plumbing from the start, I had a number of great mentors that got me to a place that I was comfortable talking with experienced plumbers and helping people with just about any issue.  Working there I really got the sense that I was able to help a person out who seemed to be having a very bad day.  There was even a design aspect as you got to help customers with bathroom remodels.  Most customers are happy to collaborate with you on tile, vanity, and other ideas that give you the feeling that people really want to hear what you have to say.  As long as a person is willing to learn, the job is great!"
good,It can be and used to be a great place to work.  I have been through 5 company down sizing and it is never easy to deal with.  Not sure what direction the company is going to this date.
good,"Lowe's is currently an evolving company. The management team strive to make your work day enjoyable and stress free. If you enjoy working with the people to help them make their dream homes a "
good,"A typical day at Lowe's is to maintain the sales floor, and assists store patrons with exceptional customer service. As a major hardware store chain, Lowe’s needs associates for a number of different departments, such as paint, carpet, gardening, lighting, and many other departments. Sometimes, and depending on the location, a sales associate with Lowe’s must perform other duties for the store, such as cashier and warehouse work."
good,"This is an incredibly fast paced environment, but not overly stressful. We help customers with things that we are efficient in ourselves, and most of the time dealing with things we love."
good,"my functions were to come in to my work space, make sure it was clean, go to the floor to acquire items in boxes and assemble parts"
good,"If you like working with people and like home improvement it is a fun place to work. Retail hours aren't so good, hard to get on full time and hours you work are not set and always changing."
good,I like working there the people were nice there were a lot of nice things there they were always there to help you out if he had a problem good place to work
good,"Working for Lowe's was an overall decent experience. You had your slow and your fast times of the day and season. I learned a lot about custom service, inventory, and warehouse functions."
good,"depending on the store, the people that worked there was fun to be around and made the job fun. you will learn about all kinds of things to fix your home with."
good,It has been my pleasure to serve some really awesome customer of the past years.  I have many repeat DIY customers and commercial customers who I have enjoy working with to solve their problems and meet the needs of the job or projects.
good,I've learned quite a bit at my tenure with Lowe's. I've built many skill sets which I believe will help me in my future. I'm hoping that my next venture will prove as productive.
good,"a typical day at work goes from slow to crazy"
good,"Lowe's is a good company, however, it works its ASM's too many hours per week. They do provide a lot of incentives for sales and safety. In recent years there has been a lot of Company restructuring"
good,"Good place to work, good pay, good benefits, treat the employees fairly well. Lots of turnover so lots of room for advancements. I do not want to write this review and needed 150 min characters to move on"
good,A typical day at Lowes is a filled with interested customers looking to change something around their homes. I have learned to better manage my task and the time I finish or spend with those tasks. The management was not very intrusive in a day-to-day time frame. The workplace was full of culture and did well with teamwork. The hardest part of the job was working multiple departments on days when the store is under staffed. And the easiest part of the job was helping the customers resolve their problems.
good,Lowe's has been a great place to work. The employees are very helpful and friendly. this is a very busy and fast enviorment. I love working with all different kinds of people. Helping customers select products and checking people out fast and accurate.
good,"It's a nice place to work. But after being there for over 10 years, I feel it's time to move on to something else. I work 6-3pm Monday through Friday and every other Saturday. It's busy work, time always seems to fly. Constantly using heavy machinery and a panel saw."
good,"Working at Lowe's was very interesting, especially since it was my first job. No day was the same as the last. The only challenging part of this job was dealing with the large amount of customers that came into the store. But other than moving the stacks of lumber and building material around it was just like a normal job."
good,"The company is great, it just depends on the management that you have. I had department managers and store managers that would rub me the wrong way and say things that are violations of USERA"
good,Great atmosphere. Everyone is kind. Management backs up employees. Flexible on scheduling. Job security. Learn a lot of house renos and daily house upkeep.
good,"Lowe's has been a great place to broaden my digital project management experience. They've given me the freedom to redefine my role, processes and way my team works. I've moved up from a contractor to full time to now managing the team. We have the ability to work from home as much as needed which helps to appease the fact that we only get 2 holidays off each year (Christmas / Thanksgiving). Unfortunately my team rarely gets them off as well. But management understands this and will work with you on comp time to make up for the terrible vacation policy. "
good,This company is full of opportunities for growth. Lowes is dedicated to their values and will bring you on board in their  inviting team atmosphere.
good,"They are willing to work around your every day schedule. Weather your a stay at home mom, student or even have another job."
good,Loved my team but the overall management team are never on the same page. Also the scheduled rotates every single week which may be difficult to handle for some people
good,"Lots of room for advancement, but may ask to move you to a department to have coverage that you know nothing about. "
good,Great opportunity for advancement if you wish to do so.  Learn as much as you want and it helps with advancement. High pace environment with many plates to juggle
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for and provides a good place to get work experience with a fair pay rate but recent changes will make it very difficult to turn Lowe's into a sustainable career unless you dedicate your entire life to Lowe's.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company for many reasons. I enjoyed being a Leader for this company. However, restructuring cost me my job. I enjoyed driving the culture in my store and its clear my associates enjoyed working for me. I did learn now matter how much you put into the job from a corporate stand point you are disposable. The hardest part of this job was customers occasional had unrealistic expectations of what we could and could not do."
good,"Serves as the store expert in millwork by providing detailed product information to both customers and peers, promoting and recommending products, plans, or installation services that match customer needs, informing customers on pricing, options or status on pending orders. Includes generating leads, conducting sales activities, building relationships with customers, keeping shelves stocked and correctly displayed, and coordinating successful completion of projects and orders."
good,Company is experiencing some financial difficulties. Job security is not a given any more.  Retirees looking for part time jobs are highly valued.  As a long time employee I have enjoyed my many years within the company but feel like  I  need  secure full-time employment.
good,"busy, on the go.  as a store manager the phone does not stop ringing.  With a well developed team it can be an easy task to delegate issues and needs to the department managers."
good,Good overall company. Good benefits. Recent restructuring of upper management. This is good overall company but with the restructuring makes you feel like a number.
good,"Good cohesive team building environment. A very clean work environment. Excellent opportunities for advancement. Great training for products, programs, and employee safety."
good,A good good place to work with a focus of goal oriented tasks. Good overall management group with great employees.  This is always something new you learn from either other employees or customers.
good,"Strengths- this company does care about their employees. It is a fun environment with talented people. "
good,I enjoyed working at Lowes. The store was very friendly and customer service oriented. I was very proud to be a Lowes employee and would definitely go back to the company if the proper opportunity arose.
good,I still work for this company and i enjoy my job.  There are times it is stressful do to working with the public but i love it.  i would recamend it to anyone looking to further their customer service skills.
good,"A typical day at lowe's is average, the pay is wonderful its just the different shifts you have to work. If you have flexibility it would be a perfect fit for you."
good,Lowes is a great company to work for.  My position allowed me to move around a lot and work with customers.  I enjoyed my co-workers as well as the position and hours that I worked.
good,"Enjoyed the work fit right in with my construction experiences, seemed to always be understaffed however making some tasks less enjoyable. Overall great coworkers."
good,"Fun, fast paced, customer and employee oriented workplace focused on creating not just sales but loyal customer based relation ships with clientele"
good,"Enjoy the job very much, enjoy the people I work with and the customers I deal with on a daily basis, the management are quick to assist and are very helpful"
good,This is a wonderful company to work for and there is plenty of room for advancement. Co-workers were great people. Management could use a little work. plenty of things to learn there.
good,I enjoyed working there. I was able to help people with home improvement projects. My coworkers were really nice and I like that. Who doesn’t like working at Lowe’s. They allowed me to attend school full time as well.
good,"Management could use a bit of refreshing, but things are working because of the employees. They do promote within the store and this is a fast track into management."
good,"Good place to work fast pace environment, learn new skills, plenty of room to move up in company. Most people willing to help when needed."
good,this was one of my best jobs when family things came up they were always understanding and worked with me if a select few people weren't still there i would love to go back.
good,I work efficiently to get all of the registers out in a timely fashion. I have perfect attendance. I help others when needed. I cover head cashier lunches. I cover customer service and returns. I know how to do pricing.
good,"I empty trailer of merchandise with co-workers...stock merchandise. unload trucks with forklift. I work alone or as a team. "
good,"I loved working here. The customers are friendly, the coworkers are awesome, the management is good. It's pretty hard work, the store stays busy pretty much all year round. I got to walk around all day  doing different tasks and I loved it!"
good,"Fast Paced During Spring and summer months, Work can be easier or harder depending on your department. Pay is above average."
good,"Day can include 10,000 to 15000 steps.  Hectic pace at times and  the culture tries to do 'right' by the customer.  Variety of workers from retired executives doing 'different' level roles to students, recent graduates and seasoned workers from other environments."
good,Working for Lowes was enjoyable. Delivery required early mornings and sometimes late nights but the customers were a lot of fun and the management team was great.
good,"Lowes was a fun and friendly work environment. My coworkers were great, most of which I am still close to. management was nice and approachable, Costumers needs come first."
good,"I have learned alot from lowes it has its ups and down but overall a good company to work for. i am a cashier and machines have issues, my co workers are pretty cool, the hardest part  of the job is nothing, and most enjoyable is meeting new people"
good,"decent place to work, no room to move up.but nice to work at a diy store if you are a diy kind of person. and it can be a relaxing place to work when you know of location of products"
good,"Retail is not for everyone, need a sense of urgency to succeed. Pay is good for managers. Hard work constantly and hard to deal with those who don't want to push themselves."
good,"Good company to work for with a friendly environment. It seems to be expanding therefore there's room for growth.  Not really big on writing online review, hope this helps somebody."
good,"Great benefits with ample opportunity for advancement. Awesome company values. Lowe's always tries to find solutions for customers and is 100% focused on customer service. However, it's easy to become overwhelmed with tasks. Training methods could be improved."
good,"The benefits are comprehensive and affordable. However, the pay is low for anyone with an education and the company lacks personal fulfillment which I think is typical of most retail sales positions."
good,"Good place to work, only downside is poor upper management. Other than that it is a good place to work in college, flexible hours and very lenient on attendance."
good,"its a good place to work if you likes sales and retail, deliveries were light but I learned to be more proactive and learned the business. my position wasn't that hard just when their were no deliveries.. but I like to stay active so I learned and helped other departments.."
good,"Lots of opportunity!  Lots of reorganization and departmental changes occur,  Job security is always top of mind.  Great opportunity for those willing to work hard!"
good,Days are fast paced and very busy as it is a high volume store. Most of the management staff is great and willing to help all employees. Remaining staff is very friendly and professional.
good,My days at work were long and hard but the team members I worked around made it somewhat bearable. The HR was really helpful and informative and other members of management were exceptional also.
good,"The coal industry if one of the hardest jobs i have or most will ever do , great pay but not worth the risk of your life, i enjoyed the thrill of adrenaline each day"
good,Had So many different job opportunities that you can learn when it came to different departments in the store. Always something to do and a high pace job no matter where you are placed in the store
good,Just make sure they treat you the way they would like to be treated . I really enjoyed my time there I just felt it was time for a change and work my way up the latter.
good,"Worked the Outside Lawn and Garden section for their Spring/Summer season position. Managers were kind, helpful, and understanding. Co-workers were reliable and always there when an extra hand or two were needed."
good,"The work at lowes can be stressful but as long as other workers did their part it generally went smooth. mangers were decent , the only hard part about the job was a lot of miscommunication and wrong orders given to me and other employees."
good,"This was one of my most favorite places to work at. I became very close friends with many employees there and loved my job. Its customer service so dont expect anything special from all the moody and ""mr. knowitalls"" that walk into the store. Managers make WAY too much from the quarterly bonuses that should be going to the people actually doing the work, but thats corperate anerica for ya."
good,It was a pleasure working there the people where great but their HR management there suck. Not very professional people run HR. Other management was great.
good,"depending on the position you have it can be a fulfilling place to work or a hard place, I worked in several departments and was able to have some really good times working there."
good,"As a driver, I am mostly outside of the store, but overall Lowe's has been pretty easy to work for.  Dealing with Customers can be rough when the salespeople in the store do not full explain things, or when they forget to sell necessary parts."
good,"I have been working for lowes for 6 years. It has overall been a positive experience. This job has put food on the table for my family and offered room to grow and advance. The downsides are the company is regularly changing structure which in turn leads to certain positions being changed or eliminated, also the rotating schedules and shifts make for a monopoly on the employees schedule. Days off are scattered and often squeezed between late/early shifts, making outside activities and personal development more difficult."
good,"This is a great place to get the hang of working hard and fast, and working at a goal of making the customer love were they live. A place that will help to sharpen your work ethic. The coworkers are friendly and it feels like a family at times."
good,a typical day at work was often pretty easy going. i learned alot in terms of work ethic and how to operate a cash register and deal with customer issues in a calm and efficient manner. my co-workers for the most part were pretty easy to get along with we tried to work as team even if we disagreed with each other. the hardest part of this job was the flexability. the most enjoyable part was some of the conversations i was able to have with the customers which proved to be pretty interesting most of the time.
good,Great place to work if you like to stay busy. There is always something to do and customers to help. If you enjoy working and want to get ahead in life - Lowe's will give you the opportunity to succeed.
good,I was a cashier and also did the IRP's each morning at 5am. After running IRP's I took over a register for the rest of my shift. The only thing I did not like is we can not get fulltime work. Only part time available anymore.
good,"Enjoyable atmosphere but few personnel per dept, so i encountered frustration from customers often that there were not more associates, management was fair and respectable as they showed respect to their employees,"
good,Good place to build leadership experience. In depth training in this field. Not as much room for advancement as used to be. Typical retail job - No work/life balance as long days and rotating schedule are the ordinary. Overall a good company but won't take long to out grow.
good,"Worked 8-9 hr shifts, worked mostly by myself, coworkers we good, and the management was supportive.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with assembly orders that were put in at the last minute."
good,Enjoyed working for Lowe's learning new products through out the store. Easy to work with my co-workers. everyone was always helpful.
good,"Nice people that I worked with, and liked my job. Loved working with the customers, helping them with finding what they needed to complete their jobs."
good,"All in all Lowe's is a fantastic job for people to hold.  Management is great, the people that work there, you fall in love with. Would recommend to anybody, that would like a part time job or a retirement job. I have learned so much from my time spent at Lowe's. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job, is your fellow associates and the bond that each and every one of us has reached. The hardest part of the job, would probably be, the lack of coverage and the stretching of each and every one of its employees to their limits."
good,Great benefits and great work environment. They are very family oriented.  They give you chances to grow with the company.
good,"Great place to work and still have a social life. The hardest part of this job is the culture/environment you work in. Manager personalities change with the change of every department, so getting along with the people in charge my vary."
good,I think the experience with Lowes Home Improvement will depend on the store you are located in and the Management Team.  It can be a wonderful product and successful place to work with the right team. I have worked in a few stores and it is very apparent the quality of your work life will depend on this very major issue.
good,overall a great place to work.... however this was when they still payed commission with your regular pay. so that part of it i'm sure has changed. but the people i worked with were great. i am still in touch with some.
good,"Overall good place to work, was never pushed too hard. however there is no point in applying for advancement as they simply give the job to who they want in the position. Loss prevention is allowed too much power in stores, my store had a history of harassment on the par of LP's."
good,It was a Fun job to work although the Pay was very low. I think a billion dollar annually company like that should pay more.
good,"it had its ups and downs like any job you work, great people to work with they have you back when you need help doing anything."
good,Lowes isn't what most people would think. It was as if the managers and co-workers never got along. The store was never organized like it was suppose to be.
good,"Good place to work especially for retired folks, but advancement seems slow. Management is good at our store and seems good other places from what I have heard."
good,The people are nice the work is consistent. The opputunity is there if you want to move up you just have to work hard. The benefits are good too. The employee discount kinda sucks but you do get bonuses for doing your job.
good,"I like working for lowes but the management is awful, and being in deivery is nice but you have unpredictable hours."
good,"A typical day at work is stressful but my co-workers are very helpful. I learned lot's of different information about hardware, gardening, and tools. The management is always friendly and always willing to help out their subordinates. The hardest part of the job is helping out all the customers and keeping every one happy, but it is very rewarding when I get to talk and laugh with the customers and hear their stories."
good,"The place was great, the job was simple and easy but physically exhausting. On some weeks the hours were manageable but on others they were very difficult. The fellow employees were extremely helpful. The scheduling was a little hectic though. Tried to get a permanent part time position for 4 months but kept getting passed over. Pulled groin due to over working."
good,"A nice place to work. Very pleasant co-workers who are always willing to help and teach you. I learned: customer service skills, cashiering, how to open and close the department, safety skills, etc. However, it can be difficult at times working in this store because organization is sometimes a downfall of this particular store. Other than that, the managers are very clearly interested in creating a positive working environment and demonstrate that frequently. They offer opportunities for employee recognition and occasional morale boosters (i.e.. after a large amount of days incident free there may be a luncheon). Overall, I would say that this store is a solid place to work, although it has a few issues with communication and keeping things running smoothly, they really do try to make it a positive experience as much as possible."
good,"In my experience, Lowe's creates a positive supportive environment for it's employees. The management culture is professional and respectful. I also appreciate working for a company that follows through on it's promise of high quality customer service. The human experience is very positive overall for employees and customers alike."
good,there was not a lot of room for advancement at the location I was in- I was offered a full time job but they ended giving me 2 part time jobs instead.. which had no benefits or job security
good,"A day at work was busy always checked the perimeter during work. I learned how to rotate, stock, cashier, and verify. Management was great and there for co-workers. The hardest part of the job was and not entirely stocking the whole store by closing time. The most enjoyable part of the job was communication with customers and co-workers."
good,"Interesting place to work.  Learn how to ship and receive product, drive forklifts.  Meet a lot of interesting people.  Hardest part of job is all the lifting of course.  Not a bad place to work."
good,very professional and the company makes it very easy for advancement. moved up to a department manager in less than a year
good,"As a single mom of two the work/life balance of a lowes corporate schedule is not the best.  With my rotation at Lowes there are atleast 8-10 days a month that I drop my kids off at school around 8:30 in the morning and don't see them again until 10:30 at night, by this time it is well past their bedtime.  I miss most ball games, field trips, and after school activities.  As for the job itself it is great.  Great company to work for, good pay, and even better co workers"
good,"A typical day at work consist of me scheduling breaks and lunches for the cashiers. I am over all of the cashiers, I deal with any customer issue questions they may have. I also get money for their till if they are short. I also give overrides, approve discounts. The most enjoyable part of the job are some of the coworkers I work with, they make the day a little bit more smoother than usual. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the customers and they funky attitudes from time to time."
good,This job is for some people. You need to be able to handle sitting and being on the phone for hours. Be computer proficient and handle criticism to better your self.
good,"As a PSA I would start the day calling my clients extend any promotions we had to them ask if they needed anything. I would help in sales with customers that came in to the store, I would junp on register if needed and go get the carts when prompted."
good,"My day usually consists of interacting with every person I see, whether it be a co-worker or a customer who comes in the door, I am always having conversation with everyone I meet.I've learned how to multi-task efficiently thanks to the helpfulness of the tasks I do on a regular basis. Management was very friendly, not the very first people I would begin a conversation with, however they all had common goals for everyone to meet and respected how everyone felt about the company policies. My co-workers were very helpful when it came to certain situations that I could not control by myself. Everyone had an awesome attitude towards their jobs and made everyone feel welcomed. The hardest part of my job, although rare at times, was dealing with tough or hot headed customers. I've learned to avoid any issues with customers by abiding by company policies and following what I felt was best for any situation involving an angry customer. The most enjoyable part about my job is interacting with everyone in the store, if you are a social or very interactive person, then the work environment at Lowes is perfect for anyone."
good,I truly loved working at Lowes.  They are many prior service men and women that work there and they make the place suitable for other transitioning prior service members.
good,Lowe's is extremely flexible when it comes to scheduling. I work at Lowe's part time while going to school full time. My supervisor would always try her best to schedule me off the days that I had school.
good,"Very good place to work, compensation is low. Plenty of room for advancement in time. Management is very good, hardest part of the job is the physical demands. Most enjoyable part of the job with working closely with contractors/businesses and watching a project come together."
good,Honestly I would work for this company again if i was afforded the opportunity. The Management program is just really hard to get into.
good,Every morning around 5 am; My co-workers and I set up shop before doors officially open for morning business.My job was to stock items before a certain time. When customers start roaming in the store; I provided customer service to those that needed it. Co-workers were very helpful when it came to training and management was very fair when it came to my floor work.
good,"The Assembly Dept. was actually located outside in their lumber yard away from other coworkers. Being so far away from people made it impractical to receive help in lifting heavy product. Other than that, it isn't a bad job. Just finding someone to help you can sometimes be difficult."
good,Nice workplace coworkers are great. Great for a person looking for a part time job.Their is nothing had about this job just come to work on time in do your job. In give great customer service to the customer that shop at are location
good,"Great place to work,hours aren't the greatest, pay is decent and my coworkers and supervisors are great people to work with."
good,"Best paying company as far as retail. Position is not easy, be prepared to work hard. Pull incoming PO's work with vendors and help customers."
good,"I learned a lot from working there, but the manger there was a joke and for the most part there kids. if your 20 and need a fast job then its the right place for you"
good,It was a good place to work I advanced quickly good team environment the only thing i didn't like was the hours. a typical work day was divers and I got to have a lot of face time with customers.
good,"I enjoy working for Lowe's. I was hired with very little customer service and gardening experience, but quickly learned a lot and was able to work on my own with little help very quickly with the help of my co-workers and ASM's."
good,I went in loader truck with appliances . go out on the road and do my deliveries to customers. Come back to store and pull for the next day.
good,"Whenever I got in to work it was lets get started on something. There was a few of my co-workers that where not motivated to work hard, so they just half did a lot of things. The management is not the greatest they do not communicate with there employees very well.The Assistant Store Managers communicated very well the department mangers did not give any direction. I have learned a a lot so far from working at Lowes, such as all the different kinds of materials for building certain projects. The hardest part about this job is not being able to have a set schedule. The most enjoyable thing at this job is helping people and seeing them happy when you find them the right product."
good,It is a pretty decent place to work if you have the right job. Some like my own have my hands tied behind my back. Days can be long and management can be unwilling to listen to reason.
good,"Working here was a great learning experience for patience and communicating to customers. "
good,"Lowe's was a great place to work, as long as you did your job and did it well. It came with many benefits for your health and your future. Employees and the managers were always there for each other. There are many ways to grow within the company. Lowe's gives you many different experiences how to satisfy customers and promote Sales no matter what department you work in. The most enjoyable part was meeting wonderful customers and co workers."
good,"When I started at this job, I adored everything about it and the company. As the years have gone on I have seen this company fall hard in the way of how it treats its employees as far as their work load and work life balance."
good,Great place to learn and grow. Typical days were busy with customers and putting freight away.  Pays well and get benefits.
good,I really enjoy working at Lowes but right now they have been cutting hours and i am looking for another job so I can start my college as well
good,Not reasonable with days and hours employees are able to work. Given hours others don't want. I was okay with the hiring process but they quickly changed
good,"I like how focused on safety they are as well as they willingness to help you learn as long as you ask specific questions, Management is friendly and helpful, as are all the employment. Hardest part of thejob has been learning their Kronos system for order management and inventory."
good,"-spent majority of day helping customers find certain products, gave quotes, picked orders or general cleaning"
good,"Great working environment. Management team is pretty good. Doesn't pay very much, but the work is easy. Great part time job."
good,"Great place to work! Wonderful people. Fun and always looking out for employees. Guidelines, skills and learning new things every day."
good,Lowe's provides quality products at a reasonable price. Most Associates are very knowledgeable about the products in their areas. A typical day is spent helping customers and making the aisles clean and presentable for the customers. My days also include managing the associates in my department and doing the paperwork to ensure we are stocked with products.
good,"Good Company to work for.  Advancement potential is there, if the individual is willing to work for it.  The hardest part of the job, is adjusting to the roating schedule."
good,"This was a seasonal assignment, so that would be the only downfall for myself, But the hours were great and so was the pay for the area. The only thing I didnt like was that it was a temporary position"
good,the people you work with is cool. but a lot changes within the store and its a great learning experience.the most enjoyable part is the co workers. the hardest part sometimes is the customers. management is sometimes iffy.
good,"My team and direct supervisor are unparalleled in their professionalism and business knowledge. They handle corporate directives with fineness and alacrity. As one of the busiest stores in the corporation, the pace is heightened while the needs of our clients comes first.  A great place to learn efficiency in the face of adversity."
good,"Great place to work, meeting new people. Life long friends have been made. Each day brings new challenges to the table. A wide variety of skills will be learned working here."
good,"10-12 hours per day in retail DIY home improvement environment."
good,"I show up at a set time 5 nights a week, i unload the same trucks over and over, then i put the freight on the sales floor. use of power equipment and LP power forklift regularly."
good,"I am fortunate to say that I have enjoyed working for Lowe's. There are great benefits, flexibility and opportunities to learn the company. However, it is difficult to climb the corp. ladder without having connections. That is the case with most companies."
good,This is a great retail company with competitive salaries. Management teams go through extensive training to ensure employees have a pleasant working environment.
good,"Best part of the job was the challenge and people including the customers.  There was no limitations to the opportunities afforded to"
good,"I am willing to rewrite my statement, first time setting up account with indeed and not feeling at all comfortable with any statement currently posted about my current position with my current employer."
good,I believe Lowe's to be one of the best large retail firms to work for. Probably the best thing I like about Lowe's is helping customers with their projects with the experience and know-how I have.
good,"My co-workers were pleasant, and enjoyable to work with. Reliable, and friendly. The hardest part of the job was not always having the proper tools available so the assigned tasks could be completed in the time frame that was given. I learned many things from stock replenishment, receiving and processing freight, using heavy equipment, inventory control, building displays."
good,"As any company as large as Lowe's is, the company struggles with communication from top down, but does an excellent job with benefits and competitive pay for like positions."
good,"Overall, the atmosphere is definitely positive. I have learned much more of what it means to do hard work. When I started, I was pressured to work harder and faster than I had ever been used to and now I feel as if I am a much harder worker. I always try my best now, thanks to Lowe's Home Improvement."
good,muy buen lugar de trabajo mas no de promociones a corto plazo
good,"Early morning usually consists of doing required paperwork and reviewing payroll  error.  Customer service starts when you walk through that front door."
good,i would not like to did this part. overall it was a nice experience. i do not have anything bad to say about any job i have had.
good,"Lots of emphasis on the customer and their needs, the customer is number one.  Great benefits available to full-time employees.  Occasional celebrations and lunch provided for meeting certain sales goals and customer satisfaction surveys."
good,"Lowe's is a fun place to work. they are like a big family they. and the management is very supportive. if there is any that ask me if lowes a good place to work i will say yes , because they look out for you and help you with everything that you need, to work safe and get the job done. they all just come together to make the work place a better place every day"
good,"Good supervisor and manager enjoyed working with them. Always busy coming in early to pull merchandise and keep upper and lower shelves stocked,"
good,Enjoyable environment with many new experiences. Management is very helpful and it is a great company to move up in. Learned leadership skills as well as renovating opportunities. Many customers during holidays.
good,Loved working there. Clean store.  Good processes in place. Some senior managers better than others. Better wages than other box stores.
good,"I enjoy working for Lowes. It is a nice company. I have good co-workers. The managers are always helpful, when they can be."
good,"I worked mornings; so, a typical morning was coffee and morning detailed meetings with a closing of a prayer. My job was lovely to do because it wasn't a restricted position; I was allowed to be free and really interact with the customers that was just walking through the store. I like being personable."
good,"This keep me on the road most days but it is a deed end job there no were to go in the company at the pay I make , the people I work with most generally just come to work to do the job without any expectation."
good,"As a DIY personality type, this is a very enjoyable atmosphere. The pay is decent compared to a lot of other jobs around this area. The only issues ive had is the lack of communication as far as schedules go. They create the schedule 2 weeks ahead, yet some management expects you to check your schedule daily (including your days off) to see if any changes have been made. I have had a few bad experiences with management and my schedule which can get annoying quickly. Other than that, a very fun job for me."
good,"We would unload anywhere from 300 to 1200 items from the truck. "
good,Became head cashier less than a month of working with Lowe's. Counted down registers and done til reports. Also was back up scan for Price Coordinator. Priced the whole store and changed tags. Coworkers and management was hard to get alone with. Would schedule you to work until 10 at night and be back the morning at 6 for pricing.
good,"Fun enviroment to be in always someone telling a joke , coworkers were awesome made a few friends from lowes, the hardst part of the job was loading up dishwashers, most enjoyable part of the job was talking to co-workers"
good,i like working at lowes the work wasnt hard u just was back and forth all day from line to line and u aint have a time limited to have the trucks loading they always said work at your own past and stack the boxes all they way to the top of the trailer
good,"Driving sales by engaging both employee and customers. I keep my ear to the ground, to feel the pulse of both the employee and the customer. Increased engagement of both equals increased sales."
good,"Apart from the 'lack of communication' from the management about decisions, the place is a fun place to work. The amount of self learning is incredible! People are fun to work with for most part and just like any organization, there is always politics involved but you can escape it if you focus on your own responsibilities. "
good,Maintain a clean work space. I assist customers with returns and exchanges and well as making purchases. I learned how to use a cash register. The management team is helpful and my coworkers are pleasant. The hardest part of my job is satisfying all customers.
good,lots of different things to learn great people to interact with customers and co workers company believes in advancement decent salary as well
good,lowes was a awesome job i learned so much working there with the other great employees and loved every minute of it unfortunatly after having my daugther i was forced to quit due to having to work all shifts although i had worked there as a supervisor for almost three years and it became very tough to find daycare for a infant barely two months old
good,"My job consists of helping contractors pull their orders and help customers load products into vehicles, I also help customers with their building, repair/replacement needs"
good,Productive environment with game tables available during breaks. Learn valuable information in regards to inventory control methods - dedicated management team - enjoyed co-workers.
good,My time with the company was enjoyable.  It was a wonderful learning opportunity for me.  There was never a shortage of work.  Teamwork was very encouraged.  Kaizen was introduced to the company during my time with them.  A typical work day for me included onboarding new installers and general contractors via the application process and updating General and Automobile Liability Insurance as well as Workman's Comp insurance.
good,This company is a good place to work. I think the hardest part of the job was having only one weekend off a month. I did get to see alot of the north country. They did maintain their fleet of trucks very well. It was satisfying to see a customers face after installing their new appliance. I took pride in my job at lowes.
good,Every day is different  a lot to learn with products we carry in the store along with computer knowledge and skills.  Like work with my co workers and customers.  The hardest part is not getting enough hours to get a decent pay check.  Plus Part time do not get any sick days not even three days a year.
good,"Lots of opportunity to advance, stay positive.  Can be very demanding but also fulfilling.  great company that cares about its employees and mission statement"
good,"I enjoyed my time there even though it was shortened due to a reduction in force. My supervisors were nice and helpful on the job. The other associates I worked with were kind and helpful, not standoffish like at other jobs I had."
good,"Employees are friendly, hard-wroking."
good,"Working at Lowe's was an experience, its almost always something to get done that day. Hardest part of the job was lifting heavy items all day and the heat inside the trucks was unbearable at times. Overall you meet some pretty cool people there."
good,"I assisted a variety of consumers with their purchases which allowed me to utilize the sales skills I have learned over my career.  The fellow cashiers were supportive of each other and the team leaders were able to teach and support the members by using positive reinforcement techniques, which I think brought out the best in each employee."
good,"Lowe's has been a great employment experience. Good wages, good benefits. Employee discount. 401k. Stock Purchase Plan."
good,Very consistent in meeting goal. The hardest part dealing with this company is nothing. Customers may give you a hard time in trying to  find different items but as long you stay confident and actually try to find items that customers are looking for. you will be really appreciated for it.
good,fun work environment something new everyday getting the chance to meet new people everyday. not much support from management to resolve problems or will not work with schedules.
good,Fast paced and physical customer service environment. Must be able to multitask and get things done. Pay gets better with promotions.
good,"Good place to work, good people that work there, nice customers, good pay there. pretty decent place to work if your trying to find a starting job as well. fun times."
good,"they let me form my own style in customer cultivation, they trusted me in that and it worked out in high volume sales and cultivation."
good,Working at Lowe's I had chance to learn how to provide exceptional customer service to customers.  I enjoyed listening and learning about projects shoppers were completing.
good,I truly like this kind of environment of work place it fits my needs and give me a since of pride to help out customers in there building projects and to help them have the tools they need to complete the job and for me to learn new ways to help others
good,"I really enjoyed the day to day interactions with other employees, as well as customers. The store I worked at (422 in Springfield MO) was one of the busiest Lowe's stores in the nation. I stayed for nearly two years, but elected to leave when scheduling conflicts became an issue."
good,I enjoyed being in public. I enjoyed customers that came in each day as well as helping new customers with their projects. Customers knew whom I was and enjoyed my service to them. I liked having co-workers yet could do my job alone.
good,Everyone is great and management is good but it is hard to get anything besides seasonal employment. I would like to work for this company if I could get enough hours to survive.
good,"Above all else, Lowe's believes in compensating its employees very well in comparison to other retail sales companies, with the only exception being Cost Co."
good,"In lumber, there is a lot of heavy lifting and customers (usually contractors) are in a hurry and have bad attitudes.  Some customers are more pleasant to work with.  Most coworkers are helpful and work well in groups.  Management tries to offer extra hands when we're super busy but it's not always very helpful.  Overall, it's worth the money if you can deal with physical labor and grumpy customers."
good,"I would say overall Lowe's is a great place to work. Good management, pay, and benefits.The paid time leave is nice along with paid sick days."
good,Had a fantastic experience working for Lowes. All of the employees were friendly and inviting. Made it easy to learn and be comfortable in the work place.
good,"A typical day at work would be unloading and loading trucks, stocking merchandise, and assisting customers. I learned many useful things in the various departments I worked in that could be used outside of work. Liked and got along with management and my co-workers. Hardest part of the job was the physical labor but I did not mind it. And the most enjoyable part to me was driving the different forklifts."
good,"Very progressive and diverse company to work with.  Each person and their ideas are important and everyone is a vital part of the team and it's success.  Very good at communicating the companies direction by week, month, and year."
good,"Management is nice and organized, pay is good, great company to work for. No stress, no harassment and they treat all their employees well."
good,"It's a good company to work for, but since it's so large there are a lot of hoops to jump through.  Nothing big, just a lot of little guidelines."
good,Fun but also very stressful work environment. You will learn a lot about home improvement. Not enough associates in each department to assist customers.
good,"Have been working at Lowe's for a little over two years. I've been promoted many times and still room for advancement."
good,"I'm a department manager and while the job was hectic for me at first, I've settled in quite nice.  It's an excellent way to meet new people and learn new things.  A typical day at work consists of zoning my department with my associates to ensure the area is presentable, managing paperwork and miscellaneous things, all while assisting customers to the best of our capabilities to ensure they have a desirable experience with our company.  The hardest part of the job is that there never seems to be enough time in the day to deal with everything that you'd like to take are of.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the feeling of fulfillment and gratitude you get when you help a customer from the first step to the last step and help them get exactly what they want."
good,"Load/unload trucks, merchandise builds/displays, stocking merchandise in a timely manner, forklifting experience, helping customers load or unload materials, helping various departments with maintaining/stocking materials, and showing good attitudes with customers, co-workers, and management."
good,"I learned a lot about plants and landscaping. Everyday I would arrive and take care of (water, prune, etc.) the plants. I would offload shipments of plants and put them out on the display tables. If the plants weren't sell-able, I would get in touch with the vendor to try to get credit on them. I also enjoyed working with customers and helping them find all the materials they needed for their outdoor projects."
good,"clean safe place to work, not to demanding mostly, help customers, straighten up departments, stocking inventory and zoning"
good,"I enjoyed working for Lowe's Home Improvement. The environment was fast paced, and during my last position as Pricing Auditor, I was able to work on my own with very little supervision. I was able to work very well with upper management and developed a good work relationship with many other co-workers. If there were any conflict among myself and others, I was able to handle the manner in a professional and non-confrontational way."
good,"Great atmosphere to work in. would load/unload, gather deliveries, package merchandise, bring stock onto sales floor, etc."
good,Great place to work in order to help customers with projects. Ability to learn how to complete projects on your own that you might not have in the past. Customer service is a must to ensure that the company is profitable.
good,"stocked shelves. helped customers, order shipment "
good,I started work at all different hours. I learned allot about home improvement. The management staff was very good to me as well as my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job was making friends and learning about home improvement.
good,I was able to make customers experience at the store pleasant. I loved going in and helping a couple the ceiling  fan they needed or direct some one in the right direction if they needed lightbulbs. I learned how to work well with a team while still making sure I got my job done.
good,Lowes allowed me to make some great connections and to grow as a part of a team player as my position with them had me integrated with a small close-nit team that depended upon each other
good,"I worked here for 6.5 years, great benefits, nice people.  Only problem is they would not allow me to advance to something better."
good,"its great at Lowes.   its the easiest call center I've ever been in.   all day long i answer inbound calls regarding order status, how to use the mylowes, place orders, and answer questions"
good,"Lowes is a great company to work for, the benefits are good, the salary is better than average, there is room for advancement."
good,"I've worked with Lowes for a total of 5 yrs. "
good,"We worked multiple shifts.  I was responsible for numerous opening functions such as daily safety reviews, checking stock levels and checking the condition of my department.  I gave direction to my direct reports and other associates as needed. "
good,"A COMPANY THAT WOULD LISTEN TO YOUR IDEA'S.They also would go around and tell you your doing a good job people Appreciate hearing that,"
good,"Not as much rooms to advance as they lead you to believe, and they like to pick and choose who they move around based on personal feelings. This may not be at all lowe's but this is one of the reasons why I left my lowes."
good,"Managed 130-150 employees utilizing the 4 Assistant Store Managers under by.  Typically 12-14 hours a day, manage by walking around (MBWA).  Enjoyed working with my employees, training, teaching and watching them evolve and promote."
good,Excellent company to work for. Co workers have positive attitude. Management is very helpful and treats employees to food on holidays.
good,"Over all, fun place to work.  Loved helping my customers and finding solutions for them.  Lots of good people to work with,"
good,"Exceptional place to work if retail is what you love. They offer great starting pay and the ability to move up. Takes awhile to learn your assigned area, but employees are very helpful."
good,"They provide continuous training and support to ensure job knowledge.  There are a lot of physical aspect to this job so you need to be prepared for that aspect of it. However, that aside this is an established company with a long history that provides a great many benefit beyond employment and compensation."
good,A typical day at lowes was pretty calm & collective. I was a overnight worker so usually there were only 5-6 people in the store at night so we had our own space. I learned that working at night can take a toll on your body so you have to be prepared for that kind of work. Lowes management was great! They always seemed like they cared about all of their employees at work.  The coworkers were very  welcoming to me when I first started & always helped me when it was needed.
good,"Lowe's was one of my favorite jobs. I started off in flooring and because of my school schedule, I worked on front end as well. Good employees, good management, excellent team work! We were like a family. Great employee get togethers, etc. Opportunities for advancement and learning as well. Some days would be overwhelming especially when we were shorthanded. Besides that, this was a great place to work."
good,"always had a great dayco"
good,"I would mix paint for customers, down stock shelves, and stock paint. I learned a better way to communicate to people. The hardest part of the job was balancing stocking shelves and answering customers calls, but it was not bad at all. the most enjoyable part of my job at lowes was the people i worked with, they were good people and the managers were good leaders."
good,Good work environment. friendly employee and managers. The team is a good team to work with. over the years working there we accomplished alot as a team and all our effort was recognized byy the store manager and his assistant managers.
good,"As a single individual, Lowe's is a great opportunity to expand career options  Ranging from cashiers, to sales specialists, to management.  The pay is very competitive and above most other employers.  However, once you are in management, and have a family, Lowe's will take it's toll on your life.  Working 48+ hours a week, and working a 4 week rotational schedule will test your ability to enjoy family time.  Having to secure and maintain a Lowe's email address, also will make you accessible at home, which is required as a Sr. Manager.  Benefits are great, co-workers are great, and the job itself is enjoyable.   With any retail, it can get stressful (customer complaints, corporate visits, etc)."
good,"I loved working at Lowes! It's been the best job I've had so far. If you truly want to move up in the company and you work hard, they give you plenty of opportunity. They really do reward their staff well when it comes to appreciating hard work. I never felt like a number at Lowes but a valuable employee. I loved learning new areas to apply myself in, I started as a seasonal paint associate and before long, I was a part time pro. I had knew customer's and vendors by name and loved tackling every project with a sense of creativity and enthusiasm. I really loved helping customer's pick the colors to turn their house into their home. It was always a fun challenge. When I moved to Seasonal for a fulltime position, I had to overcome the obstacle of learning outside my comfort zone, but I had plenty of co-workers to help train me and push me out of my comfortable art box. The only thing I didn't like about the job were the crazy hours. I hated not having enough hours as a part time associate and I hated practically living at work as fulltime. I wish there were more set hours. If it weren't for the crazy hours that cut into my time to do other things and the slow increasing pay, I'd have just transferred to another store when I moved, but I decided to move on and find something that worked with my life and my schedule alittle better."
good,"Lowe's was a great place to work. I love working with people. The Lowe's team works hard at helping customers, but falls short in what customers really need, good help. Lowe's doesn't pay all that well for being such a profitable company. They care about the customers but not the employee. They took commissions away saying that they could give a better price to the customer this way but within 3 months every appliance went up four hundred dollars. Way to drop the ball."
good,"Lowes is a fantastic company and they make it fairly easy to move up if you are willing to work the crazy retail rotating schedule."
good,"Busy place to work."
good,Great Management!! Great Work Environment! Wages are not competitive though and they cut hours on you with no explanation
good,"Easy going place to work in. Friendly co-workers and open minded management."
good,"For being my first job , it was easy to learn how lowes work and how they function on a daily . The mangers were helpful whenever I needed a question answered and the co-workers were helpful when I needed to know what to do on a task."
good,"This is a great company to work for. It is steady work. Coworkers are fantastic and helpful. Health insurance is worthwhile for FT, but not PT."
good,"I was a manager in multiple locations, and each location is very different. The culture of the store is set two ways. One way is the upper managers, and the other way is the customer base. Example, great managers will make a store, a fun, profitable place to work in. However, many locations people seem to be just going through the motions, and collecting pay checks."
good,"On a typical work day, i would come in and assist customers with their needs, whether it is helping them pick out their paint colors to ordering their blinds for their home."
good,It a place to learn when you are in school to get a job but not for anybody worked in the world hard and trying to make I the world
good,I learned about different departments and loved interacting with people who came in store. co-workers were nice . The hardest part was straightening at the end of shift.
good,"As you know retail is retail, but you are well compensated for a retail position and the atomsphere is great. The regional manger would be the only down fall he will make you hate your DAY."
good,Great work life balance. Management was aloof and not involved with their employees. Lowe's is a great brand name to have on your resume.
good,"Despite the general idea that retail is dead-end, Lowe's proves this wrong if you apply yourself! You are given tools to learn with a team that helps you."
good,"Operating the cash register and greeting people with a courteous smile and helping to locate items and assist them when needed.  Understanding of processing of various credit cards, discount cards, checks, cash, etc on a daily basis.   Must work well in a busy atmosphere selling a large variety of products and have a general knowledge base of where products are located in store."
good,"Great place to work with decent pay, especially for students. They throw a lot of cookouts and employee appreciation days. Sometimes its hard to get hours, and seasonal and part time employees don't get health insurance. Management is great, for the most part, and I got a lot of satisfaction out of my job. Beware of Autumn, however, because they do a lot of laying off in the Autumn, due to sales. I am actually trying to go back."
good,"Lowe's was a good company to work for , management pay structure  was really rewarding. Customer service was a very important part of day to day operations."
good,Its an overall great experience and its a very friendly environment to work in. Everyone works well as a team and its awesome.
good,"Nothing really to complain about. It was an easy company to work for, good pay. They worked with my schedule when I needed time off. The employee discount was appreciated. Though I only worked there for a short time, overall it was a good experience."
good,"Lowe's is a company where you can advance. You make the job what you want, as the company is very easy to work for and promote yourself within"
good,"Great Benefits Okay management learned alot I worked on the cash register mostly"
good,"I worked at Lowe's a couple times. The company seems to be on the right track for taking care of its employees. The wages that associates receive is better than most retail locations. With every job there are always things that do not always work, but that is how it is in life. The company is a great company but if you are not in with the upper management moving up can be impossible."
good,Fast paced environment that provides opportunities for growth.  Lowe's has a high expectation on operational standards that help you grow in delivering process to a new level.
good,"My experience at Lowe's has been mostly positive. A typical day is get to work check in with other associates and see what has been going on. Whether that be bay resets, cycle counts, customer service, down stocking, or putting things away in top stock, or setting up displays."
good,"The Lowes i worked at wasnt not amazing, but far from the worst. I would go back if need be, but would have to prep for the unorganized fiasco that is Lowes where of the 4 people in my crew, 2 were late 90% of the time. Most of the managers were grate, mine included."
good,On a normal day you go in and go to your register. It's not a hard or bad job just when peak hours go down it can be hard to find a way to keep busy. After your straighten up the area around you and sweep then your left to stand there till customers are ready to check out. You can learn alot about building materials and paint which I enjoyed. Management and co-workers were friendly and helpful when new to the job. If you don't mind standing in one place and sometimes faced with having nothing to do then go for cashier but if not then Id advise a floor position.
good,A typical work day is stressful yet at the same time very rewarding. I lead and engage me team to involve and develop relationship with customers to provide them with knowledgeable information on their projects and remodels.The management teams are engaged in advising and counseling any employee that wishes to develop their keen skill set and promote. The hardest part of the job would consist of coach and counseling employees that are not engaged or ready to promote. This is a job that can be hard but it is up to me to provide answers and assertive reasoning. The most enjoyable part is the atmosphere of creating new leaders and establishing customer relationships.
good,"It has it's perks and most of the staff is like family, you learn something new everyday and the pay and benefits are great for retail. My main wanting to leave is the shifts are swing, which can be tough on parents (especially single parents). Also, make sure you have good shoes, because the concrete floors will hurt your feet while working day in and day out without proper footwear."
good,Great place to work if you enjoy working as a team and giving great customer service.  Difficult work but fun because you get to work with great people.  Bring in a good attitude and its a good job.
good,"Great work  environment and coworkers, management could be improved particularly store managment"
good,I enjoyed working at Lowes with my only discrepancy being a  constant fluctuation in the number of hours allowed to work. The company as a whole is a great one with tremendous opportunities.
good,Be a manger at Lowes can be a little rough. You must have an understanding spouse or be single. Every holiday is a must to work except Christmas. Lowe's is busy during every holiday especially during the spring and summer. We call working there being in extreme retail. The beginning of March starts the 100 days of heck. The people are great. The customers are great if you treat them well.
good,"Lots of changes in 9 years, and have been able to work with the changes almost on a daily basis. I have learned about big box retail, presentation and merchandising, seasonal changes, and working with a large group of people. Most enjoyable part of job is meeting goals and working with people. Hardest part of job is retail hrs. have been working 10 to 12 hrs a day for 4 years ready for 8hrs and more time for life."
good,"Typical day starts with helping any customers in hardware and tools or any other that need help. If no customers, then we top-stock, down-stock, front merchandise to make sure our shelves are full. Work with customers often entails discovering their needs and then helping them to fill those needs. Prior to closing the store we clean-up, sweep, and get rid of the trash to make our area ready for the next business day"
good,Lowe's Contact Center can be very rewarding and challenging. It is the hardest department in Lowe's Corporate to work in my opinion as the fast paced environment is always changing. You have to adapt and continuously be on your toes.
good,A typical day at my job goes by quickly. I learned that communication is key to your job getting done right. the five hours goes by fast most days. the best part of my job is it keeps you in shape.
good,Good place to work as long as you are working! Lots of room for moving up in company! Management was ok more about numbers than employees. great bunch of guys and gals to work with. lots of celebrations and giveaways. all in all a good place too work. will work with you on personal issues.
good,its a good place to work but over the year the company has taken a lot of things away for its employees
good,"Lowe's has been a workplace that has challenged me. The customers that enter the store accompanied with their problems they have for that day, have helped prepared me for future challenges. Though these customers were the ones I used to dread at the start of every day. I now realize how valuable the life lessons I learn from them are! The life experiences have been truly unique to the retail environment. It has showed me how to treat my fellow man in a better way, and how to look at situations through someone else's eyes. The co-workers I have gotten to know on personal levels have been truly amazing. The customers that come in, in a bad mood and leave in a good mood with a smile on their face have been the most rewarding part of working at Lowe's. I would not replace my time at Lowe's for any amount of money."
good,"This is great place to work, just takes time to move up, and being a manager requires lots of hours"
good,Retail is a fast place enviroemnt. If you want to learn the ropes and become successful Lowe's is a fantastic way to go. Not only do the standards employeed at lowes force you to become a better retailer the compensation offered to its employees are some of the best
good,"A typical day of work can start as early as 5am, and end at 11pm.  However, you would not be required to work from 5am - 11pm.  The hours are very good, you get an hour for lunch, 1-2 15 minute breaks, and the overall joy of working with some really great people.  Lowe's provides a rotating schedule, so you are guaranteed to have 1 weekend off per month if full time.  Lowe's also accommodates the ability to work an earlier shift if needed.  Management is always there to help and further the careers of each employee.  They are always willing to talk when someone has a problem, and will listen to ideas as well."
good,"Operate forklift, pick items in warehouse-scan and ship out"
good,Good Company as a whole. Very family oriented. Advancement is ok considering there are stores everywhere.
good,Lowes compared to most retail positions is a fun place to work and the management is typically good but depends on your location. There is a lot to learn and the customers teach you as much as you teach them so new ideas everyday. My coworkers are typical of any other retail store so if you have done it once you have done it twice.
good,"Running a cash register and giving excellent customer service, management is very encouraging and considerate, co-workers are great and caring, the hardest part of the job is seeing great workers leave due to the lack of advancement in the company."
good,"i learn a lot of new things there get to use equipment print tags lear of new merchandise."
good,A typical day of work would involve coming in and looking at the schedule to see if anyone called off for the day. After checking schedule we would converse with the person who was already there unless you were the opener. We would find out what had happened for the day and then start worklists for the cashiers to complete during their shifts. I learned how to run different operating systems while in this position. Some of the co workers were a little hard to get along with and there were times that you felt as though you were in high school all over again. The hardest part of the job is not letting fellow employees bring you down and make you angry. Another part of the job that is hard is trying to get everything done every day without making someone mad somewhere in the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the different kinds of customers that come in from a day to day basis and helping people that had a problem.
good,"Oversaw several departments, at times overseeing the entire store, saw the normal hectic retail environment, but enjoyed working with people and helping them learn more."
good,Oppotunities are available. The time you spend at Lowe's is valued.
good,"•	Taking the initiative to get the truck unloaded by the requested time."
good,"Enjoyed working here, my job was always a challenge.  Management was always considerate of family time.  I was never harassed about needing time off when my kids got sick."
good,"A good business that could be great."
good,"Co workers are great people, easy to work with. Not enough hours provided for job."
good,"- Everyone is very nice to work with"
good,"A typical day at work involves resetting specific areas to a planogram or map.  These planograms are created based on how customers shop in our corporate store.  I was part of a committee that bridged communication between floor associates and managers.  Management was under investigation from corporate for not making the right decisions considering associates.  No communication between managers, no accountability, and favoritism.  It used to not be like that.  But before I left for maternity, it was getting better.  Co-workers liked to work there, although the benefits were not great.  The hardest part of the job to me, is when management asked us to put up freight for a department and expect my team to continue meeting our deadlines on resets.  Most enjoyable part: halloween and Christmas.  I loved assembling the trees and resetting the two aisles for Christmas.  It was long and arduous, but you get to see what all came in before the customers. But more importantly, I love to organize product like that.  I think its fun."
good,"Great Company to work for. Always busy. Wages could have been higher for amount of physical labour required. Choice of shifts. Great staff and very friendly. Great medical, dental benefits and discount card for in store purchases. Very understanding of family/personal issues that arise."
good,It was a good place to work. And helping the customers was even better.
good,"I was able to learn a lot of things in this job. I learned all about running the register, how to help customers, how to do the weekly paper work, etc. It is a great place to work for."
good,"A typical day at work for me consisted of helping people cash out either at a regular register or self-checkout. I learned that no matter what the customer is always right, you do verything in your power to make the customer happy. My co- workers where okay depending on who you talk to and who you get along with. the hardest part of the job was making sure that every customer was happy and the easiest part of the job was to cash them out."
good,"Lowes is one of the highest paying retail jobs. It is also one of the only companies to offer part time employees benefits. If you show that you want to move up in the company, it will happen for you. There is always a chance of moving up."
good,"I would come in every morning to look at the schedule board to find out where I would be working at. I would either be working in the trucks or the sorter. Would then report to breakroom for a short meeting and then go to work. Sometimes you would need help lifting the product onto the truck and you had co -workers that would help you with no problem. Everyone got along fine with one another at work. The hardest part about the job was the summer months where the temperature would get in the high 90's and inside the trucks would be over 100 degrees. This was a hard job but at the end of the day, I felt like i had done my part as a team member of Lowe's Distribution."
good,"I learned all that I could from the different departments, especially the paint and flooring. There were times that I had to juggle three different departments at the same time. From the time I got there until I left it was mostly customer service. The best part was seeing the client happy. The hardest was being alone while covering multiple departments."
good,The company offers great benefits to their employees. better than average wages and always room to grow. It is a fun working environment.
good,"Busy, my day goes fast when the store is busy...love it! "
good,"busy, but really good job"
good,"I would help customers with locating products and checking them out at the register, also stocked and rearranged store. I worked in almost every department and learned a lot about items and products in certain departments."
good,"I've worked with Lowe's for 7 years, and it's a wonderful company to work for. They're very good about making sure their employees are taken care of in many ways. The medical benefits are great. I was lucky enough to have some amazing managers that taught me so many things about being a supervisor, and how to be better at my job. My co-workers were what kept me going if any rough days rolled around. They're amazing people."
good,"Needing more of a work/life balance. Team atmosphere, coworkers and management are great."
good,"They show appreciation to their employees, that makes you want to keep doing your best."
good,"A typical day at work consists of meeting new people, understanding the difference between mission and typical shopping types of customers. I have learned the difference between these different types of customers. The management team works well together as a team to strive for excellent customer service. I have some of the best coworkers I've had in jobs past. I would say the hardest part of my job is learning to sell certain items that I'm not so familiar with. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction with customers and coworkers."
good,"My hours were from 6am to 2pm and in the midst of that times frame I answered phone calls, scheduled deliveries, handled contract workers information, admin work and played head cashier from time to time."
good,"Training, opportunity and level of service are the strong points of working at Lowes"
good,"Love the work, don't love the schedule or the lack of appreciation that goes with the job."
good,Customers come to Lowes with an idea but now sure what it takes to get it done. I step in and bring their idea to life and encourage them  with product knowledge insuring them that their idea will be fulfilled.
good,"Lowe's is a good company to work for, they treat their employees with respect and are always concerned about the well being of their employees.  Generally it is very busy, so you don't get much down time, but managers and department managers always ensured you were given your 15 minute breaks and lunch, regardless of how busy it was.  "
good,"three shifts"
good,"I would come in load all of the days deliveries, make sure that was secure and in place inside the truck. Call the customers to ensure they would be available for said product to be delivered."
good,"A typical day at work consists of phone calls, internet orders, processing orders, refunds, making intercom pages, and placing returns to their designated areas. The management helps us with customers who have problems with orders or items that we as regular employees do not have the authority to make changes to. The hardest part of the job is that we have customers who make violent threats or approach us with awful attitudes and scream at us to do what they want us to do. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting different people of different backgrounds."
good,"Very intense working environment. Really interesting work in most areas,.Oustanding opportunity to work with really earnest hardworking people...Very intense focus on understanding and helping customers. Great opportunity on  managing different personalities and duties"
good,"I have been with Lowe's for almost 8 years, and I can tell you that overall I have truly enjoyed working there. I have moved around the country a lot so the store I am currently at is my 7th Lowe's store. At every location you have your ups and downs, but it is because of the employees that they hire (well most of them) that it is an awesome place to work. They pay well above minimum wage and I highly recommend moving across country several times, because the cost of living increase has really benefit myself. As far as the job, you must enjoy helping customers. With Lowe's the customer is usually right. I would say this is one of the only down falls with the company. They will bend over backwards to make sure every customer is happy. Even if it means giving them a brand new lawn mower, when they original purchased a used one that had been sent out to get repaired. That is just what Lowe's does. It also sucks, after you have been there a while and you are one of the more dependable employees, you begin to get used because you know so much. I am complaining a lot, but the reason I am still there is because they pay me well and the people I work with are like family."
good,"I enjoyed meeting new customers on a daily basis and enjoyed helping them get whatever project or task, they came there for help, accomplished."
good,"These job tested your work ethics and also your customer service background as well as your ability to gain customer relationships with contractors. it also gave you excellent experience in various contract administration functions, including monitoring canceled funds, contract negotiation and using cost and price analysis techniques"
good,"Good place to work, Learned a lot about Housing and renovations while working here. Gave me the ability to lead a large team and support from management was great."
good,Management was easy to work with.  Co-workers were very helpful.
good,Great minimum wage job. A good when wanting to get into the customer service field.
good,"•	Handle customer inquiries, complaints and questions about special orders and material        quality. "
good,Management was always on top of things. Room for advancement was optional. Pay was above minimum but not high $11.50 starting.
good,"As an Installation Coordinator a typical day would consist with calling new customers about installations, installers, vendors and sales person. Data entry was a very important thing for us to do daily, invoices, installation contracts, etc. Management were always hands on and checking on progress of projects and departments. Company is so big you can go down an aisle and see a co-worker that you've never met before. I enjoyed this company very much but the only downside is advancement. At the location I was employed at it was very difficult to advance up into management."
good,"A typical day at work starts out with expecting that it will not be a typical day. In the grand scheme of things it may seem nothing but ordinary but when you look at the intricate issues, problem solving at a moments notice is what the job is about. "
good,"Work 3am - 9am sometimes 1pm. Unload freight truck, load merchandise onto pallets, stock store departments and warehouse, provide customer assistance."
good,"day to day encounter with customers trouble shoot and solve issues, surrounded with knowledgeable co-workers who are always willing to help you when in need. Supportive management staff."
good,"nothing much to say here, co workers are pleasant, pay in pretty good,"
good,"Frist off attend to customers using professional customer service. making myself a daily work list. calling on potentially leads old customers, and making sales."
good,"Check that all office systems are working."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy. My day usually consists of making contact with customers, vendors and installers to coordinate installations. Fielding phone calls concerning current and past installs that may have problems. Gathering merchandise sold for installs so that it is ready for pick up by installers. Filing paperwork. Submitting payment for management approval for installers upon completion of installs. Job site inspections and great customer service in general."
good,"I enjoy my job currently mostly because its so hectic. I like to be busy all the time. I work closely along side management who is always asking me to do extra tasks, which I enjoy. I support the front end by being there for them if they have questions regarding how to deal with a customer. I also work in the cash office where I am responsible for getting the day started with new registers and then following with the daily business folder for the day. I love the people I work with and that's mostly why I've been there for so long, we're all a great team and more like friends than coworkers."
good,"1 hour lunch break"
good,Great opportunity for advancement.  Given all of the training needed to succeed with the company.
good,"Mostly busy which is good makes the day go by faster. There is always something to do. Learned a lot of stuff here and there like key making, plants and landscaping, paint projects mainly anything hardware household wise. Management is 50/50. Unless its life and death situation there not dependable. Working with others is good its a work place so obviously there is time and place for everything if you know how to carry yourself in a working environment then you get along well with everyone. I would say dealing with the customers and figuring right from wrong because the rules always changes and it makes it complicated to know what is policy and what is just convenient for the time being. Having responsibility and learning new things everyday is what makes the job enjoyable"
good,"Good workplace with great management"
good,A hard working company who teach their managers to lead the daily operations of their departments and hold accountability to a high standard of maintaining productive and efficient stores.
good,MOst of the people at Lowe's were great to work with everyday. The job was worthwhile and I felt that i was appreciated by my colleagues for my efforts.
good,"Extremely friendly environment."
good,Hardest part of the job is maintaining good customer service at times when customer traffic is overwhelming.
good,At Lowe's I learned how to lead.  I developed my management style into what it is today.  I learned how to manage different styles of people that may be working together at different levels. All while helping a customer find the right products to make their vision or product come to life.
good,"Great co-workers, management and HR team. I enjoy working with others on a daily basis and forming relationships."
good,"Its never a bad idea to learn more about building/tools/lawncare."
good,"I loved everything about this job, except for the scheduling policy.  It is the company policy to schedule each employee through a cycle of every shift, each week.  This means that your schedule is never the same week-to-week.  This made it very difficult to plan anything outside of work unless you did it a month in advance.  The managers did try to work with you but this policy was not conducive to having a life outside of the company."
good,"I really enjoy interacting with my customers on a daily basis, helping them to resolve their home improvement issues."
good,I love working at Lowe's. We have a team of co-workers that have become like family. We laugh and have fun while ensuring our customers needs are met. Customer satisfaction is our top priority.
good,"Lowe's has really great employees, and I enjoyed working with them, and made some great life-long friends. It's an extremely busy work environment having to deal with several customers at once, and with lack of employees per department, it is extremely challenging."
good,It is a great job which is why I stayed there while I was getting my associates degree. It has given me a good foundation. The people there are a pleasure to work with.
good,"Assist customers, down stock merchandise and clean up. Learning about building materials, cutting wood and driving the fork lift. Co workers are friendly. Hardest part of job is trying to please all the customers. Enjoyable part driving the fork lift and talking with associates."
good,"A typical day at work starts with safety walk first. Then down stocking. I then look at sales stats. Give out tasks to employees. Then its wait on customers. Then I go through and order product. Then we straighten shelves keeping them neat and organized. I have learned to have patience and that you can't do it all yourself, so I delegate well. I have learned that a managers job is the hardest because you have to put on different hats depending on what occurs. I great co-workers who do their jobs because they are trained correctly. I don't have a hard part, but the challenge is that everyday is different so you make a list of notes for the next day knowing there is a chance it will change. Talking with the customers and getting to their level so they understand what you are telling them."
good,"this place is a great place to work especially if you go to school or have other obligations. they gave me a set schedule and if I had any errors with my hours or paycheck they were very quick to correct the issue. they had free breakfast during early morning store meetings. my typical day was mixing paint, restocking supplies, helping customers pick their perfect color, custom matching colors, and help customers find the tools they need to complete home projects."
good,"The Management of Lowes was interested in employee feedback and made many efforts to acknowledge accoomplishments."
good,"I truly enjoy helping individuals that are need of help. Being in recruiting I get to interact with a variety of individuals, from fellow co-workers to the leadership team and potential employees. "
good,Before I started my shift I would clock in at the time clock. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I became an office clerk. I learned how to conduct Western Union transactions and utility payments. I also handled money order purchases and reconciled the cashier tills. When my shift was over I even reconciled the safe. As an office clerk I helped the manager on duty manage the front end. I was left in complete control when the manager went to lunch. The hardest part of the job was making sure the cashiers got there breaks when the store was very busy. There were situations when each cashier had more than 5 customers in there line. During this same time around 10 people would need to do a Western Union transaction.
good,overall a good company to work for if you like a warehouse environment.
good,Great job and great people bad store management no chance for advancement in a fair way applied to so many positions over the course of my time and only got a chance to leave because the current store manager was on vacation he is inexperienced and wants to cut hours to keep money in his pocket if you apply to Lowe's do not apply or try to work at this one choose another location.
good,"Typical day at work consist of a lot of paper and computer work. I learned more about computer literacy. The management was kind of all over the place, communication could have been better. Working with my co-workers could have been better. Hardest part of the job was dealing with rude people all the time. The best part was helping and learning."
good,"Operated POS terminal for customer's purchases; commercial and consumer transactions.  Extended customer service to include:  setup various credit accounts, exchanges and returns.  Maintained appearance of assigned area.  Hardest part when you weren't busy, made time drag.  Enjoyed customer service part, talking with customers."
good,Retail is great if you like people. The changing hours from day to day is not for everyone.
good,"A typical work day involves loading customer merchandise into there vehicle. Provide customer service inside the store with a variety of product sold at Lowe's. Get Special order, Internet order items from the receiving area with the provided information given from customer service associates as well as making sure there are enough carts for the customers. At time you are required to be a cashier. Hardest part of the job is balancing work and most enjoyable when all the associates got along and make it a enjoyable day instead of a stressful one."
good,"I enjoy the work there, I just need to expand my income and knowledge for other skills I have."
good,"There was a lot of room for advancement at Lowe's. I loved my co-workers and the management team. I also think they have a great training program, they make sure you're comfortable before they put you by yourself on the sales floor."
good,"at times coverage was thin so when it was busy good luck finding any help."
good,"Pretty flexible place to work. Management was ok, other associates were nice. The pay is better than most retail."
good,"A typical day at work consist of customer focus making sure that the customers are satisfied when they leave the store so we can keep them coming back to shop with us ."
good,company going through restructuring so no job security other wise good place to work
good,"Every day consists of a similar routine. Walk around the store, fix the shelves, stock when needed, help customers whenever possible. Helping the customer involves not only pointing out where things are, but making sales on anything in the store; specifically for installation. We send out someone to take the measurements necessary and then create estimates around this. Then we work with the customer to make sure everything is how they want it."
good,"Was good. Company has made a lot of changes, getting rid of a lot of people who have dedicated their lives to the company. Loved working there, assisting customer, just under bad management."
good,I will recommend others to work for this company.I enjoy working for this company and was able to learn about varies departments
good,"Lowe's was a great place for me to work at and I would consider them as a future employer if an opening arises. On a typical day at work, I would interact with numerous amounts of customers; some of which I established a friendship with. Some days were hectic and others were calm. No matter how hectic or calm the days were at Lowe's, I enjoyed working there."
good,Good place to work with great benifits & pay. Also good consistent hours.
good,"-With Lowe's I have been with them for three years as there pricing and signage coordinator. "
good,"A day at Lowes starts with greeting and assisting customers."
good,"Came to work five minutes early, I learned how to process checks, the management staff were great very smart and got the job done, I loved working with all of my co-workers, hardest part was dealing with an upset customer, most important part was help seeing the business grow..."
good,"This is a very busy store and the customer base is repetitive so you can really get to know people and help them with an array of projects."
good,"I work a rotating schedule throughout the month, approximately 1/3 early AM's, 1/3 Mid days and 1/3 evenings, works pretty well. I have been able to learn a substantial amount about the retail environment."
good,"A typical workday was usually very busy which was why I liked it, being on the move constantly helps the time go by faster. I also liked the feeling of accomplisment of getting needed work complete. Management and co-workers were enjoyable to work for and with, you can accomplish more when you get along together than not."
good,"As a retailer, it is hands down the funnest place to work. Yes it is a lot of work. The people you work with make it a lot of fun. You get to set department goals and standards that go along with the companies. Management is usually great to work with and open for ideas of improvement. Can't say I like working the holidays. But there is always flexibility to have a day off when you need it."
good,"Responsible for assisting customers with whole project purchases and Knowledge of product use. Getting customer E.T.A. for back orders, Scheduling installations. Training flooring C.S.A."
good,Like any retail shop it has it's detractors but over all a great place to work...fun and lots to learn...I only work part-time but they are still real flexible. My favorite comment is...oh my goodness you're so much better than HD
good,"Lowes has several good qualities for its employees, it has become better over the years."
good,"I have worked in many Lowe's stores, 2 as a direct associate and possibly 100 as an outside representative.  I have seen stores that are a treat to work in, and I have seen stores that were a nightmare for me to do an outside job in.  One of the stores I worked in was a great place to work, and management was wonderful.  The other store I worked in, however, was a nightmare store and quickly found out when I transferred there that that was the wrong store to choose to continue my career in.  Pay is pretty great if you play your cards right."
good,"checking faxes, scheduling installs, and dealing with installer and customer issues in a timely manner."
good,A typical day at work for me is always being on my feet... going from department to another... I work with the nicest people I have ever known...the hardest part of my job is not being able to finish tasks due to the fact that I am usually by myself... the most enjoyable part is when people notice how hard you are working
good,"Like stated before, Lowe's is overall a great place to be employed.  As a full time associate I pretty much have my have full all day servicing customers and replenishing inventory.  I love the people I work with in my Pro Service department, and they are by far the best bunch of people I have known in my working life."
good,"This position is mine since management is moving me to paint department.. flooring is fun.. stressful mostly because of details/contracts with customers..  whomever gets the job will enjoy working with the guys who are in this department. Heavy lifting... carpet cutting.. tile cutting,, BUSY! Management is good and stays on top of you to make sure you are selling installs..  Good luck to everyone!!! Lowe's is an amazing company to work for.. been here almost 5 years!"
good,"i would get to work and clock in and then get to my register. I would greet the customers as they walked in. Answering questions they had before they went shopping. I would ring uo customers items and be friendly while i had their attention. Thank them and tell them to come back soon  i learned to be patient with people and how a good attitude can improve someones day. i learned to deal with money and give correct change.  My co-workers were fun to be around, they were very encouraging. It helped me learn a lot quicker. the hardest part of the job was trying to make a mad customer happy after someone ,ad them mad already. But with a positive attitude, it was done. learning to meet new people and smile was my best experience"
good,its a great job to work at great atmosphere friendly people  in the store highly credible people working in the department to answer customer needs.
good,"While working there, I had a good time. My day started in the ware house, where I would unload product from the delivery truck and place product in its area for separation. I distributed items to its proper location within the store for stocking shelves. I worked for good managers, who were attentive to my needs, and easy to talk to on a daily basis. I got along workers, and with customers quite well.  The hardest part of the job, I would say, is if there was a position that was available, that I would apply for, but had to wait forever, to know whether I was eligible for a particular position.  I enjoyed helping people and listening to what their needs were."
good,"I would say that Lowe's is a great place to work if you are in it for the long hall. Job openings are few and far between when it comes to full time, because all the part timers get fed up and quit. The hardest part of this job, is being patient with the more ""incompetent"" customers. If you have an extreme amount of patience and don't mind when someone has a problem with product, and take it out on you, than you are perfect for the job! The easiest part, is showing a sincerity to your job. It's not hard work, not labor intensive, nor is it a waste. It's a great job, like others, it has it's ups and downs. Give it a shot, have a taste. You may enjoy it."
good,"A typical day at work consists of stocking lumber products, plywood, wooden boards, and concrete. Assist customers with finding various items they may be needing for their projects. I have learned to work in a team, and to make the best use of my time. Coordination and communication are the key items I have learned from this job. My co-workers came in a mixed bag. From hard working, to slow and uncooperative. The hardest part of my job would have to be not having enough people to help me, and to spot me on power equipment. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of my job would be learning something every day."
good,"provide great customer service"
good,I am a cashier and I like working here but I still have room to improve. My job is not secure but I hope to get a raise in my pay soon. The management is alright but you don't get along with everyone. That is life in the workplace but your try which I have been doing since I started working here. I am doing what I am told to do. I just feel that this company needs to be better organized in terms of contract and in terms of employee incentives as well as benefits to employees who have remained with the company for a long time. All and all there is room for improvement with Lowe's but it is a good company to start off with in your working life.
good,"A typical work day is very busy for me - just how I like it.  I have learned the basic outline of retail operations and have a lot more to learn if I choose this path.  I have also learned even more about home improvement and many details that I will take with me."
good,Great people to work with. Most of the employees are laid back people.
good,"I would arrive in scan in merchandise from the RDC truck, scan in any damaged inventory.  Process our RDC truck in  to our inventory, also unload truck when they start arriving in the store."
good,I only was there for seasonal help.  I enjoyed working with everyone and what I was hired to do.
good,"Good place to work at. For most of the year you'll get the hours you want, except late Dec until mid Feb due to snow and less construction, good work environment, most employees are optimistic, only bad thing about it is each person only does one section and we need to apply and interview to work in another section."
good,i enjoyed my time at lowes but i think i have little chances at moving up because so many people have many more years invested in the company compared to me
good,"•	Responsible for handling all customer transactions at the register, bagging customer’s merchandise and at times loading into customer’s vehicle (at their request)"
good,"Typically would take inventory, stock, help customers, research, and place orders for customers. Learned products and uses. worked well with management and my coworkers. The hardest part of the job as a part-time worker, I had to cover for 3 full-time workers. This made it difficult when I had to work on their days off, vacations, and when they called out. Store operation our often started at 6 AM till 9 PM and sometimes interfered with my school schedule. Most times I could work around it but often not. As part time work I also worked all weekends and any time I needed of I had to give a 30 day notice."
good,"The local management can make or break your day. Some were understanding some seen delivery only as an expense. Being in delivery your day didn't have any guarantees and some managers would scold or discipline for getting overtime. Delivery was the only department that had this issue because of the factors that would go into a days worth of work. 10 stops in 5 towns taking things apart to get them into homes and then back together again time added up."
good,"It is always fun to work for a great company as Lowe's, everybody is friendly and coworkers are very easy to talk to and always willing to give their assistance."
good,You will enjoy this job if you love fast paced retail with lots of micromanaging.
good,I like working a lowes because of the hours I get and also because of the people I work with. The entire crew does their job when needed and when help is avaliable they get it.
good,"A typical day at lowes is good. My co-workers are very fun to work with. I learned how to operate a fork lift there, how to use a scan gun. The hardest part is when we have two trucks to unload. the most enjoyable part is knowning that I am providing good product and service to people."
good,Fun and busy place to work.  Part-time employment with flexible schedule was a perfect fit for me.
good,"I enjoyed my experience at Lowe's, I was able to get closer to the customer in their needs and help them find what they came in looking for. I met new people, and assisted in the painting department sometimes, along with my cashiering title."
good,"A typical day at Lowes  I will work the return desk or customer services desk helping customers, answering the telephone, and processing credit card application. The hardest part is sometimes looking for customers receipts in the system when they don't have their tickets and the most enjoyable is helping my coworkers and the customers."
good,"I loved working at Lowe's. My coworkers were awesome, my managers were pretty cool too. I was awesome at working the customer service desk."
good,Fast paced work days with lots to do.  Learned the in and outs of packing trucks and the overall functions of a warehouse.  Co workers were fun and helpful and job can be a handful at times
good,"My typical day at work includes interacting with store personnel and providing the resources for associates to be proficient with their roles. I partner with Human Resources to determine whether or not they have been recent safety incidents (usually if I've been off work for a couple of days) and to find out if any new hires are being processed in. If so, I usually conduct new hire orientation within the week. After that, if I had not touched base with the Store Manager already, I seek the Store Manager out. We discuss business and we usually throw small talk in there as well. Then, I walk into my office and check my email. After I read my emails, I knock out tasks provided to me by Area LP Manager. If nothing new or urgent has been assigned, I do my daily tasks of walking the store monitoring safety and store operations, refund verifications to identify internal theft, train or alert the front end on recent shoplift attempts from local stores or show faces of the store's most frequent thieves. I have learned that everyone learns at a different rate and your approach makes all the difference. I work with the senior management staff who supports my methods to reduce shrink, safety incidents, expenses, and liabilities. The Store Manager treats me like a business partner, not a thorn in their side. The challenging part of my job is time management. You must prioritize and plan what you're going to do before your day starts or else you will fall behind. You pick your battles throughout the day to help build and maintain a culture so your store can make its goals. The most enjoyable"
good,"A typical day includes helping customers address a diverse set of questions regarding lawn and garden projects and maintenance. I learned patience, etiquette with co-workers and customers, customer service philosophy, and management techniques. Management, unfortunately, was largely weak and hard to contact. Co-workers were great! The hardest part of the job was juggling customer and department needs while receiving directives from management and delegating work loads to junior employees. The best part of the job is getting to know/help customers and have fun on the job (while still remaining professional) with co-workers."
good,Sales and Service is key in this business. Most customers are friendly and willing to find what they need to improve his or her household project. Satisfaction is the number one goal in this line of work and thanking the customer and asking him or her to come back again is a must.
good,I enjoyed working with the people I met and I enjoyed my customers even more. I drew great satisfaction from the knowledge that I had helped someone find the things they needed and helped them gain the knowledge they needed to complete their tasks.
good,"A typical day for me involved unloading boxes and taking them on pallets to the store floor. Sometimes I ran into customers who needed help, but it was rare. Communication and patience with my co-workers was one thing I learned to value most doing the job I did. I found it difficult to get my job done when a member of my team called in sick, and the rest of my team and I had to get a job done that require one more worker. The most enjoyable part of the job was developing a relationship with my team members and those who were also in the store whom we helped at times."
good,"a typical day at work was greeting customers as they came thru the doors,helping them find the products they needed.as a cashier i was able to talk to the customers about the projects they were working on."
good,"enjoyed working there,great people only problem was it was temporary.tried several times for a permanent job but could get nothing."
good,When I go to work I get to help the customers on the floor.  It makes my day when a customer leaves happy.  The hardest part about my job is when a customer needs something that we do not sell or we were out of the product.  I enjoy my job very much when I can help a customer get everything he/she needs to do there whole project from start to finish.
good,I like most of the people I work with. Lowe's definitley Pays more than my previous jobs. They base your pay off of expiriance. Thumbs up!
good,"My Experience working for the lowes company was actually great. it was an environment where i could learn from and do a lot of things my way. And that also made it better for me, because i could use the skills i have and also what i've learned."
good,"I have worked as the second hand for home delivery for a few years and have learned a lot working with appliances, customer service, in home installation, using power tools, etc. Many contractors I've worked with are generally nice guys and have great work ethic. This job showed me the values of working with a tight schedule and shows the value of communication, time and multitasking."
good,"A typical day at work is customer service, being knowledgeable about products, and cash handling."
good,This is a good company to start your first job. You meet many different people. Your co-workers are fun people and make the job fun.
good,I was a Lumber associate and I would stock shelves and assist customers with various task from picking the right materials out to loading materials in their vehicle. I learned quite a bit from this job. I further my experience in customer services and I learned about all the different building materials used in building businesses and homes. Management was pretty god they treated all the workers fairly and equally. Hardest part of my job was learning to drive all the different lift trucks and dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I was able to turn an irate customer into a happy repeat customer.
good,Worked In Garden section of the store. Great work experience
good,Am provided much latitude to do independent analyses without someone always looking over the shoulder.  Managers are appreciative of insights found and lessons learned. Are willing to test ideas if you have a well reasoned design and measurement plan. Collaborative work environment.
good,first time with a big box store. I learned a lot about how to track and set up product.
good,"Being a cashier for the most part of my day I help customers ring up their purchases. Working on the night crew, I would mostly stock the store and get it ready for the next day. "
good,You unload and load trucks for deliveries. Process merchandise orders in the computer. Also pull items to stock the stores inventory and for customers.
good,I also have rec.employer of the year. all good do what boss ask . being  patient . do what ask of me.  show and teach others  what I have learn. which may help when down the line.no hard task just be on time. working with others make me smile. i
good,Several managers were getting involved with non management emploees... a little out of hand!
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowes, assiting customers, and working with the crew of employees. I dislike the lack of communication from management."
good,"Worked as a Cashier and Customer Service, Had a good work environment, Trained on Safety. Met alot of different people."
good,Customer service focused company. Fast paced job where you must wear multiple hats every day.
good,"great learning experience, tons of co workers to lean on. I had a set schedule for 8 years so i never had to worry about what time i was coming in because i already knew."
good,"My Typical day includes: assisting customers with selecting and loading materials for projects, down stocking and restocking shelves and essentially doing any thing that needs to get done. It is an enjoyable place to work with a supportive management team."
good,This is a customer service retail environment that is fast paced. There is a lot to learn on a daily basis. Management varies from person to person and store to store depending on the personality of the manager and their management skills. Co-workers are friendly for the most part and easy to get along with and work with. The key with Lowe's is to keep moving at all times and help all customers within 10 feet.
good,"Lowes is a decent place to work, for a while. There is opportunity for advancement, but your management has to recommend you. I had issues with my manager, based upon my sexual orientation (straight), and she would not recommend me for management."
good,Overall Lowe's is a good company to work for but it has its challenges as well as far as trying to provide great customer service when you have customers yelling at you out of frustration.
good,wonderful place i hated to have to leave to find something closer to home.
good,"I give Lowes an over all star of 4 out of 5 as my co workers were great and I loved most aspects of my job, especially helping the customers."
good,"Any retail job can be frustrating, but if you're a customer service oriented individual, Lowe's is a great place to be. They really emphasize customer service, and push an associate to come out of his/her shell and engage the customer. This is also a fast-paced environment, so you will need to have a comfortable pair of shoes and become accustomed to a lot of walking. Your assistant store managers can be a bit demanding, but as stated earlier, they push you to do your best. Over all, a great company to work for if you can keep up with a rotating schedule, heavy lifting and fast environment."
good,i enjoy working  for lowes im just seeking full time employment
good,"The management at this company really were on the same level as their employees. They were understanding that life is sometimes difficult and they are willing to work with you no matter what gets thrown at you. They offer numerous programs that are immediately available to employees, including part time employees."
good,Stable environment although managers require more than need be
good,"As a cashier at Lowe's in my area, your duties are usually restricted to handling purchases, payments and maintaining the inventory and end-cap displays near your register. As for the job itself, it isn't much different from cashiering in any other retail store, aside from the bonus of not having to sign customers up for credit cards. That alone, was one of the big reasons why I accepted the job offer because they don't base your performance or how many hours you'll receive because of how many credit lines you process. There are other programs (like the myLowe's program card and Extended Purchase Plans) that they would like for you to sell but they won't dock your hours if you don't meet a certain percentage of sign-up's. "
good,"Exciting career with job advancements, head cashier training, as well as transfers within the store."
good,Great Place To Work people friendly and flexible with your everyday life 
good,"While working at Lowe's over the last several years, I have learned a lot of skills and knowledge about everyday items. I have also learned a lot about account receivable and payable and admin work. "
good,"fun work place"
good,"steady work flow, learned alot about patience and how to work the register. management is great there is always alot of managers around to help. the hardest part of the job would be customers and some of there attitudes. the most enjoyable part of the job would be the employees."
good,"corporate schedules 5:00 am"
good,"For me personally, the coworkers made this job one in a million. We all work together for the most part. I've learned a lot from this job, I'd learned how to deal with every customer situation you could possibly imagine. However, being a Head Cashier is very taxing. There's a million things you have to do on a daily basis, and that's every single day. There are no ""lazy"" days."
good,"Lowe's is a good company to work for. Their main focus is Customer Service. We worked as a team to make sure that every customer that visited our store was treated with respect and that their needs were met. The management at my store was what I would expect in management. they were willing to be walking the store and helping the customers along with their employees. I would have to say that the hardest part of my job was the constant changing of the schedule, sometimes working till eleven at night to come back in at six in the morning. Being able to get to meet new people and grow a relationship with our regular customers is what I really enjoyed about being apart of the Lowe's family."
good,"Over a 5 year time I moved up quickly from a Customer Service Associate to a Salary area manager supervising portions of work within 8 stores.  "
good,I have worked at Lowe's for three months now and absolutely love it.  I started out as seasonal and now I am part time.  The people I work with are great and are knowledgeable of the department they are in.  
good,Overall Lowes is a great company to work for. However competition is stiff and if you want to advance you have to make it known and make sure plenty of upper management including market managers know who you are and what you do for your store or market.
good,"  Worked as a customer service supervisor "
good,Great work environment and nice and easy-going co-workers. Assisted in stocking supplies as well as providing customer service to customers to help find their supplies. 
good,"It is rarely a dull moment.  Always on the move with constant interactions with management, supporting teams, co-workers, and most of all customers.  I work alongside another specialist and it has proven that teamwork is mandatory in order to succeed.  On a daily basis I am solely running the department from four to six hours, dealing with demanding customers, delivery logistics, installations, and providing support for management and vendors.  Stress can be high and patience is a must.  It is the enjoyment that I receive from the empowerment, the involvement, and the development I provide to Lowe's on a day to day basis that keeps me going back every day with a smile on my face.  "
good,Morning meetings every morning. Very routine for those of us who open the store. Management walks the store an makes there adjustments and changes to departments. Pretty decent place to work. 
good,"Working at Lowe's is great i enjoyed meeting new people and having fun with my co-workers, What i have learned at Lowe's that retail is not the job for me. I don't see myself making a career out of Lowe's, there benefits does not fit my needs and also the pay is good but the hours are not for me. I feel the people that are managers are cool, but they need to really show team effort and not talk about it show action. Dealing with managers and just the environment of the job is hard, meaning pay, hours, benefits, and also managers is the hardest thing about the job, but me and my co-workers try to make a negative into a positive when we are around each other at work."
good,"Lowe's is a good company to work for . Some days are slow and some days are busy. I have learned how to mix all paints, cut carpet, cut glass, thread pipe, cut keys. My managers are wonderful to work for and co-workers are always willing to help. The hardest part about this job is not having enough hours to make ends meet. I  think the best part of this job is making sure all your customers get what they need and are happy with their products."
good,i love working at lowes and i love the job just don't love the pay i have a wife and 3 kids i need more income or the perfect part time job.
good,Every  manager one has favorites but at the end of the day we are all family working towards a common goal
good,"Worked with contractors all day long,and also callled on customers,all day long meeting new accounts every day,great co-workers,making sure customer was happy"
good,"The reality of retail is always odd hours, where you will open at 5am one day and close till 12am. the next. If you can have flexible hours it provides a great opportunity for those that work hard. "
good,"after being with lowes for five years,  they have forgotten family values.  Its nice having one regular weekend off a month saturday and sunday and having a regular corporate schedule and rotation, but making an associate work 6 closing shifts in a row makes it hard to spend time with family.  People arn't held accountable for there actions like they should.  Managers tend to just look the other way when something unethical happens and makes others in the store feel uncomfortable."
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's because most of the people who worked there were friendly and willing to help one another. Its got its rough spots like everywhere else, but overall it was a good experience. while I was there I learned different things about home improvement from paint to lumber to gardening and plenty in between.The only reason I stopped working at Lowe's was they couldn't work with my class schedule for summer semesters. I would've tried to apply for another position had they been able to get back to me about the conflict before the day I started class even though I had put in the request over a month prior, as well as asking about my schedule and putting in 2 more identical requests during the month of May."
good,There is not many opportunities to move up. I have been trying to move up for the last few years and hasn't been able to. 
good,Lowes is always striving to be the best at whatever they do. The appreciate their employs by providing bonuses and incentives. I learned so many things about retail and the co-workers are fun and loving. 
good,"There is no ""typical"" day in retail.  Each day presents new challenges and experiences.  In order to do your job as a front end supervisor you must be firm, friendly, be able to make decisions quickly and most of all, have a smile on your face at all times. "
good,"Lowe's is a good company to work for and there are a lot of really diverse people there. Most of my coworkers help out whenever they're needed and a lot go out of their way to help others; including management. The job is good, but standing/walking on concrete all day is a bit of a pain. I enjoy working with the customers and being able to help them out with their home needs. "
good,"Lowe's was a great company to work for. The benefits for full-time employees were better than most. A typical day was spent answering phones, assisting customers, and cashing customers out. There was a lot of change in the management while I was there, so it seemed that everyone was always giving a different answer as they were learning. I greatly enjoyed the people I worked with and am still close with some of them. The hardest part about working at Lowe's was that I never had a set schedule, so it was difficult to plan ahead. I did enjoy that I was able to move around  some and got to spend my day dealing with the public."
good,"Fun workplace, daily communication with employees while walking the sales floor, ensuring customer engagement."
good,Working at lowes was fun however it can be stressful if you can't handle standing for long periods of time. 
good,There was something exciting happening every day. You got to meet a lot of interesting people and I enjoyed helping the customers! I had my hand in each department in some way and I learned a lot. 
good,"A typical day at work involves arranging bank deposits and setting up   registers and the administrative end of the store for business. I have learned so much about sales and how the clerical side of business is ran. Management at lowes is spectacular, The chain of commands is how issues are dealt with and it makes it effortless to get problems solved. Coworkers at lowes are great people, we are more like a small community more than anything. The hardest part of working at lowes use to be the hours, but after establishing my position it has gotten easier. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people every day. "
good,"Lowes' really tries to foster the ""Team Player"" atmosphere. Unfortunately......ehhhh.....everybodys' never played a team sport in there life. They don't know what that is?! But once you find the couple of people who are about their work, and have a genuine care about where they work.......stick with them."
good,Lowe's is a good company to work for a top 50 company.  The company management is always looking to promote within.
good,helping other departments stocking and replenishing did customer service worked in the return area putting all returns away
good,Day at work customers come first and do your day to day duties. Learned my first level of management. The team of management was a great lead team i learned alot from them. coworkers turn into long friendships. 
good,There was nothing I did not like about my Job with Lowes. Pleasant atmosphere and awesome team members. Everytime I needed help with something a Coach or TM were always there to help. The job does  come with alot of lifting but along the way I was taught easy ways to get what seemed like impossible jobs done with ease. I also noticed after only a short time of being there that TMs and Coaches from other departments remembered names quickly and were all very helpful when needed too. 
good,"From my experience, it's all who you know at Lowes. There were a lot of cousins, aunts, uncles, in laws- everyone knew each other. If you don't get in good, you may be in trouble because it's a very tight knit community. With any work environment, there is gossip, and I would be weary of this- I saw a lack of professionalism whilst working here."
good,"I started as a cashier,proceeded to a stock person,and ended in the RTM clerk position. I gained many experiences and friends along the way in this job and enjoyed the rtm clerk position. I was responsible to get credit for the store on returned or defective items to help their bottom line."
good,Great place to work and learn customer service. Team work oriented tasks help the job go smoothly
good,"Receiving and Stocking for the entire store and distribution, to customers."
good,great work environment. Learned about how to take care of my Home Improvement needs.
good,Typical day at work was helping customers and giving them a good ending experience.
good,Was cashier and also helped as a loader. Day to day i would check people out at the register and often help them load there stuff.
good,"First day was hard not knowing anyone, but everyone was helpful and always find me answers to my questions.The only hard part was not knowing if you can keep on task, for exsample you are ask to fix the flower display.When do so another teamleader ask you to do something else, then another and so on.It came to a point when the end of my shift was coming im rushing back to what i started at the start of my shift."
good,"I was one of five, out of 135 employees, who actually had construction experience, consequently, I was called all over the store to solve problems and answer questions. I felt like I was being pulled in a million directions most of the time. When I became frustrated from time to time, it didn'[t feel like management cared. Over all, it was an excellent place to work"
good,"I love working there some days and other days it was a horrible place to work. It really has do with the mood of the managers there, if they are in a good mood, there is a laid back setting that helps you get work done and help customers more effectively. When they are in a bad mood, we are normally rushed to get things done and customers normally feel that in the tone of our voice and movements because we have to get things done and are not able to assist them as much as we would want to."
good,I was a sales associate and cashier. The hardest part of the job was getting off late and going to class at 8AM.
good,the most enjoyable part of my job is taking care of the customers and interacting with new people and building a rapport with returning customers.
good,Management is usually understanding and job is secure. Just work hard and you will be fine.
good,A typical work day at lowes was pretty laid back. I really enjoyed all the costumers and their dogs they would sometimes bring in. Sometimes the hardest part was we were just so slow sometimes with not much to do.
good,I enjoy Lowes however I am not getting full time hours on a regular basis. I usually get 32 to 39 hours per week.
good,"Learned the aspects of retail, customer engagement"
good,"Good job security, room for advancement if a hard worker. Great people to work with. Deacent managment, the heavy lifting is expected of all employs but not to the point of over exertion. Dificult to learn to drive a reach lift."
good,"Fast paced work with customers in many different aspects such as paint, appliances, millwork, plumbing. It would go up and down with how busy it was. Customers were key. We had good breaks and hour long lunches on a full shift"
good,get no hr's will never get anywhere workin with this company if lookin for fulltime job
good,I unload the store truck every day. I learned how to use power equiptments and alot of hardware items we sell. The management is good they care about the employees. The hardest part of the job is unloading big appliances bt the most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers.
good,Great place to interact with the community. Lots of opportunity to wow the customer
good,I was the sales specialist for the plumbing department. It was my job to manage three sales associates in our department. I was also responsible for the daily inventory reports and weekly budget reports. I was responsible for keeping our department in the top three sales for our store in the district and top ten for the region. I maintained and was responsible for the displays and marketing for the department.
good,"Typical day working at lowes is rather enjoyable. The company is great and managment for the most part is wonderful. Hardest part of the job is the down time. The off season clearly isnt the bussiest but you make do. Ive learned a great deal more about registers,customer service,and merchandising."
good,"Lowe's is a safe and secure company to work for with average compensation and benefits. There is a lot of frustration in dealing with a corporation that takes a long time to implement meaningful change, especially during hard economic times such as this."
good,I worked there for 5 years with no complaints. Its a great place to work.
good,"All in all it was a good place to work, Very Clean, Safety First. Well organized. Receiving store item all day 10 hrs. at a rate of approx. 100 pieces an hr. @ 50-75 lbs. each. That was also the hardest part of the job, Very physically demanding. Co-workers where great, The people where the best part of the day."
good,Friendly coworkers
good,It was a fast pace job. I learned a lot about building supplies and meet a lot of nice people.
good,"Lowe's was steady from opening to closing, contractors are in and out multiple times a day buying supplies. I learned how to operate all aspects of customer service. I trained new employees on self check-out and assisted Head Cashier's with registar closeouts. Management/coworkers all worked together to make Lowe's a friendly and customer happy store. The hardest part of my job was when certain personalities didn't mesh problems would arise. The most enjoyable part of my job was the teamwork our store had."
good,friendly work environment and very nice co workers. A fun place to be
good,I would go into work not knowing what was going to happen that day as far as business was concerned. It was fun yet at a fast pace that you lost track of time.
good,My position at Lowe's as an assistant to the store manager taught me many valuable lessons but none more important than knowing your employees. Not that knowing your employees is a difficult task but a time consuming and required endeavor for any manager. Having these skills allows any manger to lead from the front which will be recognized by your subordinates.
good,"Al llegar, revisar el pasillo de persianas , que la mercancía tuviera precio, el acomodo, la limpieza, revisar pendiente de presupuestos para clientes, o atender a clientes que necesitaran de información de productos. Aprendí desde como nace una empresa de ese giro, hasta la atención personalizada, y que el cliente ya solo me buscaba para poder darle esa atención. Si hay un poco mas de cuidado con los compañeros, existe mas la competencia, por las ventas, por subir de puesto, pero si todos con respeto nos tratamos, los difícil del trabajo fue aprender lo que no sabia, etiquetado, planogramas, era algo nuevo para mí. A veces salía una hora mas tarde, pero me encantaba por que era estar haciendo una venta, simplemente atender al cliente o cortando persianas."
good,Great place for students to work. They work with your schedule to ensure that school comes first. I rarely had trouble getting off time school related or not. If you work hard and do what needs to be done they will treat you well. Pay raises are unpredictable and appropriate factors are not considered.
good,working at lowes there was always something to do like stocking shelves or assisting customers.
good,"I work pretty hard for Lowes, but in the last year or so the benefits of the job have disappeared. Also I feel there is no room to move upward in the company, as they would rather have a lackluster employee they can pay less than a well trained knowledgeable employee they would have to pay decently."
good,"Good stock option program. Company has good Core Values. Worked at various stores, some more enjoyable then others due to management."
good,good place to work could improve on upper management training on how to treat employees but over all fun place to work
good,"unloading & loading ltl trucks, drive forklifts,how to recive product in to store stock.my manger was a very good to his employeds."
good,"Lots of training, emphasis on safety. Wages are OK for duties, however they cap employees wages after 3-4 years."
good,"The Managment Where I work, for the most part, is down to earth and fair. Typical days are slow and sometimes boring. The pay and benefits are a little better than average compared to the benefits offered by other retailers that I've worked for. I work with a lot of great people and am thankful for that. Turn-over is very high at my store and we have a couple managers who I am uncomfertable around. Store manager is nice and down to earth. the most enjoyable part of the job is that I always learning something new."
good,"Overall great atmosphere, team perspectives within company with advancement and great benefits."
good,There is no such thing as a typical work day. Every day is different. Management was very hard to get along with cause there were so many of them so rules and what was expected of u would change daily.
good,"Reviewing purchase orders, customer service, stocking frieght, coordinating with others to complete tasks. Maintaining and merchandising live plants. Utilizing forklift, and computer multiple computer systems."
good,My daily day of work was processing returns and working closely with the RTM Clerk to make sure that returns were able to become buybacks.
good,"on a typical day i would write work lists for the customer sales associates, answer phones, assist customers, put away stock using power equipment, and on occasion run register. I learned how to be a good salesman and how to use the lowes computer programs for sales and service. Management was much better than many of the places ive worked in the past and since. The hardest part of the job was when our coworkers took lunch and you had to cover more than 1 department, but it was also a welcomed challenge. the most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with and the job atmosphere itself."
good,"While working i helped customers, gathered carts, ran fork-lifts, pulled orders, loaded heavy loads."
good,"Great place to work for people who has older kids or no kids, schedule is always non consistent"
good,I thoroughly enjoy working with people and a typical shift at Lowes entails serving customers at a high level and stock control/merchandising.
good,Enjoy working with the Contractors who come in to purchase merchandise. Like the shift that I work.
good,Good place to work. Learning products and working with
good,As long as you get your work done on time there is little to none micromanagement.
good,Lowes is a professional place to work with a keen eye on customer service and interaction. Management was professional but fair. Nice place to work. Decent pay and benefits. I was only seasonal and had hope a position would have open up in my department but did not. They make sure you are safety compliant and well educated in any area you work.
good,Good company to move up and make a career out of. Lot of leadership among staff to always lend a helping hand.
good,"Helped customers find items, helped customers load, took their payments, went out on deliveries, Learned how to run the machines, taking care of the customers to have them come back"
good,I was the General manager and like most management I worked many hours to maintain high level of customer service and day to operations
good,"Worked in electrical department while going to school for electrical. Great environment, good co-workers, good atmosphere, clean store."
good,Your day basically consists of helping customers and putting up freight. I learned allot about dealing with the general public and team work. Most of my co-workers were fun and easy to get along with. Hardest part of job would have been the physical requirements.
good,Lowe's is very good for starting out and gaining experience in different trades. They allow you the ability to obtain multiple licensing for better opportunity.
good,call on customers about there special orders
good,"Great place to work, just looking for different experience and new challenges."
good,"I enjoyed working here, I gave my all for 9 years. When the CEO changed so did the concern for the employees. When I needed to move for personal reasons Lowe's did not transition me into a job but required me to ""apply and interview"" for a position, which is their new process. I do not believe it is good customer service to chase out the knowledgeable people."
good,I enjoyed working fast pace place. I learned many different things from plants to hardware.
good," Supervised associates in the selling effort, ensuring the store’s in-stock position, and maintaining an appealing and organized store appearance"
good,"Overall, as a company, Lowes have a great relationship with its employees and customers. There are many opportunities for advancement in management and on-going training programs. On of the best parts is that it is like working with family."
good,"I have worked for this company through the highs and lows. They have continued to take care of their employees; annual raises, employee lunches, and an annual employee appreciation day. That is impressive."
good,"Cashing out customers at my designated register, helping customers with questions/concerns, training via computer on my down time and learning about the company and it's values. Management was fair. My co-workers were always there when i needed them and gave me the space to learn what I needed to on my own as well. The hardest part was trying to figure out what department I wanted to work in and the best part was helping others, everyday."
good,A typical workday is a long 8-14 hour shift depending on the project my crew is involved in. Day to day this will change. I would travel from store to store every day of the work week. I have learned a lot from the time i started and now (7 years). I think this company has issues with promoting employees. I think they need to think more about the best person rather than who they already have in their own mind.
good,Lowes is certainly a wonderful company to be part of. Excellent benefits.
good,i got a lot of customer service and hands on learning. Learned a lot of departments.
good,great place to learn managment and start your carrer in the retail inviroment
good,"Never had nothing to do in this store (which isn't a bad thing) I learned how important customer service is, how far you need to go to meeting someone's needs. Management typically was fair to good, some bad managers out there but few and far between (at assistant store level and higher positions), Co-workers where fun, and very friendly. Hardest part about the job was to deal with so many different things that people wanted you to do. Most enjoyable thing about the job was the fact that there was always plenty to do."
good,"Has plenty of training options, plenty of room to advance, great benefits and 401k plan great Holiday and Vacations."
good,"A typical day at Lowe's is to greet customers, learn a new thing everyday, and have fun. The management there were very professional and awesome to be around as well as the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was to learn new things about hardware and answer questions about particular items. It was a fun place to work with a light-hearted atmosphere."
good,"down stock and help customers, friendly co-workers. lack of skills in some associates, most people just show up to collect a pay check"
good,was a gerewat place to work has changed alot sence i worked there had good benifits but has changed now enjoyed working at lowes
good,"Very enjoyable place to work. I've expanded my knowledge of building products, how to service customers better. Management is nice but a lot of infighting and miss communication. I love helping customers with projects and running the heavy equipment to service customers."
good,Working with customers and with fellow co-workers
good,"Started my interest in Asset Protection Management. Advancement is okay, just not at the store I was at. Customer Relation is excellent"
good,"i like going to work , you learn alot not just one think and you have to treat the customers with all respect because its mainly about them. the hardest about the job is when customers get mad . but other than that i like working , im a hard worker."
good,working for lowes was ok if you like the retail environment ...
good,first think i do is to see if any of the daytime stocking crew needs help with their work. then when im finshed with that i make sure that the front of lumber is cleaned up for the daytime rush. then i go to meet the store manager or any MOD to see if they have anything in the store that needs to be done. when i finish what they have for me to do. i go back to help cusomers with anything they need. and for the rest of my day i help load customers and help lumber out with their deprt. and making sure that lumber has carts avalble for customers to use and at the end of the day i clean the parking lot is cleaned up.
good,was a nice place to work great people the store had management issues. 3 store managers in a year. no leadership
good,"I learned new things at Lowes every day, from new and old products within or outside of the company. Loved to work with my co-workers, not only were they individuals i worked with, they were like family."
good,"I joined Lowes as a team member January of 2010. I came in with goals and expectations for myself. I was a individual contributor to my store's regional rank increase. I deveolped associates while maintaining a professional work relationship. I was co-captain of Lowes Voice Team, helping to build the morale and increase productivity through out the store.I learned many things such as day to day operations, selling techniques, installation processes, and more. There is nothing impossible to learn, you determine your own destiny. The best part of my job was watching asscoiates develop and gaining customer loyalty."
good,the most enjoyable part of my job was working with good friend; but a typical day at work started with bringing down some lumber and putting trucks up that were in the back at the same time help and service all customers in my department. my co-workers were always helpful especially those that been there along time helped learned new and better ways to handle a task given to me.
good,Stocked and operated a forklift- I had no problems with management- I liked working there- my schedule was good. I really can't think of a part of this job that was too hard for me.
good,A great place to work because of the benefts and quarterly bonuses.
good,"A typical work day goes by fairly smoothly because I work part time right now, when I was a Department Manager it was a little more hectic and unpredictable but not at all bad. I have learned to work will with my co-workers when team work is need and my management staff is moderately supportive even though it took awhile for some of them to reach out to employees. Fortunately, I can't say anything is terribly difficult about my current position aside from going on vacation and having a pile of things to do afterwards. The most enjoyable part of my job is simply that I actually enjoy being at work."
good,"All days are different, you deal with different people and their needs.My job consists of being on your feet most of the day. I have learned that retail is hard work. It has given me a greater appreciation for having integrity and respect for other people when I go into a store to shop. I have also learned that I have to set the atmosphere in my workplace and draw people into it, not let others draw me into theirs. The management team is very good, they are willing to work with schedule changes, My co-workers are are all different ages, and I love them all. We all work well together as a team. The hardest part of the job is having to down stock the heavy blinds. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with people. I am a positive person and I like making a difference in the lives of people, even if I just give them a smile."
good,"Lowe's is good place to work. It's retail so you're on your feet a lot so buy a great pair of shoes. I worked in Lawn and Garden. We had to do a lot of heavy lifting, use power equipment daily and do a lot of full scale resets. We definitely kept busy."
good,I enjoy working here. It has been a great place to work while I attended college and they have been flexible toward my school schedule. I would prefer to find a position in the field I chose for my career. Preferably in the Justice System or related fields like Emergency Management. I am looking for experience in these fields so that I can grow in my career.
good,"Lowe's is a fast-paced leader in the home improvement retailer sector, with lots of day-to-day customer interaction. Those most successful with the company are self-motivated and sales driven, with the ability to multitask and go the extra mile to ensure customer repeat business by utilizing all the tools and programs offered by the corporate office. This is a rewarding career with much opportunity for advancement, the only downside being that long, irregular hours and rotating shifts can make achieving balance between work and personal life difficult. Sacrifice is a must."
good,"Best part of Lowe's is the people, without a doubt. Most of my days are spent working on project to indentify cost savings, and increasing efficiency in the supply chain. Toughest part of the job is changing old ways of thinking and working within the confines of existing infrastructure. Best part of the job is making a different that is quantifiable – and at the end of the day feeling like you’ve accomplished something. Overall Lowe’s is a great place to work !"
good,Working here does has its ups and downs just like with any job. But you do learn good work values and develop fast friends with all of the great associates.
good,"Customer service desk did the credit applications, credit payments, special order returns (difficult), dealt the most with all of the managers, also received the bulk of the negative with unhappy and screaming mad customers. You have a lot of responsibilities and if you are unlucky, you deal with folks that are good at walking away from the desk when they really should not."
good,"Lowes is a good place to work. They have very good benefits for full and part assoicates. You will be getting trained in every department that you work in. You will do alot of walking, working with customers throughout the stores. You are able to make friends with customers, cause must of them shop there alot."
good,Would not let me finish sales by making me do things that were not in job desription
good,Meeting new people daily and helping with their selection was fun.
good,Typical day consist of assisting customers
good,This is a eye oping job I have work in retail before but it has changed and it is a good changed with all the new day and age it is moving in the right way.
good,"It was hard work but a lot of fun in the garden center. Advancement was available and they have great 401k, stock options, and health insurance"
good,I do enjoy my store and the people I work with. I have only worked at one store for almost two years but it has been a great experience. Lowe's is going through a lot of changes to keep pace with the future and internet sales and nobody is really sure how good it will be or not.
good,"I've worked for Lowes for a year, its a nice place to work the employes are friendly customers are customers. depending on who you talk to most managers listen. sometimes if feels like a giant highschool again but Lowes makes sure that you are happy."
good,"It doesn't take much at Lowe's to get into a position to make $30k a year. Management is almost too relaxed, they are kinda handcuffed when it comes to actually getting all employees to perform their best. Hours are terrible."
good,great pay in certain job titles good environment had fun working there
good,"I have had the opportunity to work at this RDC. The people you work with are top notch and after spending anywhere between 10-14 hr days with them, they become more like family. But as with most companies, the bottom line tends to over-shadow the morale. Having worked there for 6 years, people were treated well, benefits / bonuses / pay were top notch, but when the Heads came in from corporate, the whole atmosphere changed, not because corporate was bad, but because everyone panicked. The business is simple, move a box from point A to point B, yet it was a stressful job. The standard operating procedure seemed to change constantly and rather than coming to a conclusion to fix the problems, off-the-cuff rules were changed constantly. People burned out quickly and there seemed to be a gap between upper management and the supervisors/front-line workers. It was a great place to work and the tight-knit group is unsurpassed, but be prepared to put out fires."
good,"Each store has its own culture, which will change each time they change the general manager. My time included working in two different stores with two demographics and nine different managers. I enjoyed working with four out of the nine. Some manage by intimidation and the others involved their store personnel to interact in giving help to all of the new employees and were open to suggestions."
good,Was a great company too work for but after three years and having a child it wasn't the company for me. I wasn't able to move out of my cashier title which was difficult for me.
good,The store I worked at had a very good mix of people that strive to give the best customer service available.The places to advance and training was great.
good,very safety concious and they really like to make the costomer feel exceedingly satisfied with their service. great company to work for in my opinion.
good,"Working for Lowes is a unique experience, Day after day I learn something new, But the number one fact that is proven is the customer is always right. Making sure the customer is happy is my main concern. Its not so much as treating them like a customer, its treating them like a person with concerns, As we build relationships we build long lasting, faithful customers."
good,Enjoy working for a large national company but starting to go through rough times with current economy and job security has fallen off quite a bit.
good,I enjoyed doing my job helping cashiers when they needed help.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Lowes. I liked the hours I worked and the department as well. I was very good at my job, hard working, productive, delivered results. I liked how it was fast paced, and I always had something to do. I have very great customer service skills, and am adaptable. The only problem I had was poor store management. Other than that I loved my job at Lowes."
good,"I had a pretty good experience at Lowe's. The opportunities are there to advance as long as you're willing to do the computer training available there and you make them aware of your intent to advance. I had a good experience with most managers except for the store manager as she at times did not speak appropriately to associates. Apart from that, just be willing to apply yourself and I feel you would have a good experience."
good,I enjoyed my time thee and would probably still be there but a peraonal issue prohibited relocation and a 2 hour (1 way) commute wasn't working.
good,Prioritizes safety and customer satisfaction in a retail environment that often requires heavy machinery. Good benefits after you work there for a certain amount of time.
good,Going with the flow is a skill needed here as it's an ever changing canvas. Team work is essential  along with excellent customer service skills. Carry your load.
good,"I was able to always keep busy and continue making Lowes a better place to shop. "
good,"Lowes is a customer oriented company based on satisfying the customer and taking care of all needs the customer may face. I place orders, call customers and ensure that whatever the customer may be worrying about will be taken care of in a timely manner."
good,I like working there and I get along with my co-workers really well. I have learned a lot of life skills from working at this job.  I love the fact they give you the opportunity to move up in the company.
good,Good management. Very safety orientated. Laid back people for the most part but a fast paced job most days. All in all very low stress job. Just clock in and do what you're supposed to and clock out.
good,Lowe's offers a good work environment. They Are willing to teach you and help you grow. On the job training and tuition programs to help you learn and achieve your goals.
good,"I've only been with the company a short amount of time, but I've already seen several restructurings and positions eliminated or changed.  I understand why the company is doing these things, but it severely affects employee morale, their livelihoods, and gives uncertainty for the future of their careers.  Outside of that, if you are flexible, there's lots of opportunities to grow and move up in the company.  My managers and peers have been great to work with."
good,"Great environment very friendly people to work with, I learned a lot very fast pace gave to be able to pick things up quickly an be willing to give 100 percent at all times."
good,Daily activities were was a good challenge. Keeping customers happy was a priority for me due to the volume. Every day was a learning experience for me.
good,Good work/life balance but PTO could improve. Management is usually respectful of family situations and when you are ill. Vacation time is not quite as long as most other corporations in the area. I would also like for us to be able to work from home 2 to 3 days/week.
good,"The training was fairly helpful for me, but it depends on who they assign you to and how much they care. So much of the learning came from time and experience. From understanding product information to how to handle customers, the more time you spent there the better you were at it."
good,Supervisor wasn't the best as it is he left early when not supposed to and i was hired through people ready and do not recommend people ready at all they worked for lowes which i loved otherwise the are ridiculous and held my same day pay for 3 mnths from working at walmart in Monroe
good,"Very good place to shape one's knowledge level. Fair advancement opportunities in the work place. Medical benefits are too expensive and still need to pay co pays,Culture is well built, implementation always subject to who is managing store."
good,Good knowledgeable associates. Friendly customer service. Associates are willing to help each other in tasks to make sure the goal outcome is a successful.
good,"I believe that my time at Lowe's taught me a lot about which materials were better for specific types of construction projects. Along with this, I also learned about pricing for many of the materials, and great customer service skills that will benefit me in my future career in Construction."
good,Enjoy meeting and helping people in the community. The management was sometimes to work with when it came to scheduling time with family and vacations.
good,The best thing would be the between the benefits and the hours you get but beinf a PSA at Lowe's is fairly rewarding. There's been alot of encouraging people to help me along the way and that's  been on of the most motivating things about the job.
good,"A fairly fast paced work place. Depending on the department you may end up covering or assisting in nearby areas. It offers a little flexibility on where you work. You're not locked in one area for your whole shift. As above, biggest mistake was leaving. Employee pay is just above minimum wage however."
good,I have worked here for a few years now and I have enjoyed my experience and the opportunity. The management has always treated their employees and I very well. We work as a team to meet customer needs and expectations in a professional and fun way.
good,"Like any retail job, it can be frustrating at times, but management and other co-workers have always been there to help me out whenever I get stuck or overwhelmed."
good,Managers talk down to you. It use to be a decent job before the manager that was there that cared left. But the new store manager discriminates hes trying to keep all Hispanics in there and nothing else. He makes his own rules up..  he puts people in certain positions but dont interview no one else for the job.
good,"Worked with caring and committed people. I was provided all the tools I needed to flourish and succeed."
good,"The best part of working at Lowe's for me was that you aren't stuck doing the same thing every day and can assist in other departments depending on need. I also learned a lot about our products and their uses in several facets I had little knowledge of before. I had an issue with management not keeping their word on the company's advancement policies and never received the raise I was promised, otherwise I would still gladly be working there."
good,"I love my job! I get to cultivate relationships with not only my coworkers and the installers that do jobs for us but also the customers we're serving. Also, the environment within the store, no matter which store I'm in, feels like a family and that is the best. We also, as a company, give back to the community, which is close to my heart. All in all, Lowe's is a great place to work."
good,A good company to work for with lots of advancement opportunities. A company that has a good work life balance an is able to work with your schedule to a good degree.
good,I dealt with a coworker disagreement throughout the time that I worked there. Higher level management did not seem to be worried about the toxic work atmosphere that their quarrels created.
good,Not too strenuous work environment. The managers try to help make sure you understand what jobs you must complete on a regular work day. The hardest part of the job is sometimes you need to help customers in departments that you do not work in.
good,okay place to work but you are kind of a cog in a machine but there is upward mobility if you want to stay and put in a few years. some great managers some are okay but in my position i didn't care for the job i was asked to do.
good,"When I began my career at Lowes they had just launched a new program for interior installed sales. The position was exciting, as I had meetings both in ,and out of the store. I was the front man and liasion between the homeowners, contractors, and vendors. There were several moving parts that made the program a success at my store, however the company decided to drop the program after about five years."
good,My manager was great and was always available to help. Enjoyed working with home owners and making selections based on budget. Management supported family life.
good,"i was working seasonal in the garden department typical day was watering plants, lifting mulch and hay into customers cars. hardest part of the job was the heat in the summer and loading hay in peoples vehicles. Most enjoyable was the flexibility with hours."
good,"I work at the customer service desk. It's not super fun because you do get cussed at by angry customers, but the people I work with are great. It really does take someone who can brush off negativity easily to work here. Also managers kind of play favorites a bit but its not excessive so I guess it's ok, but can be annoying sometimes"
good,"Lots of people come and go because of the type of work in general. It being customer centric and a physically demanding job in most departments scares people away."
good,A really good place to work for! They try to work with you as best as they can when you have problems and will help you break your barriers! They also always look out for their people.
good,A very good place to work and everyone on the team is very welcoming. I like how there is one store manger but many mangers below him that focus on certain departments.
good,"I have been working for Lowes for almost 3 years now. There are so many things I have learned and still have to learn, from the product we sell to the company as a whole. I do love my store, and I hope that I move up the ladder and I am able to become management one day."
good,Currently we are going through some changes the downsizing of our company. Lowe's is a great Company to work for and at times some of the little things eat at the little people when there is No Communication of the Big Picture.
good,"Management, Customers, Innovation, Flexibility, Community. This place is a good place to work, in that you do not guess if your daily work is a real part of the local economy. Having place and trying to take advantage of it without making mistakes that ruin the company and workplace is Lowe's Home Improvement."
good,"Lowe's is an overall good place to work. I enjoyed the people I met, and the amount of on the job training was ongoing the whole time I worked there. In other words, they didn't expect you to know the entire store, but did hold you to excellent customer service standards. Making learning something new every day part of the job training I mentioned."
good,I enjoyed my time at Lowe's my decision to leave was based solely on the fact that I was extremely under paid. I would work for store support and that required to work on 13 different computer systems and have expert advice on 9 different departments it got to be too much for the small amount of 13.24 the hr. Honestly if the pay was better and there were better bonus structure I would have continued my tenure at this company.
good,"They've switched to assigning the days they want you to work to coincide with the days the demands are higher."
good,"Great pay, good benefits, after 13 years Lowe’s as a company fell a part; they cut manager positions, and ended up very short staffed. Which left customers and the remaining employees miserable."
good,"Lowes is a great place to work, during my time there i had multiple chances for advancement and training. A lot of training is based on your time and what you make of it. If you ask it will be given. I moved up fairly quickly and loved the environment."
good,Trailers would come in and your job was to empty the trailers out and put the boxes that were inside into another trailer. The boxes where all mixed up so you had to be careful that you weren’t putting the wrong boxes into other trailers.
good,"It’s a good place to make time for , has good benefits, nice work flow, 401k , good management, everyone is a asset to this company, it’s always different idea at the table and decent working hours."
good,"many things could change about this company but other than that, great company to work for. The company offers great benefits and they also provide a plan to invest in their stock."
good,"I wish it was more organize and team were more friendly, pay were more than they use to give me that you work so hard but not a lot of people use to appreciate what you do"
good,"A typical day would include greeting and assisting customers with their needs. Being able to meet new people, and making a connection with customers. Merchandising stock and keeping the shelves full for convenience."
good,"Lowes was the first job i had ever applied for. The managers taught me valuable work experience and the work culture was one of determination, but also learning."
good,"Lowe's is a place where I learn on a daily basis.  It is definitely a fast paced environment, but it is a great place to work if you love helping customers with their home improvement needs.  Simply showing someone where something is in the store can be just as rewarding as spending a lot of time trying to help them get what they need."
good,"Had a great time working here, everyone was really in a team mind set, the management was great and with the cross training they provide you have tons of opportunities to learn."
good,It was a good place to work. It was clean. Management cared about us. The pay was average. And we had fun activities to do. Like work picnics and other outings.
good,"Lowes is good company to work for. They pay well, have great benefits and encourage progression. The down side is scheduling. That is the reason I left. I had a family member become ill that I had to care for long term. I needed a fixed schedule  that they were not able to accommodate."
good,"While I made mistakes was let go over pettyness. Worked hard, tried to please customers. In the summer removed best when too warm. I think I was let go when this bugged some."
good,The staff and customers are the best part of the day. There is not a day that goes by that is not filled with a new and exciting adventure. But there are rules and regulations that should be followed for a happy work environment.
good,Company is going under changes and not good for employees. Keep changing schedules and shifts no choise in matter for employees. Only have one weekend off every 5 weeks.
good,"Good company to work .. great work life balance."
good,It has it's ups and downs. But overall It's a decent paying job. If your looking for something that can get you by an food on the table its a good job.
good,"great for part-time college students. A typical day can vary based on the department you work in. IT can range from loading mulch and dirt all day, to selling appliances"
good,"Work wise the job was great! Delivery schedule was easy and in a great area for deliveries. I've been around different delivery companies and felt stressed at times....almost not valued as an employer but at Lowe's its like being in a family environment where it's a all for one, one for all type of thing. Its a laid back job!"
good,"Lowes allowed me to be flexible in my schedule and my job title. I was given many opportunities for advancement. Over the course of 4 1/2 years, I was promoted within twice. I only left the company because corporate phased out my position."
good,"I have worked for Lowe's for 10+ years and have seen many changes, good and bad, that have impacted not just it's employees but also the community.  It is a great company to work for but sometimes a change is good for everyone involved."
good,Nice place to work. For the most part they keep you busy even during the slow periods. They have a lot to offer if your looking to find a company to grow with
good,"It was a great experience.  Unfortunately a seasonal position and I gained my degree, so I would like to work in the field same as my degree.  That is why I am looking for a job."
good,"Lowe’s was a good, clean, energy filled place to work! My coworkers were very knowledgeable & team great players. Most of my supervisors were helpful, friendly & easy to talk to. I was disappointed that my seasonal position was so short! I would recommend Lowe’s to those looking for a job!!"
good,Good company with benefits. They work with you on your schedule in you are in school or have children. You also get a discount on purchases. There is career advancement opportunities and able to transfer in you move.
good,Good place to work. Advancement opportunities. Management is easy going and understanding. Most coworkers willing to help you learn. Scheduling done almost 3 weeks in advance and allows for communication with manager
good,"Lowes is a good job for people that like to interact with customers that need help procuring home accessories.  For me, it's better than a lot of other jobs, with decent pay."
good,Company is good and my position gives me a lot of flexibility. If I would get more leads from the store it would be the perfect position. Overall Lowe’s is good company.
good,At the local level it is a great culture and everything is structure and you know what to expect. Great benefits and they take real good care of the employees
good,"I worked for Lowes for 15 years. I will say that it is tough because there is not much of a work and life balance.  They paid me very well and for the most part I was always treated well there by management and always had the support for the most part , even when I didnt feel that I had the support it was talked about and things were changed."
good,"this job combines the best elements of sales, service, and inventory management.  some people don't have the stamina to stay busy during an entire shift so some people may feel overworked. and having knowledge in different departments is both an advantage and disadvantage and may make it difficult to focus at times. but they accept people who want to do less as well as people who want to do more. the box store will always be shorthanded considering the square footage of space involved and the possible number of customers in the store. people sometimes have strange expectations going into HD or lowes since there are smaller locally owned stores that specialize in what they might be looking for. the box store has much more but will be shorthanded at times. a solution for the corporate office is to adjust wages to prevent turnover. the pay is the only real drawback here. the benefits were actually very good."
good,A typical day at work is assisting customers to fulfill their needs. workplace culture is fast paced. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customer get what they want.
good,Lowe’s is a great company and I look to be here for many years to come. The only reason I am on indeed is to look for some income on the side in my free time
good,I enjoyed my time working at Lowe’s  I enjoyed the culture the customer interaction and the employees I worked with. My wife’s work relocated and we moved from Maine to CT. If not for that I’d still be working there
good,"Only negative is amount of paid time off, could be compensated if able to work from home  Supervisor is super supportive and promotion is easy if you are willing to work for it"
good,"Good people, principles and work environment.  The company is focused on gaining market share by providing great customer experience and having the best products available."
good,"Lowe's in Kingston is a great opportunity to learn new skills, as long as you show up with the right attitude. They have a fantastic management team that really do want their staff to succeed."
good,"Operated power equipment, I had fun. Greeting customers and helping them was great, I was unsure on how to approach the customers that had issues with what they needed help with."
good,"Lowe's prides itself, and focuses employee training on outstanding customer service. Management always has your back on enforcing store policy and they take all employee concerns seriously."
good,"Lowes is a great place to work and interact with other people within the community. It has many opportunities throughout the world, especially when tragedy happens."
good,"Of you wanna have fun and challenge yourself at the same time this place is good. They do like to shuffle the staffing structure every couple years, sometimes good, sometimes a headscratcher. The benefits aren't half bad. It's a good place to work if you're willing to accept change on a constant basis."
good,Lowe’s Corporations showed great promising for those who want to slowly climb the corporate ladder from hard worker in a certain department to department ‘manger.
good,Lowe's is a good place to work and the pay is decent. They offer great benefits to full time and part time employees. The only down fall is job security.
good,"Lowes is a pretty decent job. If youre retired and looking for a bit more money. Advancement there is there but feels hard to reach. Especially with all the work you do and try to get sales, being underpaid. It was overwhelming. But all in all management is fantastic. Always willing to help when theres a problem. Great job. Bad pay"
good,"Loved the work and people that I worked with! Great opportunity for advancement within the company. Leadership was great on most occasions, with the exception of a few not knowing how to strategize."
good,The management would mess up the schedule a lot. Not very organized and would also allow anyone to call off no matter how short handed they were. The pay is okay.
good,Lowe's was very family friendly company to work for. They had Family days(Company Picnic) once a year. They were always looking for new ways to compensate employees for their good work.
good,"Good people, bad hours. People were great and had good hearts, but hours were cut dramatically. Okay work environment. Poor management. Overall four out of ten."
good,"Overall fun place to work. Each store is different and really depends on who you work with. Some employees are lazy and most departments are understaffed. Management can be favorited, but again just depends on the store. Would advise that you become familiar with all departments, because you will be covering them all when staffing is short. Plumbing and electrical is the black hole, and customers expect you to know what you're talking about. Take it upon yourself to become familiar because training is minimal unless you benefit well from computer based training. Product training is hands on learning. There are advancement opportunities, but it again depends on how liked you are and who you work with. Otherwise, you just get shifted around from department to department."
good,"As a loader you interact with all customers with their material needs. Once payment is made, assist customer to their vehicle or ask to pul up to load merchandise."
good,a lot of work to be done not much notice for the work you do. Could be better management but overall a good company to work for. Job security isn't guaranteed
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work for a part time employee. The full time people seem stressed and have an odd work schedule. One weekend off a month and when they get back from that, they have a seven day stretch which they all can't stand. The rules change constantly and there are hoops to jump through witha magement changing frequently. Still, there are many employees with over ten years at LOWES."
good,"I enjoyed going to work every day. We had a great Management Team. I had a great Receiving team, in which we helped each other out daily.  The hardest part out this job for me was when my job ended due to store closing."
good,Lowe’s was a good company just wasn’t consistent enough lack of training.when I work for a company I dedicate all I have into my position I work hard and expect the same from my employees team work
good,"I usually spend my morning cleaning the bathrooms, it was an easy task. I also cleaned around the store as well. Management was decent, but the hardest part was having to help customers with heavy cargo. The most enjoyable part of the job were the workers from the other departments who were easy to get along with save for a few bad apples."
good,I was in customer service and a cashier. It was fairly easy being a cashier but sometimes customer service can get a little hectic. I would recommend this job to anybody. They pay well.
good,"Good people to work with.  The job helped me understand more about the dynamics of a bix box store and the personality it takes to make it work well.  It's a retail culture so it's stressfull at times and rewarding at times. "
good,"The customers, can be rude but that's retail. The employees are easy to get along with and will help you with any issues you may have. Friendly environment."
good,"Since I started working at Lowe's,  I've been able to meet my own challenges.  Learned new things and met some nice people.  My skill set as enhanced."
good,"Fairly good place to work. However, very competitive at times.I feel some the training was inadequate."
good,"Working at Lowes was a very rewarding and exciting position until the last year with all the new Corp. Changes."
good,you have to be able to do many different things at once it can be very busy and you have to stock and help customers at the same time. You also have to be mindful of anything that could be on the sales floor that could cause an accident
good,This company was okay to work for I was given tasks each week and it was up to me to complete the task and sign off once finished. I also inspected and repaired all stores electrical equipment.
good,"Call center had nice clean breakrooms and cafeteria.  Clean bathrooms.  Hardest part for myself not being born with a computer and navigation of systems..  Once I knew how to navigate the system the job went much smoother.  Was left go for a comment on the phone to a fellow associate in another state with the same feelings.   Big brother choose my call and said it was racist.  Other than that was really getting the hang of job but your not allowed to have any feelings robot.  "
good,"Not bad as far as retail goes. Insurance is ok but not great. Vision insurance and dental are really good. The vacation system is wierd. Everyone has to borrow vacation time and pay it back after you accrue it. Hard to explain the vacation system, it’s just goofy."
good,The company is great to work for and your coworkers will make the job worth it but the company is going through some big changes and there are some noticeable growing pains from it.
good,The front end management needed a little more training because they seemed a bit disorganized and confused at the jobs they were supposed to be doing. And they really didn't care about their employees at all.
good,Cleaning bathrooms and helping pull carts if needed help unload truck help clean the back room take the trash out from inside the store and outside of the store
good,Lowe's for the most part is a great company to work for. Promotion if you put the work in is achievable. I will always be grateful for the opportunities I was given. I would recommend working for Lowe's.
good,Nothing really negative to say about this company. The employees were amazing to work with and it wasn’t ever too much that needed to be done. You’d wrap things up around the time it was to leave and be able to go home at decent times. Some heavy lifting depending what department you work in but other than that it’s a pretty chill job.
good,I was hired as a seasonal employee. I started in lawn and garden but was given a chance to relocate to the assembly department. It was a great move I enjoyed it. I was paid well and I had consistent hours. The only thing I would have liked was more notice that they were going to release seasonal employees earlier than expected. There were no jobs matching my skill set at that time and I was unable to transfer to another department. In my opinion they can afford to be choosy about who they hire. If you have the right skills tools or building experience you may enjoy it  a lot.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was my schedule.  The schedule was set early and held constant throughout.  "
good,"Once on floor from training, the pace is quick and non stop. Ability to work one/one with instore customers is a good feeling of accomplishment. Having the ability to learn all areas of store to assist customers is a big help and makes them feel as they are being assisted"
good,Cool job overall if you can handle standing and walking on concrete floors. Work environment laid back sometimes fast paced only during peak season though
good,Nice place to work and its lots of fun but the only thing is its not really good with scheduling you will be at work more then home but other then that managment is great and the employees are awesome if you like hard work then it's a great place to be I love my job it's just the way they run the schedule is a little hard but great store
good,Lowe's allowed me  to shine by letting me be inventive and resourceful.  I devised a system for doing things that served me right up to my last day on the job.  This made me such an effective worker that it was known whether or not I worked by observing whether or not things  were done to a certain standard.  This was a matter of pride to me.
good,"Lowe's has many benefits for its employees.  The career progression is okay but only if you are an ""operator"".  The company will benefit from the changes currently under way, but only in the long term."
good,I have worked for Lowes for about 8 years. With the new CEO in place there has been alot of changes. Sometimes change hard but I am hoping in time this company will succeed. I do miss my life and work balance though . But I am hoping that this will be what will happen in the end.
good,"When I worked there it was a college/sports atmosphere where everyone was energetic and talkative. Management changed to where it was more strict on a lot of simple stuff more than usual. Wasn't an engaging atmosphere anymore. For example, you could talk to your associate about a game while working and engage a customer help them out and include them in the particular conversation. It made tons of customers feel at home having a shopping experience were they could vent there excitement with different topics. Now its more on the side of if its not about work then it shouldn't be discussed. Became more work oriented which is understandable but not flexible for a human-being. Just one example for how atmospheres changed."
good,"Pays a bit above minimum just so they can say that their pay is “competitive”, a very physically demanding job, nice management, although the workload Is a bit much for the team size, no difference in pay for working graveyard shift."
good,I love assisting customers find exactly what they are searching for. I can work with the customer in many departments- from the plumbing department to the electrical. I am comfortable assisting clients throughout the store. My job is to help the customer find exactly what they need.
good,I enjoy working at Lowes from the people I work with and all the wonderful repeat and new customers that I meet.along with my supervisors and the Assistant Store Managers too.
good,"Time goes by quickly as there is a lot to do. Stocking product, helping customers find product, Problem solving, etc.  Get to know customers by their first names and they ask you for advice."
good,enjoy working with customers to solve there problems.learned more skills in other departments.do not enjoy the rotating schedule.benefits and 401-k are helpfull
good,"Lowe's overall is a fantastic company.  They paid well, advancement was easy, benefits were good.  It all came down to who was running the show.  And it was heartbreaking to leave.  Management  was why I left."
good,"The ""Lowes way"" is the way things must be done.  If you can accept that then it is a very good place to work.  Company is very community service oriented.  They encourage volunteer work and even pay employees for doing it.  Schedule changes occur with little consideration for employee wishes.  I received a good severance package after two and a half years of working part time."
good,Lowe’s was overall a good experience for me. The people are really nice. You can go to different departments to learn things. The managers aren’t as good as they should be. They will cut your hours down to the minimum of you are part time.
good,"I loved the people, customers as well. It's"" a comfortable and stress free job. Good management but they are to restricted. The layoffs and closings are a worry though."
good,"A day can range from helping customers with recommendations of product. Loading product for customers. Product placement. Easy training for any position. Personally learned fencing, lawn care, pools, plants, hardware, decking. Forklift certification an option."
good,"Pay start off around 10.50 and goes up base on experience or job title. Good first time job, you get  flexible hours and part time hours if you need it."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Lowe’s. I made a lot of life long friends, learned about construction and home improvement, and learned to manage a group of people. Pay was ok, but not enough to comfortably live on. Advancement was tough, as older people generally got management positions. Lots of managers transferred from other Lowe’s stores. If I could have gotten a better paying position I would have stayed."
good,"New CEO and changes happened very quickly with new leadership. I was assigned to the flooring department but on many occasions, I would cover other departments like Plumbing,Paint,window and walls, milworks and appliances.  I really enjoyed working with the people at the castlrock lowes."
good,Was a fun place to work.  The co workers  are very helpful to customers and co-workers alike.  Most of the managers were very receptive to  employee needs.
good,"Luv my job u can learn alot..Discipline and team work and accomplishing task.Make friends bonus etc.Operate pickers ,forklift,balley more.. And also u conpacter"
good,"Overall my experience was enjoyable with Lowe's. The management was competent and thoughtful compared to majority of retail positions I have had experience with. I learned plenty of real life skills and the company encourages you to learn other departments and more about the products in your department. They will gladly have you do plenty of hands on training as well. The only reason I am no longer there is that I decided to further my professional career in a non retail setting and that full-time positions are few and far between in retail and management did not have a full time position available for me. Overall it's a great second job, or part time job compared to other big box retail stores. For some, it is also a great full-time opportunity."
good,"Any retail store will have its issues with customers, orders and management, but overall, its good work, there are benefits, competitions, bonuses and less micromanagement."
good,When I was an employee at Lowes I was certified for just about everything. I was unloader in the back of the store. We pulled product out of the truck by hand and put them on pallets. then we would take those pallets to there section in the store with pallet jacks.
good,This is a part-time job for me am I had just bought my house so it’s great that I was able to get benefits from Lowe’s discounts to suck about things and stuff for the house
good,"I have been with the company for nearly 9 years and have rarely had any significant issues with my overall job. Depending on your level of seniority and/or your job title, the main function is working as a team to sell projects to customers with hopes of increasing retention rate. Sometimes the workload can be overwhelming, but I tend to gravitate towards jobs that challenge me mentally and physically so it was never a problem for me to keep up. The environment is relaxed and the workers have built a culture of helping each other complete tasks and engaging in critical thinking to exploit ideas to improve sales. Plus I hear the new CEO rocks!!"
good,"Absolutely love my store. Co-workers get along great, managers are always willing to help, and hours are flexible. There are sometimes where it gets overwhelming, usually around 12 and 5. Customers can be rude but no one can help that. Training is boring and takes about 2 days to watch videos."
good,This job is good if you like to work and get paid for how hard you work they  bonus they give it all depends on how your monthly score comes out the hours are ok and  management leaves you to do your job and doesn’t bother you at all
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for. The company is going in a totally different direction with new ceo. Former executive at home depot. He runs Lowe's just like home depot. Contractors  are 100% focus vs dyi which was Lowe's core business for over 60 years. Lowe's has always increased pro business at a steady pace every year. Pro customers and part time staff new future of lowes
good,very good place to start out or work for years. friendly staff.
good,Wonderful hard working staff and management that deal with ever changing retail environment. Many opportunities if willing to learn and relocate when the opportunity opens in other stores.
good,"Its usually a long and busy day"
good,"Worked for Lowe’s 20 years. "
good,I worked in the Garden center as Cashier. Mostly it was not busy out there except in the spring. So it was a relaxed job. They do move cashiers around so you can do more then one area. Customer service can be a little hectic but it makes the time go by faster. All managers were there to help and co workers were friendly.
good,"Took orders from contractors and also designed different jobs for them. Ran register, stocked and customer service. Trainning classes were assigned to each different  department."
good,"Lowes was very structured. You were required to work your schedule. They had morning meetings every day and you knew what the expectations were every day. There were opportunities for advancement if you were interested. It was a good family environment and modeled it's culture on great customer service. The hardest part of the job was no set schedule and you worked most holidays and weekends, The best part of the job was friendly customers who appreciated your help."
good,"It was work hauling cinder blocks and mulch buy it paid better than the job I had next. Lowes was cool.  People who work in the gardening department was fun, being a cashier months later was even better."
good,"Its a great place to challenge yourself, learn from others and help the surrounding community. Its quick paced during the warmer season and there is never not something to do, improve, or help another."
good,Fun and relaxed workplace setting. They are fairly flexible with your needs and times you are available. Customers are fun to interact with and there are tons of opportunities to move up within their company.
good,"In my years at Lowe's I have found that the company as a whole is very good. At would be better if the company would hold their store managers more accountable. "
good,"I love my part time job "
good,Nice environment to work and the salary is commensurate with the work. the benefits are great too. paid holiday and also paid public holiday. periodical lunch fothe employee
good,This job has helped me get through college. I enjoy working with my other coworkers and being able to help customers with their purchases. A typical day consists of making sure stock is in the holes for the customers to purchase. Assisting customers with any questions or needs they might need.
good,LOWE'S was a fun place to work with a family culture that made you feel like you where part of the family. I had developed life long friendships while working for LOWE'S
good,"On the whole, associates are very friendly and are team oriented.  Management is easy to work with.  The benefits are great for full time employees which include dental, medical, FMLA leave, on the "
good,"Part time, not during the busy season (spring/summer) can be very lacking in hours. On average, part time shifts are anywhere between 4-7 hrs. Schedule is often five 4 hr shifts/week or similar. Co-workers and management are great, I loved wearing jeans and a t-shirt to work."
good,"My typical day would be to schedule job site inspections [4 or 5 per day] with the general contractors onsite. I would go to the site, review the work on the project, ensure all materials were there, that the work was moving as scheduled and that the customer was please with the overall experience."
good,I had a solid job that required a lot more out of me than I was getting paid for.  Every day I'd report to my department and then throughout the day end up revolving around to fix other departments because I was knowledgeable.  However it often meant that when projects in my department needed to be done I was often alone but considered more than capable of say rebuilding an entire fixture in a few hours.  In addition though a good place to work It was simply to far from where I live.
good,Great place to work filled with opportunity to move up. The employees are friendly and helpful. The majority of the customers are friendly and in search of help.
good,Working at Lowe’s was over all a great experience. I loved being able to be the lady person they the customer seen. Being able to help a customer and knowing that I am the reason on why the customs left happy is an amazing feeling
good,Enjoyed what I did I do not feel like giving a review at this time and should not be forced to in order to get another job. That is not right. However I will say I gave them my best
good,"Pay is good starting at. $14.6/hr to start. "
good,Working there was great. The people were nice and did there jobs as accordance. Getting the training and help you need to move up was easy and overall it was just great to work at.
good,"I learned a lot from Lowe,s. Things that I did not know as a women such as re-keying locks, making keys, learning about nails, and thing o that nature."
good,"The work environment was ok to a point, but is has just been getting harder to work cause the management is not to great everyone seems to be on there own sometimes trying to do there work.the only thing I've learned was how to unload a truck fast so we can get the product out to the sales floor. The hardest part about my job is unloading the truck in a safe way, but it never seems to go safe, only because boxes will fall on you if we aren't be careful."
good,"I liked the job very much, but the last Manager was not willing to work with me while I attended school. I had an arrangement with one manager, to work flexible hours and attend school. But when they change Managers in the lumber department,  the new manager would not work with me on my hours. I was given a choice to hours I could not work. It was work or be fired.  So I quit and continued to attend Culinary school."
good,I like working at Lowe's because the pepole are friendly and the pay is great. The only draw back for me is not enough hours per week the management is okay they really seem like they want to help if needed.
good,"you can move up to a higher spot, they believe in a raise and keeping a eye on they working to see if your doing good and understand the job you have. care about you life not just work a family bussiness"
good,Lowe's is experiencing a lot of changes in the company culture with the new CEO. Time will tell if the changes will benefit the employees and customers.
good,Lowes is a great place to work if you need a job in a retail environment. Offers all the benefits you could ask for and starting at a decent pay rate for all positions.
good,It was a very productive place to work.  I work in lawn and garden so my job was a seasonal job.  Great supervisor.  The hardest thing was learning when different things was at to help out customers.  I learn how to drive a forklift out there.
good,They worked well with my school schedule and did not force me to work when I could not. Good management. Found comfort in the people above me and enjoyed having them around.
good,I enjoyed the customer service end the most. Helping people is a passion of mine. The atmosphere for the employees is mostly a tight knit feeling. there are plenty of company lunch's etc. Good camaraderie.
good,"Good place to work, will work with your schedule if you have things going on. Wish there was more communication between managers. Very laid back atmosphere"
good,"It was a great place to work , the pay was amazing until i was let go for no reason at all with no explanation. Staff were amazing as well so great for students."
good,A typical day at work is greeting the customers.  help unloading trucks.  ring up customers purchases.  stock front end.  working in both the garden and lumber areas as a cashier.
good,"Flooring, assembing cabents, painting walls, yard work, landscape, delivering appliances, sherocking walls, cementing, framing, companding walls, installing appliances..."
good,"Water plants, check if any plants are bad, move plants around to fit plants on shelves. Mark down if you worked front garden or inside the fence. Mark down items before throwing them away"
good,Good place to work. Hours were alway set. The people I worked with were good people. Understood job very well.  Followed instructions that I was given.
good,I think what I enjoyed most about Lowe's Was my fellow employees and management. Management seemed open to the opinions of the people on the floor. I didn't like the rotating schedule.
good,"Cons: Work days fluctuate based on customer volume, and tasks required through the work day. Pay is competitive with other home improvement stores but not adequate to cost of living in most areas, "
good,Quick paced. Definitely will keep you on your feet at all times. Loved all my coworkers. Everyone was awesome to be around! Hourly wage was a bit low but overall amazing place!
good,"Working at Lowe's was great! I worked in Assmebly, Outside Lawn & Garden, Seasonal, and Inside Lawn & Garden and I loved it. The immediate department managers and assistant store managers were great. You will find that they are people too and often that they feel the same way about things as you do. However, the general manager is the person who will kill all of your joy, benefits, and raises. Your days will move very FAST. Customers are typically awesome and you'll learn how to operate a lot of power equipment. My coworkers were always happy and great and I felt like everything was good because I stayed busy. The hardest part of the job is helping people when you're weighed down with work (you will always have something to do). The best part of the job is the day moves fast."
good,They hire great people that make the environment fun. There just is not much room for growth unless you are there for 10 years. I did learn a lot about fixing things around the house which was my favorite part.
good,Wonderful working experience relaxed enviroment with good managers. Decent hours. Very understanding when in need of a sick day. Overall a very good enviroment.
good,I met a lot of great people while working there I also learned a lot while being a sales associate. I learned how to close sales and I picked up greta people skills along the way I would work their again if given the chance.
good,Ok place to work. Worked with school schedule well.wanted full time and it's not available. I enjoyed my time there.  For part time I Would recommend them.
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time at Lowe's. I learned many different sales and managing styles. I was trained in many differant sales areas:"
good,Professional and fast paced. Very strenuous. 8-9 hour shifts. Learn how to operate heavy machinery such as forklifts and load pickers. Must have excellent customer service.
good,I usually learn at least something new each working day even if its as tiny as changing a piece from a machine or learning how to use the online system in a new way.
good,"Lowe's was a great place to work. Most of the mangers were cool and understanding. They was always under staffed, but that didn't stop me from caring for the customers or doing my work to the best of my ability. Lowe's was like my second family. I will miss them dearly. 😪❤"
good,"During the summer lowes is a high paced multi changing environment. Customer service is very important but there are so many things to get done, like stocking merchandise, watering plants, making sure everything is priced and on display. So it can be challenging to  take care of business but realizing that customers need to come first. Personally I loved this environment but I really had to find my pace to make sure I took care of myself (drinking water and eating lunch). I worked outside lawn and garden and loved the workout, the environment of being outside and helping people. The pay is low but the culture and work itself was rewarding."
good,Lowe's is very customer oriented.  They want to make sure the customer has a very good experience every time they come into the store.  The employees are trained in multiple departments so we are always able to help a customer with questions.
good,This is a great place to start off working. I enjoyed my time here just not a big fan of the work schedule were you can open some days and close the next. Just not what I would prefer for a career.
good,"Scheduled shifts vary from week to week, often with quick turnarounds. One weekend off a month and must work most major holidays. Compensation is not terrible, but the work/life balance is difficult."
good,"Fast pase environment, high customer service work environment, benefits, flexibility with work schedule, always hiring, hands on training in each department."
good,My coworkers are fun to work with and make it easier to do the tasks that I need to do. I get exercise moving product around for customers and enjoy being in and outside garden.
good,"Good place to work for a first time job. Management is very friendly and helpful. Great environment, clean environment, and nice co workers to work with."
good,There is flex-work hours that allow you to start and end work depending on your needs outside of work. The management is supportive if you're looking to improve your skills and provide relevant assistance for acquiring further education.
good,"I was a Project Specialist of Interiors. I worked with customers who were interested in kitchen and bath remodels. I would meet with our contractor at the customer's home, pick out all products, work up a quote and present it to the customer. "
good,Nice place to work. The management is pretty laid back. You have management that care and some that's just there for a paycheck. The pay is decent depending on the position you're in and there is sometimes room for advancement.
good,"Lowe's has been a great job,  I  enjoy the time I am.  With the vast variety of customers Lowe's has, each day present a new challenge.  I have been with the company 23 plus years.  I have experienced many staff changes as well as strategy changes,  As Lowe's as continued to evolve so have I."
good,The experience at the Lowe's I worked at was an excellent one. your team will feel like a family and will support you no matter what department you are in. Everyone at the Lowe's I worked at was friendly and the managers there were fantastic. I would definitely recommend Lowe's as a place to work
good,Lots of learning involved and is the perfect place to gain new information in new areas you wouldnt normally know much about. A great place to gain customer service experience overall.
good,Love helping people out great way to meet new people and you work with really good people aswell. They will work with your schedule the best they can.
good,"Lowe's is a seasonal driven store. Your pace depends on the time of year. The greatest thing about working there is having so many different types of work you can do such as customer service, management, paint, outside lawn and garden, and many more."
good,"The job required some degree of strength, and knowledge of the product to be sold in the particular department that I was in. It also required patience when interacting with customers."
good,The job was good and I enjoyed helping people fix their problems and doing it inside the parameters of the NEC codebook. There was also room for advancement
good,"There alre always programs and tools to help develop the employees. Great work life balance and the pay isn’t too bad for retail. Although they are undergoing some big changes, there is room for growth."
good,"Overall this was a good job.  A little micro-managed, most managers were easy to get along with. I still go by to visit some of my co- workers. Pay is very competitive, i would go back."
good,"I wasn't a fan Miliworks but over time I dealt with it and got comfortable with it and got in good terms with management and got to move to Unloader and it was wonderful. Consistent schedule, same time to go In and get out. Loved my co workers and was able to complete the job without stressing out."
good,Good but I felt like I was the only one working. The other problem was different hours everyday. No set schedule. Had fun working there and helping customers find what they need
good,It is a good place to work that has benefits.  There really is not a whole lot that I wish to put in this review.  I will fill the rest of this with just filler.
good,"It was a decent place to work and was not something that I would like as my permanent type job, the fact that I was use to earning more than what they were paying hour and did not seem to want to allow me to move into a different type position is where I had an issue. Working with people was fun and interesting I did enjoy the over all job and helping others is really fun and fulfilling."
good,Overall a great place to work as a student. If you want to live on your own and still work there then you will need to have a higher position and work harder.
good,Work place culture is everything at Lowe's Open door policies are extreamly valued.  management is reluctant to promote or change certain roles with the growing business .
good,"I'm in my 50's and started at Lowes 2 months ago. Training in my opinion is second to no one. I had a year experience on different machines, but their training is very involved and comprehensive, All that being said if you need more time either computer or practice you get it. I didn't need it but others did and I never saw anyone pressured. Pay is good, bathrooms are clean, benefits are good and I'm treated very well by everyone. I needed extra help with the Scanner Guns and I didn't even ask, my coach got it for me. I was never pressured. If you want to stand around and talk, not the place to be. If you are willing to put in a day's work, you'll be fine. It's often said that Safety comes first until it gets in the way of production! Not here its first and they mean it. Everything else can wait!"
good,Good place to work with ample opportunity to advance store side. Fast paced at times with good camaraderie opportunity with fellow employees. Great benefits and stock purchase plan.
good,"Don't work here if you cannot handle the occasional angry customer. Know when to pick your battles and when it's better to get help from your manager. Some customers may need you in adjacent departments, so be ready to answer more specific questions in such areas of experience. Otherwise, a great place to work for those who enjoy home improvement."
good,"Come in and load trucks. Left to right, high and tight. Had to load between 5 to 8 doors. Hardest part was lifting some of the tools. Sometimes non con people want load right and it throws your stacking off."
good,"Lowe's is a fairly nice place to work. The shifts available range from early morning to mid day to night time. The 1 hour for lunch everyday is nice too. All thought there was not much room for advancement while i was there. It was more of a ""this is what you get to do"" type of thing. Although there were lots of opportunities to swap departments if you did not like the one you were currently working in."
good,"My position at Lowe's was great! It allowed for me to set my own schedule.  Unfortunately the job is obsolete. "
good,Good job in my wheelhouse of knowledge. Good benefits. good vacation. Good people overall. a little slow keeping up with the times. No chance for regular employees to suggest ideas.
good,Lowes is a chill place to work it keeps you on your toes but you continue to learn new work patterns and meet new people. They are also flexible with your hours.
good,Great place to work if you can handle customers and tons of competing demands. Once you reach assistant store manager there is no more real advancement unless you want to be a store manager. Good work life balance if you are an hourly employee but not so much if you are salaried.
good,lowes has a great plan in place to go from a good company to a great one. the new ceo has a tenacious attitude for success. I feel lowes has provided me with the skills I need to further my career.
good,I overall enjoyed the tips and new skills from working the almost 2 years with the company. The lack of communication and support of management was the reason of my departure with this company.
good,"very physical ,hard ,heavy work"
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe’s they have great benefits and a friendly environment. They are understanding and are flexible with hours, and always put employees safety first"
good,"I would go in at work and immediately join my partner for the day. He would take care of her department and take care of our customers. It was fantastic working there, and I would easily recommend the job to others."
good,"Lowe's is a safe place to work, the working environment is great and the people are friendly and easy to work with. The management is great and they work with you."
good,"Lowes is a great place to work with a welcoming environment and a good, well rounded staff. Everyone is nice there and uplifting to each other and the customer. I learned many skills including customer service, truck delivery, forklift driving and much more."
good,"Daily store walks to insure that no safety issues are present for the safety of employees and customers.  If safety issues are identified, ensure the issues are corrected immediately after reviewing/training the department employee that completed the initial walk.  Working daily and weekly reports to identify losses by way of operational issues, internal investigations and external/ORC cases.  While the atmosphere changes from store to store, the workplace culture at Lowe's is one of Safety and Customer Service.  The hardest part of the job, and the most enjoyable part, are the people you work with both in the store and those that are part of the LP Team."
good,This was a good job for a college student to have. I worked in the lumbar yard and outside lawn and garden. I still use items I learned there out in the real world.
good,"I started working for Lowes with no prior experience in power equipment and i end up certified in 4 different machines: Electric pallet  jack, Squeeze attachment, Electric Stand Up, Pallet Rider Truck."
good,Paid very well for retail and was very willing to work with scheduling. Could be very fast pace with needing the ability to multitask. Could also have hours that would be late.Hardest part of the job was springtime because business was way up. All employees were very supportive of each other in helping get jobs done.
good,Lowes was by far the best place I've worked I loved my job and co-workers. There is alway opportunity to work your way around the store and into management. The only issue was the new managment brought in pretty much did a clearly house on the entire store but there is always openings at other stores.
good,"I would come in, start my shift. Receive my break times, then go home."
good,"I was re-entering the work force after taking time off to care for my mother. It's a good place to start. I didn't receive enough hours, and the job is physically demanding. You are on your feet the entire time."
good,"The Lowe's everyone knows is starting to change slowly, things are coming better, and worse.  I like the days around work where we have a steady volume of customers, for the day goes by on a quick basis.  Managers are usually quite helpful with the associates on the sales floor, and have limited problems helping customers when there are problems on the floor.  The people you work with are great people to work with, and it is a great day, but things are slowly changing, the stronger links to the store are being lost, jobs are being all changed to seasonal from regular, and associates are going to change from being knowledgeable to just people on the sales floor."
good,"Worked for Lowe's for 13 years until my position was recently eliminated.  Still currently employed as of this but probably won't be soon because i'm not trying to follow a store manager path.  Lowe's provided me plenty of years of stable work.  If you show initiative and competency there are plenty of spots available for those trying to be managers.  If you just want to help customers and are cool with topping out around 18-20 per hour then it's perfect for it.  A typical day was putting away freight and doing morning paperwork then helping customers and keeping the store clean.  I learned patience when dealing with customers.  Management, like any other job, is different depending on who you get.  Had some good ones and bad.  The hardest part, like with other retail jobs, is dealing with customers that come in upset for no reason and in lower volume stores when there is a call out it really affects the difficulty of the job.  The most enjoyable part was the different coworkers I got to work with over the years."
good,"Work place is busy, some well organized, leadership, busy sometimes, help customers LOVE WHERE THEY LIVE. My job is to assist customers and manage internet sales and order management"
good,"Typical days at work for a cashier is just standing around waiting for customers, it was challenging to assist customers finding what they were looking for solely due to the fact that we couldn't leave the register."
good,"As an ASM you must expect the unexpected.  Consistently be able to adjust as plans generally do not go as expected due to factors outside your control such as call ins or added truck shipments."
good,The culture was quite different and the pay was salary was always having to work over the 40 hours per week.  I relocated with this company and then had to leave the company when I had to relocate back.
good,"Lowe's is a better than average employer for retail.  Pay is good and there are usually plenty of opportunities for advancement.  Lowe's tends to promote from within, which is great for current employees, but it does make it difficult to be initially hired."
good,"Nice place to work. Clean, friendly environment.  Relaxed atmosphere.  8 years of service, part time (weekends only) . opportunity for advancement is there for those willing."
good,"working at an office place and be stressful yet relaxing at times, as an agent it is a 50/50 whether you will have a stressful day or a relaxed day. over all, if you enjoy sitting at a desk for 8-10 hours a day answering calls, this is a job for you"
good,Lowes is a solid place to work for young adults who may be going to school as they work with your hours.  The people that work there are great and will be enjoyable to work with.
good,"The store manager was an amazing man, but my manager was very lazy and was just not a nice person. Though most other managers throw-out the store were"
good,I have enjoyed working for this company. The associates make this company. I don't always agree with managements decisions for the direction of the company but for the most part it has been enjoyable.
good,There was a lack of Management in the receiving area during the evening shifts. Many conflicts during this time as employees were under their own supervision.
good,Lowes was a organized palce to work had good management as well. Most of the employees were happy. But i believe my skills can be used in other places.
good,Working as a GSL in a Lowes store was an enriching experience. It provides a good basis for anyone who wishes to get any sort of customer support experience.
good,"Very good place to shape one's knowledge level. Fair advancement opportunities in the work place. Medical benefits are too expensive and still need to pay co pays,Culture is well built, implementation always subject to who is managing store."
good,"Enjoyed the environment and the work I did but in the end work well with my school schedule and home life. Therefore, I left the position to find a job that better fit my needs."
good,"Probably the best job I've had yet, despite the physical labor involved. People there were nice and accomodating, and would teach you how to use certain tools and systems to assist them in working towards a goal."
good,A typical day at work is rewarding when you can come in and help a person love where they live.  I love helping the customers pick out product to go into their new kitchen or bathroom and seeing the ending results and the looks on their faces.
good,I enjoy working at Lowe’s. I want to try something different. I am one that is willing to try new things. I enjoy being able to help others. Lowe’s is a good place to work.
good,"Overall a great company to work for and wonderful people to work with. The managers are great people, and are fun to be around. Working here was a great opportunity for me in the long run."
good,"I've worked at Lowe's since I was in high school. I've had a few different positions while working here, and for the most part it was an enjoyable experience. I've gained a lot of my skills from Lowe's such as cycle counting, order management and customer service. Management at my store has its ups and downs, but I feel like that's a lot of places. The hardest part of the job would be holiday season, it always feels like there's never enough employees, but it's also a retail job, so that's normal. The most enjoyable part was my co-workers. If you enjoy the people that you work with, you'll enjoy your job."
good,"Was very happy and felt secure - no warning elimination of position was coming.  Restructuring happens very frequently, leaving employees to scramble to find a new position within the company."
good,"it was a very healthy and fun work environment and I would definitely recommend to a friend working there, if in the future the opportunity arises for full time position I would highly consider it."
good,"When working in shipping, loaded pallets on trucks with stand up forklift, stacked boxes off conveyor belt, sealed trailer for transport. Non conveyable distribution, picked up payload and delivered to location."
good,"supervising front end , making sure everything running smoothly, making sure staff gets everything they needs. customer service is main thing .. making sure the breaks for staff member are taken at right time ,,"
good,It was cool.  A lot of hard work but can be taught to be simple.  Long work hours but money is worth it.  Friendly people. Some hateful but can be aware of those.
good,"Didnt like the way managment passed commands down chain of command when they were never in the work enviroment. Have excellent benefits, and bonus program."
good,"I was a PSA (Product Service Associate) in Missouri and moved to Washington state. I thoroughly enjoyed my job but moved for my spouse's job. When I Moved the ""only available"" position was PT. I took it so I'd have a job. Once i go here I had a better understanding of the job market outside of Lowes so I found a new job and that's apparently the time a multitude of full time jobs at Lowes ""opened up"" that left a bad taste in my mouth. In Missouri I enjoyed my coworkers and pay and Full Time benefits. Management was okay. culture was great. the hardest part f my job was the manual labor. the people were the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,Apply and go find out for yourself. The experience is like any other. It is what you make it- no one can determine that except for you. So go check it out.
good,Very slow work environment most days you did the same thing. Weekends were the only days that you’d have a lot of things to do but even then everything is based on the customers.
good,"It can be a great job and it can be the worst job all in one day. It can be very stressful and difficult, long hours and intense work load. "
good,"I worked for lowe's back in 2012, I loved it. At the time I was a single parent, and my managers were always willing to work with me if my son was sick, or if I need to get off earlier or come in later in order to get my son to or from school. I was a lot of fun working there."
good,"I started at lowes a few years ago seasonal and then moved to full time. If your a student in school and need a competitive paying job with flexible hours. This is the place to work. Many like myself are in school and working full time. If your a driver looking for a home everynight job, Lowes pays CDL driver really well. Overall there are goodod days and bad days and costumers are not always the nicest. Lowes trains you to handle any situation thatt comes foward. Lowes is a great place to start a career and climb the sucess ladder if your looking ."
good,"I was a seasonal employee at Lowes, during their busiest time in the spring I was a cashier in the garden section. Learning their cash register technology over a busy and short period of time did stress me out, but the other employees were happy to teach me when I was stuck. My first week I won a reward for selling a warranty to a customer before any of the seasoned veterans there did. They paid great and gave a good amount of time for lunch breaks. I had no quarrels with them about anything, they had a great environment. They were like a family."
good,"lowes was an enjoyable place to work.The environment was upbeat and seemed to be family oriented.There is always room to advance however, they began eliminating certain positions towards the end of my time there,mine included. I was offered another position to which I declined."
good,"I work as a Customer Service Associate (CSA) and check out customers as well as clean, provide service, answer questions for customers, and sell protection plans as well as try to get leads for specialists. Great work environment and very understanding staff."
good,"I've been there for 14 months and as a CSA, I did enjoy my job because I like interacting with customers and get alot of compliments that were better than any other stores that we meet their needs and always friendly. I also give extra thanks to our active/retired veterans. :)"
good,"People who work here are great, but are leaving in droves. Due to retirement, relocation/finding better jobs, and some just hate working here. It's getting tough on those who are left since they are slow to hire new people and we all feel the squeeze. But i guess that's typical when half the work force leaves in the span of three months."
good,You get hired part time and are made to work full time hours on weekends.. every weekend if you dont say you can't. Other than that the laid back vibe of co workers is nice. I will say working the front end i have seen how easily some co workers get sucked into gossip and unnecessary drama.
good,Lowe's was a great learning experience on how to inter act with groups and individuals in different situations.Which allowed me to have a better appreciation for customer service.
good,Great company that is employee focused. The company emphasizes supporting our customers or supporting those who provide support to our customers. I will continue to patronize Lowes.
good,"The scheduling manager made life miserable, never checked the calender and was always giving hours to under performers who strokes his ego. Other than him, life was cake there."
good,I would request Lowes to anyone in retail. My job was kind of tough due to the customers that think because they spend money they can be rude. Other than the rude customers the manager in florence was great and they always fee you.
good,Great place to work. Full or part time. The staff is friendly and willing to teach you if you wsnt to advance. I have seen a FSA custodian move up to manger.
good,"would come in to work checked with co-workers to see what new and what needed to be done for the night. help customers with anything they needed. organized shelves, use forklift throughout the store,  learned all about mulch, plants, taking care of grass, fencing, power equipment. management not always clear what they wanted to be done. a lot of micromanagement, they don't communicate well. impuissant customers. working the Christmas tree tent."
good,A great place to work to build on your customer service skills. Plenty of different departments to cross train in. Good employee discount and benefits also.
good,"Good place to work, good people taking care of customers interests. Lowes could use a better system for millwork to better help associates help customers."
good,Enjoyed my employment at Lowe's steady work offered good benefits equipment operations are in very good shape they were eager to help you to learn also there was a chance for advancement
good,"I worked with many great people truly passionate about their jobs and commitment to the company.  It very much felt comfortable as an environment goes.  Once Senior management changed over, the atmosphere changed to a very negative and hostile environment."
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's. I enjoyed working with different people everyday. I enjoyed learning the different departments. This job was demanding and many times we were overworked and underpaid because a lack of staffing, but it was a good job to work."
good,This job was enjoyable for me mostly due to the work hours were extremely early so I had the afternoons off most of the time.  Much depends on the team of the store.  For example if the team is terrible then the job is terrible all around.  I had a great team storewide so my experience was a good one -
good,"Throughout my time working at Lowes, I never had issues with any co-workers or management. Everyone had a job, and each co-worker offered help and encouragement when needed."
good,"Good place to work, can be fast paced at times. Good pay for job. Good deals on home improvement things & plants.  Management is okay, bearable. Interact with people most of the day."
good,I learned a lot in a short time being this was my first job. I would have stayed longer if it was possible but life happened and I was forced to leave.
good,"I really enjoyed the people I worked with at Lowe’s, they are very helpful, and very respectful. If the pay were better and more hours available I would have stayed."
good,"It's not perfect, but for retail/hardware, it's way more than I expected. Scheduling is kind of a pain. The 10% off for staff is great, there's a 401k, PTO, and I feel like they want you to succeed. Often short staffed."
good,There was a lot of days that you will have customers who potentially give you an attitude but you should not worry about it but just to keep helping on there personal needs.
good,"This was a good work environment. the managers were for the most part very involved and supportive."
good,typically it was a good job with great people to work with. it is not hard but enjoyable as long as you do your job and don't cause issue and are aware of surroundings
good,A fun but fast paced workplace rain or shine u will work outside and u will want to have rain gear cause u will get wet but its a good company to work for.
good,Good company direction and management.  Opportunities to advance. Hours can be long for exempt employees.  Need to be available for holidays and weekends.
good,"Some days were slow, others were fast pace. I was always busy. I learned better customer service skills. The management was good, always helpful when needed. The workplace was well kept most of the time. The hardest part of the job was handling angry customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with really nice people, made the enviroment less stressful."
good,"1.I get to 30 or 20 minutes before i start work,after clocking in i start attending to customers."
good,Very busy and fast work place and friendly environment you’ll learn a lot on how to treat customer and how to properly answer phone calls you’ll also meet a lot of different people
good,"Overall, working at Lowe's was a joy and privilege. They work well around schedules and home life, while also giving you the most hours that they can give you."
good,Working the hardware the garden sections. I learned the layout of the areas. Management was handout will very little interaction. The job was rewarding support customer with their needs.
good,It was okay gossip badly not to many hrs it was a couple good ones out there they really didn't speak unless head people was in the building customers was rude but not all some even had your back when ppl talked trash to you lol but most days I had a great time
good,"The management team is cohesive. The Store Manager was a good guy. "
good,"I cannot respond to the current status of much of the issues presented in the above questions, as I left Lowe's about 8 years ago, and the company has undergone major structural and organizational changes since that time."
good,I appreciate my job at Lowe's because it is a fun workplace and I love engaging with all the customers that come into the store. I have learned a lot about customer service skills and I have also learned how poor management effects the store itself.
good,It was a nice company to work for. I was an seasonal employee and it was a good experience. I end up leaving for another position in another state. I would love to go back and work for them
good,"A typical day at work would be cashing out customers and making sure money is correct. Sometimes stock if the day was slow, fix up the store as well. I learned how to count money better, how ordering products works and I got a lot of communication skills. Management was good, everything is always in order. Good job for upbeat, friendly, and productive people. The hardest part of the job would be blocking at the end of the day if you closed. The enjoyable part of the job is getting to be around so many people and conversate."
good,walk my department to do my safety check list than I purge the paint machine and reboot the system than go and do the safety list for home décor and go back to my paint department to assist customers
good,I loved this job because we had goals to make the job fun without the stress of actually having to work super hard to get to our goals customers were always friendly and those goals were easily met.
good,"My employment at Lowe's was both enjoyable and educational.  "
good,"Teaches you all you need to know about tools and hardware."
good,Good place and excellent benefits I had to leave because my means of living was above of what they paid but an overall great place I love and would recommend to anyone.
good,"I loved working for Lowe's. It comes down to specific store management. Sometimes you have great people some times you don't. "
good,Ok place to work. Store level is frustrating. Management is terrible. Benefits are good. Nice discount. Customers can be very frustrating and abusive.
good,"The position allows a lot of freedom to set my own schedule and the wage is not bad. I get to work with some professional contractors for remodeling jobs and they do great work."
good,"lots of autonomy, good support throughout organization. good benefits "
good,"Great people"
good,Good company to work for. Job can be stressful at times - too much to do and not enough time. Same as many other retail places. Lots of opportunities to learn. Most of the managers are great. Some are less stellar. Same for co-workers. Nice that they have benefits and a few other perks.
good,I enjoyed working there it was just bad management at the time of employment. Friendly customers that I known the time i was there. I learned a whole lot over the years there
good,"Lots of interaction with multiple customers within a single shift.  Perfection and order follow up is a must.... great crew, great management.  Must be able to work work with little to no supervision and take initiative when applicable.  Cross training is a must and ability to lift, pull, and balance is absolutely necessary.  The hardest part of the job would be follow up on order management.  Systems are very old and out of date creating more problems and hardships than necessary.  Work culture was very laid back and employees worked well together."
good,Working for a place that tracks everything you do and when you do it is stressful you have to write down every minute you aren't scanning something and if you don't you get called into the office even if you've been a loyal hard worker for more than 5 or 10 years i get that people like to take advantge if there wasnt a tracker but they dont need to fire people for waiting for there LRT to load
good,Nice if you like a fast paced job.  Days fly by as there is always something to do.  Only problem is that you can get stuck by yourself for long periods of time that would normally require 2 or more employees.
good,"I loved my job as soon as I started. The employees were really sweet and had no problems training me. I worked a bit in each department in the store. I used the previous customer capabilities that I've accomplished over the years that I've been working. The management became a bit of an issue towards the end of me stay and the turn over began to increase because of the superiors not communicating properly. Other than that, it was a great experience."
good,"It was pleasure to work for Lowes;  I learn alot about Home Fixtures, and how to arrange a Home with proper quality fixtures.  My job duties consisted of Cash Count,  throughout the  day closing out Cashiers planning proper lunch breaks, through the course of the day providing Check authorizations, and Credit Card payments, for high end Clients.  Processing Front End orders via the Internet,  processing  exchanges,  and also ensuring delivery time frames,  for the Clients. I also provided constant updates for Policy and Procedures of Lowes;  for the Cashiers keeping them  abreast of processing orders efficiently for the Clients of Lowes!!"
good,I worked there on an off for years taking breaks for school. I was paid about average for my area for a part time job. Decent hours but mandatory weekends.
good,I spent my days changing and updating prices thru the entire store. Printing reports at the beginning and end of the day. I was the only person responsible for these responsibilities.
good,"Most managers and staff were among the friendliest people I've ever met.  Almost everyone was willing to help out customers or each other.  Most management was also very friendly.  The nature of a retail job still effected working here: it was minimum wage, no benefits for part time or seasonal, and as few people as possible doing as much work as possible.  Most customers were even friendly outside of the customer service desk.  People were very understanding as long as you were honest and did your best.  Although most managers were nice, some intentionally caused problems and even seemed to spite employees by denying days off that had been requested months in advance for important reasons.  the high turnover rate with retail employees also means that a bad manager will quickly reduce a department to only those employees who can't leave, forcing them to try to manage much more than they can handle alone or driving them off as well.  I often had two or three departments entirely to myself, which quickly became a problem if both departments were busy."
good,Customer focused. Department focused. Trigger happy with write ups instead of one on one communications. Leaning opportunities. Bad leadership gets away with anything. Also good leadership cant always get around to help you grow. Training by watching videos. A lot of moving around for younger employees. Younger employees get more faults due to more tasks being put on them. Most days you are working alone depending on what position you are in.
good,Loading and unloading trucks using forklifts. You are required to follow set procedures. I liked the freedom of my job. The hours (4am-1pm) Mon thru Friday. I liked working unsupervised and given the opportunity to think and act on my own
good,Retail HR is not where I decided I wanted to be. It may be fine for others but it seemed disjointed and too chaotic for me. I liked the HR work but the requirement to be on the floor and back up cashiers tended to infringe on my day to day requirements.
good,When I first started working there we had a full crew of workers on truck. As time went on everybody quit except for myself and a new guy who is my only partner on truck right now. 2 people on truck duty and company policy expects us to get it done within 3 to 4 hours. I'm just not a fan of it anymore and I am definitely ready to say goodbye to that job if I am accepted for this position. I will give myself credit for being a very good forklift driver a lot better than people who have been doing it for much longer than I have
good,Been with Lowes for six years. Happy with the company. Need to work closer to home. The only reason I am considering leaving is because I can't transfer back to my old store.
good,"As a driver you’ll work two different shifts sometimes 7-4pm , other times 10-7pm. The window for delivery is 8am -7pm. You’ll do some heavy lifting on the job. "
good,It is a good company to work for until you hit a certain age.  They seem to have a cleansing of managers every 5+ years.  Full time associates need not worry about lay offs.
good,Great place to learn customer service. Hard working departments that are collaborative. Team work is key in this environment. Sales learning towards special orders.
good,To many structure changes extremely high management turnover rate leads to unbalanced work place and confusion. Within a six 7 year work life with Lowe's I had 3 different store managers and more than 13 assistant store managers. Plus Lowe's restructured removing valuable department management staff rebranding them as service managers with little pay raise and tons more work while lightening the work on the highly paid assistant managers. Store managers have no idea the daily going on's in their stores and other than sales seam to not be bothered by their employee relation ships( could care less about them).
good,"I was hired as a seasonal employee and was told that I would have a part time position in a different department. But the part time position wasn't written in stone and I got laid off, instead."
good,"Lowe's was a lot of fun to work at, The management was friendly and cared about their employees. The other associates were very friendly. Customers wanted to shop at our store."
good,Good place to work if you’re looking for a job in retailer.  The team is always helpful and supportive.  The customers are friendly and you can always see interesting projects being purchased as a cashier.
good,I Miss working there. . . Great place to work. The People and Team members make all worth wild. . . customers are almost too simple to assist. . . They Know what they go in for. . .At times it's as easy as taking them or guiding them to where the merchandise is at and Helping them load. . .
good,"Lowes is a great place to work if you like retail. It is family oriented. If you work in the loss prevention side of the company then it is a little different. They come out with more and more processes, and you never know which one to focus on. They push internal cases but dont give you the time to do so. I also worked with Walmart for 10 years doing the same thing and it is no different."
good,"Team atmosphere. Team members are encouraged to work together. "
good,"Good environment to work,good people work with,had issue with a manager that caused me to quit.woukd go back to work at Lowe's if given the opportunity"
good,The store I worked at had a great environment. It felt more like a family than just your coworkers. Everyone was typically very helpful to others and very friendly all the time.
good,"I've enjoyed working with Lowe's and my co-workers. My biggest complaint is the lack of a consistent schedule, which made it difficult to search for another job."
good,Great place to work if you like working as a team. Helping people love we’re they leave.showing people how they can take on home improvement they wanted to do
good,I enjoyed my daily job duties and schedule as long as it stayed consistent. Tried to make a career with the company however supervisor was terrible and did not care about subordinates. Store manager was excellent.
good,Retail is a tough environment.  I loved customer interaction and being able to help them love where they live. Loved learning how to find certain material for customer projects
good,Enjoy working for my managers and all my co-workers. It's a fun place to work. I would recommend Lowe's to anyone needing to find employment. The managers and HR are very easy to talk to if you need to talk about any issues you may be having.
good,"Company needs to change the approach for scheduling part timers."
good,"Management was good and understandable. Work would get busy at times, but its every easy going. Unloading truck is hard work and alot of heavy lifting. Everyone there was friendly and have good work party."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy."
good,"It's a fast pace working environment depending on the selling season. Busier in summer than winter, unless it's around holidays. Good benefits and compensation."
good,"Every morning our crew would unload the truck for that day's freight. We would they stage all of the products and stock them as well. We went through the day completing these tasks as well as assisting customers with their needs. Overall, the employees seem to know their roles, but we were severely understaffed and management doesn't quite seem to have everything together."
good,I watered flowers. It was easy peasy lemon squeezy.  I came in and had to fix the hoses from the night before because the previous waterers did not do that.
good,"This is the best place I've worked since Six flags. THe pay is based on your work experience and the managers are helpful in plenty of situations, there is a family feeling when working there."
good,"In general my schedule was always reliable and consistent, pay left me very well off enough to take care of my financial obligations in comfort and training was very specific and helpful."
good,The employees were friendly and helpful. The work was fast paced and not to much down time. The management was understanding and very approachable when it came to problems in company.
good,"Working for Lowe's was fun.  I learned a lot and the team I worked with were fantastic.  It was a different type of retail environment that I enjoyed working in.  Some of the management could use some help/replaced, but the majority of management were great people who cared a lot about their employees.  I would work there again if I had the opportunity."
good,"Lowe's pays pretty well and the job is fairly easy, but there are people in management who would make things less easy, because of their attitudes and way of going about solving problems - which weren't always effective. Need better leaders, because good leaders create positive change."
good,I really enjoyed working here. I meet some amazing people. Learned a few new customer service skills. Enjoyed that ever day was different and interesting.
good,Great learning and Benefits and Holiday pay. Fast pace family feeling with co workers only things that sucks is you work most weekends and Holidays but at least you get time and a half.
good,"My typical day at Lowes was Clock in and go down to my department to see what needs to be done. There were many times when soon as you clock in and walk down to your department, already your employers had you working. The management there was not too bad at all. But they would put too much work on us to do that was unnecessary. The hardest part about that Job was dealing with Rude Customers and also employees attitudes there . The most enjoyable about Lowes is they would show their appreciation towards their employees. Especially on Holidays. Anytime the Store makes sales, they would have food such as Pizza, pasta, Hamburgers & Hotdogs, Ice cream etc for us."
good,working there is a relaxed environment as well as easy to get along with other associates management easy to work with and customer service is positively reinforced.
good,Working part time for Lowe's has helped me work with school. Great place to work at and very friendly environment  as well. Hours are crazy you have to flexible and management are good to work with as well.
good,"The cashier job was easy and fun. The self check out though were hectic because at times they were the only option customers had to check out. The managers and staff were all nice, helpful and easy to work with."
good,This job is like any other job it has it's ups and downs but the pay is very well part-time is paid $9 and hour and full-time is paid $10 and hr. you get two days off and with the short staff part-time is given a few more hours than normal. The management is under control and I would recommend this job to anyone. Great environment.
good,Beautiful people in and out love my job and what i do i love to give people ideas of where they live and feel safe. I enjoy my job and the many ideas i come up with including me it gives me my strength to go on during the day.
good,"Great work culture, safe and customer focused. The schedule is hard to get used to because it seems erradic but once you learn the system it becomes easier. Management is trained well."
good,"It a fun environment to be in , there is a lot of people that encourage you to do your best but there are people that are lazy and blame there mistakes on you"
good,"Used to be a great place to work for ,but they show  way too much favortism,they expect too much work out of one person,they  expect one person to do six different jobs at once,then you get yelled at if you can't keep up."
good,"The job was pretty good, there is always chances for advancement and my coworkers formed a type of family unit. However, the pay is low although you can get a yearly raise, and there is a lot seemingly silly rules to follow that come from corporate."
good,"i enjoyed working outside in all types of weather as well as going on deliveries as needed."
good,It was okay for the most part. The customers was always sweet and I grew friendships with some of our everyday customers. Some of the managers were nice some wasn't too nice. It was an overall good/okay job.
good,Fun place to work but LPM schedules are difficult as we are required to work 48hrs a week with OT pay. Position needs to made salary or back to 40hrs regular.
good,"The schedule was very flexible when I worked at the location in Jackson, TN. It was a very friendly environment. The customer base was very friendly as well. I loved to work there."
good,"Worked eight hours a day, where there was always something to do. Ported carts early on in the morning while answering calls from customer service to retrieve items in receiving, and bring them to the customer service desk for pick-up by customers. When calls were slow and carts did not need to be brought into the store, i would assist whatever department needed help. I used powered equipment including automated pallet jacks, fork lifts, and order picker lifts every day in my capacity as a front end loader."
good,"Lots of multi-tasking and being on your feet. Safety is a major concern for this company when it comes to their employees. This company is very flexible when it comes to working with you on your schedule if you attend school or have a secondary job. Management is alright, depending on the store you're at, but most stores coordinate fairly well together. I would say the hardest part of this job is handling the very few angry belligerent customers that come in from time to time. One of the pros about this job once you're past the hiring process is working with the other employees, the company sets a precedence to maintain a safe, friendly, and fun work environment."
good,The reason I say can be  a good place is I worked there for 6 years and worked up to a store manager role. Made one mistake without any corrective actions I was terminated. Seems like they could have done more to support through the process.
good,"Workload can vary heavily from day to day. In addition to your own workload you can be asked to handle the work of other agents who are either overwhelmed or just not there. Inbound lines have the general call center pains of Monday through Wednesday being very busy, while Thursdays and Fridays tend to be slower and more relaxed. This is compounded by the rotating schedules (only in the install department to my knowledge) which have about a quarter of the department off on either Monday and Tuesday, or Tuesday and Wednesday. Overall a very good place to work as far as benefits and atmosphere, but the schedule can get tiresome and getting the same 4 kinds of call can wear on you."
good,"A typical day at work involved stocking product, cleaning store, assisting customers and unloading trucks. The management is wonderful. The hardest part of the job is all the heavy lifting that could be imvolved."
good,Lowe's is a great place to work for an entry level job. The pay isn't competitive as you move higher up the ranks and gain more skills. Overall this is a great company for young people to gain experience doing a multitude of things.
good,This was a 9-5 Monday through Friday position for me in customer service throughout many departments including the front end. The management staff was always fair
good,As with retail busnesses they they expect you to do more with less help. I enjoy working in the garden center with the plants. We work as a team in the gc.
good,Lowe's was a fun place to work. The people I worked with were great. My manager was was great. My job could get physical at times but I always enjoyed the work i was doing.
good,"I started working at Lowe's as a seasonal internet fulfillment associate. I absolutely loved the job! I started having some serious health issues a few months later and management was really understanding. They worked with me a lot. During a period of time I couldn't do any heavy lifting or climb ladders...really most of my essential job tasks were off limits. My direct manager moved me to a cashier position until I was able to perform my regular job requirements. After a few more months my job was moving to a lower volume store and we were all given an option to move with the job or find a new position in the store. I moved to cashiering in the garden center because I already had the training. I didnt like it as much as internet fulfillment but I did love being in the garden center. I started to notice things that I didn't before.  The scheduling was the biggest problem I had with the job."
good,This was a huge step up from my first job. I love to come to work . Even though it may of had its ups and down it still was a very good job to work at. The manager was nice most of the time but overall I love Lowes.
good,"I worked for almost 10 years at Lowe's. I loved it so much, hated to leave. I moved out of state. If there was a Lowes closer to me if go back.. They gave me opportunityto learn new things. I accepted and learned."
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Lowe's. the campus is truly amazing and has a lot to offer. For the most part the people at Lowe's are amazing, caring and helpful."
good,"Company is great over all what matters the most is under what management team you are in."
good,"Really nice place to work, a lot of people are very open and approachable, good place to learn."
good,"I enjoyed working with my team and the store associates. Customer service is the culture there and I found great pleasure helping customers solve their problems. At times we are under understaffed, as a team we join together, keep the customers expectations high and celebrate our accomplishments."
good,"This is a fun and energetic environment to work in. The management team is friendly and available to help when called upon. The company cares about the employees well-being, family life and their contributions to the community."
good,"It was like going to school you have your duties and jobs you have to do daily. Then the main priority was to help customers with any issue and in a productive way. The people were very friendly."
good,"Worked temporary as a night stocker. Was a good amount of work and a decent crew to work with. Manager could have been better, he didnt seem to do much, but overall was a very enjoyable experience working there."
good,Working with people is always a challenge. There is no easy day or hard day. You just gotta have a positive attitude willing to help people. If you what it takes to deal with people customer service is the way to go.
good,"Assisting customers with their shopping and making sure that they leave the store satisfied, also working with all employees at the store was an amazing experience for me."
good,Lowes is a good place to work because they are close to home and I work Monday thru Friday. I can take off when needed with a 30 day notice. I enjoy going to work
good,"Lowe's has a strong strategy to thrust itself into the future.  Overcoming antiquated systems and ideology has been its greatest obstacle, but finally a fresh perspective and streamlined vision has launched Lowe's into a very viable and sustainable company."
good,Every csr that worked me would always out helping others and they knew their jobs we’ll enough that I didn’t have to remind them a lot free up my time to do my project that were tasked for me to do
good,"unpacked the trucks and stocked the shelves. It was self-explanatory and didn't need much supervision. We also, got to help customers find whatever they needed while giving them the best experience possible."
good,At Lowes I worked hours that were in my favor and received a competitive pay. I enjoyed my work and loved delivering new appliances to people. However the management was not up to par.
good,"Sometimes high paced, and stressful. Good people to work with. Flexible schedules, good pay. Hands on retail work. Typical shifts are 8-10 hours. Two breaks and one lunch"
good,"Busy times can be stressful but the management staff is always willing to step in and help."
good,loved staying busy working there and learned areas of other departments meeting people with there passion was awesome. Fellow employees always stepped in to help
good,"came in as a low level outside home and garden sales rep. I spent a lot of time loading cars with purchased bags of mulch or bricks. Organized and cleaned the work space. Occasionally watered flowers in the morning. I was treated with respect and had a very clear and pleasant boss-rep relationship throughout my tenure. I was never given much room to grow, but i did learn a solid amount regarding organization of outdoor supplies, and how to drive a fork lift"
good,Everyone helps each other out. The managers are willing to work with you to develop new skills and lean the ropes in multiple departments. the entire workforce is kind as well.
good,"at Lowes I learned how to read a plan o gram ues various tools assemble shelves and various appliances and products that they "
good,Good place to work. Could pay better!! Get people. Had an on-site doctors office. Was free to the company employees depending on the insurance you had.
good,"It's a good place but they mainly hire high school kids and most don't have the strong work ethic or desire to do a good job or provide great customer service. Other than that, the management is good and the pay is good, there is also plenty of opportunity for advancement."
good,"Had a lot of fun working with the people at Lowes, always something exciting going on including all store bingo games during hours, fun cookouts after work with games. The work environment was, we, work but everyone made it easy to relax and enjoy actual work. There was ample opportunity to move forward with a career in Lowes and they give everyone the know how and training to do so, its how you usethe skills and take the opportunities they give."
good,"You get out of it what you put in. I good place to work with great benefits.Expect a high traffic work environment with plenty to do. If you are just looking for part time work, or looking to take your career to the next level, then Lowes may be for you."
good,This place is good to work for. Enjoyed it while I was there. People were nice and management was pretty cool. They don't let you slack here but its a good thing because it will make you a better worker.
good,"Worked in the Seasonal Department, ever changing department with always something going on. Easy to learn on the job as well as educating oneself on the different types of products that are sold. Management was easy going, but forceful to ensure all tasks were accomplished on time."
good,"I learned how to work with others, as well as time management. I worked the closing shift. wish was maybe busy for 15-20 min for an hour. then it was quiet.after we closed I was left to clean the front and restock the shelf's and take out the trash. when I was done i would help others if they needed  it."
good,"Lowe's is a good company, but you have to remember that they do hire some young people to work there who don't grasp responsibility.  However, if you come to work on time and do your job you won't have any problems.  If you show initiative and want to move up in the company there are opportunities, but you have to be available to work all shifts."
good,I really enjoyed working at Lowe's. I felt the managers were super helpful and didn't just delegate work. The managers were more than willing to jump in and help where needed.
good,Everyone I worked with was all about completing the task as fast as possible so we could get a jump on helping the next crew. The hours were consistent so it made having a life outside of work easy.
good,Lowes was an excellent place to work. I loved all of my coworkers and the relationship that I developed with them all! The only thing that I did not really agree with is my working hours. I did not feel as if my request for certain working hours was not acknowledged.
good,"Lowes was/is a great place to work.Morning meetings start the day. not just a dry meeting full of complaints and management gripes. but ususally the time for employee reminders for the day and human resources related."
good,"Enjoy the people I work with. Always room to advance in the store (different department/role). Training to drive power equipment (forklift, raymond reach, order picker)."
good,"Average job- good pay. Management seems like a revolving door sometimes, but they usually hire pretty competent managers. Managers are usually flexible with schedules."
good,"Everyday there were certain things that absolutely had to be done in your department.  the shelves always have to be stocked and all labels have to be front facing.  Not a hard job, but time consuming."
good,"Towards the end of my career, things started changing at the company. The CEO's continued to collect, but started to shake up the work force by cutting positions and moving toward a more part time environment."
good,I worked as a co-manager so I was responsible for the whole store.  Had to be very quick at identifying priorities and taking care of them.  Had to be very flexible in job tasks while having the ability to perform multiple tasks throughout the store.
good,"typical day was getting the associates to complete the daily task and making the install sales were being handled on time, commercial sales was hitting there numbers, verifing the inventory level to ensure instock, follow up with the cash office for deposits, and cash shortages being handled, and deliveries were on time."
good,Never thought I would find myself working in a hardware store. For the first 2 months I felt like I didn't belong there but the managers and coworkers supported me and didn't give up on me when they had every right to. I've been learning skills that I didn't think would ever come across. The difficulty comes from that it is a large store and customers expect answers to their questions that may not be related to your department.
good,"The hardest part of my job is taking on challenges and taking risks. There has been different tasks I've had to complete in a matter of time. You learn not to get stressed out and set your priorities straight. I've learn to have a lot of self control and a lot of patience with this job. Management was okay, not the best in the world when you needed help with something. But I manage my way to get around that if I ever needed help with something or needed advice. A typical day at work would basically I would come in and clean up the department. Make sure the Aisles are clean and well stocked. Making sure the plants are organized on the tables. Making sure the trash is taken out and everything has been swept and blown down inside and outside the department of outside garden. The most enjoyable part of my job is really helping customers, meeting new people everyday, knowing what there goals and accomplishments are everyday."
good,"Training is very easy and quick to learn, the management are very relaxed people and during the work day you would be lucky to see anyone over your supivisor so they stay out of your hair unless you really mess up"
good,"First official job. I would recommend for future peers and or students. "
good,A typical day for me is comprised of multitasking and sometimes I find myself thrust into a leadership and manager role because of my experience. Even though I'm a Pro Services sometimes I feel the need to charge in order accomplish a task or to pass knowledge to someone who is new or doesn't have the knowledge I have in order for them to succeed.
good,Love the vision benefits and the employee discount!  Enjoyable group of people to work with.  Management cares about the people.  Benefits are a bit expensive and spring OT is a must
good,Very stressful on certain days. Very bored on others.  Constant pace at times. Learning experience.  Very fun work environment.  Coworkers and managers were great to work with.
good,Helping customers love where they live. Lowe's is a great place to work. You can move up in the company and work with some pretty amazing people. Lowe's builds a relationship with their customers.
good,Great management and good enviornment. Only left because I wanted there weren't many opportunities for advancement. Would definitely recommend to other aspiring call center representatives.
good,"Some times the day can drag on and on, and other days the place can be filled to the brim and overwhelming. The difference is, there is usually something to be done, and its up to you as an individual to do it."
good,it laid back jobs it teachs you different things in life and how to have a bigger outsight on life show u how to get your house in order and i love helping and seeing smile on other faces
good,It's a really great place to work you work with the public and really great employees that will help you as needed and teach you there way's of doing things making it easier.
good,A good place to work if you are a self starter and do not require to be micromanaged. Many good people and managers. Current job market makes it hard to get people.
good,I believe in the company and respect it. The company does a lot for the community and for it's team. Benefits are excellent and have plenty of opportunity for time off.
good,"I only worked on the weekend team, and wanted to become full time, but at the time there were no positions.  I enjoyed helping customers and found my job easy, because I have many years of experience in the hardware field.  Management was very nice and I learned to work in a big box rather than in a small hardware store."
good,its a good job. a great job to work at. GREAT benefits. Lack of management on the same page. Love co-workers and customers. Its a good company to work for.
good,"On a weekly basis I update our half priced lumber in our system and up-sell our rewards program, business account and revolving accounts, I enjoy working with people."
good,Great environment love the team work and effor put into every situation and customer. They offer great benefits and flexibility. They are very fair and offer many things in general.
good,"As a delivery person the work day is long and at parts boring, my shift would begin in the morning when i would load the trucks and would end after we had finished all of our deliveries, sometimes leading to overtime work.  I got to be good friends with my fellow delivery people and even some managers from other stores we would pick up from."
good,"My job at Lowes was temporary while I was in college, it made me enough money to put gas in my car and pay a few bills. The hours were flexible and they were able to work around me being a full-time student."
good,"I really enjoyed this job for 15 years, however I was forced to retire upon using my FMLA."
good,"Being an outdoors store, it was easier to get through the day, as it kept me preoccupied helping customers, to restocking products. Met a lot of people, which made the days enjoyable."
good,"Typical workday includes printing out my paperwork for locating then staging the next-day deliveries, answering customers' calls, confirming customers' delivery dates, and helping where I am needed within Lowe's. Best part of the job is not having to work within the actual shopping part of the store around customers often, but there's still customers to work with and around when you need to go into the store. My department is in the back and for employees only."
good,"SALES,SALES,SALES!!!!! As a Cashier we had to meet sales quotas. we also had to push for customers to apply for the Lowes Credit Card. The best part of th job is the friendly work environment."
good,"Lowes pays a decent rate for entry level although it is not the best.  Job security is great, and communication with managers and HR is mostly good.  I would recommend working part time to any students or retirees although full time here is inconvenient because they have matrices."
good,Overall Lowe's is not a bad place to work if you are making it a temporary thing. Some days are stressful due to how others treat you. But your experiences are what you make them. I continue to work there because Lowe;s affords me health insurance and time off when requested.
good,"Lowe's was a fantastic place to work. It had the proper balance of hours, pay, management, and coworkers. I worked seasonally for 6 months and the only real qualm I had was the insincerity when I was let go. Other than that, I would wholeheartedly come back and work with that group again."
good,"People were generally positive, wanting to do the best, growing company with lots of opportunity to become efficient.  Management was proactively seeking to be better"
good,"Not a bad company at all. Lowes is a great company for someone who is seeking employment with the ambition  to move up within a good company, many opportunities for advancement"
good,I liked working at Lowe's because it was fast pace. The hours were never the same week by week- That made it very difficult to plan life outside of work. Not healthy by any stretch.
good,Lowes was a great part time job especially for a college student.  I was a full time student and Lowes was extremely flexible with my school schedule.
good,its a great company to work for. very helpful and very dependable. Any questions you have the employees will take the time to find the answers to help to you finish your projects.
good,"Typical day work."
good,"I worked at Lowes on a part-time bases while attending school - management is great!  I would recommend this for a part-time job... The people that work there are great; knowledgeable, polite, easy going."
good,"Perfect position for full or part time, "
good,The IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) manual is the global reference for shipping dangerous goods by air and the only standard recognized by airlines. Training . The 58th edition includes a proposal by the ICAO Dangerous Panel to adopt a Competency-Based Approach for dangerous goods training. See Appendix H .
good,"The employees were all tight-knit, the atmosphere was laid back, and the service was top quality. There were employee parties and some employees even had celebrations if they were leaving."
good,"This is a good company to work for, 90 day probation went by fast. Able to learn many different departments and help customers. if self driven can easily work your way to a department manager in about a year or come in with prior skill set is a plus. Management worked well, and was a pretty smooth running corporation."
good,Advancement opportunities are one of the best parts of this company. Another wonderful part is being encouraged to cross-train in as many areas of the store as possible. You are able to learn from professionals whom know every aspect of DIY! Great compensation and a generally positive employee moral.
good,"Running cash sales, as well as helping customers with directions around the store if needed. Good people, understanding of personal conditions, very family friendly."
good,i had a work injury from lowes i would have continued working there. i learned how to communicate with customers and how to handle difficult questions
good,The emloyees and most of the customer are what made working at this particular lowes enjoyable. The many changes to management at the store level did make work more stressful at times especially when were had alot of managers leaving and coming.
good,"I liked working there, they worked with you if you needed to change hours for most reasons. There is definately room to move positions or even to move up within the company."
good,"Great place to work"
good,"Helped estimaters with their quotes. Scheduled appointments, answered phone. Some days were stressful tension in the office between bosses made it uncomfortable."
good,"The environment is nice. Employees get along great, no work issues. Customers tend to get rude very often. Would recommend as temp job but not forever"
good,"Not a bad experience, management seems to get overwhelmed by bigger bosses which falls upon employees. Complaints about management falls on deaf ears."
good,"Job was good ,but they had trouble with keeping people. people came and went, we were short handed most of the time. and when we asked for help, they could not come up with it. but there seamed to be lots of bosses there."
good,"I worked in the Lumber department where you are required to maintain, help and assess customer needs ranging from simple product locations all the way to having to cut a few wooden boards to the desired length with a mounted skill saw."
good,"You get an hr break, a lot of benefits. "
good,"enjoy the interaction with customers, enjoy learning departments which help the time pass, always helping out departments that are in need of help , give input on how to clean up departments."
good,"Everyone got along well together. Work and personal life seemed to effect the work environment. Everyone cared about each other like if they missed a day of work, they would see if everything is alright."
good,"The work associates are great and helpful.  Most associates are close nit like a family.  We have a good management support staff."
good,Sometimes little to no support in the smaller facilities. Number driven. Lowes has done a lot restructuring which less people same jobs. I truly enjoy working here.
good,"Good job with somewhat flexible hours. Once you’re familiar with the store it gets easier. You cross train, so cutting glass, tile, pipe threading, tinting paint etc, is easy"
good,"As a Fortune 50 company, Lowes is a good to place to work at with good people at all levels. For me it was my first job straight out of university and it was a good experience learning about the ins and outs of corporate culture and how to operate, manage, and collaborate with others in an enterprise environment. The benefits were great, the people I worked with were great, and overall the work life balance motto at the company really did strive to have employees manage their work life balance with flexible working hours at the office and remotely. The only thing was that during my time there, there were many upper management level decisions that led to a series of events that led to changes that continuously hammered at employee morale. There many more changes that affected many, but as for whether they were positive or negative, only time will tell."
good,A typical day at work the work is not hard .You clock in get your department phone get your vest and go out on the floor start helping customers.Half way through your shift you get one hour for lunch. After lunch you do the rest of your day what ever needs doing.             What I learned is some people just want a check and don't want to work. For must part management is good some of them try hard to help out. The workplace culture is good every get alone. the hardest part of the job is when you are the only employee in the department and you have 5 to 6 people need help at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you are able to help customers get what they need and they thank you and leave with a smile.
good,you learn how a drive forklift have 3 days off managers respect you. The work is very heavy and there is teamwork but it doesnt work well. They say you are supposed to lift only 60 pounds by yourself but you have to lift 80 pounds.
good,OK workplace but I wanted to focus on my trade/skill as a carpenter and designer more. I am more of a hands on person inspired by in field carpentry or construction worker!
good,"Working at Lowe's was fast paced but enjoyable. Was very busy at times, but sometime it was slow. Working freight or helping customers would fill this slow time. I learned allot at Lowe's, they have extensive training programs in all departments. Rep's would come in and help you learn about their product weekly. Management was nice and always helpful. The only downside to Lowe's was at the time I worked there they couldn't offer a full time position. Most positions were part-time."
good,"One thing I enjoy about working at Lowe's is the willingness they take to adapt to the technological advancements. Online ordering direct from a local store, ELD in the delivery trucks, iphone delivery management system and Same day pick up in store. You can also head in to the store and sit down with a Specialist and see on a computer what your upgrades will look like in your house before you buy."
good,The hours there were all over the place.  One day you may work day shift the next day you may work nights then turn around and open.  You never had weekends or holidays off.
good,I loved working at Lowes. My coworkers were kind people and I always enjoyed when I went into work. If I had the chance I would go back simply because it was such a healthy work environment overall
good,"Good working environment with team building goals and opportunities to advance. Hard work is required, but associates will learn about the home improvement industry."
good,"I typical would greet several regular customers on my way  to punch in for work. Some would say hi others would stop me to help them with their current project."
good,"Best staff to work with. Upbeat friendly environment. Great support and encouragement. Fun atmosphere. Great opportunities to troubleshoot, learn and grow. Love the challenges, and feeling of accomplishment."
good,Lowes is a good place to work. Management is fair and my coworkers are enjoyable.  I would recommend this job to anyone interested in working in retail
good,"Great company to work, good work life balance. If you want a trouble free life then this is the place. Negotiate well for salary and get the best package. ask for joining bonus. Hike is good in this company."
good,Great place if you can only work part-time since it offers insurance and paid time off. There are also plenty of chances to move up in posistion or change departments.
good,Excelente ambiente de trabajo y clima laboral asi como sus instalaciones
good,"Never had a problem with any of my managers, and customers were fairly friendly because most of what they were buying wasn't a must. Although you would get the occasional rude customer but that just happens in this kind of business."
good,LOwes is okay to work at but cut cost alot with hours and full time positions available.  They also add to job duties due to lack of coverage because of cutting hours of partime employees in which make up most of the employee roster.
good,"My commute is 30-35 minutes. What I've learned is that retail is not for everyone, you'll get your fair share of good and bad customers. The management is good, nobody is perfect. I've been there for 6 years, they're almost like family. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with great employees, training them on what to do. My job was easy for me anyways because I knew how to do it well. The hardest part really was just standing around doing nothing at times. other than that, the company is just fine."
good,Good for a starter job. Not a lot f room for advancement. Easy job for college students looking for extra money. At times can be stressful but usually relaxed.
good,This is great place to work but management was not that great. something in my family happened and they were very rude and just didnt care at all and thats why i left.
good,At the start of the shift we would go threw our order management then start looking for customers that may need help with anything that we could provide
good,Keep calling customers and develop positive relationships. Help customers throughout store with product questions and ways to fix their problem if they have any.
good,There is always something to be done in the hardware department. Everyone is very motivated to be working at Lowes. We are constantly stocking the shelves and making big sales.
good,"The job is fun and often challenging. However, I am part-time and at the beginning of 2018, work hours have been cut to 15 hours per week. I just cannot live on those few hours."
good,"Each week I have several areas to review reports, set up resale, research products.  It keeps each week very busy for me and very satisfying.  Associates I work with are all extremely helpful and great to work with.  Management has been good.  Benefits are good for me."
good,I was a subcontractor at Lowes. Every morning i arrived at 6:45am loaded my truck up with deliveries and started my day. Usually a delay waiting on Lowes but that wasn't a major issue.
good,"fast pace  always changing best methods . a very safety culture, start up was always the hardest , good people to work with . the only place that had its own restaurant"
good,"This job was great if you like talking to people. Finding out everyone's projects, seeing pictures before and after, creating life long friends, this is great for a people person. The hardest part is standing on the concrete floor all day but it was worth it."
good,Good overall retail company. Can be tough to advance. Benefits are and can be pricey. Fair compensation based on experience. On feet all day talking to various customers.
good,"I started as a seasonal employee and was then hired for full time position. The only thing that I did not like was that they did not like to advance employees to management from within the store, so if you wanted to go up you needed to leave your store."
good,Typical day at Lowes for me requires me to first go find a manager/supervisor to make sure if any department is short handed and if they need my help. I they answer yes I will spend my shift helping said department co workers and customer alike. when it is not very busy I take a walk around the store looking for customers indeed of assistance and try my best to help them out.
good,"physical, mental, fast paced, multi tasking all day long.  I learned how to deal with stress and be positive.  I learned how to manage different type of people.  It was a fast past, competitive environment.  Hardest part of job was putting up large amount of heavy freight daily.  I truly enjoyed helping people to find what they wanted to purchase and sharing my product knowledge with them.  It made me feel really good to see people be able to feel confident in their purchasing of the product which they needed"
good,it was a good job I like helping customers and stocking products. good co workers and manager and asst managers. over all good experience and good products .
good,"Lots of physical demand for lifting and moving tile, flooring, mortar around. Hard to keep up on keeping the department looking presentable with how busy the department gets with customers wanting details written up, following up with customers. Helping customers down the aisles and keeping inventory stocked, presentable and clean."
good,Not bad for a summer job. Pay isn't anything to write home about but the employees were friendly. Work days began around 6 which isn't too terrible but it was a hard adjustment.
good,"Daily meetings, communicate with managers for feedback and problem solving .Help  customers with products and restoration projects. Place orders for installations."
good,"Staffing has, and continues to be lacking, with several positions being eliminated, and more on the way, with the CEO continuing to receive multi million dollar bonuses while stores suffer. "
good,Lowe's overall is a great company to work for. They are very flexible with school and work and does not mind giving you more hours if asked. I would recommend this job to students in college.
good,"It was a great place to work but didn't meet the goals I was going for.. good management, nice people, great atmosphere and the best thing is you meet people all the time"
good,"I Enjoyed Teaching painting Classes There, Working with other Employees and Learning from their Knowledge and Skills Of The Job. "
good,"I have been there almost a year, and still like going to work. It is easier now that I know where everything goes, so it doesn't take me long to get my job done. The co-workers vary, from very intelligent to somewhat weird, but mostly all are nice to me and know me by name. The day shift is sometimes hectic and under staffed.mostly."
good,It's a job that I kept not planning to stay at for the long term.  It's is temporary and serves it's purpose while I looking for something else and take a break from the mental health system.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Lowe's, my co-workers made the day go by quickly. Working black friday is mandatory, but there isn't a large crowd of customers usually."
good,"Laid back and slow paced but can become busy at times, very independent job. Requires a lot of organization skills and good memory. Must be good at customer service and be able to listen closely to what customers say in order to provide the best service possible."
good,"Good place to work with great benefits.  401k stock options are great along with insurance (dental, vision and medical).  Get 3 weeks of paid vacation after 5 years which is great.  Have to wait to 15 years before you get an additional week though of vacation"
good,"It is a good job to have. I wouldn't make it a career path but its a good job. Hard on the body, so be prepared. Management is good and the co workers or easy to get along with, just do your job. Invest in good shoes for concrete. Summer is very busy, long hours and then towards the end of Summer depending on your department, it slows down."
good,"a normal day is quite busy. i have to maintain the paint desk, which includes matching, mixing, and customizing customers specific choices. im also responsible for aisles two through seven including paint products,cleaning supplies,caulking, home decor, glue and tape. i also cut head rails, vanes, and faux wood shades. customers are both the hardest and most enjoyable part of the job. seeing someone smile and commend you for how you've helped them is very gratifying. in the same aspect it can be extremely busy in my dept., literally non stop for hours."
good,"clock in, start down stocking any items that you need to, stay focused, walk store if not busy to offer assistance to shopping customers till lunch then back for a repeat till you clock out to go home"
good,Lowe's is customer focused and recognizes its employees as the foundation for their success. Lowe's offers very competitive rates and their benefits are some of the best available.
good,"The only issue is that they increase and decrease hours based on their sales numbers... The environment though is collaborative, warm and friendly. A nice place to work..."
good,"Very good job , i loved it. Great people and pay, lovely atmosphere they sometimes provided food and snacks in the break room. Felt good about getting up everyday to have a busy day at Lowe's"
good,"Balance registers before store opens, research overages and shortages, work registers, process credit card payments, assist customers with products, customer service and returns"
good,"Overall good company to work for with Local employee.The store manager war awesome, he respected me and That made me respect him all the more. My department manager was very supported to my department with suggestion and information."
good,"I loved working for this company and the people involved, good management and an understanding HR crew. They were very helpful and caring at all times truly care about there emplyoees"
good,"A daily, weekly, and monthly checklist need to be worked often. i manage a part time employee and delegate jobs as needed. The management changes often. I have learned a lot of new skills."
good,"Sure, it's customer service, but as far as that goes, it really wasn't too bad. You're mostly helping customers and learning about home improvement. I would say it was the most educational job I've had. I was working part time while I was there, and getting into a full time position I wanted was tricky at the time. So that's why I left."
good,If you are a good sales person and have energy you can progress quickly with this company.  Offers a full table of benefits and assistance programs.  Has many policies and standards for the benefit of the company and employee.
good,My typical day at work is to process pricing and creating labels. I have learned how to become more independent and able to help customers and buy what they need.
good,The only negative thing about it is you have to have completely open availability to work full time. They have a swing shift rotating schedule. Its very demanding and takes a toll very quickly. I left to move to another state and get more time with my young children.
good,I was always busy either helping customers or working on special orders.  Management was great they taught you as much as they could.  Long days and good pays.
good,"good overall experience, really good for a student I would say, part time pays well. good people, decent hours. learn new skills and put to use in the store and at home"
good,Good management structure that rewards its employees with internal advancement opportunities. It’s retail so the work life balance is horrible but the atmosphere is good with good employee morale.
good,Working at lowe's you are always busy everyone there is friendly an makes work fun outside garden is always busy. but its always pretty with all the plants they have.
good,"Enjoyed working with the customers discussing their projects and helping with materials necessary."
good,Great place to start if you're unemployed.The pay is fine.You work for every cent though.They have three shifts.Days are from 6am-4:30pm Mon-Thurs.Nights are from 7pm-4:30am Mon-Thurs.Weekends are Fri-Sun 6am-6:30pm.
good,"this is one my favorite jobs ive had and wish it wasnt just a seasonal job, the work environment was very relaxed and u knew what u needed to get done and could take ur time and get things finsihed on time"
good,"I enjoy working with the public, helping people with their home needs.  I have enjoyed learning the many different aspects of being a sales specialist."
good,Lowes is a very good company to work for if you have the right managers who cultivate a good work environment and not putting too much stress on select few individuals
good,Lowes is a quick paced style job. You must be knowledgeable.  You have to be willing to communicate with customers on a regular basis and keep a positive attitude.
good,"I really enjoyed working at lowes, and would love to work there again. It was an excellent environment and had plenty or opportunity for success. The flooring department helped me learn many useful life lessons."
good,I worked at the distribuition center operating a fork lift and helping out with the spanish speaking empoyees. Lowes was a good place to work with good pay.
good,Working for Lowes as a Cabinet designer was fun.  When you weren't in that department you were literally thrown in other departments to help each and every customer you came across.  They were always training you on stuff as well.
good,I enjoyed working at Lowe's and had an opportunity to expand my knowledge. The people were really great to work with and the management was responsive to problems.
good,It was a positive environment with a great staff. Management was good and the company appreciated its employees. Opportunity for advancement was acceptable and the pay was very good.
good,Sign onto register at the department in which you are working. Scan items of the customers merchandise. Greet and sell Lowe's products to the customer. Assist  customers in departments.
good,"My job involved using a computer to special order products for the customer, however, the system was VERY outdated and as a result extremely slow and difficult to use"
good,"a normal day you unload freight onto pallets then bring it to its department. I learned how to use a forklift, reach truck, and order picker. it is fun to work at lowes"
good,"I am proud to work for Lowes 'part time, It suites my Home life as well., I get to spend more time with my Husband, and Family, I have never worked a job, Where I have had weekend's off"
good,Lowes was a great place to work full of great people and great leadership. Lowes really focuses on safety which for a business like that I think it is something important for them to focus on.
good,"job atmosphere is good management is sometime questionable, it get sometimes overwhelming because if short staffing but nothing to crazy.. could have a bit more stringent policies"
good,"at lowes i learned how to make paint, make keys, cut carpet, and perform any duty i need to do there. im now in appliances and sell appliances. the hardest part of this job is dealing with unhappy customers."
good,It's a very busy store got to learn new thing in the paint department an the lumber department show me new things to do around the house the pay is good an u get all the benefits the managers was nice
good,"Some days are really fast paced, it can be a challenge to some and enjoyable to others. I've learned how to be more patient. Management has negative and positive days, depends on the individual. Hardest part of the job is being heard on certain things. Most enjoyable part of my job is that I'm always busy."
good,"A typical day for me was come in do my daily maintenance. Put away freight,  Help customers throughout the store, Call customers with delivery dates, updates, questions. Help out in the Paint department because we were always short staffed. Take a lunch when I could (rarely had time to take the 2 15 min brakes). Clean up after customers, restock shelves, keep area(s) clean and orderly."
good,I have enjoyed working at Lowe's but I am planning to work for a time longer and need more challenge. I enjoy working with the customers and employees at Lowe's.
good,"Even though I was hired as just a cashier I was able to try different positions in the short time I worked there. I did the phones, returns, the floor, check out, etc. etc. The people were fantastic, it was well run. It was a pleasure to work for them for the summer."
good,Working for Lowe's is a great learning experience (from both coworkers and customers) on home projects and repairs if you don't know anything regarding those subjects. There's room to grow within the company.
good,"It has been a good place to work.  Good benefits.  Worked my way up to department manager until corporate decided to restructure store management.   We have a very dedicated hard working team, a well performing store"
good,"•	Provide above average customer service to new and retaining customers"
good,"I was able to stay busy and do a good job of what was expected of me. I worked as part of a team, but I was also able to be responsible for my own work."
good,"Lowes was better than other retailers. The company wants to do right by its customers, and it realizes that taking care of the employees is important. Each store and location has its own culture and management team, so you have to try to do some research to see if it will be a fit for you."
good,Lowes was a good place to work because it allowed me to develop my customer service skills.  The interactions with customers allowed my communication skills  to develop.
good,"Went to work did the the tasked that were required for me to do. "
good,I was pleased with their structure and leadership. Got plenty of training and support for the position I held (Night Stocking Manager.) Only reason I decided to leave was their restructuring of the managerial positions. I understood the why but did not want to be a part of a company who chooses to bring everyone in for a meeting to say they're going to have to fight for the new positions created by corporate and that those not chosen will have to make other arrangements.
good,A typical work day at Lowes was hot or cold depending what the weather was outside. But over all it was good. I was a forkfit driver. I picked the products from the shelf and took it to the trucks
good,lowes was a very coool place to work. It showed me that you are able to work in a fast pace environment and still get things done as a team. Team work really does make the dream work.
good,"I worked my way up to dept manager and then they eliminated that position from the company, so i was disappointed. Overall it was a good place to work and I would of stayed there through retirement. The hours are not the best but it is retail. They pay better than other box stores."
good,It hard work we are short hand right how with personal I have to help out in some dept but it okay I get to learn things in each dept the work place culture in management is not that great.
good,"Typical work..some what stressful..learn, leRn, learn...if you want to go up. Culture is a little clicky.Most enjoyable part is teaching and training new associates."
good,I only worked as a temp on the unload team offloading freight 4 hours a night but it was a great job for part time work. Pretty relaxed bunch to work with and not that stressful of a job.
good,"Overall, Lowe's is very well organized. At times, management made poor decisions, but that did not change my perspective of the over all company. They have a great culture."
good,Enjoyed working a Lowe's. As a second job really they worked around my schedule with my fulltime job. They offer lots of training and opportunity to advance.
good,I worked  in the  call center  and  you were  almost  always in queque where  the  phones  never  stop  ringing and  you get  one  call after  another
good,Very good entry level jobs. Takes time to move up the career ladder but can be worth the wait. Managers were fair at all times. Also was rewarding of good performance as a whole. Cookouts were a regular thing for achieving goals within the company.
good,"Lowes is a good place to work. I would work there again. Since it is retail the schedule is not perfect. There may be days you get scheduled to work that would prefer to be off , but scheduling is about as good as you could expect given the times and days the stores are open for business. As I said before I would work there again."
good,"It can equal out to both positive and negative experiences, mostly customer interaction is the worst considering their in a home improvement store and their not willing to accept anyone else's opinion or idea but their own. I found the (sub) management to be the worst, they either edited work schedules without informing you or put their work assignments off on lower employees. On the other hand, you usually find something to keep you busy or assisting customers will fill most of your shifts. HR department are easy to work with and will help if any personal issues arise, and the dog/pet friendly policy is pretty cool. If your first applying, the base rate per hour is $10, don't be afraid to negotiate your wages after their ""wage calculator"" spits out a number. Pretty standard retail experience with a few niche details."
good,"Lowes is an interesting place to work where no 2 days are the same."
good,"Very quick paced job with high stress at times. Other than that a very nice work place, a great first job to learn new skills and better yourself. I learned a lot about operating forklifts and other pieces of equipment since i started working here."
good,"Lowes is one big system that operates at a micro and macro level. If good communication is kept the store functions much better. When more stores function better, then the company as a whole functions better. Everybody plays an instrumental role throughout the entire payroll."
good,"Everyone I worked with was friendly and there was some opportunity, depending on what department you worked in. I didn't like some of the management changes they made. I feel this will create more problems in the future."
good,I enjoyed my position at Lowes.  I learned something new on a regular basis.  It is a typical big box retail store. Local management was good to work with.  Making sure customer demands were met was the most difficult part of the job.  Customer satisfaction was the most enjoyable.
good,"I worked part time while going to school, and Lowes worked with me on hours and schedules.  It was hard work but we still were allowed to enjoy each other."
good,I enjoy working for this company. A typical work day is working side by side your team and ensuring day to day operations are being ran efficiently. While doing this assisting our customers to ensure they are satisfied.
good,lots of great people to work with and the management treats you fair and doesn't belittle you in anyway. the jobs are easy to learn and the people are well trained in what they do.
good,Day of work at Lowe's was sometimes stressful but more rewarding.   Loved my job as a picing coordinator.  Learned a lot during my 12 years there.  Would love to be able to show my strengths in the company
good,"Lowes coworkers were excellent. My customers were  excellent. It was fun helping people improve their life through home improvement. Although the hours were irregular, I recommend working at Lowes."
good,"Lots of promotion opportunity, work with a great team, fair work life balance, decent pay for skill level, paid vacation, company match 401k, decent medical benefits"
good,"Contamos con 10 dias flexibles adicionales a los de ley"
good,"Work depends on the department. I was in the outside lawn and garden department which in my opinion was the most difficult. I was outside in the sun 80% of the day which isn't pleasant if you're in a warm environment. due to policies you must assist customers with handling heavy and dirty items (such as bags of dirt/manure/mulch/sand/rocks/fertilizer/lime, slabs of concrete/grass, bricks, fencing, metal poles, etc.). there's a lot to learn about plants and soil as well. keep in mind that you'll most likely be needed in other departments of the store which means you have to gain some knowledge about more of the products you sell."
good,"Lowes was a great place to work. All of my coworkers and leaders were very friendly and easy to get along with, which made for a great work day. You will learn many things about home improvement as an added bonus."
good,Good advancement opportunity. Solid company direction. Work life balance is acceptable.Clear cut processes and operations.Solid foundation and proven track record.
good,I learned a lot about home improvement and met some great customers that became friends. Hardest part of the job was having to stand on the concrete for 10 hours and making cold calls to commercial customers.
good,My expectation when I get to work is hard labor rain or shine. I truly enjoy working around others. Different cultures and age group gives me a lot of insight on the world around me. I come prepare for everyday situations around me.
good,Lowe's gives you back what you choose to put into it. I started as a CSA in 2013 and rose to the position of a Service Manager. Lot's of good people but a lot of pockets of negativity which requires you to spend all of your time focusing on the negativity.
good,The job can be slow with some days there being nothing to do. Overall management is easy to talk to and willing to help you with scheduling needs and work life balance is important.
good,"Good group of people, very costumer oriented atmosphere. Sales goals are reasonable and employee appreciation is adequate and often. I am currently employed by Lowes but want to broaden my advancment opportunities"
good,"I enjoyed everyone i worked with at Lowes. What was the inevitable reason that i left was that for one I wanted to move to Florida, and two, many people tend to not be in a good mood when they go to a hardware store. I'm a very nice guy and can start a conversation with anybody. But I found it difficult here. Other than that it's a great place to work. I was only seasonal at the time so i didn't receive any benefits other than a store discount. But from what i was told, once you get to full time the benefits were amazing."
good,Lowes is a great working environment my time there was great. The management and people in charge were always helpful. It works perfect for part time and those trying to make a little extra cash.
good,"Fast Paced work environment Ability to move throughout all areas of the store; sales floor, receiving, register areas, lawn and garden, including the outside perimeter of the store. Ability to work in both inside and outside environmental conditions. Physical ability to move large, bulky and/or heavy merchandise. Physical ability to perform tasks that may require prolonged standing, sitting, and other activities necessary to perform job duties"
good,"Scheduled 10 hours per day, but worked till job done"
good,"Working at Lowe's as my first job has been a great experience. I've learned a lot about home improvement in general from being in different departments like paint, millwork, lawn and garden, flooring and plumbing. I wish I could stay in one department rather than being thrown into a different department every few weeks. Right when I get good at something, bam!, new department."
good,"Great place to work, pretty flexible, very supportive. Loves to promote from with in. Great place to learn how corporations work regarding customer relations and support toward their employees."
good,"Enjoy working with people, Helping people, Enjoy working together with other employees. Enjoy being apart of a great corporation . Great company to work for"
good,"Although the compensation is great, Lowe's is always understaffed, leaving associates stressed and overwhelmed (not to mention very frustrated customers). Management is friendly for the most-part, but most of management has unrealistic expectations of what should get done around the store. With very limited staffing, it's difficult for associates to assist customers and even more difficult for them to get anything done in their department. The size of the store allows employees to work without being supervised the majority of the time. This allows less motivated employees to get away with slacking off, creating more work and frustration for others. Lowe's rotating schedule makes it extremely difficult to make plans outside of work (unless you submit a request-off form at least a month in advance). The only positives that I can think is the compensation is pretty good for working in retail and working with some awesome coworkers."
good,Great place to work lots of opportunity. scheduling is flexible.Retail environment provides opportunity to work with many different people lots of diversity.
good,"The company itself is a great place to work. They have had a lot of"
good,Worked as a delivery driver. Typical day began with a stop at the driver's office to receive route delivery plans and keys. Then you get the truck and back it to the loading dock to be loaded with materials and appliances. You load the truck and sort everything in a stop by stop fashion. Management worked well with employees and very helpful. Learned how to plan a route and watch for problems along the way. Hardest part of the job was making deliveries at night where it is difficult to see low lying wires and building structures. What I liked best about the job was the fact that I can help people/customers in the store and out on the route by delivering their items or helping them with a purchase.
good,Lowes is a great place to work and the people are for the most part all friendly. For me it was just a far drive nothing against the company just my travel time was a bit of a distance from where I live. Overall a good place to work if you don't mind keeping busy and working.
good,"Regular days at Lowe's are not as busy, we help out each other so we can finish all our work, i have learned how to work in every department, the hardest part would be the heat, which i don't mind too much."
good,"Very low demand job. Not to stressful and most other employees were nice and easy going. Not to many bad customers, most know what products they want to get."
good,"Job is ongoing,never ending, days fly by.    Major emphasis on customer focus, so much that performance bonuses will not be achieved without first, exceeding customer focus scores.  "
good,"Lowes company is customer and  sales focused as top priorities. Training is excellent, giving every associate the tools  necessary  to succeed  in  their positions. The atmosphere in the store setting is team oriented, and all  employees  are considered to be important assets for the success of the store and the company overall . The management team is always available to work with each associate."
good,Fast paced retail job. A lot of chance for advancement. Work environment goes through changes regularly and have to adapt. The work environment widely differ from store to store.
good,"Definitely a place that everyone is very accessible.  I even worked a lunch rush with the owners of the company . Because of the fact that there wasn't that many employees needed to run the store , there wasn't thst much room for growth."
good,"My work day consisted of implementation of Lowe's safety standards in my department, checking email for messages from management or fellow associates, calling prospective customers in efforts to close sales, follow up with current sales customers up until projects are finished."
good,I have worked at Lowe's for the past 4 years. It is a friendly atmosphere to work in. I was hired as a weekday team member but my duties has out grown that job title. The part-time worker benefits are good for vision and dental.
good,The culture of the company is great but the pay doesn't match up to other warehouses. You have the ability to move up within the company but you can get  released from your position for any reason upper management feels necessary no matter how long you have been with the company. Overall its a great place to work I like it.
good,"Worked in the rdc, distribution center, and was paid pretty well. The environment was very family oriented. The work was hard with the benefit that if you went above and beyond you would recieve bonus checks."
good,I love this job. Co workers are extremely nice and all the long work makes the day go a lot faster. Friendly environment but not built for people who are lazy.
good,"I enjoy working at Lowe's.  I really get the atmosphere and the customer base.  I feel that before the recent changes, we were on track to beat our competition.  Unfortunately, the Corona Pilot began.  I went from Del/Rec DM to Support Manager.  No one know who I was because we were in a pilot program.  It made doing my job very difficult.  Then when it rolled out to the company, my store downsized and I lost my position.  I use to think that I could move up but with the removal of so many management positions, I no longer feel that there are opportunities for me."
good,"I've been working for Lowe's for 2 years and 2 months now and I gotta say, I love it. My main complaint is with management. They don't take enough time out of their schedule to see how the team is doing and it seems like they worry about sales too often. "
good,A different type of customers. Was a really good job and enjoyed it very much. Part time hours though so had to leave for a full-time job. Management was wonderful.
good,Lowe's is a good company to work for.  It provides good benefits and genuinely care about their employees.  Lowe's constantly provides appreciation to their employees financially and physically with different events and accolades.
good,"I answered phone calls, pulling online orders and updating the status of customer's orders. Resolving customer complaints, making sure that customers are satisfied."
good,all the co-workers ive worked with are great just the management and the time where they can change your schedule and wont call you to tell you that they changed your schedule but they give you a portal username and password to see if your schedule has changed or not.
good,Great place to work.  It's just time to move on and spend evenings and weekends with family.  Recent changes in the company are not working currently.
good,Best company I have ever worked for up to the time of this review. Love the people I work with. You qualify for benefits even as a part-timer. They really work hard to take care of me and make accommodations for my medical condition as well.
good,I liked working here it was easy the pay was just small but I had a family to feed so I made the best of it... I left this job for a better paying job.
good,I learned how to use all the computer systems and my job pretty quick. The management was really easy to talk to so I could voice my opinions. I learned how to use the order picker and ballymore.
good,"A typical day at work is very busy with a lot of different things going on at once,you have to be very good at multitasking to keep up.The customers are pretty demanding and management expects you to be capable of taking care of their needs.The hardest part of the job is trying to comply with several requests at once,which can be overwhelming at times.The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with the customers and feeling good about helping them."
good,"I liked working here. Its a pretty chill place. Good break rooms, It didn't seem like the managers were on you all the time.  Its busy enough not to be too boring, and not too busy that you don't have time to relax. "
good,"I have been working at Lowes for 10 years, so a lot of changes have occurred. Some for the good and some not so good. The people I work with are great and are easy to work with."
good,"Checking out customers and handling refunds, keeping work area clean at all times, restocking shelves by registers, handling customer complaints, Directing customers on where to find merchandise, Answering multi-phone lines and maintaining excellent customer service while practicing loss prevention."
good,"Great place to work. A place where you know everyone and enjoy working. Not a fan of the schedules that they make you work, but that is something you deal with where ever you go."
good,A typical day at work entails stocking shelves and just working with customers in general. Very wide range of clients. At times management can be hard to locate or pin down but for the most part very helpful. The hardest part is some of the heavy lifting of toilets and vanities. I really enjoy working with customers helping them remodel their bathrooms. For the most part customers can be very polite but also needy at the same time. I always enjoy having a customer come back and shower me pics of the finished remodels and know they are happy with the end result.
good,enjoyed my time here although a lot has changed I feel I was cared about and it was easy as far as work life balance there are stressful times but great environment overall
good,"Lowe's is a very fast paced company. However, it takes time to appreciate it's employees. on staff HR which provides a professional environment. Great benefits. I would recommend this company to anyone."
good,Lowe's has been great to me.  I just feel the role I was hired for has become obsolete and I need another challenge.  I feel that there are other opportunities that I would thrive and grow as a manager and sales representative.
good,Alwasy learn something new never have a boring day and lots of work. Have great people working there but need more team players. Always helping customers.
good,"I started working there after I worked at Home Depot, so I had a lot to evaluate as this became my new job. Right off the bat, employees were very nice and willing to help if you needed it. Management was ""ok."" I say OK because there were a lot of fake promises that were repeated. They fired a lot of great workers and kept the lazy ones who hardly ever did anything. Working up at the front end I often had to solve problems for the other workers who were there way longer than I have been. On the Other hand, I have never had a job where I felt so at home and so peaceful in my surroundings. A place where my coworkers became my family. I love the people, not the company."
good,Great  employer.  Easy to get along with coworkers.  Using power equipment happens every single day.  So experience is gained on stuff like a fork lift.
good,"For the most part, I enjoyed my time there at Lowe's. Unfortunately with cut backs and business decisions, people sometimes are in the wrong place at the wrong time."
good,"I had a great time working for the company and was given some great opportunities. My only issues arose when I was promised upper management opportunities based on my performance. 2 opportunities that basically promised to me were given to external applicants with ""more experience"" and 1 was cancelled after I was told I was chosen for the position but before the job offer was given. This was demoralizing after the amount of work I put in. I see this as a poor judgement call by upper management. I really enjoyed the culture and customer service with the company."
good,"Great work environment, great people, great coworkers. Great. Benefits, depending on the job you're applying for sometimes you do not work on weekends"
good,"Whole place tries to build you up to what you'd like to become.It's retail so you have to deal with customers, coworkers, and bosses like any other job. But it's a wonderful environment to be in most days."
good,I was working full-time and also a full-time college student so i didn't reap the same benefits others did but it was an overall great experience.....
good,"A typical day started as soon as I turned on the light at my register. There were always lots of customers, usually pretty satisfied, good people to work with and I was always comfortable with my surroundings. I learned that even unhappy customers just want to feel like their needs are important and usually are just looking for resolve. Everybody I worked with was always willing to help, always open minded and willing to listen. The only conflict I had with the job or the people was the inability for scheduling to be addressed as needed for my situation even though it was a point that was discussed during my original interview, which ultimately led to my resignation."
good,It's just like any other job good days and bad but I have many good days. Only thing was I worked there for 2 years and had 3 store managers over the years
good,Every day is a lesson in humility. The people that come into the store typically need to be taken care of. The problem is that many of them don't know it and a few of them will take out their anger/wrath on the salesperson.
good,This was a great place to work with constant change and excitement. Great employees and job security with good benefits. Good procedures and training.
good,great place to work ...excellent employees ....Management is very nice .....culture is definitely diverse ....the hardest part of the job is nothing its all about learning what you want to learn.
good,"worked morning shift hard work place but good pay good management excellent benfits you worked long hrs sometimes and over time a lot."
good,"It was a very upbeat job, everyone was very suppotive. "
good,"Zero accountability. I don't mind working hard to make my job easier but the work load is not equally distributed. Working in Millwork they hired an older (late 40s) woman as the full time CSA. She flat out said she could not/would not stock the doors. I complained to management all the way to the top and was told ""she has no weight restrictions so she should,"" yet nothing changed, no help."
good,"Work was new learning experience ."
good,Being.l a full time college student LOWES and the management have been understanding of circumstances and have helped me to continue working while at school.
good,"Enjoyed designing kitchen and baths for people looking for upgrades or building new homes. Hours were difficult to adjust too but it was a "
good,Lowe's is a great place to work because they offer intense training in order to give low supervision. This allows for the build of trust between employees and superiors.
good,"This was a great job to have if you are in school or if you are young and want to build a career with lowes. lots of options to advances. great atmosphere and customer service. the bosses let oyou know they appreciate you. can be stressful, but all customer service is."
good,"As a temporary part time employee it was a fast paced busy environment with management support for success."
good,unload trucks put merchandise away. life was easy for the unlad team. it can however be physically demanding. Most managers will treat you with the utmost respect and are flexible with life hiccups.
good,"The job was kind of hard in that it required to do a lot of strenuous work and in the heat, but that's my kind of thing.  Your work team and boss are great to work with.  Just be ready to deal with customers that sales dump on you."
good,"fast paced"
good,"Not a bad job, fairly easy when you learn the position and products. If you're a good worker it is not hard to excel within the company.  Favoritism can be a factor with management but if you're a team player helping out doesn't go unnoticed. The particular store I worked at had a great group of people and there is a lot you can learn. At the end of the day it is a retail position, however, pay is comparatively better than some other companies."
good,"Lowe's is an interesting place to work and provides its workers with a great deal of opportunity to learn new skills in the various departments such as pain, electrical, and hardware."
good,I like working here have good employees and experience. I like the hours and the people I work with. Sometimes the days get long and we work hard. Overall a good experience.
good,"A typical day at Lowes was a very happy environment, everyday you learned what was more important to customers. Managers treated you like family the culture of this workplace was friendly."
good,"Great pay, great benefits, lack luster management, but overall a great place to work. Hours are long, days are hard, if you can't lift, don't apply here."
good,"While the job is slightly repetitive, it is usually fast paced. You get to meet many different people, as well as develop a relationship with repeat customers."
good,The workplace is ever changing with different requirements on a daily basis.  It is a fairly seasonal place to work while living in the NW and the winters are fairly slow.  But that is all made up for during the busy seasons.  Great group of people to work with and they really only hire the best for permanent positions.
good,"I love working for Lowe's.  Great pay, excellent benefits.  As a full-time employee you have a set schedule and every other weekend off. This company is excellent for a work/life balance."
good,Overall good company. work life balance very hard. good people working there. Company changes to keep up with every changing time. Good benefits and salaries .
good,This was my 2nd job and one I did well at. Lots of room for advancement and fairly well compensated. Good job for someone who wants a to make it a career
good,"As the human resource manager each day offers something different. A very fast paced environment which requires the ability to multi task at the extreme. "
good,"good place this is a long review that I am not entitled to write.  I don't quite feel like writing a long review about this place.  Really good people to work with.  Hard workers that don't slack off, however management could use some help in areas."
good,"9 hour days at most and they typically go by pretty quick and painlessly. It's a solid place to work and they pay a bit more than their competitor. Most higher positions are filled from within the store, so there's a fair amount of upward mobility."
good,"They work with your school hours, and pay fairly well. They provide cookouts and other events to show appreciation to their employees. They give out a raise every year."
good,"I worked with Lowe's for almost 16 years.  In that time I saw multiple staffing model restructures.  I did not advance through the 2017 changes.  I took years of management experience with me that I value very much.  I understand big box retail thinking and know that it was only a business decision.  This does not prevent me from wanting to continue to pursue my career in retail management.  There was a lot of time sacrifices in the salaried positions, however, a successful year meant a nice bonus.  Unfortunately that journey has ended but I am doing nothing but looking forward to the future."
good,Lowes has been a great place to work. I've learned numerous skills in my years of working there. They offer competitive pay and pretty decent benefits.
good,"helping customers, loading and stocking. learned a lot about the products. Management was extremely friendly and always there to help. Hardest part of the job was lifting."
good,a typical day at work is 7am to 4pm. i learned to use shoulder straps to carry appliances. management was good. the hardest part of the job was nothing. i knew the skills from a previous job alike. the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing new people daily.
good,Lowe's has excellent benefits for full timers and even pays benefits for part timers although not as robust as the full time benefits. Management in the stores do work alot of hours but Lowe's provides great training in many areas and constantly looks to improve our management skills. The chance to grow and develop is there if you are willing to take it and run with it. You just need to be open at all times to coaching and changing as Lowe's changes. The company is always changing. There are chances for every single person to move up if you listen to advice and coaching. A high school student who might not want to get a degree can become a service manager if they listen and open themselves up to coaching and then Lowe's will pay for that person to go back to school. its a place for all to grow if they are willing to listen and willing to grow.
good,"As far as retail goes, Lowe's is one of the better places to work. The pay is decent and there are almost always opportunities for advancement. The hardest part of the job will always be the customers and the tedium, but you find that at any retail store. For the most part, though, the employees are friendly and management is helpful. Plus they allow dogs in the store. Which is always a plus."
good,The Management's was very experienced very professional they make sure you had your hours and plus you gave you some if you needed more. Not stressful at all
good,"It may be dysfunctional at times, but they really do have your back. Not one day is ever the same as the day before. The pay is good and the people are great."
good,"Great environment to be challenged and learn in. Wonderful atmosphere with co-workers, everyone is knowledgeable and more than capable of getting the job done making it a more enjoyable work place experience."
good,"I would start off the day by doing a quick assessment of what needed to be done and what trucks were coming in. I would see what products needed to be stocked and what products we were short on. Early in the morning the contractors are usually the highest priority as they need large amounts of product and quickly, then i would task and help regular customers throughout the rest of the day. On days with trucks I would either check in and unload the trucks, or assist with checking in and unloading the trucks."
good,Lowes is a pretty good place to work but it is hard to get full time. Once you get full time you get holiday and sick pay which is extremely helpful. Lowes is a place that you just need to apply yourself to learn and become better. You will get a lot of general knowledge on how to all basic home improvement.
good,Lowes has its employees interest first the management program offers great training and hr presents. Fair to all employees full time and part time. A++
good,"Working at Lowes as a customer serve associate, I absolutely loved my job. It was a perfect place to work for me because I enjoy helping people and effective problem solving. Working in this department has definitely increased my patience and has given me a confidence in finding solutions that are beneficial to both parties of every issue."
good,"When I first started Lowe's it was very much a family oriented business. Over 15 years they changed drastically asking one person to do the work of three, firing tenured employees to control payroll."
good,"Great company to work for. "
good,"I work at one Lowe's location and the morale there is great. However, I've worked at a couple of the larger stores as well and absolutely hated my time there. Associates acted like they didn't care about anyone but themselves. The smaller stores seem to be more customer-focused."
good,"The company pays well and has excellent benefits. Good opportunity for advancement."
good,Lowe's is  a well organized and fun place to work. The staff is extremely friendly but not personable. It's a lot of heavy lifting and minimal compensation and hours.
good,Long hours but typically had two days off in a row.  Busy but enjoyed the customer base and coworkers.  Pay is good and benefits are good also. No job security due to restructure.
good,Job was interesting working in Retail.  Learned a lot about the products and people.  I worked in different areas of the company and gained  knowledge
good,Very fair. Great expectations and detail. Everyone is encouraged to work as a team and we do. Management is fair and easy to get along with while still having expectations and accountability. Store wide communication could be better tho.
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers with any questions they have. We down stock our products to make our shelves full. Some days, our manager will have a project to work on. The management at lowes is good. But, every department has their own management. I learned how to work much better under pressure. I learned where the product in my departments are at. The work place is very welcoming and fun. We are a big family. The hardest part is not having extra coverage. The most enjoyable part of my job is making a customer happy."
good,"A typical day at work deliver route out deliveries, what I learn to manage, management was great ,culture was good hardest part of job was turnover ratio is bad, best part is being out and about and helping my team."
good,"I enjoyed working there. I needed to make more money so I left, but management was great.   The only negative thing I have to say is we had to delivery and put together appliances in the customers home.  Back breaking work."
good,Hard work and dedication did little for me when the company restructured me out of my job. I loved working for this company and enjoyed working with a great team. Work schedules weren't always desirable with working random shifts and a four week work cycle that had varied days off.
good,"Love the people I work with but management spends more time managing up then focusing on their people.  "
good,"The job itself could get very stressful at times, but the facility and amenities are fantastic. There is a Nurse Practitioner on-site, a cafeteria, walking trails, and more. The management teams were very friendly and approachable."
good,Used to be great but the new management structure is ridiculous.  Everyone is stretched too thin on coverage within the stores and it makes for horrible customer service.
good,"Great coworkers great vibes. I felt like I really fit in on my first day, everyone came to greet me and introduce themselves. Iv built bonds with most of the employees and management minus one asm"
good,"Creative, punctual and out going personality who is always getting the job done. Always willing and able for a new challenge while still exceeding sales goals"
good,It was a laid back environment. The HR department and upper management were very easy to talk to if you had any questions or concerns. Other co-workers were very helpful as well.
good,A typical day at work will be assisting customers with troubleshooting  the problem they are having with their appliance over the phone without the need to schedule service. I have learned a great deal of communication skills are very important in this field. Management is helpful and caring.
good,"I believe the company is really dedicated to helping employees develop a great life/work balance.  Scheduling is difficult to adjust to, as in any retailer dedicated to rotating schedules, but the other benefits and programs they offer are of great benefit to workers.  "
good,"Lowes is  good place to work my typical day at work is great I love to interact with customers, I have learned to always be productive and stay organized and task oriented as well as maintaining sales goals and always assist customers. I really dot have anything that I can say is hard for me because I love what I do."
good,I loved working at Lowes. It was a great experience the atmosphere was positive. I encountered alot of customers who i gained wonderful relationships with throughout my time there.
good,"Good place to work if your a hard worker.  Some people will slack off and allow you to do their work and take credit.  Management needs a serious revamp, especially corporate.  The people make it a fun place to work, you really begin to feel like part of the team if you try.  Customers can be difficult but also incredible.  Depends on who you get, but that's customer service either way."
good,"Great co workers, fun place to work. Always something to do, never a dull moment.. Medical and dental benefits. paid time off. closed on Christmas and Thanksgiving ."
good,"If you love working in home improvement, this job is great. You will learn a lot about home remodels, renovations, paint, flooring, etc. If you are not interested in learning about this stuff, then I recommend you do not consider working at Lowe's. You will consistently have to answer questions about product that is not in your department/area. You will need to quickly answer simple and complex questions about products, how they work and how they work with other products."
good,"I met great people. I learned a lot about their different products and their usage, as well as the different departments such as Plumbing, Electrical, Appliances, Roofing, etc. Store Managers had poor management skills."
good,There are specialist in each department and even if you don't want a career here you can learn many different things about everyday home problems. Good place to work.
good,Was a good place to work. Worked here a second full time job to supplement income. Great people to work for. Working 2 full time jobs was too much so I had to give this one up. Still a great place to work.
good,"Cosechar en las primeras horas, realizar labores culturales de producción de flores"
good,constantly and consistently working to drive superior results and from the time you come in to the time you leave for the day.  gives you an opportunity to make a difference in someone's life
good,"Lots of positions to learn about and a large clientele base to assist on a daily basis keeping things interesting each day at work. Just don't hope to move up in the company as corporate calls the shots, not the management in store"
good,Great company to work for I like the every day changes it keeps the job new.  If you like working outside and working as a team. this is a great place to work.
good,"There are always ups and downs with a company of this six=ze and it all depends on the staff at any particular store. Some are run with military precision while others are a free for all."
good,"lowes can be great place to work like family, but management does not know what the right hand is doing as the left hand. your schedule will change many time a week  and the will not tell of the changes, and the shifts are all over the place."
good,"i worked in the Delivery department, I enjoyed it because of have to take apart thing or put thing together to complete tasks. A lot of problem solving when it came to getting appliances into customers houses. "
good,The company its self is good. pretty consistent hours. easy to build a life around. job security is the biggest concern because the store has the right to keep you or fire you but the company can veto any action at any time.
good,Lowe's was a great company to work for. All employees were very nice and cooperative. It was enjoyable helping customers find their needs. Management was understanding.
good,a usual day working for Lowe's busy constantly helping customers day in and day out great place to work honestly and Management also helping all about team work at this place of work to get the job done.
good,"Lowe's has given me tremendous experience and opportunity. Like any publicly traded company, the culture and overall work environment changes with the tides of Wall Street. Working for this company has been an excellent experience and has been a key player in both my professional and personal growth over the past few years."
good,"As my first job, Lowes Foods taught me how to show the utmost respect for both fellow employees and customers. I quickly learned how to adapt and multitask as well as obtaining and keeping a professional look. The work environment was always welcoming and enjoyable, with enthusiastic employees all around."
good,"Great place to work, excellent benefits and work life balance. A lot can be learned here. Excellent culture. Some areas are very lay back. Have to be willing to adapt to rapid changes (hiring/layoffs are frequent)."
good,"Vision insurance is AWESOME! Medical, not so much. Mostly average. Lowes also likes to purge managers everyone few years, and this year was the latest. You never know if your position will exist tomorrow or not. "
good,"This place was fun to work at, a great job for a summer as a college student. Doesn't pay as much as I'd hoped but is very flexible with schedules and taking time off if needed."
good,"I loved my job as a Customer Care agent at first, until management began breathing over our shoulders and never giving us personal space to work. They offer feedback at least once a week and management seems like they care whether or not you actually do well. As representatives that get cursed at all day long, we definitely do not make as much as we should. Overall this position is great, but as will all jobs there are cons."
good,Fresh out of highschool it definitely taught you some valuable life lessons. Great management and shift leaders. Very flexible with school schedule and other life appointments.
good,"My store manager was great and the Assistant Managers.  "
good,"Great place to grow and opportunity to advance . Also lowe's offers great benefits. Each day was a day to learn something new or improve on the things you already knew. The overall work environment was enjoyable. The challenge was to always be better than what you were previously , and to make customer actually want to return to shop ."
good,"fun place to work and good coworkers, very busy delivery department meeting different people on a daily basic. over time is a must."
good,"So many radical changes in the company the last couple of years. When I started 8 years ago I thought I'd work for Lowes til the day I died. I'm still there, can't complain but if I can find something better, I will go."
good,"Great daily structure, and flexible for families. Great to be nimble and learn about adaptability. Creates growth inside and outside the company."
good,"Great place to work, great benefits great people amen overall great atmosphere for working they work with your schedule if your part time. Downfall if your full time have to have open availability"
good,"Work here just for some extra cash, Really enjoy working with customers and good employees. Management at this store is good. Only downside is being pressured to leave early and low pay. Fun place."
good,Working here was great. However Lowe's in its prime season can be a little challenging. I recommend working here if you enjoy constantly doing a task and working with customers for long periods of time.
good,"Work day is normally long, and hard. Management was alright, but it seemed very divided, as certain people were liked more than others (of course that is just my opinion). I was only a temp for summer so I didn't really have much job security, but I can say, that if you work hard, they will keep you for a little while longer. "
good,"Average days consist of helping customers, handling special order items, setting up installs and delegating to and directing employees. Company is a good one to work for however they restructured their management and there are no more dept manager positions."
good,"Lowes is a WONDERFUL place to work. Although it is a retail store, management treats their employees wonderfully. I really enjoyed coming to work because I loved the people I worked with. This company also helps its employees advance and learn more skills if they wish to do so."
good,Lowes was a good work environment with an agreeable enough staff. The store I worked at had a high turnover because they ran like any small community would- political power plays and overworking those who knew the store. I learned some skills I wouldn't have picked up anywhere else and enjoyed my place in the Paint Department.
good,"A typical day at Lowes begins with a meeting that gives you a breakdown of what's going down with the company and within the store. Congratulations and recognitions to departments. Then off to the projects due within the week. Fast and steady against time while assisting customers getting work done. The environment is light and rewarding when you communicate what project your doing in each department. The most hardest part of the job is to not lose focus of your project. You have a lot of factors heading left and right ,but at the end of the day you know you did your best to accomplish the goal and be ready for tomorrow. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the comradery. We stay in touch with other PSA's and vendors in other stores to compare projects, what's coming up in the future, and techniques of the trade."
good,A great place to work and stay productive.  Helping customers while finishing orders.  Management almost always there to help.  Very upbeat and positive environment.  Hardest part of the job for me was the slow nonproductive days.  What I enjoyed most about working for Lowe's would be working hard with my coworkers everday giving great customer. service.
good,Lowe's is a great company to work with.  There are many opportunities for advancement and with company profit sharing there are many chances to make a great deal of money.
good,"Best job ive ever had, full time hours as a part time employee, slightly above minimum wage, reasonable with shift changes, and friendly and helpful management. 10/10 would work again."
good,I learned how to manage in a fast paced environment. I enjoyed helping my employees advance in their careers. Had to manage many issues at once. Great management staff makes it a good place to work.
good,"Was a very good company to work for at the time, hired on as part time with potential to move up quickly within the store, was there for almost 2 years, and applied for almost every full time position offered but they would keep hiring outside employees. Loved the fast paced environment that would allow me to use my communication and customer service skills on a daily basis. The company itself was very customer focused which i liked a lot, but sometimes when it comes to the employees sometimes their focus gets sidetracked in my opinion."
good,Lowes was a good place to work with good benefits. I learned new skills daily and created good working relationships with many people.
good,"It's an ok place to work for.  Hours tho, are inconsistent.  Your schedule changes from week to week. The other associates are good to work with.  Management also.  But they make too many changes on how they run the company."
good,"I have a good job at Lowe's and it's clean and well maintained with good people that work hard.  Work on a cash register all day, answer phone, standing in one spot on concrete floor my whole shift.  My only dissatisfaction with this job is that the scheduling is up and down and not guaranteed that days you requested off will be granted."
good,Great place to work. Worked there for 10 years and am still currently employed by them. Have been able to advance and move over the years.

good,"I enjoyed the opportunities, management and teams I was fortunate to work with. The culture and team feel is one of the better I have experienced in the retail industry. Future is unclear with the new direction in store and management structure."
good,"Was great to work at Lowe's years ago, but current company changes make it not so much fun. They pretty much knocked any chance of advancement. Most of the workforce will turn into part timers so going forward I am concerned"
good,Great place to work as part time or full time but when you move up in the place managers tend not to support you.  Work ethics get you no where and lazy employees are rewarded!
good,This is a great company to work for as long as you do your job you have nothing to worry about this is also company where it is a lot of room to grow.
good,"Highly recommended , management takes pretty good care of you , good pay and great schedule most of the time. If you did or didn't go to school I would like to think lowes is the company for you !"

good,"went to work there when previous employer closed."
good,"The hardest part about the job is being outside in the summer. The people are nice, the pay was nice, the store is usually always calm. The store only got cray for the 4th of July Sales."
good,I have been very happy with Lowe's for the past 14 years.  I am being affected by the company-wide restructuring and am looking for another opportunity.
good,"Great company to work for, had treated me well.  Lot of inconsistencies among stores however.  Lowes is not Lowes depending on where you go."
good,"Coach and develop my team to win. "
good,A typical day at work would consist of me going to the receiving are in the back getting stock to put out on the shelves. I learned how to talk and deal with customers that might not be the nicest people in the world.
good,Lowes - is a very good company to work for they have very good service and its easy to find what you need. they also have a huge variety of things in there store.
good,"Overall my favorite place I've worked so far.  Learned a ton about myself and my abilities.  Built great relationships with customers, coworkers alike."

good,"I've learned how to mix paint to all different colors.  I've learned how to cut blinds for customers and make spare keys for them.  A typical day at Lowes consists of me mixing paint, stocking my department, and cutting blinds.  The management team is pretty awesome.  They are always willing to help and they are very understandable.  I enjoy being able to make others happy.  Sometimes it's tuff on me when I can't get the exact color that the customers are looking for."
good,Overall a pleasant experience. I enjoy the work and the customers. Managing people is a challenge but can be a rewarding one. There are not many people in this world anymore that really want to work.
good,"I would go into work, count my money and then serve the customers that would come into the has hut with their gas needs. I would also restock everything that people would come in and buy. Then I would go inside, count my money and then leave for the day."
good,Decent atmosphere and understanding managers make a simple or complex task easier to work with as well as positive attitudes and hardly any foul language or criticism
good,"Professional work ethics environments, very fast past totally committed to the customers, total dedication to the employees safeties. dedicated to making customers happy"
good,A typical day is like any other day in retail . Numerous tasks to do and customer to help. Starts with truck about every day of the week and overstock reports.
good,My typical work day is always busy and provide excellent customer service. Since I started at Lowes I learned lots of new information about products. The management is excellent. Whenever I am having medical issues with my son they all understand. The hardest part of my job is not being able to have more hours than what I currently have. The most enjoyable part of my job are the customers. I have never had any complaints from any customer.  All my customers enjoy coming into the store when I am working.
good,I have already reviewed this company.  I worked 12 hrs. per week and found it to be a steady paced location.  Keep me busy for my 6 hr. shifts.  Good place to work
good,"I enjoyed this company on many levels, i allows you the ability to provide a customer service experience second to none!"
good,My time at lowes was a very interesting time. There was always something to do so keeping busy was fairly easy. My co-workers were more then delightful & the environment never once had a negative vibe.

good,"Enjoyed my time working there, learned a lot. I built confidence in my customer service communication skills. Able to work alone and do things on my own as well in a team."
good,Lowe's is a great place to work. We have lots of great people that know their stuff about the departments they work for. Lowe's is a good place to start for those that want jobs in a warehouse environment because everyone gets certified on a forklift and other power equipment.
good,"Out of every job I've had, I learned the most at Lowe's. I still use things I learned here every day. You are trained on power equipment and you pick up knowledge of repairs and projects constantly. You get plenty of breaks. The hardest part of the job was the holidays, as with any retail environment. The most enjoyable part was figuring out a solution with a customer."
good,"Lowe's does a great job in training manager's to follow the SERVE model of leadership."
good,Helping customers fix a problem that they have at home that you haven't fixed yourself ever. You learn to apply what you learn from other customers to help another one.
good,Good company to work for but could use more pay per hour. The people who work there are Great people who are willing to help you if you are in need. A good environment to work in.
good,Management is stuck working within corporate guidelines. They have no room to think for themselves or allow employees to think.
good,Helping customers with matching their paint samples. The work environment was always different and exciting. The co workers were always willing to switch shifts with you and cover for you if an emergency came along. Sometimes the customers you would deal with could be a little difficult but you pushed through.
good,love my job need more hrs great place to work great hr  good coworkers looking to stay with company a long time love doing what I do
good,"I enjoy working for Lowe's and I have learned a lot. I have increased my data entry skills, learned how to schedule and work in Kronos, as well as daily business and accounting needs. I am consistently trying to learn so that I can teach others and make myself and my coworkers more efficient for both customers and our company. "
good,My first call center was great. Much needed experience for me dealing with customers over the phone. Management not the best and I learned quickly that callcenters re constantly changing so I had to stay in my toes.
good,co-workers and management team can be great for the most part there are plenty of opportunities to always ways to make more and live and have a comfortable life
good,Lowes is great company to work for as a kid. It got me through college and I appreciate them a lot. Co-workers were good and I like the opportunities.
good,"I have always come in early so that I could walk the store and say hello to all that I could find before I had to clock in.  We all worked very well together and smiles, jokes and any humor was a gift to give and receive when working with customers."
good,Lowe's is a good company to work for.  They are family oriented and have a heavy focus on safety. There is opportunity to mve up in the company.
good,"i learn a lot have really good experience workin as a team memeber at lowes.safe inviroment really good people, in holidays they make special things for us employees."
good,"Lowe's has an ecosystem that cultivates comradery and positive attitudes amongst its employees. The pace and workload can be quite intense during peak hours, but the supportive staff makes it much more manageable. Management is a mixed bag of stern to friendly and helpful managers making or an overall fair rating on management."
good,"What do you expect working at a hardware store? It wasn't anything to challenging, I was a cashier and I met a lot of people, learned a lot about tools, plants and things like that."
good,a typical day as a lead was to review sales numbers for the department and store from the previous day. ensure you know the best selling item in your department as well as the least selling item. being knowledgeable about the product coming in and out. being trained in all surrounding departments. motivating myself to ensure i reach my sales goal and connecting with my customers. the most enjoyable part of my job was working with my customers. the least enjoyable part was put heavy freight away.
good,Feeling like there is too much work and not enough time or help is common.  I enjoyed interacting with customers and helping them with their projects.
good,"I was trained and learned everything at Lowes, I was able to work in any department where I was needed, Loved providing customer service, the management was great to work with."
good,"As with all corporate retail businesses, there are plenty of good things and bad things. Overall as a whole however, Lowes does a decent job with balancing each other to make it a decent place to work for."
good,Lowe's is a great please to work if you enjoy retail customer service. Lowe's is all about taking care of the customer and there employees.
good,Managers are the worst part besides the customers. Some managers know nothing and cant answer questions so you are expected to find them out yourself or call the corporate phone line and wait with your customer for a hour. Ran very politically. Good benefits and paid vacation and holidays.
good,"The work was challenging yet satisfying.  I am a perfectionist and particularly enjoy seeing a job well done.  As a merchandiser in a big box store there are numerous tasks to complete on a daily basis.  I keep myself organized which allowed me the ability to complete tasks on time.  I maintain a professional demeanor at all times and do not bring my home life to the workplace.  I've always enjoyed interacting with co-workers and customers, my customer service skills are above average.  My reviews have always highlighted this point."
good,"A dynamic environment with an openness to enhance sales, retail motivations while having fun at the same time. Very goal oriented.  Flexible scheduling was very nice. Christmas time was especially fun for helping families get their tree."
good,It's a friendly environment with a knowledgeable staff. Management is goes above and beyond to train their employees. They are always willing to help. Excellent benefits.
good,Lowe's is a nice place to work.  I enjoyed the department I worked in while I was there.  I'm a people person so to speak so if I could help a customer when they came into the store I was very happy to do so.  If I couldn't help them myself I found someone who could.
good,Really Great Job Learned a lot gained a lot of experience. Was taught skills that will benefit me the rest of my life. After becoming a manager learn how to lead and motivate my employees. Best of all became a great teacher.
good,"Lowe's has great pay especially for the minimal amount of work asked of you.  They take very good care of their employees.  Very good benefits, and you can actually get prizes for being healthy.  The only issue with the company is that you don't always get a chance to move up in your area, due to the lack of growth in the company at this time."
good,I like dealing with most of the customers the management was ok and most of my coworkers were good to work with. Lowes  taught me better people skills.
good,"Outside the fact that you can get very caught up in work place politics and departmental cliques, this is a wonderful work environment that is very conducive to learning many different trades and areas of home improvement."
good,"Its a great place to grow and develop important skills that you can incorporate within everyday life. management and coworkers are warm and welcoming and customers may at times be difficult but, we all work together to build and grow."
good,I enjoyed working for Lowe's but soon relized that all managers don't care about family issues. There is an extreme pushing of the employees to always push foe extra sales.
good,I learned several new skills to take along with me. The managers were very supportive of my school schedule and worked with me to make a reasonable schedule.
good,Lowe’s is a great and energetic place to work it offers an opportunity to grow within the company while making a good living. Lowe’s also offers many great benefits to its employees.
good,My day At Lowe's is t o walk the store and ask customers if they need any help trying to find what they are looking for . The hardest part of my job is when i have more than two people ask for help and i have to remember who is next . the best part of my job is when i am walking the customer we end up having a conversation and i have many friends because of this and that is great .
good,I really enjoyed working at Lowes.  They pay well and gave me compliments when they noticed how hard I was working.  The work could be difficult and stressful at times with the amount of customers lining up but we helped each other out. Lowes felt like a second family to me almost and I learned a lot about different products and such from what I would inform customers on.
good,"good experience, great people.Enjoyed my time there.managenet does there best,retail is a fun exciting rewarding experience.the work schedule is flexible."
good,"A typical work day consist of me mainly assisting customers loading and unloading, putting up return product, stocking the department, pulling orders,cleaning, and answering any and all questions. My co-workers are good to work with they usually have no problems lending a hand if needed. The hardest part of the job is you may not know all the answers but you can always find someone who does. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my co-workers and being able to help the customer."
good,Good company and a benefits. Store managers are really involved and they try to listen to every employees opinion. They have a lot of different positions so finding the right fit for you is a lot easier than most places.
good,"Working for Lowe's over 23 years I have seen a lot of turn over.  It is a wonderful place to work and I will miss my coworkers, but I am ready to expand my work experience and spread my wings."
good,"As a department manager there is a lot of paperwork to be done and inventories. The good thing is there is a lot of help if needed to get it done. Great leaders and workers alike. Company comes with job security and a 40 hour work week, no overtime so that can be a pro or con depends on how you look at it. Hard part of the job is balancing department demands while taking care of all customers in a timely manner. Most enjoyable was working with the people i did and learning the manager role."
good,"good working environment. Fun people to work with, make the work a good place to be. Great benefits. Job unfortunately had a manager that over micromanage or jobs making it difficult for us to work"
good,Healthy work environment with excellent employees.  Part-time associates don't always get a lot of hours but Lowe's tries their best to work with you.  Overall great experience.
good,I enjoyed working there. The people are nice the environment was enjoyable.Good benefits it was a good experience overall. A typical day at work consisted at working at the customer service check out to ensure the customers were satisfied with their purchase rather it was a return or exchange.
good,"Open my station by reporting any problems by making sure top stock is stacked according to regulations.  Make sure all appliances are in place and clean.  Return customer calls. Greet customers with a smile, listen and understand their needs.   Place their orders and follow through by making sure entire order is ready to be deviled.  I have learned so much about appliances, how they work and what accessories are needed for installation.  My managers are very caring and always offer help when needed.  I find standing for an entire shift is sometimes  difficult.  I meet the most amazing people.  I truly love working with customers and educating them on appliances.  They always convey to me that I have been extremely helpful and knowledge, and for me, that is very rewarding!"
good,"i enjoyed working there, good people,great experiences , good benefits , it was good over all. the managers were nice and helpful and very encouraging."
good,Typical day would be scanning items and checking people out. Asking if they had a Lowe's card or would be interested in opening a Lowe's credit card. Pretty simple
good,This was surprisingly a good job once you get used to the long hours standing up on your feet.  Honestly the only reason I left is because I was stuck on a part-time compensation and I needed full-time compensation and it was never offered after 4 years of trying.  The job culture was nice simply because I enjoyed helping people find their do it  yourself solutions for their home improvement inquiries.
good,"I would refer this job to anyone.They cross train you throughout the store, great benefits and I had awesome management."
good,Cool place to work. I learned a lot great tools the company provided that I may be better productive. I worked with an awesome team that took the time out of what they where doing to assist in helping team members as needed. Great benefits.
good,"Lowes offers great benefits along with competetive pay."
good,"I learned a lot about home improvement needs and basic knowledge such as how to cut tile,carpet, as well as product knowledge"
good,heavy lifting but a good place to learn and expand your knowledge of construction. good people and good management. customer service is the most important part of the job.
good,"Stretch my body before starting work then proceed to check the conditions of the equipment I will be using while filling out my equipment check list.  Assist to the morning meeting proceed to my assigned work area to make walls of boxes, and carry pallets with forklift until the truck is full."
good,"It is a job, so it not anything too amazing, A decent place to work, with nice people, easy enough going management, good compensation. It's all what you make of it. Its retail so yeah."
good,"Lowe's was a great place to work. It was and still is a good and healthy environment to work in. When I first moved out here Lowe's was my first job, and that is where I met my first few friends in my new environment."
good,It was good working there friendly co-workers and good people. Didn't like short breaks but my co-works made it a good job and I think it's a good first job
good,"I started working at Lowe's in 2014, in need of a job that was flexible with my school schedule. Lowe's was very flexible, paid a competitive wage, and consisted of an environment imperative for good customer service."
good,You are left to your own demise if you do not know job criteria. Department manager is never around. Training does not really compare to actual sales floor but you learn as you go.
good,"Lowes was a great experience and the people there were great. The management itself was not very good. A typical day at work would be me showing up, signing in and positioning myself at the cash. I would stay there all day helping out customers. Our store was quite busy most of the time so we never got bored and we were never just standing around. We always had something to do."
good,"Working at Lowe's I felt like I was family, everyone got along with everyone. The customers were great fun people. Not a day went by either the employees or the customers had a smile on their face. For that, the smiles and being able to feel as if going to work was a second home and family was a great experience to learn all the necessary materials to become more and more comfortable with the job."
good,A typical day for me at Lowes consists of working with a team of guys and unload trucks. while doing this I use a forklift to move items through out the store. i learned the importance of teamwork and how to pace my self when i work. Then most enjoyable part of the job is the fun and out going atmosphere.
good,"wasn't bad, it was work, nothing bad or amazing about it, I enjoyed working there due to new friends I made and didn't enjoy working there the last two months due to being completely alone to do 5-6 peoples jobs every night."
good,Customer based very friendly and cooperative work environment with   a close relationship with management. flexible hours with a set monthly schedule at a reasonable salary.
good,This is a great place to work.  Compensation is not as good.  You get to learn a lot of home improvement skills.  A pro is a lot of challenges.  A con is many different shifts.
good,"A great environment to build customer service skills and practice team leadership. Goal oriented mindset is a must. Customers are always asking questions, so a learning, knowledgable and patient  mind is a must.Co wokers are all team oriented, friendly and have goals. Management needs improvement. Not being able to fulfill a clients needs (due to non-stock) is the hardest part of the job."
good,The people that work for the company are wonderful people and should be taken better care of. Depending on which store you may have a good senior management crew.
good,Enjoyed working and doing my job there. My co workers were fantastic. Everyone was a team player. I would set up the delivery orders in the mornings make sure correct items are going out. At night I would pull orders from the work sheets. I loved my job.
good,Family/work life relationship is hard to do with rotating schedule and the extended hours beyond scope specified. I worked for Lowe's for over 15 yrs and it is a good company to build a career with.
good,"I enjoyed working with my co workers, really good place to work if your looking for a good part-time to work while in school. "
good,"Management really does care about their employees, from making sure they are doing a good job with customers and daily tasks, like cleaning or inventories, to making sure they are compensated for their hard work. A lot of cleaning when closing, and sometimes understaffed, but as long as you're willing to work hard, others will follow your example, no matter who has been there longer."
good,Very good place to work.. I just got laid off though..its kinda a kiss butt system..if you buck your a target if you do what they say your on the goody system
good,"Overall working at Lowes, in the paint department, it was enjoyable and the pay was fair. The employees for the most part are friendly which made a comfortable workplace and easy-going to work in."
good,A productive workplace in which there was always something to do and someone to help and interact with. Job security was very high and management could always be depended upon.
good,i loved meeting new people and working with most of my co-workers and making sure the customers got great customer service.
good,"The job is what you make of it, if you have a good work ethic and are willing to go the extra mile you can do very well for yourself. Never stop improving."
good,"A typical day at work is fun, interactive, and task oriented. I've learned how to improve my time management, communication skills, selling skills, and knowledge of products. The work environment is great and help is always available to you by the management team and other co-workers."
good,"Lowe's is an enjoyable place to work with a comprehensive, if a bit slow, training system. There's a lot of encouragement from management to always be on the lookout for opportunities to get to a higher position. I'm disappointed in their abrupt manner of letting seasonal employees go, but you're given every opportunity to find a more permanent position within the store before this happens."
good,Cashiering and customer services. Retail industry. Management is usually nice and fair easy to work with. Coworkers are good as well.
good,"As a specialist, work can be up and down, busy one minute and slow the next. Days are either opening or closing, with sometimes covering several departments at the same time."
good,I liked the job for the most part. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. I liked the employee discounts and other benefits.
good,"As much as people love to complain about the job, there are a lot worse out there.  Rather than getting paid minimum wage, they pay you much better.  Management is there to help you and solve any problems that may arise throughout the day.  It is important to be able to learn the store quickly and be able to have an open mind about learning about home improvement."
good,Lowers offers a variety of positions and opportunities. Its is a versatile company with room for growth. The programs they use are up to date and the benefits are very good.
good,"There are some days that require strenuous work such as being on your feet, a lot of moving around but it does get the job done at the end of your shift. I love how busy I was and not just standing around, it requires a lot of movement and lifting. I like seeing customers with a smile on their faces with joy when I was able to help them. Hardest part of the job was inventory that had heavy lifting and being stuck in a cold freezer for an hour. Other than that, I can't really complain. "
good,"my 1st legit job coming out of high school. Lowes gave me my 1st opportunity and showed me how to overcome obstacles when dealing with adversity. I had an great schedule that worked around my school schedule while attending Texas Southern University. the hardest part was dealing with an short staff of people, we were an unload team of 4 people so if I person quit, or called in that put pressure of everyone else to get the job done. Management was ok , you might have an disagreement with a manager or 2 but overall I could say anything negative . Anything we were told to do, we worked as an team an made sure we got it doe, an they just made sure you were doing the job correctly as it supposed to be."
good,Great coworkers for the most part.  Management was good but lacked communication with each other and employees.  Payed well for the retail market.  Plenty of room for advancement but sometimes in-store loyalty does not take precedent.
good,I really enjoyed working with the customers and management personnel. Learned sales and customer satisfaction procedures with frequent training. Received a 10% pay increase after 90 days.
good,"A typical day at Lowes was very high pressure, but it was not difficult.I learned how to quickly determine a situation and quickly figure out a solution to the issue. The management seemed to be ever changing, there were a few assistants that continued to be a presence, but nobody seemed to be on the same page. I had about 200 co-works, I quickly learned how to talk to several different people from different backgrounds and cultures. The hardest part of the job was learning that not everyone is willing to work as a team and not taking that personally. The most enjoyable part of the job was each day being very different."
good,great job doesn't value great workers. hires on appearance. doesn't look in to qualifications to raises. follows buddy system.
good,"I've worked for two different Lowe's locations both as a cashier. When I was hired I had previous customer service experience and they took that into account when factoring what they would pay me. I made fair pay in my opinion for just being a cashier. I had worked for Lowe's for 2 years and had raises in that time. The first Lowe's I worked for had me clean the bathrooms and would force us to help other departments straighten up with I don't believe was in my jobs description, the second location didn't require any of this. The work was pretty easy, selling the my Lowe's was pretty annoying no one was interested. Always fun to meet new and interesting people. There also is always plenty of chances to move up the ladder within the company to other positions. "
good,"Good company to work for, management cares, attempts to work with you the best that they can.  Co-Workers are family oriented, watch out for you when in trouble."
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for.  Advancement is always available as long as the individual wants to do so and has a passion for retail and home improvement.  Lowe's really tries to make their customers and employees ""Love where they live."" Retail can be tough when it comes to scheduling because the stores operating hours are so long you might be working 2pm-11pm one day and the next be working 8am-5pm.  Many incentives such as quarterly bonuses are provided by Lowe's.  Health benefits, 401K, stock Purchase Plans at a discounted rate are all available as well.  Be ready to smile and make sure you understand the customer is always right."
good,One and one with contractors. I learned patients is a good quality. Customer Service and being a team player. With Support from management work productivity goes a long way.
good,"productive and lively atmosphere with innovative retails assistants, high volume environment with weekly stock. Organised setting with no potential WHS concerns. the management team was greatly coordinated and on task"
good,"Working there can be rewarding if proper managements can delegate their duties to help out the employees.  While there are productive managements in the company but there are a few that will overwork the staffs to get themselves be known by upper management and will disregard the well being of their staffs.  Overall,  if you are there and do the work that you are supposed to do then you will not have to worry about anything related to disciplinary action against you."
good,"A great way to move up if you want a retail management position. Must be customer oriented and want to work hard and able to handle multi tasking well. Furthermore, must be able to work on weekends"
good,Every day started with loading your truck up for the day. Once you had completed that you were to print your paperwork and have your truck inspected. Throughout the day you were to deliver multiple appliances safely and quickly to a customers satisfaction. No stop was ever the same and this could be good or bad. You would sometimes get into very tough situations trying to get an appliance into a home. Unfortunately a negative was even if you thought it was somewhat unsafe to do management would still ask you to do it. This makes the job very difficult.
good,Its hard to get hired on full time they only want part timeemployees most people are looking for fulltime its hard to raise afamily working part  time
good,"Flexible scheduling, the good is you can have a day off whenever you need it, the bad.. you have to work every shift. Closing then opening is terrible. Management at this location was not very trained in developing others."
good,"Work hard, I learned how to  pan up breads, Most of the management were pretty good and fair Really like co-workers, Leaning how to pan up bread Working with different people and caring for guest."
good,"Offers excellent benefits to its employees, ongoing training, some opportunity for advancement.  Team work environment."
good,"I enjoy working for Lowe's. The management is very good, co-workers are mainly friendly, job is physically challenging, but at the end of the day it is very satisfying."
good,"A typical day at work varied from time to time it all depended the moods of the customer you worked with that day and the work load you had, but i learned a lot from working here i learned that multitasking is key, and the management would help if they were able to but always took care of the customers needs, my co-workers were always willing to pitch in and help when needed, the most difficult part of this job has to be pleasing and irate customer that will not except any of help that your trying to give them and just totally disrespects you and having to take it with a smile, one of the most enjoyable parts of this job would be the pleasure that i got out of being able to make someones day just by simply giving them the best customer service that i had to offer and making them smile."
good,A typical day at Lowe's was come to work expecting anything. I learned a lot of product knowledge while I was at Lowe's. Management had our back as much as they could. Co-worker at Lowe's were great. We always helped each other. To me the most enjoyable part of my job was when customers would tell me I made their experience at Lowe's both friendly and very helpful.
good,"Great place to work if you are looking for a seasonal or part time position. Plenty of exercise, you get a lot of product knowledge"
good,"Fast paced but under staffed on sales floor."
good,"Customer service, helped check out customers ,cash and card transactions. Helped customers apply for credit card. Cleaned cash tills."
good,Good place to work with a nice environment! The company is always striving to be better and look for ways to be the number one retailer for home improvement.
good,I gained my first experience of driving a fork lift as well as how to use other heavy duty machinery. I made good friends here with the workers. Management wasn't always fair in their decisions.
good,Working there was a great experience. I was surround by people who where always happy to assist you in anything you were unsure of. I would recommend working there to anyone.
good,"was not here very long, nothing bad to say about the people or work environment. management cares about others, and having a tidy place."
good,"Good pay for retail, excellent management, not much for advancement, flexible scheduling, decent benefits, part time has lower hours."
good,"Some managers care about you and your family, they can do better in paying good workers. They do help in everyway the can."
good,"Although working as a seasonal cashier can be rigorous during the summer months (Lowe's busy season), Lowe's was a great place to receive my first time job experience.  The compensation for the position was very nice as well!  I like to always tell my friends if they ever need a job that pays really well to go work at Lowe's."
good,"Lowe's in Canada is a growing organisation, which means a lot of opportunity to grow. Great leadership , lots of opportunities."
good,"I learned I LOVE working with people. I challenged myself everyday to make every customer smile. The hardest part of my job was the drama there. I couldn't stand it.  I loved the other half of my coworkers, and will have those friendships the rest of my life!"
good,I worked anywhere from 8 to 12 hrs a day. I learned a lot about products that are used in and around the house. Helped out different departments out when needed. I didn't like to work the swing shifts.
good,"I love Lowe's and the hard working people who work there, from top to bottom. I think our HR hires above average personnel but the demands and insufficient staffing with the insane 6am to 10pm coverage bleeds those who are willing to work dry."
good,"Decent pay, employees and mangers were kind and helpful (though many have moved on to work at different companies)"
good,Customer care that included helping with home improvement projects. Also receiving of shipments and organizing in there correct place.
good,"It was a good job. For me personally, not an opportunity for advancement. But overall, I loved my managers and the things that they tried to do."
good,"I have good customer skills i think if your happy they will  happy also. When i work for the yacht club we had to do whatever the member wanted we had to do because the club was member owned but it was not hard.  When i worked for Lowe's  i began as a front desk and customer service, and cashier , And signed up for the R.T.M. job and i got it and i loved it."
good,"para mi es  una empresa muy competente con los demás mercados ya que genera  variedades en sus productos y novedades,  como empleado cuenta con varios beneficios para uno por ejem: sueldo superior al que marca la ley, fondo de ahorro, vale de despensa, derecho  a bono, días festivos pagados al triple etc"
good,"This job is not for everyone, but if you can handle the high call volumes and the customers, then this would be a good job for you."
good,"Fast paced constantly loading trailors, very hard on the back and limbs as the equipment used to get the job done was not up to par.  Advancement opportunities were left up to the coaches which did not always result in fair placing of the workers.."
good,The coworkers are great but management needs some work. They are not entirely fair to everyone. It is hard to have a work-life balance due to the corporate rotations you are on.
good,A typical day can consist of many duties not within your job duties. I've learned that you will be asked to perform other duties within your department & sister department. We have a good Senior Management team that is willing to help you advance your position if desired. The hardest part of my job is the physical labor. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the plants & helping customers transform their gardens.
good,"Lowes is a good company to work for, they provide opportunities for advancement, and their pay is completive with other stores"
good,"The coworkers were always very friendly. I got to learn the basics of customer service standards and the way a business is run day to day. Management, for the most part, was very friendly and didn't mind helping out with any issues. Compensation was higher than expected for being my first job, a great starting point. Overall the hardest part(s): coping with disgruntled customers, and getting used to prolonged standing. I also ran into9 the ""no room for advancement"" problem once I was moved to customer service from being a regular cashier."
good,"Lowe's has grown a tremendous amount in the 15 years I have worked for them, however, in the past 5+ years the company is trying hard to be something different.  I give the company a ton of credit for trying to be an innovator and for leading change in our industry, however, if you want to lead change, you MUST let go of old animosities!  Lowe's is now, and on it's current course, will alway be in their primary competitors wake!  Lowe's leadership refuses to let go, they continue to compare every aspect of our business with our competition, while telling the employee group that we are trying to be different, trying to change the industry...you cannot do both!"
good,"A typical day at Lowes consists mostly of down stocking , cleaning and dusting the shelves , helping customers find the products they are in search of .  A daily store meeting takes place every day informing everyone of the day before in profits and what is expected of the day ahead .  I learn something new every day and the more I learn , the more I experience , the better I will be able to help the next customer .  The management overall is very helpful and very flexible at times and my co-workers at my Lowes are the absolute best to work with .  The hardest part of my job can be the customers , as one can not please everyone all the time .  They do get irate at times and irritable and knowing how to handle them is a learning experience .  Overall working for Lowes is an enjoyable experience for me . I do love working there ."
good,Digital analyst contractor with lowe's - management and co-workers very good. Working on the lowes.com team is an excellent placement for anyone who is interested in working with data or math.
good,"Plus side Loved that the job required customer interaction and that exceptional customer service was the expected not the exception. Great people to work with enjoyed going to work every day. Excellent pay."
good,I felt motivated to work at this job daily. Encouraging team meetings in the morning set the tone of the work day. Recognition of a job well done always seemed important.
good,There were numerous times where I had to be a one man army for Lowes. I worked 3 different job positions with the classification of an Assembler. I was also a reciever/stocker as well as a Delivery driver for Lowes. The amount of work that I was asked to do without having help on the go really effected the way I viewed Lowes towards the end of my career there. I started to see the lack of concern for me needing help and the lack of trying to hire more employees to help. I felt that it was time for a change and get into an environment that truly respects what I can do for a company instead of taking advantage of my work ethic without giving some help in return.
good,worked her for three years then needed time off to finish my dgree and ended up getting fired. great job but awful management.
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Lowe's. Great people to work with, I'd work for them again in a heartbeat. Great company to work for."
good,"Its easy to get work done because we all work as a team. Its a good company to work for. Its a great place to interact with customers, and help people with their sometimes fun ad interesting projects."
good,"Overall, I've enjoyed working with the people I have been with for almost 10 years. The work schedule allows me the freedom to have a healthy work/life balance."
good,"Helping customers"
good,Walk into work and set up the pallets for the freight. Working at a hard and quick pace to get the trucks unloaded as quickly as possible while still maintaining safety so the unload crew can enjoy the 30 minute break. The job itself is a little on the low side but if you are working with awesome people then you job is awesome .
good,"I was hired on as seasonal help and quickly grew in the ranks. However when the season ended, the hours dropped. Forcing me to look elsewhere."
good,Good company to work for when I started. After new CEO took over incentive programs were cut making it impossible to stay in ct.
good,Enjoyable work with a variety of activities to keep the day moving.  Typical day involves sales to the public and inventory maintenance.  Plenty of opportunity for advancement within a short period of time.  Management can be lax and quality communication is limited.  Days usually move quickly and coworkers are generally upbeat.
good,Great job had plenty options for advancement also great place to learn customer service skills and team work. i learned a great deal about stocking and management and how to help people feel confident and comfortable working in groups and taking care of certain task.
good,"Started here right out of high school and started from the bottom as part time associate. Climbed my way up ladder from team leader, to sales specialist to department manager. Its a good work environment and helped develop my management skills to prepare me for advanced fields."
good,"A very busy and challenging place to work. A place to learn about every feature of a home, from new buildings to repairing old structures. Lowe's employees work together as a team. "
good,Being able to help customers and help point them in the right direction when they didn't necessarily need something out of your specific department.
good,Checking adds from the paper to see if any price changes came up. looking to see if any new display items came in to set up. i learned alot about customer service and management was always willing to be hands on with the employees
good,"My main job requirement is to stock the warehouse when new inventory comes in. I have learned how to operate heavy machinery and am called upon to do so often. The supervisors/ managers are very fair and approachable. I like working hard for them, because they treat the employees with respect and courtesy. The hardest part of my job is when we have an abundance of inventory to stock, especially around the holidays. Things can become chaotic and overwhelming, but we always pull together as a team to complete the job. The most enjoyable part of my job is training new employees, which I am often asked to do. I like helping others develop into strong employees with good worth ethics."
good,"Lowe's is one of the greatest companies to work for. They offer amazing benefits and incentives. It's fast paced and you always learn something new everyday. Morale and attitudes do change with the employees, it all buckles down to the management team. If the employees feel they have a good team they will work hard, if they feel they don't then morale goes down. Other than that I always recommend Lowe's as a great place to work. It's fun interacting with the employees and customers. You start to feel like the regulars are your friends."
good,"Work hard every day with co-workers and management.  Work order management and customer service, all paying the installer invoices and look at every job going out of the  store making sure there are no problems. so that all installs go smooth and flawlessly. And calling all customer before during and after to make sure they have all question answered and are happy with the install."
good,"Learned registers, mixing with customers was one of the best parts of job.  Management could be tough at times, but they wanted to ensure that we put customers first.  The days could be long, depending on the flow of customers, but could also be very rewarding when customers left pleased with their experience.  Some of the hardest parts could also be dealing with customers and seeing that their needs were met with a friendly attitude.  Co-workers were always friendly with each other and could encourage each other to do better or help when needed."
good,Great company that is in an explosive growth and expansion process. Company logistics are struggling and a lot is placed on the management in order to acheive company goals.
good,"Answer and demonstrate products to customers "
good,Worked at the register checking people out.  Enjoyed hearing about different projects that people were doing.  The hardest part of the job was there were times when you just stood for long periods with not a lot to do.  I like to keep busy and productive.
good,"good working environment. Nice working technology. there are a lot of garden, walkway and pond. There are also new technology classrooms in the company"
good,"Working at Lowe's has been a pleasure. The people you work with are always one of a kind. I have met some amazing people during my time with Lowe's, some of which have become great friends even outside of work."
good,no two days are alike.  fast paced office setting.  very matrixed instructure.  success requires a lot of collaboration.
good,"Lowe's is a very fast paced place to work, it can get overwhelming at times, but overall, it is a great place to work.  The management team in general are very helpful and friendly. The people there are simply very friendly and genuinely care about one another.  The hardest part of the job would be dealing with frustrated or irate customers, but the most enjoyable part is seeing the smile on a customer's face after you helped them with their next home improvement project and having them look for you to help them again."
good,very good company to work for and I can recommend others to fork for Lowes  cleaning company it is a good place just not much hours
good,Great job for outgoing type people like me. Salary and increases in pay very generous. The largest problem seemed to be other employees calling out. Some management seemed to be clueless.
good,I have been working at lowes for about 16 months only part time but im looking for full time position but other than that its a great place to work!
good,"Lowes was a very interesting place to work.  I learned about plants, lumber and outdoors. wonderful management. the hardest part was working outside in the heat and cold to assist customers"
good,Lowe's is a great place to work. I enjoy being able to help solve customer projects and concerns. Managers strive to help associates with day to day operations.
good,"Enjoyed working with the company, learned a lot over the few years I worked there. As time progresses I want more of a stable job with stable hours. expand the knowledge I know as well as learning more in a different field."
good,I really enjoyed going to work every day. It was fun to learn knew things about the products and services we provided. I enjoyed meeting new customers daily and exceeding their expectations. It was incredible when returning customers would come to me and tell me how much they appreciated the time and effort I took with them to understand their needs and make sure they found exactly what they wanted. The hardest part of the position was that I was required to work every weekend away from my kids.
good,you can learn so much from working here its a great store or company to work for tons of benefits love working her just to long to promote
good,Not a bad place to work.  Day usually goes by quickly.  Have several times a year when payroll is cut to minimum.  Most employees are motivated to help the store.
good,Compared to other retail places pretty nice. You have a set rotation and one weekend off a month. Pay is decent. Never slow except first thing in morning or late at night. Upper management good with helping out and responding when needed. Only issue is short on staff and cutting back on hours when still busy enviroment.
good,"Great work, just depends on the management you have. Great benefits and the company will take care of you. Customers will always get their way no matter how rude they are."
good,"I work at a high volume store/location, so there is always something to do. Everyday activities are providing customer service by answering questions and providing the right product for the customers needs. Keeping up to date on product information, sales events and promotions for customers. Keeping relations with customers on their orders, installation projects, and deliveries."
good,"was mostly on the road, i enjoyed bringing new items to the customers and helping them install as well. The hours were great, was able to spend time at home with loved ones"
good,"Good place to work. Everyone is really friendly, helpful and understanding. Not too strict on dress code. The only thing i disliked was the hours I got but pretty decent pay."
good,I have worked at 3 different Lowe's stores an i can tell you from experience they they are all different. I enjoyed working their but it seems to me that if you are a hard worker then you are always expected to be a hard worker and if you are a lazy person then nobody expects you to do a bigger workload.
good,"Overall, a typical day at work involves the enjoyment of providing customers of their needs and accomplishing all of their wants. While striving for excellent customer service, the team at Lowe's always finds time to laugh about the little things, even though things can get crazy during our busy seasons. The company provides excellent management that always guides you in the right direction. Not only do they provide the team with skills, they are always there for support. The whole team becomes a second family, and although we all work closely together, we always find a way to work things out and help our work family in times of need."
good,Overall great place to work with fun staff and great job culture.  Lots of room for advancement within the company.  I enjoyed my position what what I had to do on a daily basis and had fun while doing my job.
good,I made a lot of friends working here. The management understand I was in school and they worked around my school schedule. I learned how to operate different types of machinery.
good,"It is a fast-paced job. Every day is different. It is hard work so if you don't like to work, don't apply. I enjoy the constant movement and the fact that no two days are alike."
good,"Every day that I come in there is always work that needs to be done. For example reports that need to be completed, reviewing returns that were made, margin loss etc. Things I've learned from this job is how to supervise sales and returns accordingly depending on the goals for the store. My co-workers overall are easy to get along with and easy to work with. The hardest part of my job is ensuring that all associates are trained in regards to the importance of store special order margin. Everything an employee does from a sale to an adjustment or return, determines if we meet store goals or not. The most enjoyable part of my job is that there is always something new to learn. My position is a position where one never stops learning."
good,"Lowe's offers many job positions, competitive pay, great benefits, and good people to work with.  Great place to get business experience and move up within the company.  Full-time employees are eligible to receive tuition reimbursement."
good,"After 35 years in single and multi unit retail management my perspective is somewhat more objective than most since I have had to perform the same types of duties as Lowe's management.  However I left management due to a shift in corporate management philosophy.  To me it changed from management to shop keeping."
good,Lowes is the typical retail giant. not a bad company to work for. Some wages are good if you get into management. not very equal though. if  you know someone then you really have a good shot at advancing
good,"My co-worker would always make sure I knew what needed to be done for the day. I removed old price tags, made new tags, restocked, and removed the items into different areas as I was told. I learned how to remove lights, and put new ones in. The management was great, they were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job, was that it didn't matter how many more hours we did, we always got paid the same amount. So for an example, if we worked for a 60 hour week, we would still get paid for 40 only. Also, since I traveled, they didn't help very much with money. The most enjoyable part of the job, I was able to get more experience working in retail stores."
good,"Workdays are never the same. I learned how to proficiently conduct a return, how to quickly run a register/make change. There was a large lack of communication between management and associates"
good,"At Lowe's I have busy days full of either unloading freight from a trailer, sorting it by department, then sending it out to the floor quickly and correctly. On the nights we do not have trucks I clean up the sales floor, down stock product to fill the shelves, and I help customers find anything they need to complete any project from start to finish. Lowe's has taught me many things about home improvement and how to correctly add or repair anything to your home; from adding on rooms to your house or fixing a leaking faucet. Over the years I have learned about all kinds of product throughout the twelve departments in the store. I have five major managers who are smart and know how to run the store correctly without giving too much work to some people and none to others. Also most of the people I work with are hard workers that can work together towards a goal and complete everything that needs to be done. The hardest thing is helping many customers with everything they need and at the same time finish a task list given by a manager , if I work smart it can be achieved with everybody leaving happy. Lastly the best thing about working at Lowe's is all the things it has taught me about improving my home. I like building things and fixing stuff up so this is a great company that shows me what product and tools I will need to make any home project a realistic goal."
good,Once they like you they like you. It can be easy to move up and around Lowe's as long as you are willing to be flexible and work hard you can go places.
good,"inventory control, payroll, cashier, making deposits, counting money, building displays, hiring, customers service, receiving trucks, employees was fun, and so was customers."
good,"You have to be truly dedicated and hard working."
good,Lowe's was a very good company to work for. They truly did look out for their employee's best interests as much as they could. They offered a lot of programs to help those who were interested advance within the company. Management had it's issues but overall the store I worked for had a very effective team of senior managers that would do all they could to help out.
good,"A typical day at work is to wait on each customer and give the best customer service you can give."
good,"I really enjoyed being a seasonal worker at Lowe's, Being in the outside lawn and garden department was very fun and fast-paced"
good,Fun work atmosphere and if you show the willingness to move up and hard work you can definitely move up within the company.
good,"All ways there to help when there was a problem, never leaving you out to take all the blame for something you didn't understand. Was able to gather practical experience with dealing with frustrated people as well as safety protocol for certain equipment. Co-workers were all good people that i would consider friends. Best part of the job was meeting so many people and getting to help them."
good,"Good company, good benefits, good coworkers. I want more time with my family.  Full time means working days, mids and nights."
good,"Lowes was great place and great environment to work at, loved the people and got along with upper management well, hate it was only for a seasonal position"
good,"Good solid company, but bad communication and follow through between nighttime and daytime management.  Had to move product left by nighttime crew before being able to access my work area.  This was addressed with Store Manager and HR with no results.  Took at least and hour a day out of my work schedule to move product left by Night crew.  Much of the product I needed was carried to the floor when I had designated places in my work area.  I had to wait to get a department manager to get the product back to me for assembly."
good,"Flexible, laid back, great management. Loved the free lunches if went without work-related injuries. Great people to work with!"
good,"Hard work in most departments. Day goes by quickly. Learn something new every day. Local store management is for the most part very good. Hard workers notice who the slackers are. The inside temperature at the locations is reportedly controlled by Lowes home office. Customers constantly complain how hot it is inside the store."
good,You can go as far as you would like to with this company. As a manager it was hard to find qualified people to fill open positions.
good,Upward movement throughout the company is possible when working above and beyond the norm for retail associates. Management is wonderful to work with.
good,"Loved working at Lowe's. I learned a lot and the job was fast paced. Unfortunately, it was only social hour for the managers. They would talk to each other and then throw employees under the bus when things went wrong on their watch."
good,"There are a few customers that have attitudes, but I never let it bother me. The people who work there are so happy, it's hard to stay in a rut anyways."
good,The business keeps you busy with freight and day to day tasks. This is all in conjuction with helping customers and planning for the next day. The stores do a good job at the day to day...but could do a better job and helping the associates learn how to manage all of the tasks each day.
good,"Lowes is a good company to work for. I was able to move up in the company at a good rate. My typical day is managing my own department, which has about 5 employees in it. I also help manage other departments as well. I am responsible of making sure the department is kept in top condition and also responsible for shrink in that area. The hardest part of my job is completing my tasks with very few people and getting in my paperwork in on time. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be the associates I work with."
good,"Excellent work environment, co-workers are good people.  I haven't worked long enough to receive benefits or get a good grasp on management and advancement. The hardest part of the job is learning where products are and being short staffed. The most enjoyable part are the co-workers."
good,"overall it was a great job but management was ok the store manager acted like he cared about what employers had to say but mostly brushed us off. typical night all depends of how much freight was delivered that night 1000-1800 carton truck its all work  no play,999 and smaller finish early and you could go home if you wanted."
good,The training was good and gave the opportunity to learn skills like driving forklifts.  Many areas to learn in store and tailor your skills to.
good,"You have to be prepared to handle customer problems quickly. I've learned many things about the products and services Lowe's offers how to delegate tasks more efficiently. My store manager would probably be the best manager I've ever met, never met anyone so dedicated to customer satisfaction. It feels more like a family then co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the times when you might upset a customer if you're out of stock on an item or if you cant find it. By far the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and helping the customers solve problems around their house."
good,"It is good to work with a lot of aey going fellow employees. Also, it is nice to help people solve their problems and help them with their projects."
good,Pays well if you can get to sales specialist. If you stay at the bottom you won't make much. Management is decent. The company changes their overall plan often so you can never get overly confident in how things should be done. Overall it was a good place to work.
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers during their shopping experience , fitting room duties ,cashier duties and hands on the sales floor. Stock room processing and hanging clothes putting clothes in certain departments in a timely manner before the store open.A closing shift would be cleaning the store folding clothes making closing area neat. Making sure the customer have a overall good shopping experience. I learned a great amount of customer service skills and and fast pace moving with stock and shipment. My co workers was very helpful when i first started and i learned a lot and was able to train other people. From working at h&m i don't think nothing was hard after training i caught on to things pretty fast. The most enjoyable part of the job was mainly being able to satisfy a customer by providing good customer service on a daily basic and coming to work everyday being able to always learn something new."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of interacting with customers,resolving customer problems maintaining a professional atmosphere at all times. I learned that there is an importance of customer satisfaction and it is imperative that customers are always satisfied rather than content. The management team worked diligently to provide a positive work environment for employees. My co-workers were productive and fun to work with and get along with. The hardest part of the job was the unsatisfactory of the customers which may of resulted in a negative aspect of the company. The most enjoyable part about the job was meeting the customer needs and also wants"
good,"I enjoyed my actual job here. but I experienced poor communication with and a lack of support from two separate store managers I worked under.   "
good,The job had it's hardships but i did any tasks that i was required to do and more if possible. Every task that i performed was within my job scope.
good,Great the customers with excellent customer service as well as checking them out and answering any and all questions to the best of your ability. Management is not the best simply because they fail to communicate with each other.The hardest part of my job is closing due to the fact I have a second job and I have asked not to close every night and I have change my schedule. The most enjoyable time is making the customers feel good about their shopping experience and I get to meet knew people.
good,"The pay is pretty good for this geographic area for part time work. At the location where I work, the management team is easy to work for, and most of the employees seem to have worked there for years."
good,A typical work day at work mostly starts with a greeting from all employees and management asking either  about your shift the previous night before or about your week end in most cases words of encouragement if offered based on your response. then its all  about getting  the  stocked to the floor and start shorting them based on the product location then  moving the product to its spot on the shelf's.
good,"Worked out in the Garden Center . Duties included; Wateriing plants in the Outside Lawn & Garden center.. Helping customers with garden and product inquiries. Helped them find what they needed for their gardening/yard upkeep needs."
good,"Predominantly college students that work here do to it's location in a college town Quite a bit of turnover, but fun place to work nonetheless."
good,"Pretty fast pace during this time of the year."
good,"Exciting morning huddles which we talked about sales, up coming promotions, area of opportunities, training, and shot outs to great customer service."
good,"Have worked at this specific loaction for over a year. although ive worked at another location and it was wonderful . this one in specific is wild. me as a cashier witnessed alot. especially from people who are suppose to be authority. if one person has a issue with you, everyone knows and everyone is gunning at you ESPECIALLY H.R. . ive overheard one of the head people discussing another employees business such as them not coming to work on time and etc to just regular employees as myself. even the hr has the worst attitude. i would ask questions very nicely and would get one of the most worst response back. i love the people who are just regular part time workers like myself and we all get alone especially when it comes to getting picked on by specific people in charge we all stick together. its someone there now that was on her written notice for picking with cashiers in which one even moved to another department because of her. the department manager even is insisting on leaving the department for some ""strange reason"" that she cant deal with anymore. this place is corrupt and although the pay is good and its a easy job i come in with a smile and leave crying my eyes out of stress. Favoritism is also a big issue....but lets stop here as i can go on and on about how corrupt this place was."
good,"working with contractors, budgets, materials, cost, sales, and customer service, placing special orders, meeting daily, weekly and monthly sales expectations."
good,"not a bad job, nothing you would really want to call a career decision but for the most part it is steady work and you also have good benefits along with an opportunity to move up"
good,"My tenure at Lowe's was for seasonal hire. It was a different job that groomed me in retail experience and hands on customer service that gave me a great deal of excitement, I had an amazing staff that helped me daily in areas i was unfamiliar with as being helpful and professional at all times."
good,"I learn a lot from working at Lowes. From answering phone calls, Inventory, operating machinery etc. The hardest part about this job is the heavy Lifting. Other than that this job is good,"
good,I worked in the area of Plumbing. I helped those who needed to know where things were and gave what knowledge I knew to help those with understanding the product and its use. If I did not know I contacted someone for the customer to ensure their satisfaction.
good,I enjoyed the customers that frequently asked for me to help them with their purchases. I learned a lot from my co workers
good,"- A typical work day involves taking care of employee problems and tending to customer needs. Ensure that everyone stays on task and customers are taken care of."
good,I have enjoyed my time working at Lowe's due to the fast paced retail environment. Every day you go to work you will be presented with new situations.
good,I really enjoyed my time at Lowe's.  I enjoyed helping the customers.  Management was really great.  They threw bbq's for us every now and then.
good,"For the work that you do every day, you should be paid more. Other than that, it is a fun place to work if you don't have bills to pay."
good,"Great employees with effective management. Fast paced workplace with plenty to keep you busy. Constant interaction with other departments to satisfy customers needs. The hardest part of the job was the constant changing work shifts each week, and the need to work too many weekends and holidays. Overall a great bunch of people with varied knowledge and abilities."
good,"I personally look at Lowe's as a very fun, very interesting place to work. There's a lot of upbeat personalities in the store, we maintain a neat and customer accessible environment, and we take our safety very seriously. Your fellow co-workers are always joyous to be around, the management stays on top of learning experience and is more than willing to teach you anything you want to know. The hardest part of the job is probably juggling task management along with providing excellent customer service, however it is also the most enjoyable because at the end of the day not only do you feel accomplished, but you feel like your making a difference in the store."
good,"Lowe's Home Centers, LLC provides a great atmosphere for employees and customers alike. Lowe's is a great organization that truly cares about its employees and the community that it serves. The possibilities for advancement opportunities are endless. The sky is truly the limit.If you are looking for a career, you have come to the right place. At Lowe's, everyone is valued. They not only help customers love where they live, but also make its employees love where they work!"
good,"This was the first job after I retired from the military.  Thinking that I wanted to slow down in my life and not be in charge.  To my dislike, I'm not ready for slowing down and I like being in charge."
good,I have enjoyed working with this company. There are some great people and coworkers there. They do have a few kinks to still work out but they are getting there.
good,"Overall Lowe's does a better job than most in fostering a positive work environment. Some of the managers I worked under were lacking in talent but I figure that's going to be anywhere you go. I'd work for the company again, no doubt."
good,"It was a good experience , learned to multitask and is fascinating learning about products and its uses and how to treat and deal with customers."
good,"great job just a lack of hours, has a great work life balance and overall is a great company to work for. Great atmosphere and co workers, good pay, and great benefits."
good,"Of all the jobs I have had this employer was my favorite. It is here that not only did my career blossom but that I,myself became more confident.  I started as a Cashier and advanced to  Head Cashier to Outside Lawn and Garden Manager. "
good,"Review measurements and work up orders based on products selected by customers. Assist customers in store, down stock products as needed. I learned a lot about the retail business in my time here, learned how to read plano- grams and how to read financials. My co-workers were all knowledgeable and helpful. I found nothing really hard about my job. Working in a group setting and helping customers."
good,"I have worked in 4 Lowe's stores around the country, and believe that management has a positive attitude towards it's employees. More employees on the floor to take care of the customers and more engaged with them. The hardest part of the job, was made easy with  advanced technology, no time clocks, receiving well organized an easy to find the products. the most enjoyable part of the was the comfort of the break rooms. A typical day at work was fun and enjoyable."
good,"One of the most important things in the work setting is the moral of its employees. In order to create a better relationship between the employees to customer, is by having a positive atmosphere within the work area."
good,A typical day as a cashier included helping customers and the hardest part of the job was dealing with rude and disrespectful customers. The management team was exceptional and the co-workers were very helpful and fun-loving.
good,I am the front end manager for a big box store. I manage 30 people and handle all the customer complaints that come in. I love working with people and loving working together.
good,"Llegar sacar los pendientes del dia como cotizaciones,entregas,prospeccion de clientes,y salir a campo para ir en busca de las ventas"
good,I would have liked to work there far longer... my days wore me out... as I was constantly running and busting my but the entire day... but I actually liked the job a lot...
good,"It's a great work force and flexible around your life due to changing shifts. The management are good and the skills learnt have been excellent. "
good,"A typical day at work mostly entailed customer service. I learned how to operate a lot of different machinery, including a blue lift, cash register, the carpet cutters, and the paint shakers. Management is excellent; they are always there to help you out, no matter what department you're in. The co-workers are great too. From my experience, most of them worked just as hard, or even harder than I did. It made for a great work environment. The hardest part of the job was keeping track of inventory and stocking the shelves, especially during the busy seasons. The most enjoyable part was having fun with the customers and co-workers."
good,Nothing to make a career out of but it will get you by. There are days you will hate the company and days that you will be bored out of your mind
good,I spent the day at the register or restocking drinks and snacks. Tries to empower employees and the managers were very helpful.
good,Not really a career depending on what job you get but it is a nice place to work with plenty of job security if you plan on staying there.
good,"Really enjoyed working for Lowes. Had great co-workers, and management was nice. They did a good job of building a team environment. My managers were always very understanding, and helped me improve myself. Customers were usually nice. Loved being able to learn how to be more handy."
good,"if I had a new group in I tried to get to know them as a whole, met some very interesting people. my qa exp. was daily cycle counts of entire building (this building is huge, it covers 39 football fields and 9 miles of conveyer belts) , and hazmat was easy for the most part until a paint truck came in then there were spills every were."
good,"Loved working with different people everyday. Enjoyed the work atmosphere and the friendship and fellowship with fellow employees. Must be willing to take the good with the bad when dealing with the public. Loved doing different stuff everyday and resolving customers issues or concerns. Only real drawback is that if you have a family and they are active in sports or community projects you have to try and balance it around a a 4 week out rotation. They typically want to know a month a head of time for time off or scheduling changes, Which sometimes does not happen that way, But overall the company was a blast to work for and I know that if I wanted I could go back in a instant."
good,Lowes is one of the best companies I have ever worked for.  They do an excellent job of working with their employees to increase their knowledge of the job.  They are flexible to the needs of the employee but also work hard to establish rules for the betterment of the team.  Management was great to work for.
good,They were very professional. Gave me the skills to do my job. customer satifaction was great. Learned alot at the customer return desk. Product information was always available
good,They pay their sales people well.  There is no commision so the pay a little better than other companies. If you're good they will give you better hours to be there when customers are. Sales are the name of the game here.
good,"Grate and fun place to work at. High paced, one on one contact with costumers. Daily maintenance on facility. Self motivated work."
good,"I would open the Flooring Department, put out the morning freight, put away back stock, contact customers in computer system for their job estimates, organize job order and materials. I learned how to  write up project material list, how to complete those list. The hardest part was the placing of freight bending and lifting, but I completed the task everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer satisfaction and to see what I could do when I tried my very best and put all my effort forward."
good,"I have a love/hate relationship with Lowe's.  I don't mind the job or the daily requirements but you can never tell from week to week what topic the corporate management is going to put a emphasis on.  They have worked really well with me around my college classes and let me off when I needed without a hesitation.  The biggest negative would be that if you perform well then you are expected to continue to do so and constantly do better week after week with the same compensation (sometimes even less) than those who do not perform near as well.  Lowe's is a fun place to work and I have worked my way up to a decent position, but it's not a job I could see myself retiring from, mainly because I am looking to get away from retail."
good,I enjoyed the people I enjoyed the work I did. I started when I turned 18 I learned tons on how to manage others with this company
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Lowe's, my coworkers are pleasant, and I enjoy helping customers. Management overall is decent. To cut costs, they spread employees too thin and one employee is expected to cover 3 departments, in which is too much for one person to cover especially in a high theft department."
good,"Company was well-planned in doing things, Very customer focused and driven."
good,"I would love to stay at lowes, my coworkers are great, and the job is good. I just need more hours then they can give me."
good,I typical day at work very busy you troubleshoot any electrical problem found.Do any repair needed and do periodical maintenance.Help anyone that is behind in work.Very good place to work very good management good benefits.
good,"Typical work week would involve up to 40 hours of work, with constant training and interaction with customers. Lowe's is a very ""Hands On"" company. Lowe's had great respect for customers, presentation of products and their employees."
good,Good company to work for. Friendly work place and good people.
good,manager position pays well but requires many hours and training processed but fun to be in management field.
good,Lowe's was extremely fun with good supervisors and managers. Everyone was there to help out if needed and had superior training. As well as the customers were of all different sorts.
good,"Lowe's has good job security and pays well for a retail company. Has good benefits and decent healthcare. Lowe's will try it's best to work around your schedule, but it's still a business and must make use of it's employees for profitability. If you want to go to school, part time is the best route to go. Overall Lowe's is good stable company and is a very good place to work at, but it does require time and work from it's associates. Lowe's has high expectations out of it's associates, so with high expectations comes high stress. But if you have good time management and work hard, it wont be a problem."
good,I began as an entry level associate and quickly worked my way up to department manager. The potential to be promoted from within the organization is good. The hardest part of the job is the constant changes in schedule and working on holidays. The payoff comes when your hard work is recognized.
good,"check the to do list left by department manager. waited on customer. cleaning department. stocking, inventory, left a product list of  need to be ordered for department manager. "
good,"I enjoy working for Lowe's Company. Co-workers and Management  were very helpful when needed. I learned a lot of useful things when it comes to building a lovely home. I learned how to re-key locks, glass cutting and woodcutting."
good,"Taking care of customers needs such as any issues with product, special orders,price matches,installs, credit, complaints, deliveries,internet pickups etc. I also cashier, assist customer with ideas on there home projects. My other duties are offering product protection plans, offering Lowe's credit, up sale, and cross sale."
good,"Lowes is a great place to work. they have a lot to offer the employees with a good benefits programs, open availability and bonus programs."
good,"•	Handling incoming calls or inquiries from customers"
good,"Worked freight, stocked shelves. Required to know how to complete projects with stock in department (hardware and plumbing) that customers needed help with. Managers were very helpful in giving directions. Hardest part of job was making sure I gave customer correct direction on projects they had questions about. My co-workers were enjoyable to work with."
good,This was a great place to work and a typical day was assisting commercial customer with their needs and requirements for their own business project. Great co-workers for the most part and enjoyed working with them as I am a team player. The hardest pasrt of the job was being unable to satisfy all the needs of my customers because of lack of comittment from other employees and management. The best part of the job was seeing a satified customer leave the store because of the passion I had for customer service.
good,"Advancement is there for those that are willing to work hard and dedicate themselves. But, be aware as you move up you'll be less happy"
good,"No matter what was asked or to whom, you would get the same answer,  It did not change the higher up you went.  No was no, I cant do that was, I cant. but if we did yes was yes.  not 50% today from the sales assc. and 20%from the cashier. Also, the recv area and stock rooms you had to be certified, any and all.  NO exceptions."
good,Company is good to work for however there are no promotion opportunities within the same location once you have achieved department manager.
good,"Depending on schedule day started between 6:00 and 9:00 am.  Customer service is very important in order to get the customer to come back to the store.  A person who has an attitude or bad day cannot ruin or give you a bad attitude, no matter what you have to stay positive.  Meeting people and the co-workers, that was enjoyable."
good,love to stay busy with a management team that cares and works with you. I love working with positive people who care about their jobs just as much as I do
good,"I like working with my team of another three guys,unloading trucks and helping customers with there questions about making changes to there home or business."
good,"I learned customer service, home improvement the hardest part of the job was balancing all of the job responsibilities and giving awesome customer service"
good,"The co-workers at Lowe's were of a variety. A great group of people to work with. If you didn't understand how something is done, they would help you until you got it down pat."
good,The people are hard workers. They are friendly and are good people. Good food for the workers and benefits.  policy that works.
good,"Ability to work out for a career, serve your country and help others who are in need of our service"
good,"Show up on time, or early, and ready to work. You will stay busy, if your not busy, then your slacking in this place. Pretty good work environment. Lots of laid back people as long as you do your job. The opportunity for advancement is definetly there if you want to take it."
good,"If you work hard and have respect, it will be acknowledged and you will be rewarded."
good,"a typical day at work is:"
good,great team builder Management ensured Training was done for all employees
good,Enjoyed this job very much and would have liked to be more involved as sometimes found it boring.
good,"Working as a Lowe's associate, I efficiently stock the inventory and provide quality customer service. Working as a team with other co-workers is  something the company strongly encourages to its employees. There are times where even management will take on task with part-time and full time associates, The hardest part of the day would consist of stocking the floor during hours customers are heavily in the store shopping. I enjoy working with co-workers that love working together to solve difficult task,"
good,"I worked at Lowe's for over 5 years. They have great benefits and they even help pay for tuition for any full-time employee. I really liked 99% of my co-workers. The computer system is horribly outdated and it would lag a lot of the time, so that would get frustrating when I was trying to complete orders for customers. Overall, Lowe's treated me very well though."
good,I have worked at home depot before and this company is by far more accommodating to women and them moving up into management. I started in the garden department and was quickly moved into the team leader position. I was able to surpass the head cashier position because I was given the fairest chance.
good,"Customer Service is targeted, but balance of daily tasks and monthly goals seem to take priority."
good,I interacted with great customers and co-workers.The management was helpful.
good,I just need more hours and its hard to get on full time there. I usually get there around 10:00 and start helping customers on the floor. I get a 15 minute break around noon.
good,"Awesome, people, place and environment. Work schedule was the only thing complicated at times."
good,Wish I was still with this company **Tear Drop** I left right after the massive ASM Layoffs 2011 due to just not knowing what was going on and had another company trying to bring me on and offering a insane amount of money.  To this day I think this was the best company I have worked for and learned so much at this company and from the people I worked with.
good,"•Provided customers with an unforgettable experience resulting in a loyal customer base	"
good,"The last position  I had with Lowe's was with Product Service. I would begin by reviewing the projects due for the week and make assignments. My job focus was resetting product to new plan-o-grams. I learned more about product and reasons why changes were made in the display process. I worked with management to monitor sales performance. I worked with a team of 5 and was able to complete big projects in record time. "
good,"I enjoy working for this company. It is a great job, the pay is decent."
good,"There will always be ups an downs at any company, and that is to be expected at Lowes #444. "
good,"The people and some management is great here, and they do provide you with the tools to be successful."
good,"I work part time for Lowes which means I can only work a max of 25 hours a week (VA Lowe's policy) which is the only real draw back about working here. Besides that its pretty relaxed enviroment, its a big store so people come and go all the time."
good,"Typically helped customers and restocked empty or low shelves with new product"
good,Lowe's was a great home to me for many years. I developed my sales skills there and had great mentors. I eventually became a mentor myself and I hope that I helped someone as much in their own journey with Lowe's
good,"Each department has it's own personality, when you match up with the right one working at Lowe's is a blast.  Like plants? Work in Garden and you'll be stoked. Lumber and Bldg Materials is my people. Each department gets it's own cast of regular characters/customers, too. They keep the job entertaining."
good,"A typical day would involve unloading a truck, then stocking. Sometimes there would be no truck or need for us to work the floor in various departments. I took a lot of customer relations courses and was familiarized with various equipment required for the job."
good,"Hours varied week to week"
good,"It was a good place to work. The company provided a good job place. It was safe, clean and fun."
good,"Almost every day was busy, and fast paced. Which is what I prefer."
good,work was fun because you get to know plant and flowers. people wasnt very nice
good,Its a nice place to work. With alot of learning experience available.
good,I liked the fast paced work. I was always busy helping contractors and customers with all projects they were doing.
good,Excellent for growing individual they are very supported in family and work life . I recommend this company for everybody
good,"great place to work at, good people."
good,"A typical day would include talking with customers to try and figure out what exactly they needed for a specific project or task. I would help out in every single department, but was still assigned to a general area for the day, usually the inside and outside lawn and garden areas. I would get code 50's at the customer service desk which means I would go get a customer's order that they paid for and get their product from the back. I would use an order picker to get heavy products such as grills and appliances down from shelves. I would cashier and water plants when they needed me to. I would help cut blinds on a special machine, help cut keys, mix paint for customers in the front of the store and much more. I also got to go on deliveries and learned how to install things as well as work with customers at their homes. This job taught me so much because of all of the tasks I was expected to learn. There was great communication among all employees and managers to help get everything done at the end of the day. The hardest part of the job was trying to get customers to sign up for in-home consultations. So many people did projects themselves in order to save money, and it was hard to get people to sign up. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting outside of the store and going on deliveries. It made me realize how important and valuable the customers were to Lowe's. I got to see how appliances and other products were installed and got to get a little closer to the customers and built some good relationships for the company."
good,I Learned how to be more of a peoples person to the customers and that no matter what the customers is always right.. the co workers and management was very helpful and everything was based on team work
good,although the management is not the best in the world I find a way to get through my day with being friendly towards customers and finishing my work.
good,"Lowes is a company that services customers in need of various home improvement products. While on the job I have to tend to the paint and home decor section of the store. I am proud to say I can manage this job while attending college, but it hasn't been an easy battle. I have to work my schedule around my school hours and deal with my job asking for me to come in on days that could be used doing homework. However, I am happy to do so."
good,"My store has had a lot of turnover with assistant managers and department managers. The computer programs designed to make shopping for special order items is very difficult to learn, there are always exceptions to every rule, and every department uses different sales programs, it results in untrained employees, and chaos. The database we were supposed to be done using two years ago is still the primary database and looks like it was designed when Pong and Pac Man were first created. Most of the benefits are way better than anywhere else, and most of the management is laid back and friendly. A team approach is expected and good customer service is expected so the atmosphere is pretty upbeat most of the time."
good,"Managers are terrible, employees respect you in their job, if their was no employees the managers could not handle the pressure"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Lowes for the most part although it was seasonal, managers were nice and understanding when it came to issues away from work, most coworkers were also good, the pay was decent compared to other retailers. Workload was good aside for when people called out and it got really busy but we always got our breaks and lunches."
good,"Worked for Lowe's for 12 years, advancement gets tricky with limited options for advancement. Worked all over the store, learned a lot about everything working there from my managers"
good,"Our company, specifically our store, is highly regarded as a family first company. We are encouraged to do our best and bring new ideas to management."
good,The associates at Lowe's are among the best. Teamwork is a strong suit. The hardest part of the job is finding enough time to get all your tasks completed. The best part of the job is working with so many different people.
good,"Some days are very busy, others are not. If you plan well, you can accomplish required tasks efficiently and leave yourself plenty of time to service customers. Selling is very important and you must be willing to be a sales driven person and not just an order taker."
good,"I enjoyed this job very much.  It was something new each day & I tended to build a relationship with my customers that came to see me.  I like being on the move at work, always having something to do.  I enjoyed the openness of the store as a whole.  Being able to work outside when it's a beautiful day, there's nothing else like it.  My only downfall was it was very limited for seasonal help only."
good,"I would have 1 or 2 appointments with clients in various stages of project.  I would spend time following up with clients I had given proposals to.  I would talk to vendors to monitor deliveries and orders.  I became proficient in 20/20 kitchen design software.  I learned and used order management system.  My department manager was helpful, motivating and supportive. The hardest part was managing clients who I was working with to take time to assist walk-in customers.The most enjoyable part was taking a client from inception thru design, order, delivery and completion.  I built trusting relationships with most of my customers"
good,All in all this is a good place to work.  The management is a bit chaotic and confusing but the pay is good and the customers are friendly and patient.
good,"As a cashier, a typical day at Lowes is operating the cash register. Constantly in contact with customers all day. Its something new to learn everyday while working at Lowes. As far as management, I have no problem with any member of management. Co-workers are friendly and courteous. I really don't have an hardest part of the my job, everything runs smoothly. The most enjoyable part is making the customers happy and providing great customer service."
good,"At typical day at Lowes consists of learning new things and working closely with people.  People includes employees on the sales team as well as customers.  Communication is the key in any job but is especially stressed when customers are in front of you.  Learning to understand and find what they need is most important and is definitely the focus at Lowes.  "
good,"Assisting customers with shopping, checking out, returning items, exchanging, and placing special orders."
good,The management at my Lowe's location is friendly in manner and good in communication.  The employee's are appreciated for the work that is done.  I have learned a lot about the computer system with Lowe's as far as scanning product and entering them into the inventory system.  I have also learned great customer service with being in the retail business and creating good relationships with customers and potential buyers and contractors that come into the store daily.  I also like delivering bought appliances to customers homes and delivering them a smile and a brand new appliance.
good,"Make worklists, merchandise product, help customers, learn about products. The hardest part of the job was making sure employees were held accountable for their actions."
good,"I was a cashier and to help customers service. I learned no matter how hard the job is there is no excuse to not doing your job well. I made sure my work area was clean and organized for myself and for the next co-worker. I know customer service because that's what I like to do. Provide nice, honest service. The hardest part would be learning the returns desk but I caught on real quick and customers had not problem with my service for them. When I know I'm doing my job right then that makes my job enjoyable."
good,Was a great place to work. there was always ups and downs just like at any job. but there was room for advancement and pay was good.friendly clean store
good,"In this job you are required to be able to multitask between your daily tasks with constant interruptions by customers. This may sound simple until you actually have to try and accomplish 9 hours of work in 8 hours, while being asked a question ever 5 minutes. I really enjoy working here, but the way my store has promoted from part time to full time has baffled me and I do need full time. Length of service and loyalty are not factors, neither is work performance and I would like a company that does have that."
good,"Although you could be an average starting employee, the room for advancement for hard workers was substantial. Our store manager at the time was 28 making $100K plus a year. I moved from associate to team leader and then on to department manager in just a year's time. Odd hours and beginning pay were the only lackluster parts."
good,"was a great company to work for."
good,"Lowe's is a growing company with a new country manager that has high expectations and aggressive goals.  Jobs are constantly evolving to meet the business needs.  Lots of opportunity for advancement for hard working, dedicated person.  Hours can be long for some positions."
good,Overall good place to work. Staff is very friendly however hours are very inconsistent
good,"Part time this company is good for school. As long as you don't get too friendly with the people that you work with there is advancement opportunity. Once an opinion is formed about you at your store good or bad, it is extremely hard to change that view to anyone. Management can be lazy at times."
good,"The rules are very set about break and lunch times, and are to the benefit of the employee. I learned a lot that I had no idea about before by working in a home improvement store. I worked under many supervisors and they were all very informative and helpful. They used constructive criticism and instruction instead of bold criticism of me trying to learn something new. My co-workers liked their jobs, most of them were in college so it was part time for them as well as me. The hardest part of the job would have to be answering the phones when there were 6 lines going at one time and three customers waiting on you to get off the phone while no one else was at the desk to help you. That was the hardest part of the job, but the most enjoyable. I got to learn how to interact quickly and interpret facial expressions and body language about the item being returned or asked about. I loved being able to help someone find what they were looking for while talking to them about their project or about their use of another product compared to the one they were about to buy."
good,"Lowes company is a great career move, with great people to work for, and most management that sets clear expectations. The pay was excellent, benefits were good, healthcare not great. The training wasn't great, but you learn as you go. The store manager at the Glenmont Store was a reason this store has a high turn over, she is a great store manager, not a good ""people"" manager."
good,"get to work load the truck an start deliveries"
good,". check mechain before opporation "
good,"Working at Lowe's was made fun because of the people around me. The job itself was okay, but nothing to brag about. Management for the most part was fine and I mostly had no problem with them. There really was no hard part of the job as long you did what you needed. Overall it was a great experience."
good,"on a typical day I replace shelf stock, help customers, and work on or with lawn equipment. I have learned a lot about lawn equipment, pesticides,  and other lawn care items. for the most part my mangers and co workers are easy to get along with."
good,"Work consists of hours between 4-8 hour shifts helping customers and abiding by managements. My coworkers are an amazing group of individuales who have also became like family to me. Most of the time the managers are great company as well, but every now and then they think they are better then you are."
good,"Merchandising often involved moving steel beams, prior to merchandise changes.  Usually we had to go outside to find additional steel the right size or use some modification if proper size was not available.  When project was completed one would feel a distinct sense of accomplishment."
good,"Enjoyable work environment, great people. I don't make it a habit of speaking ill of employers, past or presen"
good,"Solid place to work.  Decent pay with a good compensation package with benefits."
good,Very good company - ability to grow and learn as well as try new positions to gain knowledge.  Enjoyed the retain experience.
good,"When you first come in you are greeted by some of the nicer co-workers. Then you head into your department and greet customers and help answer any questions they might have. If they ask you where something is you walk them to exactly where they need to go. I definitely learned a lot during on the job training. I learned how to cut tile, carpet, vinyl, and blinds for windows. I learned a little bit about basic plumbing products. Management is nice but you always want to be on your toes whenever you see them around your department. Some of my co-worker were very nice and even became close friends. Other co-workers are just there for the job, they are nice but stay to themselves, the rest try to get to know you so that they can use it against you to try and get you fired. The hardest part of the job was some of the questions asked by the customer, but when I didn't know the answer I would take the customer to a co-worker that did know the answer and I would learn from the answers they gave the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with friends."
good,"Lowe's work environment is great because I am presented with the challenge of contacting customers on a day to day basis to keep them up to date with their installation(s) and making sure they are done in a timely manner. Management is great because they're always there to help if you have a question or faced with a dilemma. The hardest part of the job is making sure that you, the Central Production Office(CPO), and the installers are on the same page because sometimes they may not update the status of the order in a timely manner. The most enjoyable thing about the job is providing premiere customer service and having that customer come back and show you the job after it's finished, customer satisfaction."
good,A company that works with and for their employees!  I learned that I could go to any manager with any question and they would take the time to answer or find the answer!  Everyone in the company was incredible helpful.
good,"A typical day at work starts with a store meeting that informs us of the previous days sales and what the goal is at that point to meet budget for the week. "
good,"Busy place to work with ok pay. Management tends to show favoritism at times but can also be really good at what they do. Great group of people to work with, everyone is always looking out for each other."
good,"Lowe's was a great company to work for. If you have the passion,knowledge and drive you will succeed."
good,Most employees worked hard everyday. The upper management was very good and helpful.
good,"While working at Lowes I really enjoyed my day to day life. Typically my job consisted of mixing the paint, stocking shelves, helping customers, and occasionally special ordering certain products. I learned a lot from the paint department including different sheens that go walls and which ones are good for each room in a home, how to cut blinds or other window treatments, and helping with inventory. I really enjoyed the management at Lowes, I always felt as though I could talk to anyone I needed for anything and my work was appreciated. My co workers were really great and easy to work with and I felt like I learned a lot each day working with all of them. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to all the new products that would come in and learning as much as I could about them so I could easily sell them to customers, and what I loved most about my job was getting to do a variety of different jobs while working at lowes."
good,"This is a great company,  Fortune 50 for a reason.  Main reason for leaving is they stopped growing, thus making it difficult to promote within the company.  Great opportunity's here though."
good,"Handle all inbound / outbound calls for update of all customer accounts. Process Payment Adv Management of all status of customer accounts.  Work as a team with coworkers to meet goal set by Management.  Some time customer upset or call in to compliant of products or service.  Handle all call to resolve for clarity."
good,"I work in the delivery department which is very organized and well managed, The add on to a days delivery by the salespeople who can over ride a booked day is the downfall."
good,"I supervise 17 people in 3 different departments Receiving, Delivery, and Freight Flow.  I honed the following skills: multitasking, time management, and trust through verification.  The challenging part of my job is balancing the logistics and stocking for Lowe's Home Centers.  I enjoy the face paced environment of my Monday through Friday schedule."
good,"I loved working here. We had a tough upper management that drilled us on daily on the meaning of customer service and sales. Having clean and well stocked shelves was a must and everything had to be perfect. "
good,The only negative that comes to mind when thinking back on my time at Lowe's is that I wasn't able to transfer my employment with them.
good,Enjoyed almost all parts of the job environment.  The pay and benefits were not as good as other companies.  Fast paced retail environment that never seemed dull or mundane.
good,"Lowe's is a clean, safe place to work.    If you are a people person this is a terrific job because you work with a lot of co-workers and help customers in all aspects of their shopping experience."
good,A typical day for me at Lowe's would be to come in at the beginning at the shift and make sure the lot stays clear of carts. I also answered any calls of any department when a customer needed assistance loading their product. Hardest part of the job is when there would be calls all over the building and i'm the only loader. The most enjoyable part of the job were making sure the customers were okay and drama free environment.
good,"I worked for the company for nearly 10 years and have been everything from cashier to Assistant Store Manager."
good,Overall great opportunities to move around within the store and advancement within the district
good,"Work was to always take care of the customer and help them find ways to be able to purchase the product and find the right product for the project they were working on. Learned how to approach customers with the direction of helping and listening and suggestions of how to accomplish what they are trying to do. "
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for.  They do listen to their employees and are striving to work for a better customer experience for our customers.  My management cares about my well being & career within the Lowe's Corporation and bends over backwards to help when they can.  My co-workers are easy to get along with and we have no problems.  A typical day is full of work so no time to rest really.
good,The worst part of Lowe's is the rotating schedule that doesn't really allow for much family time.
good,"It's a great Lowe's that I work at.  Management is great, the head manager sets the tone for the Assistant Store Managers.  Everyone works together.  I enjoy it a lot, but am looking for something I can have most weekends off."
good,"rotating shifts/weekends.. improved customer relation skills, sales skills.. loved this job, not the hrs.. co-workers, customers were a lot of fun.. physically very demanding.."

good,"Good place to work. High efficiency, goal and accuracy very important."
good,"Customer service top priority. Learned how to operate and run a receiving area to include receiving , processing and distributing product throughout the store.  Co-workers were great to work with and help was given when needed."
good,"I am a very organized, rule following, task oriented person with lots of retail experience. Was told during interview I should be able to advance onto floor to use my expeiences but have yet to get there. Workers who have been there longer and yes maybe more familar with this store have moved into these jobs.I have 41 years retail experience. I have never stood only behind a register in all my years in retail. I like all aspects of retail but I really like the behind the scenes as I have been doing that for a good portion of my prior years. Love customers, they are great, down to earth, learn lots and hear all kinds of stories and now several come looking for me when ready to check out."
good,"Great Company, the associates become family aswell as co workers"
good,Great place fast pace I enjoy working with the different people of all creeds. I have learned the ends and outs of the business
good,"Not a bad place to work. They have decent pay and benefits. Lowe's has a lenient attendance policy. They have a lot of incentives for their employee's. I, as well as most people that have worked for Lowe's did not like the way management was. They are not fair on a lot of rules they have set for the company. They reprimand one person for something and let the next person get away with the same thing."
good,"Multi-Unit retail market director with 13 stores throughout the Southern Tier of New York and Pennsylvania.  The most enjoyable part of the position was the development of senior level managers within the market.  Coaching, teaching and training each to advance within the company."
good,Lowe's like many big box stores is a successfull business with a customer focused approach.
good,"Hours always vary, never work a set shift regardless of standing in company.  Very safe place to work.  Management is good and hard work is noticed and appreciated.  Large variety of co-workers.  Some customers can be difficult to deal with while others can be great."
good,I worked hard to inspire Employee's to want to come to work each and everyday. I strived to achieve Lowe's Vision and Sales Plans.
good,i loved working at lowes the only reason i left was because I wasn't going to be able to finish school.
good,"A typical day of work is arriving at least 10-15 minutes early and going through a list of orders. I contact the contractors who install for us and ask for updates on scheduling and install progress. I communicate with customer's the install process, give them the status of their special orders, and also communicate with them any scheduling. I contact vendors and get estimated delivery dates of products. I file a lot of folders with customer information, I pull a lot of product which consists of doors, windows, carpet, tile, laminate flooring, countertops, cabinets, evaporative coolers, and any other product that needs to be pulled. "
good,"A job that is very customer-focused that teaches the meaning ""customer service."" Also, there were friendly co-workers that share the same drive of satisfying the customers' needs and accomplishing the detailed assignments. Finally, I enjoyed learning to operate machines such as the forklift."
good,It Was Easy Just Had The Wrong Guy Teaching Me And He Just Put Me To Straight Labor. Not Complaining But I Was Doing Other Duties An Wanted Me TO Do Whatever He Wanted Thats All
good,Start work with printing reports and looking at previous days numbers for the credit application part of my job. Work with the voice team to come up with ways to improve employees relationships with the management team. Get on the register and help customers on the floor.
good,They value they're culture everyone that works there is glad they work at Lowe's. It's not a difficult job at all as long as you do what your supposed to do it's easy money.
good,"My experience at Lowe's was great.  I enjoy talking with clients one on one, to further understand their needs and to make sure that the company matches them.  There were plenty of opportunities to do so, and the company encouraged such interactions with clients."
good,"Amazing place to work and amazing people to work with, fast paced with different experiences every day.."
good,You will always be busy if you have a job in the installed sales department. When you are on the floor or on a register you have your days where it is either really busy or really dead. I think the hardest part of the job is when a customer is upset with one of the installers. We have no control over what an Installer does but I understand what the customer is going through and we try to fix it. Once we do take care of the customer and they are satisfied that is when I enjoy my job when I know that the customer is happy.
good,"Typical days at Lowes include checking in product for customers and placing them in an organized bays. Using a forklift I would move product on pallets and unload pallets off flatbed trucks . I've learned how to manage inventory and keep all product up to date with customers. Management was good, always had an open door to any issues or concerns. The hardest part of the job would be the physical part by using hand trucks to move 100 + pound products . The most enjoyable part of the job is the friendly environment."
good,Helping customers with day to day home improvements to there homes. from decks to windows to roofs. Hardest part of the job was making sure to get the customer what they wanted was what they were looking at.
good,"Typical retail, assist customers and stock shelves. Morning routine would be to print out and review reports from previous day sales and look for opportunities to improve. Walk the sales floor and ensure associates are staying productive."
good,"I enjoy working for this company. They are driven with high morals and great customer service. However, I am looking for a career with better compensation, benefits, and a chance to excel higher."
good,This was a good place to work except when you had to clean the bathrooms
good,"A typical day at work would include :"
good,"Lowe's is advancing in the right direction for the business field we are in .  But getting here has been a struggle with ever changing products and technology.  Troutman is the Company Test Store for new process, new technology and we are the first to roll out any new platform"
good,Lowes is some what good of a company. However when they said that the would hire you back they won't after the temp seaso is over with.
good,"good work environment. "
good,"Busy, never a dull moment, always stay busy, alot of paper work to be done"
good,"Easy place to work, but not easy to get a promotion most of the time."
good,"All in all, this company has a very good structure. Enjoyable with opportunity to grow. A great place to work.   "
good,"The hardest part of the job was learning the computer systems, and trying to remember customers.  Even though it wasn't required, I would try to remember them and what they were shopping for to make their next return better than the last.  The most enjoyable part of working at Lowe's was the awesome management, the great co-workers and of course the customers."
good,"Managed more than 100 team members, in the process of pulling orders, loading truck. All in a safe environment."
good,Lowe's is an ok company to work at depending on who's managing the store you're and the people you work with. The customers can get really rude and sometimes they feel as if the workers there are obsolete. Very frustrating around holidays just like any other department store.
good,"overall atmospheer was awesome... good people, good customers fun job!"
good,"This was their motto to customers. But it can easily be used by its employees. A great, friendly, work environment!"
good,"Fast-paced environment, fun place to work, great team, great benefits and pay, hard work"
good,Great place to work. You can learn anything as long as you are willing. 
good,The most enjoyable part of my time with Lowe's was definately the people. Not only the people I worked with but also the customers that came into our building. I have made some life long friends through my years with Lowe's.
good,"Lowe's is a great company with lots of great programs to support the employees and the business. The job can be demanding, but there is an effort to ensure the employee is taken care of."
good,The hours are staggered so you are never working the same time every day. Good pay and good health insurance and benefits. 
good,"good company to work for, clean and well stocked stores. you gain lots of experiance"
good,This was a decent position that provided decent pay. The hours were full time yet I was considered part time. I was able to move around to different positions until I found one that fit. Management is down to earth and expectations are feasible to achieve. 
good,It's not everyday you meet people you actually enjoy hanging out with outside of work.  Management was willing to work with my school schedule which I found very convenient. 
good,"Decent pay, benefits, employee incentives for a college kid."
good,Part-time I enjoy assembling products so that they can be sold on floor.  Good place to work and the co-workers are great.

good,"A typical day would include greeting customers and directing them to the correct department or product requested is. Interacting with customers and employees. At the end of the day cleaning, organizing and socking soda and snacks for the following day was expected, so everything was ready to go for the next day."
good,"I enjoy the freedom to work on my projects. The management team is supportive of my effort to grow the business. They provide training and set clear goals. The process is a work in progress, they understand the changing market and are trying to cater to every customer."
good,"This is a good second job for someone looking to work part time, The pay isn't the greatest but it's not bad either."
good,"I like working for Lowes, especially as a cabinet specialist. My typical day consists of talking to prospective clients that some into Lowes looking to redesign their kitchen. I have learned a lot about speaking to customers and finding out exactly what they are seeking in their new kitchen design by finding out what they do and don't like in their current kitchen. I also have the chance to use my project management skills by monitoring the project from measuring to installing.The hardest part about my job is working three out of four weekends a month. The best part is seeing the customer's satisfied look on their face after their dream kitchen is installed."
good,Lowes is a high quality employer enjoy the management I have and the people whom I work with
good,hard work but pays off in the long run helpfull management and opportunity for advancement from within.
good,"I must say I started at lowe's as a seasonal employee. Went on as a part-timer. My Manager's from store to department mgrs. Even my district mgr, are all some of the best employers I've worked with in years. Very motivational. And my co-workers well there just my additional family and some lifetime friends, In many ways it has inspired me to climb the corporate latter of success all the top of the chain. I hope to become a store manager with the company within a few years. I must say the hardest part of my job has being able to keep up with new products that we recieve continuously. even though it has been challenging to work with the veribalance system, which had a little problem from time to time but by inlarge it gave me more determination to succeed, and im extremely greatful for the opportunity Lowe's has giving me to blossom and grow into a beautiful flower. And I look forward to my next step within this corporation. And I always look forward to helping all of our wonderful customers I see on a daily basis."
good,"My typical day at work starts with walking the aisles in my department, making sure all customers have been helped. Mostly, I help mix paint and cut blinds for customers, and suggest products. I have learned quite a few machines around the store, and the policies of Lowe's. Lowe's management always make sure they are open and available to customers as well as employees. My coworkers are very eager to help with any and all situations throughout the workday. The hardest part of the job of course is to make everyone happy, while the most enjoyable part of the day is seeing the customers I help happy with their experience at Lowe's."
good,Lowes Market is my 2nd form of employement. I have been with them 9 years as a second job and have enjoyed the friendly atmosphere.
good,"A typical day at work consists of running register and assisting customers in product knowledge and product location. I have learned how to work in a fast paced environment while assisting the general public with their demands and needs independently and as a team player. My position with the corporation has given me the opportunity to work closely with management and co-workers to gain invaluable skills, therefore strengthening my ability to lead others. The most challenging aspect of my current position is diffusing customer service issues to keep the customer satisfied and keep the availability for repeat business. The most rewarding part of my day is witnessing the satisfied look of the customers."
good,"There is a routine everyday in which you know how your schedule will be, you will learn how to work well with others. The hardest part of the job is maintaining deliveries while the equipment being used breaks down. The most enjoyable part are the quarterly bonuses and employee appreciation."
good,"Every day at Lowes wasn't typical it was different. There are so much to learn from Gardening to Lumber. Management was pretty ok not really tuned in with the employers but more concerned about value of things. There is nothing to hard about the job. The enjoyable part of the job is the customers, they made my day."
good,Lowe's has a great retirement. I also loved the work place. I learned a great deal about every dept.
good,This job really gave you a chance to hone in on your customer service\people and time management skills.
good,Daily we had to check the shelves to see if there was any product that needed to be replaced. During the day we had to make sure all product was easily accessible to customers and answer all customer questions. This included questions about my department and where to find product in other departments.
good,"The managers were rude but overall, the place was great. They were thurough when training. The 90 day probationary period was the roughest. They stick you in ""doors"" for the first 90 days and all you do is load product all day. Barely ever given another job while in probationary period but it definitely gives you a workout and prepares you for spending long periods on your feet without downtime during the busy season."
good,"Typical day was 10+ hours. Varying hours. Learned alot about retail management; HR, inventory, scheduling, complaint handling, A/R and A/P. Hardest part of my job was long hours and balancing work/life. Most enjoyable part of my job was seeing my hardwaork pay off in the form of increased sales and adulation for my employees."
good,"Lowes has excellent buisness plan. A bit too much turn-over and @ this location, some odd choices for leaders but 2 of the best managers I've ever worked for."
good,They have been very considerate with me going to school and offer a great work/ life balance.
good,Very diverse. Fun meeting new people and learning about their projects and finding ways to help them come up with ideas and solutions.
good,"Working there was done on a contract and compensation was pretty good. During downtime, we were able to relax a bit and do our own mini projects and during the busy period we would take calls, do repairs, or do online support. Hard part was diagnosing some computer issues or figuring out which part was burnt out."
good,A typical day involves assisting customers and maintaning the stores appearance. The people there are great to work with and more than willing to lend a hand when needed. The hardest part of the job is the hours. A day can start any where from 6:00 Am to 2:00 PM. The best part of the job is that at the end of the day you can leave and not have to worry about what is coming up the next day.
good,Fast pasted environment with focus on excellent customer service. Supportive management and co-workers. Work to improve communication with customers for better understanding of policies & procedures.
good,A typical day at work consists of taking care of the customer. Making sure they are finding everything they need and to make sure they have a great experience shopping in the store. My customer service skills have really improved while working at Lowe's. Running customer service helps with learning the computer systems and phone answering skills also. The store that I am working at shows teamwork. We are a team and we act like a team including the management. I believe the hardest part of my job is dealing with very unhappy customers. They are upset and telling them you’re sorry sometimes doesn’t cut it while you are still trying to fix the problem. The customers are also the most enjoyable part of the job. We employees can make their day when we are able to help them find what they need.
good,Supervised Product Service team to ensure displays and product placement on a day to day basis
good,A typical day work was great customers and friendly staff to work with. I learned great customer service skills and teamwork skills. Management of the store was superb and my co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was coming from the environment of being a kid into being in the real world with adults. The most enjoyable part of the job was being accepted for who I am.
good,"Typical day at work: Upon arrival at the facility, I would meet with the sports director to review the responsibilities/duties for the day. I would then report to my area and setup the activities/games for the day. I then would wait for the participants, coaches and referees to arrive to begin the games. I would supervise all games, participants, coaches, referees, and parents. I would answer any question and respond to any dilemma as need be. Once all games were finished, I would collect equipment and do a daily equipment check. I then would report to the gym and monitor open gym until the facility closed."
good,no me gustaba que no dejaran tiempo de descanzar despues de estar todo el dia parada y pues para lo que era pagaban muy poco habia muy buen ambiente laboral
good,hard to get ahead and climb the ladder. alot of training to be done. very task orintated along with customer focus. management doesent give the feel of caring. there seem to be there colecting a pay check
good,very versatile dealing with all types of people and gaining knowledge on all aspects of home improvement.
good,"Lowe's great company everyday we had out goals to meet proffered exceeding our goals, set a task deligated and manage as a team leader second incharge of a department job was multitasking cashier, closing sales. Had great employees well motivated well rounded and hungry for success. Sometimes this job got over welming, when another associate called in sick or for any other emegencys had to cover their department and yours and the knowledge for other departments was difficult but not to challenging. I enjoyed Lowe's always new challenges every day always new product and always new tools to learn from."
good,you always had fun at work it never seem like work management was good at making sure you and the customers were happy.
good,"Well Structured environment with good coworkers. Position was part-time. Decent Hours, yet laid off at end of season due to demand."
good,All Duties to make a 35 million dollar company run successfully.
good,"Loved working here. People were great, management was laid back and understanding and pay was good."
good,I like my job. We have awesome customers and a great work family. I would prefer more stability on hours and schedule but everything else is great
good,"Lowes Provides a great work experience and skill building opportunities. Also the workforce and staffing are great and uplifting, upbeat and quality service to the consumer."
good,"Overall a great company to work for. Great culture and values toward customer service and merchandising. I really enjoyed the people I worked with really felt like family. I learned a lot about retail management, budget control, managing and training associates, and always attempted to learn something new everyday. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers and the amount given to certain complaints well above and beyond a reasonable resolution, but Lowe's strives to make every customer happy and sometimes have to do way more than should to resolve a complaint."
good,I loved everything about this job. I enjoyed the people there my co-workers as well as the customers. It was a fast but steady paced job and I loved the pay!
good,Mostly very good people to work with
good,productive and fun lots of new things to learn really nice people to work with
good,This job offered great compensation plans and benefits. Management was great up until complete change within my last year.
good,"enjoyed working fo lowes,would like another opportunity."
good,A typical night of work begins with simply arriving to work on time at 9pm.... The store closes at 10pm so customer contact is minimal for those who do not enjoy working with public. After clocking in for work I typically check in the back to see if the truck unloaders need any help.. Then I head to whichever department I am assigned to work for the night and began stocking the merchandise in its assigned isle and shelf location. Since arriving at lowes I have learned that working together as a team is definitely always the best way to go. My superviser is a very fair and understanding superviser. For the most part the coworkers are all pretty good people.. Very friendly.
good,Its hard once you get stared but when you get it its very fun. I learned how to ride a walkie rider (very fun) the management is great. The people was ok. The hardest part is the dust and the long hours. The joyful part is the walkie rider and getting the orders pick on time . I really miss this job
good,"Clock in, go get your vest, walk the the from of the store where the check outs are and check customers out and clean around your area, and get buggies."
good,Helping people/customers in need of help. I work well with others and the environment provided at work is great.
good,Specialize in the design of kitchen and bath. direct relations with the client in designing a new or remodeled kitchen or bath
good,"help customers, sale merchandise, build items, pay starts low but can advance"
good,"Unload trucks, stocking shelves. Typical shift for part timer is 5 hours, it could be more but management wont let you go over 30."
good,Always busy doing something. Never a dull moment. Could always count on help from others.
good,"It's a part time job so I get there at 4am and start working the freight in my sections (paint, walls and windows, and home decor) up until about 7 or 8 am then go around and help in the other sections of the store. Usually a manager comes by and pulls a Bill Lumberg a couple times a day, but other than that I usually have a pretty lax day and no one really watching over me while I get stuff done. I have a fear of heights and sometimes I am supposed to put items up in the top stock which is not very enjoyable. I do like the people there, as most of them are quite friendly and personable."
good,Organize merchandise from shipping trucks. pull customer orders. stock store shelves. assist customers.
good,"I like working at Lowe's, I like the people, the friendly atmosphere and the company. I am just ready for a change and looking to work normal hours, nights and weekends dont leave much for a family life."
good,i had fun while i was there. it was really fun during the holidays. that was my favorite!!
good,"Great place to work, meager pay, but room for advancement within the company all over the USA"
good,Great management. Good pay great advancement. Left job to start school.
good,"Good work environment and the people were friendly. Hours were all over the place. (Could be days then nights) Managment was ok, but if you had been working for them for years and then a new person came in, they would start making as much or more than you. If you wanted to advance with the company, they would hire outside, before they would hire within the store. Overall the environment was not bad, but just felt like I was not going anywhere."
good,"Great people to work with, Fun atmosphere. Management cares for it's employees. Flexible schedules."
good,Lowes is a good place to work if still in school. Work is usually fast paced and co-workers are usually in good spirits. Management is ok depends on what store you work in.
good,I started as a Human Resources Manager in June of 2007 (Hired out of College). I've learned a great deal about Human Resources on top of what I learned in college. The most important aspects that I've learned is how to manage performance and counsel employees. Lowe's is currently going through a large-scale change initiative which I have helped implement in my store.
good,Met many good friends while working there. Is a good company with good benefits offered with opportunities to better ones self.
good,Very good and stable company to work for. Receiving department is the hardest for physical work.
good,"Typical work day very busy, day goes quick"
good,"Where I was is where the brunt of people's anger would hit, so it can be a bit stressful at times. I learned how to talk to people so that they could calm down, and actually got pretty good at it by the time that I had left! The hardest part of the job though would be having to sit outside in the hot and sticky garden cashier spots, while having angry and hot people yelling. Never fun."
good,"great for a flex schedule, but harder for families who need a stable schedule. Advancement is quick for hard workers, gave me a great experience in management."
good,"I've learned and acquired a lot of knowledge from Lowe's that will stick with me. I would recommend working there to nearly anyone. I had a lot of fun, and it's a good well balanced company."
good,Well organized and clear cut ideas on job requirements. Adherence to Policy and Procedure was very restrictive but understandable.
good,"Typical day began with walking the previous days worklist and making a new one, then checking sales and inventory reports. Most of the day centered around customer interactions. I learned new ways of doing the same thing, every company is different but all retail operations conduct cycle counts and price audits, I just had to learn the Lowes way of doing business. The management for the most part was good. Very easy to get along with which I think is where some problems were made complicated. However I think the managment always made fair decissions just sometimes slow to get there. My coworkers were a mix of people that actually knew what to do and some that were just going through the motions but were not capable of operating outside the box. Company culture not changing fast enough allowed those individuals to get by. But some were truly good at what they did and could have done any job in the store. Again, you pretty much have that everywhere. Hardest part of the job was breaking bad habbits that had been unchecked in far too long. Employees would try to wear unauthorized clothing (hats that weren't company hats, wrong color shorts things like that). I would tell someone to correct the issuse and it became ""I've been here a long and nobody has ever said anything."" Or I would make schedule and post it and then everyone would go above me for more hrs and sometimes they got them but I wouldn't be informed of changes to schedule and that created shift gaps. Getting out of the rut in that situation was hard and I don't think I really made a dent in those areas but I stuck to"
good,"I love working for Lowes, it's a very friendly environment, i get along with the majority of my coworkers which is very important to me. I love the fast paced work environment because there is always something to do."
good,It was a great place to work. Worked with a lot of good people.
good,Working at Lowe's was nice. The store was normally busy enough during the day to keep you busy and when it wasn't there was plenty that needed to be done. Co workers helped a ton weather they were from you department or from another. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with what customers needed being our lumber department was short handed. The best part about working at Lowe's was the managers understood what was going on. I was flooded in at my house for a week and I called in told my manager and he said ok we will talk when you get back. When I came back to work he wasn't mad didn't write me up just asked how bad it was and if I had lost anything.
good,"I Learned so many things, Learned how to use a lot of tools that I wasn't use to."
good,"fun job kept me fit, only downside was they would promise a promotion but it would never come haha."
good,I started out as a seasonal associate which quickly became a permanent position. On a typical day at work I am interacting with customers every minute of the hour. It may be in the store or over the phone answerings questions or taking purchases. To help a person in need is a great fufillment in my lowes life. I've learned so much about inside garden products which will help me with sales and my personal life. The team that I work with are great people and if anyone is in need a team member will help out in any form or fashion. The hardest part of my job is getting to know all the technical terms for some products. That is going to take time. The most enjoyable part of job in helping those in need and this goes for not only the customers but co-workers as well.
good,Decent pay and you learn an ample amount about home emprovement. Friendly and down to earth staff encourages you to push yourself above and beyond the call of duty.
good,"This was a fun job, i was always very active and in great shape."
good,great place to work
good,My day would start out by making a big commercial pot of coffee for the contractors. then it consited of inneracting with my cusomers selling all of Lowe's services.
good,I come in work to do the task ahead of me and what ever the task do it to my best. I don't go to work to play. I have learned a wealth of information working for Lowe's. They have the best computers and the most updated systems I have ever worked on. Information at a fingertip. I enjoy my co-workers and work well with them. Being around them you are a family. The hardest part of the job is the hours of work. Night and days are not on a set pattern.
good,"I had a great time working for Lowes, I learned a lot about myself as well as about the people I worked with, people from different backgrounds and walks of life. I'm a little sad it had to end, but I'm glad for the opportunity."
good,"a typical day consists of coming to work, clocking in (within 5 minutes) someone is coming to find you to tell you where to go (whether it be to let someone else go home or give them a break or lunch). staying by your self (usually) for 2 hours at most, checking out customers. The things learned while working at Lowe's consist of; learning to deal with your boss(es) whether you like them or not, learn to do what you are told with no questions asked, and learn to have fun with what you have or your work life will be boringgg.."
good,"Days were long but productive, I was given weekly training and developed a schedule for my employees as well. Management was fair. Co-workers were happy. The hardest part of the job was making the department managers understand they had to confirm their departments time or they wouldn't be paid correctly. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I was able to make the company profitable with the job I was doing for them. I also enjoyed working with the public every day."
good,"A day at Lowe's I'd always come in and water the garden center, push carts, and would help a lot of customers with merchandise into their car. Management was all nice and liked having me there when I was for seasonal job. All the co-workers were easy to work with and they were all friendly."
good,Good job. Kept me busy. I met a lot of good people there. This was my first warehousing job.
good,"I love the customer service atmosphere at Lowes. I always connect with everyone, and there's no judgement or negativity. My management team can be a little difficult at times, but I know that they are trying to uphold a certain standard for the store."
good,The store manager wanted me to move thru the chain of cammand and become management material for Lowe's. I had a gentleman take me under his wing at Lowe's and was teaching me many aspects of the department I was working in and I was learnig so much from his guidance. Then he died and the man that took over was on me everday I could not do anything right. Need less to say he got rid of me said he did not want to work around my college schedule. I left there feeling very humiliated and discouraged.
good,"The atmosphere and culture are really good to work in. It is a very large company, so you have to get used to the fact that most of your work is not going to be ""world changing""."
good,"Working at Lowe's I learned how to work with a team as well as working alone. I enjoyed working with customers and helping them with issues and problems that they came across. My station (customer service desk) was always very busy. I had to multitask at all times. Not only assisting customers but co-workers as well. I enjoyed figuring out my own ways of bettering my performance and I also encouraged helpful tips from co-workers and management. I would not consider customer service a hard job. You have to learn your job and be confident while working. A few important factors while working a customer service job is to pay attention at all times, keep a friendly smile, and help the customer the best you can in a timely manner. A typical day as a Customer Service Associate consist of answering phone calls, directing calls,making pages on the loud speakers, assisting customers as well as co-workers, and keeping a clean and neat work station. The only difficult part about customer service is dealing with somewhat difficult customers. Difficult customers are very rare, and outstanding customer service skills helps me to better deal with them in a timely fashion."
good,"I enjoy working for Lowes, I have taken several learning classes to better myself on the sales, how to projects etc"
good,"A professional, work-oriented job. Very sociable from co-workers to management. Not too bad pay with raises fairly often."
good,Oversaw all operations and directed and supervised assistant managers and staff. Learned merchandising and making profitable goals. Must fun is working with a great team and engaging them.
good,"Many different cultures, you will experience. Lowe's is a great company to work for, you just have to find a great location."
good,"I would work an 8 hour shift, either opening or closing. Sell products to customers and help them with their needs. Made sure all items were stocked and my department was clean and presentable."
good,In the years I've worked at Lowe's I've gained a lot of knowledge in home improvement. I have also learned how to operate numerous types of machinery. My customer service skills have expanded throughout my being there.
good,Customers were always so friendly and the co workers. I loved being at customer service.
good,Stocked shelfs before opening in my department. Management was fair.
good,"Start day out by going to the store to check and see if any appointments have been added or changed. Check on any issues that may have come up with orders,installs, or deliverys. If so work with vendors or other internal teams to solve the issues. Then start out on appointments to measure and give proposals on what the customers need intalled and sell it to them. Then return to store turn in payments and process orders. The best part of the day is when you sell a customer a product and they are happy that they are getting what they have wanted or needed. The hardest part is when issues come up that are out of your control, ie: vendor sent wrong size item, then the customer is expiting you to fix it for them ASAP as if it is your fault. But you do the best you can to calm them down and assure them it will be taken care of as fast as you can get it done for them."
good,Lowes and all of its upgrades will be a marketing giant in the very near future. I enjoy the associates at the store and helping them strive for the greatness within them. Helping associates grow and learn make the company profitable and helps me become a better leader each day. I have a willingness to succeed in the industry and working 60 to 70 hours a week is difficult at times. I have grown immensley in the seven years with the company and am fortunate to have a job.
good,"Working at Lowes is a fairly enjoyable experience, the majority of my co-workers are nice people, management can be difficult at times but they try, the hardest part of the job is learning all the plants in the Garden Center, but its a good place to work. Its always nice to get a good day's work in, and thats exactly what Lowes helps you do. The pay isnt so bad either."
good,Lowes is a good place to work. I have been there five years and advanced very fast. I have learned a lot from my time there and would like to expand my horizons.
good,"A typical day at work for me involves: providing outstanding customer service, resolving customer complaints in a professional manner, greeting customers with a smile, and performing customer service tasks. I work on the front end as a return desk associate, customer service associate, and front-end cashier. I learned that every customer will not be completely satisfied. My management team is great and they make sure everything runs steadily and smoothly. My co-workers work as a team and get along with one another. Nothing about the job is difficult to me. What I enjoy most about this job is that we make sure our customers are satisfied."
good,"Customer service driven,"
good,"Although I was one of the top sellers in the district, my figures did not meet the expectations that HQ had put on the store. That is why I am looking for a job. I was near the ceiling of the pay scale too."
good,",good people, atmosphere. good pay . not good job security ."
good,A good company. The new MyLowe's program is outstanding and should increase sales.
good,Had very hard working coworkers. Supervisors were wonderful. Everybody got a long for the most part.
good,Worked for a good boss. Had some issues but overall a good work experience.
good,There were no typical days and that was a great asset. I also learned how to cope with a lot of different stressful customers. How to handle even the most irate.
good,There is opportunity for advancement but the hours can put a strain on a family. I have learned the skill of multi tasking as well as teamwork. the hardest part I would say is being understaff it made your job hard but I enjoy interacting with the customers. Making someone smile made my day. Sometimes a simple smile and how are you doing made people see that they matter. My motto is without them I would not have a job. Customer's always come first.
good,Make you feel as a valued member of a productive group
good,Most enjoyable part of job is interacting with customers. Co workers are very helpful and respectful. Hardest part of the job is standing up for long periods of time.
good,"I loved working for this company. However, after 5 years of employment with them, I felt they didn't have the heart for me as I did for them. I don't usually let the hard times in life get me down but during this time period that I quit I was going through some rough times i.e my dad passed away, separation from spouse. I requested that I step down from my 50 hour work week to a 40 hour work week so I could tend to my 3 kids more. They denied my request and I was heart broken because in the big picture of my life, my kids and family come first. I really wish they would have considered this for me because I might still be an employee with them."
good,Workplace allows a lot of alleys to move up in the company.
good,Top paying retail employee. Fun working environment... Not for those who don't do well in customer service
good,"Upon arriving into work, I met with customers and helped to choose all items from flooring, counter tops, cabinets, faucets, etc. I performs layouts on the computer using the 20/20 CAD system. I then proceeded to cost out the jobs and close the sale."
good,Good retail company to work for. There is plenty to keep youo busy and the customers can make your day.
good,good place to work under the right management team. benefits were good when I was there.
good,Lowe's provides opportunity for promotions to those who express the desire & show the competence to manage people & the business.

Good benefits with 401K & vacation accrual.
good,Good Work environment
good,"Lowe's provided me the best opportunities, just too bad it didn't work out. If you are looking for a company that likes to really offer top notch customer service, this is it."
good,A very fun and rewarding place to work if you don't mind working hard and being on your feet for long hours. After working in State Government jobs for 10 years I am very happy to be with a company like Lowe's. There values and overall mission statement are things you can not duplicate in the government sector.
good,"Lowes Companies is a great place to work and be a part of with great people. It is a very large company so it has a strict structure, but offers great benefits and perks."
good,"Great company to work for. If you're motivated, you can mak management quickly."
good,"Great place worked helping customers with electrical, plumbing problems"
good,Enjoyed very much my employment time with this company. High volume of customer interaction. New names and faces to help find the things they need to complete a project they are doing. Very rewarding when customer comes back to store to say thank you for all your help.
good,"Surprisingly, Lowe's is a good place to work. The pay is decent considering it's retail and the employees at the location I worked in were, for the most part, very friendly and helpful. Lowe's offers fair benefits to all employees: full and part time alike. That's something you hardly come across anymore. It's a shame I gave it up for another job opportunity that didn't work out."
good,My job was to literally run a crew of guys to unload the trucks of merchandise. Sometimes it would inquire using fork lift trucks.
good,A fantastic place to work. Usually the managers are amazing and the older staff are completely willing to assist! The lowe's that I worked at even understood that I was a college student and couldn't work all the time.
good,I really enjoy working at lowes the only problem I were the hours were pretty chaotic. There was no set times. One day you would open at 5:30 and then the next day you would close and be there til 11PM
good,"I felt that Lowe's could have spent more time and money in training their employees in the areas of sales, customer service, product knowledge, and confidence development.  Ultimately, these are things that I had to learn on my own and I did.  I benefitted by doing this."
good,"You learn a lot when working on the sales floor that can help with your future. Also, they are so flexible with your schedule, it’s reassuring that they will always work around you."
good,I have been very thankful for Lowe’s very good pay and benefits . Overall Lowe’s stock has grown and the benefits have been very good for associates. The company has overall a great benefit options
good,"It depends on which shift you have as far as primary responsibilities. Opening associates execute inventory replenishment and walk department for any safety issues. Work any freight with a focus on customer flow. Assist customers with finding product, providing solution to meet their needs - offer installation and delivery services. Time management is a necessary skill, to be able to complete daily tasks while balancing customer service. Maintain a clean and fully stocked department."
good,Awesome opportunity to advance in company for hard workers. The management staff is very friendly and will help with anything you need. All employees at the Twin Falls location were very friendly.
good,The best part about working at Lowe’s was the customer. No customer was the same which helped with advancing people and social skills. Without the people skills the Lowe’s taught me and I would not have advanced in the United States Navy.
good,They are undergoing changes because of the new CEO.  This is always a difficult time.  The store managers are very supportive and willing to listen.  They appreciate hard work.
good,Good company to work for. You are able to move departments and move up if you put in the work. I have worked in several departments. Fair pay. Good people.
good,Lowe's was a very good work environment there was a lot of good teamwork a lot of good upper management and altogether a pleasant place to work in a pleasant experience in general
good,"Management is great, Customers are okay, Company is okay, Kind workers, Hard workers, Very nice stores, organized work place, overall nice company with great people"
good,"Great environment with great people working for a company who genuinely cares about their customers and employees. Great benefits and many extras, including bonuses every quarter."
good,This company is great but it has its ups and downs. it pretty much depends on the manager and or team that you have to work with and the teaching you will get from them.
good,"- Skills are taught before expected"
good,"Great place to work if you love retail. With multiple departments dealing with home improvement, you have an opportunity everyday to learn something new."
good,Very good place to work. Try and get a MST job it allows you to really work as much as you want as well as keep working rather than just standing around
good,"Flexible schedule, work place culture, good position and easy going management, great work environment, very professional, employee satisfaction, great opportunity"
good,Lowes is a great company to work for with a lot of room for growth.  Once you work your way in to management you learn something new everyday.  They give you the tools to overcome those obstacles.
good,"Enjoy the friendly, warm & welcoming atmosphere. "
good,"Customers will be your main priority. If you love working with people and helping them, you will like Lowes. You can move up quickly if you are a hard worker."
good,"The pay for employees needs improvement , alittle better customer service, hours are decent managers need to appear on floor more often. And customer service is slow and terrible."
good,"One benefit of working from Lowes is having that constantly human interaction, and flexibility to help guide our customers from department to department making certain their shopping experience was a success. "
good,Lowe's was a good experience pay was decent.Helpimg the customer with items to forklift experience was good. Never a dull moment performing all work duties was a breeze just have to know how to deal with the public

good,"My time at Lowe's was very positive and was due in part to my supervisors who valued my work. Misccomunication was one of the things which raised tension. There were workers who wouldn't cooperate as a team. In spite of those things, I felt comfortable in my job and happy to work,"
good,"Lowe's was a great company to work for because of the learning environment. A typical day consisted of always taking care of the customers who came, helping the people love where they live."
good,A typical work day is assisting customers with they home needs. Must have strong customer service skills because the customers happiness is what keeps your company afloat.  Its really not a hard part to the job just go to work and do your job plus 10 with a smile
good,"Lowe's Home Improvement is one of the rare companies that gives back to the community. The company is inclusive with a diverse staff. The company needs to provide more training in specific areas, such as plumbing."
good,Lowes provided me with a lot of work experience in customer service and sales. The atmosphere was a nice and friendly work environment.  I was able to Learn more skills to help me in future job opportunities.

good,We need improvements but they are coming along. I love coming to work and being in positive environment. I love customer service and want to provide the best service
good,"The people there are very hard workers and care about the customers. I like working with this team.  Working in the different departments is knowledge, which I enjoy having flexibility where needed.  I can work as a cashier, customer service return, product support, greeter, direction for product, phone answering, paging, helping delivery scheduling, receiving product after hours, and in departments."
good,"I enjoyed working directly with the customer, helping them with gathering needed material for a particular project. I know allot about what is needed for home improvement projects"
good,good place to work.  Good people to work with.  They are encouraging and help with all questions.  This company has a lot of opportunities to grow and move up
good,Most enjoyable was helping people within our stores and within our local communities. Flexibal work schedules and benefits for PT and FT employees such as tuition reimbursement.

good,"I enjoyed working here, everyone was really nice too bad it was only for a temporary position i would of enjoyed staying here.Positive environment and located near my home."
good,Was there for a brief time but was very enjoyable. Worked as a MST under the supervision of Bryan which was a plus because he was a great manager. Cared about staff.
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work. My manager is one of the nicest bosses ever. Majority of the customers are very nice as well. The work is not that hard, and everyone gets along."
good,"Working at Lowe's has allowed me to acquire a variety of skills and has enhanced my knowledge in respect to in home construction and accessories for a plethora or work projects. I have been able to utilize these attributes to assist with family members, friends and individuals outside this environment. As a result, they have furthered their understanding of safety protocols as well how to go about cost efficient methods to complete said projects. "
good,"A very good place to work, people nice learned a lot of things the co workers was nice also the managers was excellent u could go to them with a problem."
good,I enjoy what I do the must. Helping ppl and solving the issues better they bc huge is rewarding. I walk in everyday ready to have fun and enjoy it....
good,"I start my day with the ""mindset"" of being productive.   First, I start with my customers, building that rapport is a priority,  finding out what their needs/wishes are for their home.   Possessing that sales culture along with customer service provides the results that I desire."
good,There is always something to do. You learn mant department to gain knowledge in order to better assist the customers. Forklift experience is recommended since many peoducts need to be brought in daily.
good,"A typical day at work I would clean the paint machine and cleaned my work area and spent the day helping customers by matching paint from a sample they brought in as close as possible. I learned how to mix paint and how to use the paint machine. The management wasn't always present, although they were only seen when there was a customer concern or problem. The workplace culture was diverse and very open to everyone at work. The hardest part of the job was to try to please every customer because some are more easy to please than others and the most enjoyable part of the job was to mix paint and make the customers happy."
good,Helping customers is the priority for sales. Putting away products can be hard at times because the need of a spotter while on the Forklift . I enjoyed working there.
good,Lowe's has taught me a lot of professional skills that I will carry on to my next job experiences and I really enjoyed the company and the experience it offers.
good,"Lowes was a good place to work for many reasons, good pay full time . reasonable benefits, flexable hours, employee discounts, good management. always made sure we had goog delivery trucks to drive."
good,Would not work around fulltime work schedule and children. Management at Hwy 64 location was unorganized and unfair to cashiers. Very rude manager. Would love to go back but to a different location
good,Meet and know different people; good benefit; family oriented; good working environment; fair pay rate; getting promotion base on experiences; product knowledge training
good,well  I like working there oh always  ty oh why well when at to sea I went found a whale  then clam digger  the I I work sun set pub   the iwtcountrykeep going   then I work at bay carw
good,Lowe's was a good first job to experience retail. I got to help many customers with the help of my fellow employees and managers. I helped out where I was needed; like unloading freights and glass cutting. I would even help out with opening and closing of my department. Lowe's spreads out the work to everyone.
good,"I loved working for this company, the general manager always made me feel welcome. They have me plenty of opportunities to grown as well as different positions around the store to expand my experience. I loved the responsibility they placed me with and all of my coworkers"
good,It was not bad. The place was a easy job with good people surrounding me. Customers were always nice to oddly enough. I would recommend to anyone wanting a part time job.
good,"Lowe's local management was terrific, however because it's such a large business any time they adjusted the company's direction it caused people to lose their jobs if the local management couldn't find a position for them. I was fortunate enough to be offered a store management position as opposed to my department manager position but unfortunately others were not so lucky."
good,"Greta place to work. Most of the employees are good people who take time to help others , working as a team is a priority. Most management give support."
good,I would definitely go back if I can. Awesome people I worked with a great work environment. Management treated you with respect and gave you an answer to every question
good,"The store is great, full of great people. The corporation is mainly focused on money and not employees, like most corporations. Retail work in general is best for temporary work during college and other transitional periods of life (or for a second part time job). The career type positions are usually a bit harder to come by as there are less of them and are usually already taken by awesome hard working people. Store 2509 has excellent managers and the culture there is wonderful. The corporation has started shifting its focus to money and making things a bit harder for the employees as individuals (as most corporations do). In summation, Lowe's (and all retail stores) are awesome places to work for transitional parts of life and for part time jobs."
good,"I loved my co-workers, such a great team of people. The benefits where nice but management was a little sloppy. Its retail so you often have to work strange hours. Its a great place to work if you are going to school and have bills to pay but me personally i wouldn't make a career out of it."
good,"I loved going to work , getting to know my customers , engaging with them making them feel comfortable to shop and to keep coming back. Management was nice and very understanding of , especially when it came to family . Working at Lowe's felt like I have known the team members for a long time and I was there only 2 months ."
good,Lowe's was a place I was able to go and start a new job and grow and learn things I wanted to and desired to. After a few days of being there I was permanently hired and it was into a dream position. Only downside was a fellow employee slacking her work onto me while she was just leaving early and I got a lecture for not having hers and my paperwork finished. I only resigned due to medical reasons
good,Address concerns displayed by clients. Offer cashiering administrations. Information section for online requests. Divert calls to suitable offices. Address installments for Lowe's charge cards and help with helping clients with routine solicitations.
good,"Pros"
good,"Typical entry level business. Pay is well below deserved compensation. Even with 15 years experience, it is a entry level pay. Would not reccomend for anyone over the age of 22"
good,I had a great time working at Lowes because I have a lot of experience dealing with people trying to purchase supplies and material to upgrade there house.
good,"Get to meet may new people and walks of life.  Good company to work for mostly if you are a college student, as a second job, or as a retiree.  Yes, I would recommend this company."
good,Busy at times learn from upper management got to move around and learn about different areas of the store. Fair and rewarding to meet different people everyday
good,It is a company I enjoy working for.  Every day is face-paced and never the same.  Management team is very approachable. Store works as a team.  Job requires reaching sales quotas.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the great team effort put in by my fellow employees. We enjoy working together and never fail to step in to help each other when needed.
good,Plan route and execute  deliveries of appliance and other various products to customers homes . Meet and greet the customer at there home and install there new appliances.
good,Lowe's has went through many changes over the last few years. I felt that when I first started working there it had more of a family feel to it. Now I feel it's more a military style. Maybe not all store are like this but it has been at my location.
good,pretty laid back place to work. Sometimes disorganized but mostly really chilled. The hours are flexible as well especially at the front end part of the store.
good,"Was a great place to work, enjoyed my time. The reason I`m no longer there is they closed my location. They gave the working knowledge to allow me to work in this type of environment."
good,"I worked there 7 years, first 5 years I learned a lot, lowes has a lot of rules to cashier, you r not always told in advance about new policies, changes, Head Cashier are all different , with different ways to do work, some prejudice, was trained in every dept. , everyone has to work outside at different times .,unless you get dr. Note, worked nites was better, attitudes of customers better.."
good,"Typical day at Lowes is a very busy one for me in my position . Daily deadlines to be met , stressful , demanding ,fast paced , and all while providing customer service.Management is being streamlined by Corporate , and the best part of my day , is when I go home to my family."
good,Was a fast paced job and I worked with a lot of great people.  They were good to work with schedules.  I just didn’t like the fact that most shifts were 4 to 5 hour shifts and varied.  Sometimes you had to be there early morning and sometimes you worked close.  Worked well with my my construction background at the time.
good,"Lowe's challenged me to go above an beyond ,developing a love for costumer service,I work in lumber ,I operated power equipment, walkie stacker, forklift,an i also got a chance to meet a lot of great people."
good,The job was not too difficult and was enjoyable at times. The only hard parts were having to lift really heavy building construction objects from time to time. Other than that the work environment was relaxed and the employees were mostly friendly and polite.
good,"I applied in person at a job fair. It went well, got the job right on the spot and then they told me the start date would be about 1 month from that day. It was a good job"
good,"Fast paced work area , with strong team members working towards the same goal to unload truck on time before store closes, wrapping and pushing freight to floor"
good,you get to meet and interact with hundreds of people throughout the month becoming engaged with their personal projects creating a store regular that brings monthly sales.
good,i dont want to write a review. There is no way to skip this section and that is stupid. I am trying to find a job. Not talk about other companies. If I liked it I'd still be there.
good,"I loved my job for years. People were great, management wasn't overbearing, processes were in place that protected workers, pay wasn't bad (for retail, that is). I enjoy managing my department and helping customers. BUT waiting to see what happens as new corporate management continues to dismantle the old Lowe's culture, eliminate jobs, remotely handle issues, etc."
good,Lowes is a good starting place to work in retail or any logistics style of work. Get to meet people from all different backgrounds from contractors to local business owners getting supplies.
good,It was a fun job granted the employees were slightly rude but it was fun. I got to see nice houses and meet nice people We delivered washers dryers refrigerators.
good,"I was hired and tasked with assembly of floor displays and customer purchased  items such as Grills, patio furniture, children's playsets, and more..."
good,This used to be a priority it no longer is employes have lost H.R. support. Bonus dollars and days off they also removed managers and proper staff to lower cost all these changes have ruined work life balance and moral for all employees horrible lowes Shame on you.
good,"Co-workers are great and I enjoy helping customers, so it is a good fit. Issaquah location is not as busy as other locations and doesn't have the amount of staff, so you do need to help other departments as well."
good,A typical day at Lowe's involves helping customers of many different backgrounds while excelling in great customer service. Lowe's has great benefits.
good,Its a great place to work at i love working here part time i love the staff and managment there kind and understanding as all as you are up front with them!
good,I love it.its very fast paced yet we work together as a team. Management is pretty good and laid back .the attendance policy is not that great.i do look forward to advance in the company.
good,At Lowe's to very exciting place to provide customer service friendly environment good pay good benefits great people to work with overall my experience there was fun great
good,This was an enjoyable place to work. Made lots of friends and enjoyed being there. Only left because I moved. Started as one job but able to learn other jobs.
good,"This job was very team-oriented, with every person working together to get the same job done. I enjoyed this job because of the people I worked with, and the fact that they were also working as hard as I was."
good,I really enjoyed working at lowes and meeting new people and making new friends. The hours were a bit much. I applied for part-time but worked full-time hours. I really enjoyed it for the most part. The hours were just too much with also being a full-time student. Plus they never give you a day off. You have to request it. If you don't they don't ever give you off. So I felt a bit overworked and burnt out after a while. Overall not a bad job though.
good,"I been workin part time here for over two years, it’s been good overall. All though as a part time employee your hours aren’t very consistent so they pay isn’t very stable"
good,It was a great place to work. The management was great and they created a schedule around my school schedule. We were very short staffed in the seasonal department and it was extremely stressful being there by myself at times. Sometimes other employees were there to help.
good,"Productive and busy place to work. Typical day on the job is stocking helping businesses and people with building projects, remodeling projects,  or the purchase of new appliances. A good part about this job is being a part of helping a business or people creating something new that fit their needs."
good,Great place to work.  Overnight management was pretty good and supportive.  Was trained up on all power equipment and constantly had online training available to do.  Having anywhere from 900-2000 piece trucks with 7 people not including managers could be pretty stressful at times.

good,"-Much opportunity to learn new skills, tools, and become involved in cross functional projects"
good,The work place and people were amazing and so much fun to work with. The customers were great and were always really nice. Every now and then you have the couple of rude customers but management always had our backs. Great place to be.
good,Lowes is a good place for a young person to start working during college. You get out in the world and learn something about other people and a lot about yourself.

good,"While working in the seasonal department, watering the many annuals and perennials, I worked independently, and alone from 5:00am-7:00am (Until the department and store opened to the public).  This time was especially peaceful."
good,"Register software antiquated (DOS based instead of Windows). Not enough worker staff. Actually, not a bad place to work and fairly liberal about requesting time off."
good,Hardest part of the job was running a department as a sales floor associate because there was a lack of coverage. The best part of the job was making the customer's day and experience better.
good,"This was a very fun and fast paced job I would recommend it to anyone who wants to work at this place, the managment is very kind and understanding in all aspects of life."
good,"The current position has a great schedule. Monday- Friday, 6-3. Lowe's offers good benefits but wages aren't enough to live off of. Friendly customers will add to your daily work experience but you will not always receive that at any retail store."

good,"I really enjoyed working at Lowe's. It was very much a ""chill"" job for someone like me who was about to start college. I think if you are used to construction type men as customers and are okay with cheesy jokes every so often, it's a great place to work."

good,"A typical day consisted of screening, Training new employees. Learned how to interview, train, stock, talk in a very professional way. Very clean environment. The hardest part was firing people. Meetings were the best part of the job, so you could know the task for today."
good,"workers are good,management the  best some workers of course not agree with others but thats just minor problem and common in a big company I agree with the management team its just that sometimes senior workers acts  more than supposed to be  but thats common in a big company I just hope the management team will be able to see that in the futute..."

good,"Working at Lowe's on almost any day tends to be fast-paced due to the consumer traffic, but it is overall a nice place to work. The environment is very friendly, people are open to talk, and its a joy to work there. The management team can be a little lacking from time to time, but overall they get there parts done. The hardest part of the job for me is the short-staff issues we have from time to time and having to cover for so many people and departments around the store, but it was manageable and not a stress for me. The most enjoyable part of the job in my opinion is getting to meet so many different customers and getting share experiences and stories with building bonds that last indefinitely. What I learned most from Lowe's was building strong interpersonal communication skills and especially adaptability by covering different positions throughout the store and training new hires. Overall, if you want a place that can almost feel like home with good benefits, Lowe's would a be a great fit for anyone."
good,It was great I learned so much in every category in each department from gardening to flooring to anything it prepared me well to give great customer service and how to handle situation that were alittle difficult

good,"It's great to start at the bottom and work your way up. Lowe's offers a lot of opportunities to grow, make money, be involved with organizations that helps others"

good,"Everyone wants to help each other out and care for each other. Management is alright, other associates are very sociable and kind and usually offer to help."
good,"Downstocking products, helping customers with their purchases. Problem solving customers issues. Lowes is a fast paced environment. You definitely need to be a multi-tasker. Customer relationships were a big factor to working here."
good,"Wasn't a bad job, but I wasn't really putting in a full effort since I was just working a summer job as a high schooler. The management was mostly nice and my coworkers were welcoming and respectful."
good,Lowe's is an overall great place to work. It does get tough at certain times of the year. But everyone is different and has a different opinion and approach. I enjoy the customers and the people who work there.

good,Overall great benefits. Highly recommend apply to Lowe's. Great management. Well maintained work environment. Fast paced. Treated fairly in work area.
good,"Good place to work. Hard time getting full time positions. Always cutting hours. Start you out at a little over minimum wage. Good benefits, paid holidays. Very fast paced, always busy so time goes fast. I liked that I stayed busy, it made the day go by quicker. Helping the customers was my favorite part of the job. Hardest part of the job was the physical work."
good,"I worked as a cashier and it never got too busy. most of my work consisted of basic cashiering, recommending products, and showing the customer where they could find what they were looking for. Most of the employees are just part-time 40-50-year-old parents and grandparents looking for something to waste their time so it was a lot of fun listening to their stories and how they grew up. The hardest part about my job was organizing the snack sections in between the registers which weren't hard at all."
good,I was given the opportunity to to work different departments which made me very knowledgeable about home improvement projects and meet to s of different people looking  to home improvement
good,Good place to work. Very close knit of employees. Did have high stress when cooperate was in town or when we we short staffed which unfortunately was often.
good,My boss sub-contracted through Lowe's. I never interacted with Lowe's. They seemed like a good company however they never had the correct amount of material at a job site.
good,"A really nice work environment, where co-workers and supervisors all work together to get the job done.  Flexibility on the length of lunch breaks was a big plus.  Understaffing caused some friction with customers, and the thousands of lay-offs (including me) they just had will not help matters any."
good,Your experience will vary based on what season you apply in. Spring is the hardest hitting season for the Garden Center and you will be worked none stop. Refreshments are supplied along with other safety precautions from the heat. Otherwise the days go by at a steady pace of assisting customers around the departments and down stocking.

good,A typical day at work can either be slow-paced or extremely busy.As  cashier i work the register and help customers. I also help clear the parking lot of stray shopping carts and put them where they belong. The managers are easy to get along with and will assist you with any problems.
good,"typical work day is outside lawn garden , Its a large box hardware store.I like working with the public being helpful in the needs they have from lumber to housewares."
good,I enjoyed each and every day that I worked at Lowe's. Each day was an experience to learn and grow in the Management position that I was hired into! There was never real down time because there was so many people to manage in so many departments that there was very few hours being wasted at all!
good,"I worked in a high volume Lowe's location so I was able to meet a wide variety of people--from your everyday customer working on their home to contractors placing bulk orders. It was a fast-paced environment which allowed me to stay stimulated and excited about my workday. The people I worked with were friendly, and I really enjoyed getting to check out all the new products coming on the market."
good,"Laid off, good atmosphere, good team work, flexible, nice people, on job learning, dress code, free work shirts, paid millage between store, one hour lunch"

good,"this job is fast paced and easy to learn, great teamwork and good place to work with flexible hours for those who like the night shift. Good communication with team."
good,Enjoy working here. This is my first retail job so I don't like the hours. The hours are long when it's slow. Standing all day is really hard as well.
good,Overall Lowe's is an excellent place to work at with great benefits...associates are very friendly and tend to the need of customers...great place for advancing opportunities...associates help one another in Departments...my experience working there was very challenging and motivating in my personal being...

good,"Lowe's is a fun place to work, but management over the year has changed since HR is no longer involved in store! Maybe changes will improve, but for now, its on a low slope"
good,Everyone works together to help out customers. Throughout the day it’s very eased environment and the managers are really nice and work with you when you need them
good,I enjoyed my part time job with Lowes.  Unload associate is a physically demanding job. My mangers and co workers made it worth showing up daily. I would recommend this company as a good employer.
good,"Most Lowe’s stores in Ca. no longer staff in-house delivery departments. They’ve all gone third party. Lowe’s (Corporate and Store management) didn’t know how to handle deliveries. Scheduled for 8 hrs plus a 1 hour lunch, most days your lucky if you had enough time to even put fuel in the truck, let alone STOP for a lunch break. Even then you’d be lucky to clock out after 10-12 hours. Store policies were almost always circumvented by management, on what seemed like a “whim”."
good,My time in Lowes was not that long but the time i spent there was very pleasant. Managers usually had the task of the day and came back when the task was done.
good,I loved how fast the process was to getting hired. Super kind and supportive managers. They make it clear that we can advance with the company. Overall they empower you to be a really great employee.
good,The job environment was good and most of the managers were communicative. The position was very clear and simple. I recommend this position to any future applicants.
good,The company is a great company. Wish it offered more hours and more money but over all a great company.  Give you the opportunity to learn a lot about home improvement
good,I wake up to go to work usually around 10 I get to work I go put my vest on go out to my department which is the garden center and I load people that cant load their car themselves
good,"Warehouse environment but excellent place to work"
good,"On weeks where the days we had freight where spaced out (Mon, Wed, Fri), we usually had big trucks and the pace was quick. Leftover freight usually is worked on the no-truck days.  On weeks where truck days were bunched together, it was slower and more relaxed pace.  On no-truck days, we usually got off early."
good,Lowe's is a family oriented employer that cares about there employee's. I would recommend this employer to anyone looking for a fast pass environment with the opportunity for advancement
good,"Well trained, with assistance on the knowledge of products being sold. Learned to work as a team, to help and be helped. Workplace was clean and orderly and enjoyed all the time I spent there."
good,"I have always enjoyed my time spent at Lowe's. The work environment is great, as I was surrounded by excellent coworkers. Management teams are always on top of things and willing to listen to and aid employees in all avenues of work life."
good,"Loved working with new customers everyday and solving there problems,,very satisfying.from finding the customer to being flagged down,to sitting with them to specially order the product for there needs."
good,"Decent job. Decent pay. Decent people. Can be an alright career if interested in retail management. You won’t be miserable all the time and there’s a lot of team spirit events going on, potlucks and etc."
good,"Communicate clearly and honestly, and how to anticipate what the customer needs to know. If there is a surcharge, or a product warning, or another rack with a better selection in different aisles, don’t neglect to mention it simply because the customer didn’t know to ask. Knowledgeable on Lowe's products is  one of the most underrated customer service skills, and unfortunately, the one most lacking in the majority of retail positions and i try to master that. Willingness to listen or to help won’t do much good if you can’t actually answer the customer's question or help solve their problem."
good,Lowe's  is a good company to work for. Specifically if you  are  looking  to  advance or going to school. Employees are friendly. Overall is a good place to work.
good,Job was fun to work at. Love the customers...but must know your online info to work. No drama needed but happened. People were nice working there but management not so soundly.

good,I really liked work at Lowe's. lot of friendly people to work with and a lot of different things to do. really liked the depts. manager. the only reason I left was I was getting the hours I needed. they had changed to a new way to making the Schedule. I would be on the schedule one day and going to work and I would be on the schedule. I would drive from Greenville to Madisonville and not get to work.
good,"management was great, lots of moving up in the company, work culture is great, hours are good for school , coworkers are like family , learn a lot in a day"
good,I really liked working at Lowe's. The best part for me was zoning my aisles. I enjoyed helping customers when I really knew what they were looking for because I had organized it before. I was able to get familiar with the produced.

good,"The Pay is decent. The work is ok. Hours are fine. Sometimes, departments dont have enough coverage, so find someone to cover down that's currently there sucks at times."
good,"Lowe's has been a good place to work but there have been a lot of changes this year which have made a negative impact on the customers. In an effort to save money, staffing has decreased which brings difficulty meeting the customers needs."
good,"A lot of customer assisting."
good,"I like working for lowes but its time for a change. It is a fast paced job and you can work in many different positions, but it can be competitive to get those positions."
good,"Lowes was a great place to work for, definitely a fast paced environment. Company itself always took care of the employees and made sure everyone was happy."
good,Results matter and service to others matter.  High paced and challenging work environment with complex situations that require tough decision making.  Employee engagement is crucial to success and need to find the right people to develop and promote from within.
good,Lowes was a great company to work for. I would still work there but they don’t offer associate transfers anymore. So after 10+years I have to quit due to relocation states.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at lowe's. It was my first ever job. The part of my job that I enjoyed the most was working with customers, helping them find the items that they needed. Management was friendly and understanding. The hardest part of the job was finding the items the customers wanted, but not being familiar with them. I still somehow found a way to get them what they needed."
good,"Lowe's is a progressive, competitive, fair, clean, organized, well-managed, good people, great products, good sales deals. A place to learn and grow. Good work opportunities across multiple departments."
good,"Not to make a living when a cashier"
good,The customers are good and my coworkers were amazing. The training was simple and the managers were very helpful. I enjoyed my time with the company. If I could have stayed on I would have.
good,I had really great time working with all different types of people from all ages I really learn a lot from the older guys they really took their time to talk to me and explain everything that I had needed to know
good,"I looked forward to going to work everyday. The staff in warehouse were all friendly and helpful. If you needed help or customer had concern, they always answered and were supportive."
good,I enjoyed being able to move around positions in the store. Most of my managers where great except for one but other than that I enjoyed working for lowes.

good,Lowe's is a fantastic place to work and offers many benefits. It has a pioneering culture and provides a quality work/life balance. The most enjoyable part of my job is the employees. They care and are purpose driven.
good,"working with contractors, how to work a fork lift, working with no staff was the hardest, shift change every day working the nights is hard. meeting new people everyday"
good,"An interesting place to work, where you can learn many new skills and help people love where they live. There are many opportunities for advancement and management will help you achieve your goals."
good,"I enjoyed my short time there , the work is harder then I thought it would be, everyday I went to work I left tired working in the lumber sections , the customers were butt head contractors and workers."
good,"Friendly, family oriented work environment. Great coworkers in all departments. Loved the management team they are all wonderful. Felt safe there. Would definitely recommend."
good,"Lowe’s generally gets busy on weekends, especially for the cashiers. Most customers are very friendly and are always seeking help in my experience. Aside from cashier, you’re always finding something to work on, like stocking merchandise, answering calls, and helping out customers with sales in your department. Teamwork makes every transaction run smoothly."
good,Lowes is amazing to work for with competitive pay. over time work hours. and a friendly environment. I would definitely go back to lowes. When I worked there it was family oriented.
good,"Lowe's is much better the so called best in home improvement !!!"
good,The day are long if Business is slow as a cashier if there are no customers and really short otherwise it can be difficult if you are use to move all the time and your feet can hurt after standing all day
good,"The hours are really flexible, but the stress that comes with it is too high. If you really want to get some work experience and get a ""easy"" job lowe's is a good place to start but you have to really learn how to not depend on those above you or you'll be left waiting for what to do or any news whats so ever definitely not a place you should work with your all or else you'll end up stressing you're self out for a job that doesn't really care if you are a hard worker or not."
good,Lowe’s is a wonderful place to be even though the leadership is a little iffy. People sometimes seem lost and have nothing to do. Managers seem to contradict each other sometimes but doesn’t really matter as your work day is your own.
good,I'm passionate about sales and determined to exceed company targets and client's business goals. I am retaining client's for the long term by diligently helping them achieve success.
good,"I enjoyed assisting others, with the knowledge I obtained while working for Lowes. I enjoyed assisting the customer and seeing the excitement when delivered and installed their products within their home."
good,"Good place to work if you want to move around and learn new things and communicate with difficult customers, coworkers are great, but it is turning into home depot"
good,not sure now but at the time fun place to work day goes by fast always something to do good friendly environment its the retail business some days better than others
good,After working for Tractor Supply for two years I was unsatisfied when moving to Lowe's. As a cashier you are not hands on with customers and you cannot leave the register.
good,Good company Good benefits. I have worked at Lowes for 30 years have enjoyed the experience. I have been at Merchandise Service manager for the past 2 years
good,"Lowes is a great place to work, except for the pay, I work as an overnight associate and I think we are underpaid for the type of work we do as well as the hours we work ( it is very hard on your body to work overnight ). Other than that it is a great place to work ( in the Oceanside, CA Lowes )."
good,Working there has been a daily adventure with opportunity to constantly help someone. The associates work hard and play hard.  Company sponsored events are always fun. The most enjoyable part of the job has been working with such a diverse workplace.  The most difficult has been balancing the demands placed on management vs. home life.
good,the pay is very competitive with in the industry. the benifites are good. the job can be stressful at times but there is always someone there to help if you need it
good,Lowes is a fine place to work at. Everything there is organized and easy to follow. Most of the time that I was there I found it easy to wrok with everyone there.
good,"hard stock-taking in inventory replacing items that were not on the shelves I learn how to work a scanner that checks in - the merchandise when it comes in I manage my time and not work to fast "
good,"excellent place to work. Plenty of room for advancement. Fair annual reviews. Very customer service oriented, Promoted employee and customer safety above all."
good,"Everyone was part of the larger team, all working together to accomplish the monthly quotas. The tasks may seem mundane, but it builds good work experience and customer service. Focus on learning more about your role and the store itself. Knowledge is the key to upward mobility. Know about the products carried in store and be able to discern which products are best for a customer's needs. Management is good. They bought the outdoor lawn and garden section a mist tent during the summer months, and expect you to at the very least make it look like you're working during the slow times. Granted there is usually always stuff to do, inventory to be restocked, and bags of mulch to be re-bagged."
good,Very friendly environment. Great team of people in all of the departments. Flexible scheduled when notifying management and understanding. Great relationship with customers and a lot of different and great personalities.
good,It was nice being able to work for a large chain store like Lowe's because there is many of them around the country and when I had to move they were able to get me a job in the next location right away at the Lowe's nearest where you're going to live.
good,"The basic job of a sales associate is to identify a customer's needs and suggest products that fill those needs.  This job is a good way to learn about the surrounding community.  Stocking shelves, inventory, and housekeeping are some of the other duties.  Management is very considerate of outside-of-work needs of the employees."
good,"Flex team specialist so my job was never boring. Worked with customers and learned how to use all the equipment such as saws, blind cutters, mixing paint.  And learned the process of installations for plumbing, appliances, blinds. Fun co-workers and pleasant managers."
good,Working at Lowe’s has been a great stepping stone in my career. They worked with me while i was attending college and were flexible with my school hours. The management and other employees were very positive and helpful from the beginning. It has been a great experience!
good,"I love our store, the management is great and very helpful. Our store manager is great! Fun place to work. At times the job can be stressful but management is always willing to take time to talk to you and work with you."
good,"Great place to work and  insurance was vert good in 2011"

good,Good place to work. Training is good  People are good to work with  Mgmt is understanding and willing to work with you.  Flexible on special needs.  Bonus for budget
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's even with it's ups and downs. The work culture is quite challenging which gave me a reason to go in every day. I did absolutely love it there, The one strong area that they could improve on is training. For the first 15 months in my position I was restricted from most of the day to day functions based on my title and then in February of this year, they changed my title, added more to my job requirements and offered no training which was quite overwhelming."
good,I even learnt cashing perfectly and plumbing somewhat. I learnt how to print loading ticket and a lot i even had a good experience with all the customers and staff
good,"If you're ok with going to work and just socializing and getting paid then this is the place for you. There's a few people who do hard work and the rest are good at hiding and collecting a pay check. Granted it is retail, so there is a lot of necessary customer service, but the associates run off so they don't have to deal with customers. The customers also think that since you work there then you are a professional in every department. If these people were proficient in plumbing or electrical then they wouldn't be working at Lowe's making minimum wage, but I digress."
good,I would help customers find their product and answer their questions. help load customers orders into their cars. collect carts from the parking lot. Assist other employees with their needs.
good,it was ok work place but it was hard to work get to work and having two kids and a husband that works to is hard get a ride and find a ride and a babysitter but one of the managers and on of the co works didn't get that they compared me to there lives.
good,"I have never had a time at Lowes where we didn't get to stressed out with work or customers. All of us at the company enjoyed testing our skills, working with the customers on our powered equipment."
good,I loved the day to day of working at Lowes. Fron dealing with the employees to helping customers with whatever it was they were looking for. Lowes really believes in cross training everyone
good,Working at Lowes is great but I wasn't given many hours after I started. After being there for two months they stopped scheduling me due to adding a different truck schedule.
good,"At Lowe's I was a cashier, and a Head Cashier.  As Head Cashier I was overseeing the cashiers and assuring they had their tills with proper cash and materials, and they received their breaks and lunches as appropriate. I would help schedule the hours for cashiers based on requests off and availability.  I also was  to answer any questions and deal with customer issues during the day.  The hardest part of the job was doing the scheduling and keeping some cashiers on track.  The most enjoyable was the people."
good,The work is awesome just the management needs improving. They monthly incentives. Great benefits. They work well with school schedules. They have tuition reimbursement available.
good,"Fun fast paced seasonal work, very physical and demanding but overtime is good and pay is decent for the hours given, usually pretty busy to keep you occupied"
good,Coming out of high school was looking for an entry-level job with flexible hours and that's what I got. Great Co-workers and management can't complain and been there 2.5 years planning to leave soon.
good,"Work mornings, afternoons, or evenings and help customers find the best solutions for their home improvement needs. I learned team work and problem solving regarding product placement and where the best place to sell it needs to be. The most enjoyable part of the job is being a help to others and making an impact in others lives. THe hardest part is with the lifting which requires to lift 75lbs or more but it makes for a great work out."
good,I had recently moved to the area and was looking for a job in my field but was unable to find one at the time.  I worked at Lowes till I found a job in my field
good,Good positive vibe good people to work with everybody hard worker management was great the customers and employees were excellent for everyday basis good startup job
good,this was my first job due to other requirements and it was excellent.  I was able to learn many skills to further my work experience and to use in everyday life
good,it was a good paying job but also a lot of politics. as a company they are constantly changing things that do not seem to be broken. advancement is available
good,the employees made this job a lot more fun than it should have been. The location was great easy to get to and from work with public transit. Along with the management sometimes threw surprise parties and chili cook offs.
good,A customer service representative. Everyone is to be treated with smiles on your face. Also with all the curtisy you have in you. There are chances to move up in this field.
good,I learned more in depth about customer service and working with multiple employees. Also the flexibility with work hours was a nice addition. Every employee was enjoyable to work with and were willing to help when asked.
good,The entire team was fantastic however the downside for me was one manager. She micromanaged me event though there were people below her to do it. Even her boss liked my work but she didnt. Other than that the job is very straight forward
good,"Working on loading and unloading was very simple for me but stressful at the fact that we didn't receive much percentage as it was a team work job, so the chances on getting hired was harder. I learned fast paced work and managing my time."
good,"What is a good place to be training to grow in different areas of the industry, it has a diversity of departments that will allow you to increase your career potential."
good,"I was put into the best department to help out with a pretty simple job, I liked the people I worked with very well. Sometimes customers will be hard to deal with but thats the same with every customer service jobs, and honestly that was only a hand full of people over the course of 8 Months."
good,"Overall good for college kids or someone trying to get a steady job. The work gets a bit stressful in the spring but is otherwise steady. The computers need an upgrade with software but still work for the most part. Overall, I would work there again."
good,"It was a good job to have, it was very fast paced, focused on customer service, safety, and happiness and satisfaction of the customer on a regular basis."
good,Lowes offered great benefits that really appealed to me and my family. I believe the hourly wages were not as high as other places though. I got to travel and help set up new stores so that was one of the best parts of the job. They have a great 401k plan too.
good,"Lowe's was a difficult company to work for butthe bonus at the time made it okay.  I achieved full bonus at two different stores.   The failure of one store manager we how lied on me who I"
good,"Lowes provides all employees with the opportunity to grow with the company. Good benefits and flexible hours to work. Schedules permits employees time for school,"
good,The company today is not the same company I began to work for 22 years ago. There are many changes the company is undergoing that go away from its original philosophy that I don't agree with therefore I am seeking new opportunities elsewhere
good,Got to learn about plumbing and was able to do home improvements at home based of the knowledge I gained working at Lowe's as a part time employee. Lots of knowledge can be gained for home improvement.
good,"Working at lowes there was always something to do. You are either running a register, helping someone in any department, or helping load customers products."
good,"Easiest job. Fun place and people to work with. Can win items when they have meetings. I worked there pregnant and after my pregnancy, they we're so helpful, understanding and nice. Flexible with no rush after having my child."
good,"Overall Lowes is a good place to work. As with any job, management varies on a store to store basis and does not reflect the overall company. There are good standards in place as a company basis. Training is provided. Only issue is that the systems seem a bit outdated."
good,if you are wanting to attend college or of the age of 18 they are willing to work with you on your hours.  you get sick hours so if you need to call off you will still get paid if you have the hours.
good,"It's a great job to start when you graduate and learning how to communicate with others. Their training is wonderful, but the head cashier was so rude (some) but I really like working in lowes and it's great teamwork with others."
good,good place to work good work/ life balance. they do alot for their employees. They take safety very seriously and provide monthly extras for their employees to show their appreciation
good,"A typical day at work started at 4 am and ended at 1 pm. My job was the support manager for the back-end, which included the freight team, receiving, and the delivery department. As a member of management, I personally supervised up to and over 35 team members. I think that the hardest part of my job was dealing with those 35 different personalities and their problems and concerns, everything else was second nature to me working in the retail environment for 10+ years. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers with their wants and needs."
good,"They hired and fired me after two and a half years, but I will always be appreciative of Lowe's and especially my coworkers.  We definitely worked as a family."
good,LOWES is a good place to work your inside not out in the weather most of the Time people are friendly co worker are friendly you become a family if you need with something just ask and you will get it but LOWES has a no overtime policy except for maybe the delivery drivers
good,Management went down after a few people got hired on. It made work unbareable. But other than that working for lowes is good. I would recommended it..
good,"I operated cherry picker, sit down and reach forklift operations on floor with customers and spotters and blockers. I passed tests given both written and with approved coach. No accidents followed safety guidelines,"
good,A typical work day started at 5:00 am. The work included moving product on a forklift and cleaning my section of the store (Building Materials and Lumber). The biggest things I was able to learn from this job was knowledge on many building materials like wood and concrete and how they correlate with each other in a building design. My coworkers were very skilled and made it a great environment for work and learning.
good,Good place to work at. people are friendly and you get to meet new people everyday. Job is pretty basic and straight to the point. Would recommend working here to anybody
good,"I have worked at Lowe's twice. The second time I already had another job and was hired on being told I would be able to work this job the opposite shift times of my original full time job. Well after being hired on i was told they only had hours for first shift. I have a full time first shift job, so obviously it just didn't work out. Lowe's is a very good part time job, but the pay is not enough. The pay isn't 'minumum wage low', but in my opinion it still could be better. If you're already part time it's not like you can live off of that pay alone as an adult with adult bills. The hours of your schedule are like a normal retail environment and all over the place which only works if you have Lowe's as your primary job. If you have set hours you won't get that many hours also, so it's best to have open availability. This was my second job after high school. I think this is a great job to have for someone who's younger or in college. It's for someone who doesn't have many bills & Lowe's can secure you with a nice future. It's all about where you would like to go. The first time I worked there I loved it. If you show initiative you will grow and can grow within. Overall I've had a good experience with Lowe's my first time around, but I'm not sure if I would go back. I've gotten into the pharmaceutical industry lately and I would rather get experience there then to do customer service again. If I had to go back to customer service I would pick Lowe's. Why I haven't went back lately is because they don't offer many full time positions & I'm not wanting to be a cashier anymore. "
good,"I worked there for 18 years.  I would have retired from there but my position was downsized.  My frustration would be that I gave them 18 years of service, worked many different shifts, and my position was downsized while others younger than me kept their position."
good,"The job was awesome and I loved it, but the pay was just a little too low."
good,Learned to coordinate home improvement projects and serve customer satisfaction.  Constant communication with management/production team and customer to make the project go smoothly
good,"lowes was a okay company  to work with, I was there for 3 years and I didn't have any problems with the company except of lack of job positions filled in order to help the team, and the hourly pay was unacceptable"
good,I really enjoyed working at Lowe's. Hour management was great. Everyone treated equally as they did there job and was noticed for there performance. Was a friendly but professional experience.
good,"The work environment at Lowe's was really relaxed, it was nice to be in a open work environment, they even gave me the chance to be a delivery assistance for the appliances which i enjoyed very much, and my supervisors were really kind, and understanding."
good,Part time but great people to work with. Would recommend working here to anyone. Love the work atmosphere. Great pay and benefits . Just needed more hours per week
good,"This was my first official job and i loved it , great management, costumers were awesome here and i love the co workers i had working at this company."
good,Lowe’s is a great company with awesome workers. At Lowe’s I felt at home with them they not only are very understanding with your life arrangements there even willing to move you departments if they feel it better fits your needs.
good,Working at Lowe's is a great place to start! They pay pretty good if you want to start out as a cashier. They work well with your schedule and the work isn't too hard. When you first start they pair you with a mentor. That way you can learn from someone who's already been there and I think that's a great thing because other places don't do that.
good,this is a good company to work for but can be stressful with the wrong managers.  Worked here for 8 years and it taught me a lot about sales and management
good,"A typical day at work involves customer service and responding to staff requests."
good,"A typical work day would include cleaning up the store, bringing carts in from the parking lot and helping people load large items in their car"
good,"Lowes employees quickly become Lowes family. There was always something new to learn or teach. My favorite part of working at Lowes was being able to help DIY customers with product knowledge and inspiration, especially when they brought in before and after pictures to share, or came back and told you how much fun they had completing the project and that your advice gave them confidence in their ability to successfully bring their ideas to life."
good,Change in management approx every 2 yearlove the employees.Work hard and enjoy customers a lot of contractors come in everyday.Familiar faces are nice to see
good,So you know I never thought of that but it wasn't me lol I know it was good I was gonna be here and I was gonna go back and see you lol Haha I know it
good,"Never a dull moment while working, Always on the go from each department. Each employee helped all departments from top stock to cleaning. Definitely was a team oriented workplace."
good,"Good place to work because management worked well with associates. the hardest part of the job was sometimes stressful when sales are down, Employees all felt like a family,"
good,"You are trustworthy and reliable. You find joy in the details and believe good quality is what keeps guests coming back. You remain cool, calm and collected under pressure. You understand there is no “I” in team and thrive in diverse situations. You are self-paced and get the job done, no matter how big or small the task. You get that service isn’t a transaction. It’s about connection."
good,"Lowe's pays their employees very well, and treats their employees with respect while also holding every associate accountable. The workplace culture is friendly and inviting."
good,"Not until new CEO's take over is it that major changes are made that affect the livelihood of employees."
good,"customer focused and employee team attitude company"
good,"Excellent employee relationships, friendly people, great selection, great location, employee incentives, well maintained store, helpful employees pet friendly comfortable atmosphere"
good,I enjoyed working at Lowes Foods.  This was my first real job and I learned alot.  I learned how to work on a cash register which was new to me.  I also learned how to work in a team environment.
good,"Typical day includes lots of walking, stocking product, working with customers, answering their questions. I learned how much I can impact a customers day simply by being pleasant & willing to be interested in them & how their day is going. Management is generally very helpful, although they often times don't have adequate time to all they are required to do. Hardest part is being on concrete the whole time i am there."
good,There was a lot to remember.  Job could change daily.  was standing 90% of the time sometimes got hard to do. Perks of discounts was a huge benefit of working there.
good,"Managed a team of 7 to 10 cashiers. Ensured staff was trained, shifts were fully staffed, and registers were operational. Resolved employee issues including safety incidents, motivated and evaluated their performance."
good,"Typical work day would include preparing orders for customer to come pick up. Finding all of the items on the order and wrapping it up on a skid to be loaded up into a customers vehicle. Spending a lot of time driving forklifts or order pickers and grabbing things, also answering customer questions about products"
good,"Assisted customers selecting product, installation, ordering, and design.  Suggesting addition products for remodel.  Inventory and freight down stocking, top stocking, and loading."
good,Customer service desk is the most stressful position at lowes. You have to answer the phones and take the customers in line waiting to return their items plus several other things.
good,"The company was a good company, I liked their store and their products, also liked the availability to advance , the top manager of the district was always there to lift moral which i feel is important. Rewarding job, but the pay was not good and there was a lot of duties assigned to the head cashier and once again not enough pay,"
good,"I worked there for two years and most of the time my job felt rewarding , unfortunately I had to leave but it was not due to the company , I would recommend this job."
good,"Lowe's was a great place to work, coworkers were really cool but the manager was not. Didn't work with me on hours as I was a full time student and couldn't work 35 hours anymore."
good,"Retail is retail.  "
good,"worked out side.."
good,I would arrive at 5am and pull the deliveries for that day and then deliver them. At the end of the day I would pull the next days deliveries. The management was easy to work for. As long as I got the job done they were happy
good,The ever changing matrix of retail. Lowes is in the middle of growing pains and is making many changes. My hours have changed as well as my off days. Not all managers care about the receiving and delivery teams.
good,Lowe's was a great company to work for because they were always trying to help me do whatever it took for me to move up within the company. Lowe's felt like a family environment.
good,I needed to drop down to part time hours to take college classes and they wouldn't let me.  I was not able to balance my college classes with a full time night job.
good,"I learned how to drive a forklift a reach, board cutter,my enjoyable part is driving the forklift or reach there was not really a hard part, i also learned how to do sales order stuff for customers ect."
good,"I started by loading and strapping down the loads for the day."
good,I work here part time as a sales associate it’s a nice job to have but business is very slow I was happy to help anytime someone came in. Very clean store decent benefits
good,"It is a ok place to work for.  A lot of things that you have to remember when using the cash register.  But, overall it is a good place to work for.  Learned a lot."
good,Employee focused company. Great benefits. Corporate Headquarters is a great environment. Many opportunities to grow within and outside your area of expertise.
good,Lowes is a great place to work for hard working people who want to learn and provide excellent customer service. They provide healthcare and paid vacations.
good,"If you are going to school or looking for part time work then Lowe's would be the place to work.  Lots of flexibility with schedules, and decent wages for part time work."
good,"Support from management, team work freedom to work independently meeting new people making costumers feel welcome meeting their needs always greeting them learning something new everyday from customers and employees giving your 100% everyday make the company proud"
good,Management team is great but scheduled hours vary and provide challenges with the work life balance. There is a great deal of advancement opportunity for those who want to improve with extensive training for each role.
good,"My particular job gave me good treatment but the pay was meh, I would recommend this to long term lookers or high school kids, otherwise not worth being there"
good,"interesting place to work met nice people whom I worked with"
good,Overall a good place to work.  There is a lot of change going on which should be for the better.  Fast paced/high stress environment. Good opportunity for advancement.
good,The job was hard during the summer months paying attention during the unloading of the truck using the pallet jack to move stuff around on the floor or the showroom
good,It has good and bad. Need to be approachable from customers. Make time to learn as much as you can. Take in all the benefits that company offers. Help your fellow coworkers
good,Great place to work if you like retail. Compensated well but benefits are just ok. Lots of positions being changed. Hard to promote when they don’t know what they are looking for yet
good,"Only worked there part time when I was off from the Sheriff's Office.  Had a good delivery team at store # 1776 in York SC.  We got along good, was very productive in getting customers there purchased items."
good,This company has great employees who strive to make every customer experience exceptional.  Challenging fast paced work environment where Associates are a family.
good,"I came to work, did what i supposed to do, was treated well. Lowe's made sure I knew about the products I was selling and that I knew how to assist customers in multiple departments."
good,"Conpany is no a bad  place to work, workers most of them are good workers, benefits are good, hours are good ,customers must of then where good ,  culture work is good in general"
good,Management isn't the greatest. It's still a fun place to work and lots of areas to learn and further advice your career. Benefits are amazing. Tuition reimbursement was a huge plus!
good,"Assisting customers to meet their needs, answering multiple phone calls, ordering and picking products for online orders, stocking shelves with products,"
good,Completely miss working for this company. I had a supportive management staff and coworkers I loved working with. I had a steady job that kept me busy every day and I went home feeling like I had accomplished something.
good,i wasa loader at lowes it was a easy job all i had to do was get carts and load the car of people who was buying alot of stuff its a relaxed job i would tell any one looking for a job lowes is the place to go
good,"Group of great people to work with, great environment most days, always willing to help each other most days, nasty customers most days, no opportunity to move up to full time"

good,Lowe's Home Improvement is a great place to work it stays busy and consistent during holiday seasons can be a little overwhelming more staff would help
good,"good management and co workers , opportunity to grow is nice and co workers always come forward to assist you in case of need and management listens to you if you have any issues"
good,"Lowe's is driven to service the customer.  All actions revolve around the customer, and it drives the daily tasks.  The atmosphere is constantly changing, so it doesn't get dull easily."
good,Fast paced and when not busy in one department you can help in other departments.  Very diverse environment.  There are always promotions to make sure your customer is getting the best deal!
good,Assist customers in finding the right items for their projects. Used fork lift to stock product daily. Would cut would for customers so it can fit In their vehicle. Hardest part was the lack of team work of employees. Most enjoyable part of working their was meeting different people and working with my my hands.
good,"Good environment, good people working there and good company.  Safety is very important.  Communication between shifts could be better.  Good benefits."
good,"Lowe's is home improvement. It's focus, is meeting the needs of the customer. Whether, you're Pro customer, a DIY customer or first customer the task is the same to build strong loyal relationship within our community. The buildings are clean, well maintain and a friendly environment. Lowe's believes in a strong safety culture. Associates are encouraged to be involved in their growth and development. Lowe's is a great place to work."
good,very slowpaced very loving and compassionate ppl that worked their along side me.nothing to hard to do if u needed help they would help you no questions asked.
good,over worked under staff poor managemnet there are more worried about profit than helping customers no consisted hour for part time employees i worked for them almost 5 years
good,As long as you are willing to show up to work and help deliver great customer service to every customer you can do great things in this company. You can start from the bottom and really work your way up if you are open and willing to learn.
good,It was a great place to work with plenty of friendly people. I learned a lot about the job from the supervisors and fellow employees. The hardest part of the job was not having enough time to finish every task
good,my workday started with safety walks and counting outs. through out my work day  i was responsible for assisting customers with both instore and online orders
good,Lowe’s was a very great job. Management and co workers were very friendly and understanding of situations. I worked a seasonal position for Lowe’s and felt like apart of their family
good,"I enjoy working at Lowes due to challenging and quick-paced work environment.  Learning and becoming effective takes time but once you put the time into it, you'l take off."

good,This was a good place to work and if you work really hard your ability to climb up in the company is quite easy your room for advancement is open to whatever you are looking for
good,Great place to work if you like fast pace and customer service. Everyday is different must be willing to be on your feet most of the day running around checking on workers and customers. Never a boring day and no time for desk work.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Lowe's for the most part. There was sometimes  I had issues. I Clocked in then, I would get on/ take over a register for a coworker. After about two hours I would go do carriages. Then, usually 3 or 4 hours into the shift I would go on lunch. The management was  great, all super friendly great people."
good,worked at Lowes for about 1 year.  they promoted me to hardware team leader.  Taught me to use heavy equipment.  Fun place to work with little stress.
good,My typical day was of showing up pulling carts in and being friendly to customers. on busy days other nonloaders employees would come into work and help out other employees and on slower days the management let people go home earlier if they so wished
good,It nice place to work at and it's nice place move up in management. You learn have used good customer  services .Interact with vendor and business owners
good,Depending on what position you go for and season determines how many hours you will get there are a few with set hours which to me are the best. They do provide lots of benefits and discounts to their employees. You will have a few mangers that sometimes will want different thing from time to time.
good,I learned how to challenge myself and always smile and greet others while working at Lowe's. A typical day at work was somewhat busy. There's no down time. Even when you have no customers you should be stocking the front end.
good,"If you have good coworkers you will enjoy the place, management is no always the best, but the customers is terrible. They don't raise you salary, and don't have a lot of opportunities"
good,"Great Job"
good,You always had job Whether or not thr day was busy or slow. Management was friendly understanding and outgoing. Communication was key if you needed off or has to leave early all you had to was tell them
good,"Fun and good people to work with, and there almost always seemed to be something to do which made the days go by quickly. Then there were some days that did not go as well, for example, some management decisions did not make sense and were questionable."
good,Fast placed work place that focuses on getting the job done effectively and safely all while furthering your learning opportunities and getting you task certified as quickly as possible
good,Lowe's home center is a pretty decent job  . Me personally I think it was a great experience for me  . I wasn't planning on leaving Lowe's but i moved to a different state and they said it was not any opening sadly.   Very good job for your first real  job experience . They also pay pretty decent but for a job that will wore you down they could start off a little higher. Other than that it's a decent job for a starting off person.
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's, for the short time I was there. The management were supportive and my co-workers were helpful. I like being able to help customers find what they needed, or give helpful input if asked."
good,Lowes is a great place to work. It's competitive yet a very friendly environment. My position is time sensitive. Productivity is key in my role. Time management is important.
good,"Became a good manager learned how to lead by example how to teach others be a team player time management , inventory sales planing and much more developed people skills leadership"
good,"typical day at work was making sure your area was clean and counting your til (where money is) to make sure the correct amount was in there, i learned to make money orders, order what was needed on the floor, relaxed atmosphere, the management was easy to understand and would help if needed."
good,"I enjoy working at Lowes. I have been employed there for 15 years. A typical day at Lowes can be very competitive, but it is challenging which I love."
good,The job will keep you busy while you're there in a good way. The environment is stress free and watering plants was a great way to spend the day. Bring sunscreen though.
good,"great place to work. great managers. great coworkers. "
good,Great environment to work in and very understanding management. There was no hassle if I absolutely could not make it in and they were supportive of my decision to leave.
good,"Beautiful company to work for "
good,"Responsible for assisting customers with all of their shopping needs including assisting customers in the selection, demonstration, preparation and loading of merchandise. Also responsible for responding to customer inquiries throughout their shopping experience including promoting customer loyalty plans and/or extended protection/replacement plans where appropriate"
good,"Overall I had a prettt good experinace, my job was very laid back and we still had time to be people and not always be working constantly. I would recommend it to anyone who might like the fast pace but still relaxed vibe of working."
good,"like any other work place you have some up and down moments.The main thing is your way to approach the situation ,your way to handle it.We,at time,have fun some other time you have to face some difficult situation in which you must try to complete the task with calm and positive attitude in order to get it done.Over all I always tried to make it fun for me because I have a job to do and no matter what is the moment I must make it fun to avoid mistakes and complete the tasks that were assigned to me."
good,Lots of positive opportunity and development.  Managers are awesome.  The staff at Lowes supports teamwork and vision.  Everyone contributes their input to facilitate positive interaction between customers and their living experiences.
good,"I had a great relationship with everyone loved working in lawn and garden, loved to help customers.Got along great with higher ups, worked great with my customers."
good,Responsible to constantly be on your feet but managers are very easy to get ahold of especially for help. Room to move to different departments and more than often able to ask for additional hours or certain days off.
good,I enjoyed  opening the department and interacting with customers and fellow employees. I liked the garden dept. because I was able to spend considerable time outdoors. Workplace culture was great. Sometimes it was a challenge working in winter (occasional freezing) and summer (a few days over 100 degrees). I thought there were a few too many managers to answer to and the managers had a habit of cutting employees hours drastically(without notice)  when sales were down. That was the reason I left (my last week I was cut to 12 hours).
good,"Good job, little recognition for giving up family time to further departments - worked for 17 years at company, giving up numerous family hours with no support from local or regional hr"
good,"Had a great experience at Lowes , did a great job stocking and cleaning the store, got the carts in there right place, i was your go to man. I left the job because my son came into this world."
good,Great community involvement. Encouraged team environment with all levels of staff.  Lots interaction with customers.  Always challenging.  Strong recognition programs for employees.
good,"It was fast paced, and i didnt mind it. Its always busy so it helps your day goes by fast, it always something to do or work on in there. Mangement and coworkers were pretty laidback and cool to work with."
good,"It is a fast paced home improvement store. I got chance to improve my communication skills while working in multicultural environment."
good,Lowe's upper managements is failing by not focusing the PSE outside sales program. If they would seperate this from the retail store it would be succe
good,Great fast paced environment with growth opportunities available. level of work is dependent on ability and stress level is dependent on how well you manage your time. Customer service is expected to be maintained at its highest even if that means staying late. Most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and the hardest part of the job is also the customers.
good,"Lowes was the most vision oriented place I have worked, Its employees all worked for a common purpose - that of customer satisfaction.The organization is fully focused on their mission"
good,My time at Lowe's is reflected upon with a smile. There were many opportunities for my advancement and I was sure to take advantage of any and all. I would recommend anyone looking for fair retail work to apply.
good,Overall had a great environment to work at. Had great coworkers and great managers. Made going to work enjoyable and bearable. Overall wish I could still work there.
good,"I worked here 22 years ago when I was 18, not sure what would still be relevant today. Grat if you like retail and stocking shelves and helping customers."
good,Retail can be stressful but I work with a great of people. This makes my time at Lowe's enjoyable even when it is hectic. I also love the feeling I get when I have helped a customer find what they need.
good,"Management was awesome, all employees were a joy to be around. However career advancement unless you are a cashier and can move up to head cashier or higher or can become a department manager, is very difficult to do"
good,"Worked for the company for more than 6 years it was an awesome place to work , love it ."
good,lowes was a productive fulfilling experience and I was more than happy to help any customer and put a smile on their face. I never had a problem with any co worker and enjoyed everyone's company
good,Good place to work with and easy to get with other friendly team member. Co-workers are willing to to help and provide information and  Lowes are very understanding when it comes to time off and family needs.
good,Fun place to work and learn a lot of different things like different rtpea of Machines like order picker and forklift and then when you finish stocking up your merchandise you will downstock
good,"Would clock-in, Head to the back room to wait for trucks to pull up to the dock to unload/ load. Would also occasionally help customers load their purchases onto their personal vehicles. After unloading appliances off the trucks we would arrange them in the backroom. unloading the trucks also involved stocking backroom supplies and any huge appliances on the warehouse shelves. If there was no responsibilities in the back would help out the floor with stocking and helping out customers."
good,"it was a great company to work for, let me say the one in Flint Michigan was not a great one for mang was rude and the other they told us t treat customer's like they were gonna steal. in Chesapeake VA was a great one to work for everyone work great together they were a team and we all would work together and could still have fun and great the best customers."
good,I enjoyed working with the people and getting along with the customers. There I was able to learn and develop my people skills and be able to help people.
good,"This is a nice place to work, but the management needs work. I think this is a good job for people who are beginning the work force and need guidance in what a real job is like."
good,Everyone you worked with was always with a smile on their face including most customers. You really learn a lot about customers and coworkers when working with one another.
good,Wasn't micromanaged and was allowed to do my job and go home. Full time student at the time so I didn't mind it at all... But if you needed something you'd never know who to ask cause there is so little management
good,it was an okay job managers were nice when they wanted to be other than that it was fast paced. i was in high school and didnt work alot. Only reason i left was becasue of colllge
good,You can work here if youd like to for a retail job. was not a very fast paced job on most days. closer to holidays was the only time it got busy so expect long luls.
good,"I needed employment until I found a job more in line with my skill set and Lowe's fulfilled that role well. After two and a half years with the company, I moved on but I do have fond memories working there."
good,My typical day at Lowe's was putting up stock unloading trucks an helping customers.I leaned people relation on the fore how to please the customers. Management was fair sometimes hard to find. Workers were very friendly an would go to different departments to help out. the most enjoyable part of my job was the customers. The hardest part of the job was pulling lumber.
good,"Lowes was a good place to work for, many different opportunities to grow from. I enjoyed working there. Like any place it has it's pros and cons, but overall it was a good place."
good,"Lowes can be a great place to work, I do believe that there are some departments that are more enjoyable to work in than others. Overall my experience there was pretty good."
good,Lowe’s is a great company to work at. It is welcoming and overall and great place to work. The workers are friendly and managers are great. The hours are just inconsistent for a part timer.
good,"It is a great place to work friendly people and great wages."
good,I learned many things at Lowe's including excellent customer service management.  Learned how to work with rude and unruly customers in a pleasant manner.
good,"Lowe's is a great place t work if you are looking for career advancement in a retail environment, competitive pay, and good benefits. "
good,"Excellent environment to work if you can handle the negativity of some customers. It requires patience, understanding, and great customer service skills. Great benefits as well as discounts and special events that go on throughout the year. Employees also get ten percent off on all purchases and additional in-store discounts. The atmosphere is laid back but requires hard work and fast pace at certain times of the day."
good,"They were pretty good to work for. I was hired as a seasonal employee from December to June. In most aspects, Lowe's is pretty good. Not great, but I can't think of any qualms I had about working there. I generally liked my time there."
good,"I def did have fun hear. Caught a lot shoplifters, learned the ins and outs of being a loss prevention agent. Worked with one of the best LPS which helped me craft my game I the LP field."
good,Working at lowes gave me great chances of growth for my career.  It opened up all avenues of cross training opportunities and advancements.  Allowed me to train on multiple levels as well as traveled to other locations for a better understanding of the Lowes Big Picture.
good,Hard work at a fast pace. Very hot and humid and dusty. I would recommend night shift especially in the summer. get trained on all equipment so you don't have to load pallets
good,"I have nothing much to speak badly on Lowes behalf aside from hours being reduced during winter and that only applying to my department in the most sense. Decent workplace, good team members/co-workers. Benefits were definitely a pro."
good,I was with Lowes for almost 5 years.  I held different job titles over those years.  I finally left because at the time my supervisor was a micro manager.
good,I like working for the company i would suggest lowes as a good place to work and stepped out of my comfort zone with working at a home improvement store
good,"I am personally not a retail kind of girl. However, I enjoyed this place. Very friendly, professional and ordered place to work. It was always clear of what was expected."
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's. If it weren't for wanting to finish my degree, I may still be there. Overall it is, or at least was, a good company to work for."
good,I started out watering plants which i really enjoyed.  then once the cold weather rolled around they moved me to paint with out even giving me a heads up.  They dont really train you.  I was always expected to know how to do my job which always sucked.
good,"good place to work, advancement is available to anyone who is willing to  pursue and push themselves, friendly environment, casual dress, clean work spaces."
good,"Lowes was a low pressure position.  The nicest aspect of the job is that you can assist customers with recommendations regarding DYI projects.  The job is ""hands on"" and gives the opportunity for a CSR to be proactive with helping customers. The hardest part of the job was the physical effort.  Shifts are 9 hours and does require some lifting of heavy products (flooring department).  Work place culture is relaxed."
good,"Lowes has many different areas for the employee to work in.  You can do everything from unloading trucks, stocking products, to cutting plywood, to delivery"
good,was certified in fork lift  worked in garden department  also worked in plumbing department  had to leave this part time job because I was working too many hours a week
good,I enjoy working for Lowe's. I work different hours each shift that are range from 5 to 8 hours a shift. These shift allow me to spend time with my family and continue my education.

good,Assembled merchandise needed for customers and displays. good working culture. great team to work with. time went buy very quickly. would have stayed but relocated back to hometown.
good,"I enjoyed the experience working with Lowes, however just seekeing more involvement within logistics. The interaction with customers on a retail level does not interest me."
good,"I was a really good place to work. I enjoyed the atmosphere at the company, and the work was great. Once you got the hang of your job it was easy to set into your role and become a great employee."
good,"Not a bad place to start a career if you like working as an unloader/stocker. Ive made a lot of great friends working here, management is always helpful when necessary."
good,"It was a decent and friendly place to work at. Location was also close to where I lived before I had to move. I enjoyed working in the indoor/outdoor garden areas as I learned a lot about gardening, tree/lawn care, and especially how to repair or build a swamp cooler."
good,Paid good. learned new things everyday met nice people. I was able to pick up hours when they were available. Co-workers willing to help when you needed help.
good,"My typical day started off with me signing in and starting my shift. I would usually check my emails to see if there are any tasks that need to be attended to, but most of my work consisted of helping customers, keeping my department clean and doing what any Assistant store manager needed. I learned a lot about the products in my department, which can always be useful to share to friends and family."
good,"Being a good employee goes a long way with a company! If you are in need of time off or need to transfer from state to state, because of a family emergency. They will do everything in their power to make sure you are taken care of. "
good,"enjoyed working in the environment, I did stocking supplies and chemicals, stocking and pricing of supplies. Carry product for customers to there vehicles"

Offered really good insurances options. Majority of management were always helpful and willing to train you in many different areas of the store ."
good,"great benefits . great employes . flexible scheduling. quick advancement "
good,"It has its pros and cons, pros definitely outweighing the cons, but there a lot to learn that you could take with you into your next job/career. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for stable work/pay with a willingness to learn and the desire to work hard."
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work. But, of course in the workplace and in life, you have to deal with everyone accordingly. Everybody is not your friend, and that's fine. Always do your best, and you will go a long way. Integrity is everything."
good,"I have worked for Lowes for a long time.  I was disappointed to see them go another direction with their Human Resources Department, but I will always remember how they supplied me with a good position during a very rough time in our economy."
good,"Loved my job. Just needs to give more hours after working a few months.  Learned a lot from other employees.  Great help.  Management works with employees in any situation.  The most enjoyment came from working with employees and customers."
good,Lowe's was my favorite place to work. I loved all my co-workers and the management team as well. I loved working outside with the flowers and lawn and garden merchandise. Overall a great place to work at.
good,In 2001 I was a Manager at Home Depot in Bakersfield California. The Regional Manager for Lowes on the West Coast was walking my store on Gosford Ave he was walking with his people and I had been with Home  Depot for 13 years and had walked my competitors stores with other managers so I went up and introduced myself to their District Manager and offered to answer any questions they had.2 weeks later I got a call from the Lowes District Manager to see if I was interested in opening the first Lowes on the west coast. After  some negotiating and a better salary and  a  50% bonus if my store hit my numbers I jumped ship
good,A lot of physical work was required in the lumber department. Had good team bonding skills to help locate things. Management was always near-by. Could always count on one-another to help with loading or unloading.
good,Lowes is a good place to work but getting a full time job there is very hard to get full time employment. But I loved the people and the time spent there. Def a great part time job.
good,I enjoy the people that work at Lowe's. Management and hourly people get along well. I like working overtime and the overall job. I've learned a lot here.
good,nice place to work lax as far as retail goes  good manager support a lot happens around the store lots of different position for employment and a very diverse requirements
good,"I've always been a fan of Lowes and always will be. If you like a challenge, like to advance easily, and want a good paying career then I highly recommend joining the Lowes family."
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's distribution for the most part.  The pay was fair, but there were other distribution centers in the area with better pay.  Certain job tasks could be hard (physically) or very tedious, but as a whole it was not too bad."
good,"I enjoyed working with Lowes during the time I was there. Great culture and futuristic company in embracing new technologies. Very diverse workforce when I was there. Over 800 in I.T. with lots of consultants from India, Brazil, Argentina, Rumania, etc. Probably the best organization I ever worked for. Well I've worked for several organizations I really enjoyed being a part of the team over my career. I probably would still have been working for Lowes, except they were moving their corporate I.T. offices to Mooresville, NC. And I did not want to make the move or do the long commute. Gave me incentive to jump back into a NC state job where I could retire with state benefits."
good,"We helped all cutomers to find the product to help them with there projects around the house. Put of freight on a daily basis, built displays to help display the product in the store. Make deliveries. Went to go help open up new stories, It was a good place to work"
good,Would recommend to friends or family! Family friendly fast paced energetic . Enjoyed the expiernce  of taining and motivating new and current asssociates
good,"It was a fast pace work environment. Can be a bit stressful but they were good at giving me the hours I wanted and listened to my concerns. They had job advancement but, it was pretty competitive to get."
good,When it came down to it Lowe's was a good job to work at i would keep my work space clean help cstomers when ever another employee needed help I'd do my best and help them out part of being a team player. Above all else a basic cashier job.
good,It's a great place to work good people great management I cannot say anything bad about them only thing I can say is the pay the pay is not where need to be but all in all it's a great place to work if you want to know about Home Improvement our doors allows the place to work at
good,"Coworkers at Lowe's honestly became very good friends to me. The working environment is great and although dealing with angry customers isn't the best, doing it together with others helped ease the stress and pain. Management was great. I got to know many of the managers on a personal level. Lowe's taught me many things, but one of the main things that stick out is working together and learning to have fun in it even when it's hard to do so."
good,This was a good temp. job. Picked it up for a seasonal employment while working through family health conditions. Management was very understanding and worked with me during my time there. The work was not physically challenging and my co-workers were a good crew that worked well together.
good,"Lowes is a great company to work for, they have paid vacation for full time workers room for advancement and a great atmosphere to work in. The harder you work the farther you will go"
good,Schedules & work load vary. Great opportunity to advance. Always something to do.  Customers add variation as well. Willing to work with part time & full time associates on schedules while still catering to the needs of the business.
good,"Unloading trucks at a fast pace. The faster you went the better your check would be on Friday. Overall it a okay job to work at. The hardest part about the job was, very hot in the building."
good,Good company to work for.  Train the employees well and give ample opportunity for employees to cross train if the employees will take it upon themselves to do so.
good,"There's never a day that's like the other. Always something new around every corner. Lowes offers benefits, PTO, and quarterly bonuses... seasonal overtime is option."
good,The position I worked was Assistant Store Manager. This was the most stressful position in the company.  I was given training but there was very little continued support for the management staff beyond that.
good,"Your always learning singing new. With new customers comes new changes, no one costumer is the same. You are constantly being cross trained. There are new career opportunities pooping up all the time. The benifets are wonderful. The longer you work for the company the better they get."
good,Ive learned to manage 3rd party contractors.  Scheduling of product and orders. Review with customer the overview of an install. start dates and warranties.
good,"Have to be knowledgable about the products and their uses.  You will be asked many, many questions."
good,Lowe's is a very laid back job. All you do is help customers with their needs and keep your department clean. Other then that is a very chill environment.
good,"Sometimes hectic, sometimes more calm; requires people skills, stamina, a good work ethic and attention to detail. Personal experience in the related areas of expertise are a plus and one is able to help others solve problems."
good,"working there isn't terrible. They do tell you from the start that you can't get fired for performance, but you actually can. The second you get done with training, they immediately start hounding you about performance and basically put you on a list of people that need supervision to get their performance up, and it stays on your employee record for a year."
good,Lowes was a great place to work. I would work there again. the people there were great. just needed something fulltime and needed a higher pay to handle my bills.
good,Great place to work when you’re with the right people and the right people are placed in management. Great pay and benefits. Little room for advancement if you aren’t the right person.
good,"Great leadership/ Customer Service/ Self Motivated/ Inventory control"
good,"A typical day at work was always enjoyable and challenging."
good,"Everyday at Lowe's is a day focused on customer service. On any given day I will be answering the phones, taking payment for credit cards, ringing up purchases, or helping customers with returns. On the weekends I am in the cash office getting the tills ready for the head cashier. I enjoy the clerical duties of the cash office position the most. I have learned that when customers are unhappy, not to take it personally if it something beyond my control. At my Lowe's store, we are highly supported by the management team. There is always opportunity for advancement and personal growth."
good,"It is a very productive place and environment, nice people and great energy from everyone who works there, I would recommend a job at lowes to friends and family"
good,"Providing detailed product information to both customers and peers "
good,"The management team will really make or break your time working here. My favourite manager just quit and it's made it worse. If your store is staffed properly, you'll have a much better time as well."
good,Very fast paced with management who are in tune to employees needs.  Friendly coworkers who with go out of their way to help you if you need it.  Can be a very physically demanding job.
good,I see as a worker your time will only tell how you work and enjoy being employed at Lowe’s. I liked my ltl stocker the work was set for the whole week. You learn the store and get to communicate with different departments.
good,i had a good experience at lowes and would recommend it to someone who enjoys that sort of work. good work environment and nice people and customers are usually very nice as well. home improvement related products
good,I don't mind the work and the Managers are usually willing to work with your schedule but there is no regularity to the schedule. This makes it difficult to plan every day life tasks and family friend adventures.
good,"On a typical day of work I helped customers with their ideas, designs, and provided great customer service. There always seemed to be some sort of event or activity going on to boot morale."
good,"if you are like me, knows what to do and gets the job done right the firsst time, but are not afraid to discuss or go a few rounds(verbally, not physically) with your managers. dont expect to get very far. they will just make you do all their work plus your own. However, if you are a butt kisser then you will have a better time working here."
good,The staff is great and everyone helped each other get the work done. Some days are stressful than others but you’ll definitely enjoy your time working there.
good,Lowe’s is a very good place to start working if you need something to start with. It will teach you a lot about team work and how helping others will paid off.
good,Great company is moving in n the right dirction ti be a market leader. Great opportunities to advance and develope with the company. Has their employees at the forefront of each decision.
good,"Lowe's is a good company to work for, good benefits, fair pay, and good management.  My only complaint are the hours, because there is no set schedule, so the work life balance is questionable."
good,"I reaaly enjoyed working there in the rear area of the store as an assembly technichian. I tend to be a behind the scenes kind of man. When I was first hired it was temporary seasonal as an assembler, then I got picked up and hired as a permanent part time sales associate on the floor.  I enjoyed the work itself, but really had trouble when it came to dealing with the general public. I felt uncomfortable, worrying about being able to help without saying the wrong thing.  I suppose I really could use some conflict management skills."
good,the team working is great like the other employees you become close friends with most of them. The head cashiers are all great and fun to talk and get to know. The managers are up and down some of the managers are a little uptight and mean but the others ones are nice and generous and really caring.
good,Was a good place to work and would work there again if I had to. Customer service can be really stressful other than that it was a good job and came with fair wage increases.
good,it was a nice work area. they were about the team it was not fast paced. you did work on your own time and what you got done was always noticed. im happy to have had the opportunity
good,"Just wasn't for me, the people there were great and would help you out when you needed it. I enjoyed my time there, however short it was, would have loved to learn the machinery but like I said, job wasn't for me."
good,Productive fun... Outside work loading lumber cutting wood.. tape measure loading bricks sand soil mulutch flowers.... I also work with power tools and outside power equipment
good,It was a good clean workplace and it was a table to work in and it was a good job. The managers were very well and it was nice that way. I had to leave because I had to relocate.
good,Enjoyable/productive work place with high standers of work but the Benefits are great and you also get pay bonuses for holidays and other stuff and did i mention
good,good workplace. it was hard work but the pay was good. management and i had dis agreements but they were infrequent. fellow co workers were nice. overall great place to workm
good,Great place to work very busy when hired on the seasonal period. Non seasonal very slow paste laid back job. Learn a lot about different products and sales.
good,"Lowes was the second job that I got, and I find myself thanking my lucky stars near daily when I compare the two. For starters, you will never have a shift working any later than 10 pm assuming you are departmental and/or a cashier (customer service associate or proservices). They informed me of the benefits package immediately. My coworkers have become my family, and because so many people do spend many years at lowes there will always be that sense of security because you know who you are dealing with and that they likely know their stuff. The pay isn't bad for an entry level job. $11 an hour definitely beats our minimum wage of $7.25! The CEO emails us regularly and asks for comments and questions, and our managers in-store have us take surveys and rate their performance regularly. Lowes really does care about it's employees so I can't really complain. Most of my grief comes from uninformed customers, or those looking to haggle a price no matter how small, but I guess you'll find that working in any retail environment."
good,lower offers a great opportunity for part time workers whether it be for summer jobs to help with college or to maintain a certain amount of hours due to disability. it also has very friendly staff and its very supportive of veterans and also helps volunteer for their city or local neighborhoods.
good,I haven’t been there over a year. I don’t have anything to say at this time. I’m irritated that I can’t get out of this without typing something in this box.
good,"shaow up, get things ready to unload the truck make sure the gas tank on the truck is good, and than start the un load the thing on the truck and take the plates out to be worked"
good,The benefits are best reason to work here. It is more stressful than I would have liked. Coworkers are not always uplifting and often complain about management.
good,"Good place to work, friendly environment, always changing, fairly cooperative environment, gets cold in winter, hot in the summer, management is alright"
good,This job can be fun. You need to maintain a positive attitude among a lot of negativity. It is difficult to move up but not impossible. Most employees in higher position are long time employees and are here to stay. I want to be one of them.
good,"Fortune five hundred company with strong commitment to customers and employees, good communication and chances for advancements, really good benefits and good work environment."
good,"I love everyone I work with, and hardly, if ever have a problem with anyone on this team. It can be fast some days and slow paced others. There's always something to do, and as long as you show you want something, you can advance."
good,"very exciting place to work, With self paced advancement. the sky is the limit when woking for this company. So much potential  for career advancement."
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work. The environment was great, employees are nice and friendly. supervisors are cool. Had some rude customers but that's anywhere"
good,"I love Lowe's and the company and wish that I could have stayed longer. As soon as my family situation smoothes out, I will be re-applying.  I loved the working environment and the managers who cleary care about their associates."
good,"managed deliveries"
good,I enjoy a job that you actually work. Its nice that days just go by because I've just been working all day. Its nice to just have a single objective for the whole day. The job I do specifically is also good excersize.
good,I’ve learned a lot of different skills while working here. Things I never knew before. The team I work with is great and it is a fun place to work! Highly recommend working here to anyone!
good,"Great company, lots of support for employees, good benefits. Aways putting on events and celebrations. Good starting pay and always getting yearly raises."
good,From what I remember it was a good place to work for. Management made promises then never kept then so I went to college instead. If given a chance I might go back.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Lowe's.  They offer benefits to all permanent employees, part-time or full-time.  It was a relaxed work environment, decent pay and decent benefits."
good,"It’s like a big family when you work there, the best customer service around. Biggest thing at Lowe’s is to make sure customers are satisfied with the service we give."
good,"Worked with two leaders who were confident enough to allow the me autonomy needed to perform at the highest level.  They were there for support but not to disrupt the performance of the business with the one size fits all mentality. Great benefits, growth opportunities, development and training opportunities. Really enjoyed the work environment and would do it again."
good,"A day will consist of stocking shelves and helping customers. As well as driving power equipment such as a forklift, orderoicker and an aisle forlift."
good,"the hardest part of the job was being out  in the heat or standing the entire shift."
good,The customers hit you with hard questions. as long as you know or can find help with what they need the job is pretty simple. heavy lifting is evolved and you will always bee on your toes about IRP's but tell me a job that doesn't challenge you
good,"Typically the environment at Lowe's was very productive. Getting along with coworkers was easy and cooperating with them and management in order to solve issues adequately, was more than enjoyable."
good,Ever changing to meet changing customer demands. Like most places you will get more out of it if you put more effort into it. They try to be associate focused.
good,Being an Greeter at Lowe’s Home Improvement it was a excellent position. The company was fair gave you 10% discount off all your items the people in there was respectful and helpful and kind.
good,"A fast pace fun place to work. Great Customers. Always something to do. Offers pot luck, holiday meals brought in for those who were working on those days."
good,"The Midland Tx lowes is the highest volume store in the company. Certain challenges came with that along with being understaffed. A typical day as a manager consisted of trying to satisfy customer issues while also merchandising and trying to recover the store from the previous day. I learned a lot about retail management, developing people skills, and receiving product. The workplace environment has gone downhill in the last year, with the under staffing and the motivation/morale of employees and an all time low, it was very difficult to make the store look as good as it had in the past few years."
good,"If i struggle to find a job as I finish college, I fully intend to come back here until I do. Iv'e worked a few other jobs and this is by far the best. I loved moving up and being in customer service, I really enjoyed the time and customers. I fit in with the job and enjoyed my coworkers. It was a great seasonal job throughout college and my senior year of highschool."
good,"friendly people working together to help customers, warm during the summer and they have water if you get too hot. had a good 401 K program and also good insurance."
good,"Very nice co workers, flexible hours, good starting pay for retail.  They are very fair here and the work is pretty good and not too hard for most people."
good,This job was a competitive career of advancement based on learned skills and becoming a great asset to Lowes Home Improvement. I enjoyed helping customers and working with driven co workers who had great dreams and ambition.
good,"Worked from 7-3 Monday through Friday."
good,This was my first job I loved working here and the people I worked with. You will learn great customer service experience and a lot about home improvement.
good,The workplace was relaxing and i could get my work done easily. working in that heat was a challenge but I still did it. The customers were great as well.
good,Lowe's cares about its employees and the store teams worked well together and took care of each other like a family.  A typical day includes managing associates and ensuring that all store functions are running smoothly.
good,"There was never a dull moment, you are always busy with helping customers and stocking the shelves.  I enjoyed working there because you were doing something different everyday."
good,"I love my job. I have learned a lot by working at Lowes.Management could be better if they cared more about their Employees.The workplace is great. The hardest about the job is withstanding the seasons, meaning the weather,"
good,"Very easy to work here, it gave me more experience working with customers face to face. And the salary isn't that bad, the only thing was they cut my hours even though I'm a full time associate and that has really cut into my pay. I feel like I work hard here so I don't know why they chose me out of all people. The coworkers are kind and friendly and are great at teaching the work."
good,"It was a good place to work. You don't get raises, but the starting pay is pretty good. Room for advancement if you are a hard worker. Management is very good, and will work with you on anything."

good,its a good job its very laid back it can also be very hectic and stressful you don't know what your doing but if your a very fast learner then you should be okay
good,days at Lowes are very busy fast pass .you wait on customer help them with problem solving. Management needs to be more involved in helping employees instead of just directing them .Very stressful most days because of a lack of knowledgeable help hire to many young people with no experience. Very outdated computer system .
good,"just a good place to work, a lot of one on one with customers. good insurance, competivie pay, friendly staff, enjoyable job. Meet lots of people and help them love where they live"
good,"Enjoyed learning a new skill, enjoyed the people and management. This is the kind of work I have done for 20+ years and fit right in with company/department."

good,Lowes was a good work environment. the only problem was management. staff was very limited and they were planning on hiring anyone after we repeatedly ask them to hire new people

good,the customer service is 100% as you have to make sure customers are satisfied and their satisfaction is key and part of the motto for the company. the work ethic is conducive and it helps grow in different department
good,"I currently work at Lowe's Home Improvement. A typical day at Lowe's begins with getting the many various appliances on the truck on the dock. Loading up and loading out as soon as possible. GPS the various homes and locations and deliver items appropriately.  Iv'e learned how to deal with multiple personalities in regards to customer service and also to remain calm when problems arose. Lowe's workplace culture is very tight and committed to team work to get jobs done. The hardest part about this job is the weight of these appliances putting stress on my body!"
good,"A typical day at lowes is business in your department waiting on customers, stocking shelves and team work,"
good,Working for lowe's as a cashier and a Delivery Driver was a good experience for me was younger and it was fun Driving all around the state with a coworker and meeting customer was good.
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work, the culture is good and it is a stable company to work for.  The policies and procedures are relevant to the business and is tailored to help the customer have a good shopping experience"
good,"Lowes is such a great work place and they as a company take care of there employees, that ive noticed at the location that I'm at . the managers are great! The co workers are great! I really believe I made the best decision to leave my prior job for lowes! I have no regrets! And if I cannot get a permanant position i plan to keep a watch for opportunities within the company"
good,"Good supervisor promoted within so advancement is possible if you show interest and work hard, great people to work with and benefits are good not great but better than some that i've enjoyed recently."
good,"Management has improved in the past in few years but still, need a lot of in communication on each other. As the training for new hires is a joke, they give out booklets but have no real information about the products when need to help customers."
good,Locations in a nationwide franchise are sometimes fraught with disconnect. I often found that to be the case at Lowe's. The local staff were friendly for the most part though.
good,I enjoyed working for Lowe's. I had a position that I could work all over the store and had lots of different experiences. I enjoyed being able to move around the store.
good,"A great place to work and always potential for growth withing store. As a regular customer service associate, daily functions consist of helping customers with questions and putting up stock."
good,Good company to work for and very polite and helpful employees. Managers are willing to work with employees for time off and emergencies. Good company.
good,"Management is very willing to work with associates to work around other commitments such as school or family. Fast paced, but it helps the day go by faster. Knowledgeable associates who are willing to learn more to better understand other departments and help customers."
good,"When I started in Receiving, the unload shift was in the afternoon. I was to set up pallets in the marked area per department with my crew.  This position was timed as soon as we cut open the bolt to open the door. Then we had two people in the truck and two outside working to sort and place the product in the right department in a timely fashion. When we were done, the crew brought the pallets to designated departments on the floor at the end of day."
good,good company for new employee or for part time work. willing to support being flexible.  differnt areas you can select which meet your needs in sales or interests.
good,ok company but extremely under staffed and the lack of set schedules is also a must for people who do volunteer work in the community and who have family
good,I enjoyed working at Lowe's it is very calm and steady. Everyone helps eachother. The managers are very understanding and are able to work with your hours.
good,"Ringing up customers and answering the phones."
good,Nice place to work.  Fun...no stress..except when you had customers that cursed you or degraded you and team leaders or management did nothing about it.
good,"Sometimes it can be very dead at work."
good,"Fast paced environment, typically worked overnight so I had no contact with customers.  Overnight work is typically team oriented.  Individuals are split into different departments."
good,"I enjoyed working for Lowe's.  I stayed pretty busy helping customers and keeping the department in shape.  Most of the managers were great to work with and it was a fairly happy environment.  Best part of the job was customers, worst part was computer systems.  Lowe's has a lot a computer issues."
good,"Don't get me wrong, I like working here a lot. The only thing that really makes me consider getting a different job is the customers. You have a lot of good ones, but sometimes the bad ones can really ruin someone's day. I like to think I'm a fairly patient person which is why I've lasted here for two years, but sometimes I wish I didn't need the job and its benefits otherwise some customers would have definitely caused me to walk out a while ago."
good,Lowe's has truly given me new experiences on how to work in a fast paced environment and has allowed me to to recognize that I can go above and beyond in what i do!

good,This is a very fast paced place to work in which you stay busy which I like because it makes the day go faster.  Enjoyed meeting new people and making new friends.
good,Lowe's was fast paced which I prefer.  They did consider hiring for other positions from within so you were able to advance with the company.  It is a good place to work.
good,Every day is  different depending on the picking work load. Some days you run all day and others you work at a nice even pace. All in all if you do your job you will have a great day.
good,Lowe's is a fun work place and I enjoyed cross training in other departments in order to help customers in need of help. The managers were very helpful and thoughtful.
good,Have only worked for Lowes for 3 months but I'm happy with the autonomy I have there.  The vibe around the building is relaxed but not always very positive from staff.  Management is more supportive but could be more available at busy times.  Overall I would recommend Lowes as a good place to work and achieve career advancements.
good,The Pro Services Loader position is a fairly fast paced and labor intensive job. It requires heavy lifting on an extremely timely schedule. Shopping cart levels must also be maintained.
good,"As soon the unloaders have a palate for one of the department, one of us will take it to the respected area. We usually get everything done and clean before 5:30am."
good,For the most part working for Lowe's is pretty easy. They do a good job training the new hires in so that when they get out onto the sales floor they are ready to go to work.
good,"it was ok and will probably work there again.It was a comfortable place to work in,some good people work there and i recomend this job to anyone that is looking for  JOB"
good,Lowes was a great place to work and other employees are friendly and helpful. Managers needed to learn the old fashion way as I did and they would understand more of the employees and the customers as they come first for a business to grow.
good,Enjoyed my co-workers . Managers were understanding. HR was also available. I also worked in customer service.  That was very very stressful. Decided to go back to just being a cashier.
good,"Nice work place "
good,Lowes was a great place to work.  The benefits were great and the pay was very competitive.  There are opportunities to move up with the company and the abilities to learn new things
good,The store teams need to work together to make it all come together. Develops a great team environment. would  recommend a store manager position. rewarded for performance
good,LTL Stocker/Receiver. Assisted the main receiver with the store's truck shipments. Received items and distributed products throughout various locations in the store.
good,i enjoyed working at lowes. the management was good. the work was not to difficult ............... had alot of fun but each store location is different
good,Lowe's was a pretty good job to have. In the short time I was there I built really good relationships with people. I rarely saw my manager but he was a nice guy. It felt like home working there is that I grew up in the city. The hardest part was leaving and if I wanted to return I had to go through the whole hiring process again instead of being transferred.
good,I learned a lot at Lowes. I had a great work team. Definitely taught a great lead for team work. Scheduling was up and down. But flexible when needed  to be.
good,A place to learn and grow.  Employees are wonderful to work with.  Make it the best experience you can while you learn and grow.  It becomes a positive experience.
good,"Great On Continuing Education ad great experience for Retail Career. "
good,I was tasked with taking care of installers and installations/issues that arose on the job site/store. I did enjoy getting to know and work with most of the installers
good,Each individual experience depends on the position held. In my position on the delivery team I could be out pretty late or I could be off early. I had plenty of days where we worked passed our scheduled time. The culture is nice. They do make a way for people to be recognized for good work.
good,Any retail location is difficult to manage. This company is great for advancement and pays well. Management could use a re-vamp but I would still work for this company in the future.
good,"Although i have worked in other places after lowes, it is still a place i can recommend people to work in. There are different departments in the store anyone could work in, as long as the receive training."
good,Was a perfectly fine summer job. We were sometimes very understaffed; hiring more people for each store would probably solve that problem and allow for better customer care.
good,"A great place to start your retail career. Great opportunity for advancement."
good,I mostly worked as a cashier in the lumber department. I felt like when I needed a manager to help it took forever for them to get to me. I also felt like I didn't get much help from my co-workers when it came to pulling lumber supplies for customers or finding prices on items that did not have a bar code.
good,"The workplace at the Lowe's I am at has been good. Almost all of my coworkers and the managers have been fantastic. I enjoy being able to help the customers that come in for a variety or product and while not all of them were perfect, the experience and work has been very good."
good,Lowes was a great place to work over the summer. The HR manager was extremely friendly and really helped me ease into my new job at lowes. My manager also was very kind and helpful in teaching me the duties and responsibilities of the job.
good,"Worked for XPO as a 3rd party delivery   company"
good,Its a great store and a great company but I call I tend to wait a long time to get ahold of one department. Customer service is great and so is the management.
good,"I enjoyed my time with this company, I worked here in two different locations and liked the management and other employees of both locations. Very flexible with school schedule and with sick children."
good,"Would open store in the morning, give directions to 45 plus employees for their daily shift. manage a team at the customer service counter and cashiers as well as coordinate shipping and receiving. check on reports daily. control all expenses for the store and payroll for 176 employees. learned how to deal with the public. team work environment. enjoyed dealing with people. Lowe's is a great place to work. it can provide some great opportunity for a career. They create a team effort to everything and opportunity for advancement."
good,help customers and do daily chores like keeping it clean and merchandised. The hardest part of the job is having to load lawn mowers into cars. The management is better than most places.

good,"training always available "

good,"Overall Lowes is an interesting place to work because it taps into so many areas of our expertise and forces us to be fully engaged at all times."
good,I have been with lowes for 5 years now and it has been a good place to work i enjoy working with my fellow co workers. Its pretty fast paced at times but some days are slow. The only issue i have with lowes is i have not been able to move up or advance in full time because to be honest they favor certain people to choose to pick to move up and its wrong. Other than the favortisim lowes is a good place to work. Everyone is very nice and fun to work with.
good,"I love where I work, as I am able to help people love where they live on a daily basis. The work environment is extremely friendly, as I look forward to going to work on a daily basis."
good,The staff there is very nice and friendly. Everyone gets along and everyone helps each other out. No one will get on you for your mistakes they will help you not make it again.
good,helping with customer needs unloading trucks stocking shelves sweeping and cleaning in and around work station teaching classes going to classes having bbq
good,While working as a nights delivery picker my duties consisted of putting customers orders together to be ready for delivery the following morning. This included large orders for Lumber and shingles which are fairly heavy and taxing on the body.
good,"Loved my job in the cash office. Had fun filling in doing price changes and other job duties needed. I started out as a seasonal lumber cashier and moved my way up to an administrative associate within 5 years. I offered to learn as many different jobs as I could to help out throughout the store, which helped me acquire the title of Administrative Associate."
good,Lowes was a good company I have no complains about it .I left on a good note. I learn a lot from being an hr. But I know in my heart I wanted to work somewhere else
good,"I loved working at Lowe's, I didn't really want to leave but because of unforseen circumstances I ended up staying in Wyoming state. The customers where awesome and the employees helped to teach me everything I needed to know."
good,"I had worked here for 6 years and it was probably the best job Ive ever had.  The work wasn't terrible, the management was reasonable and the friends I made there I'll never forget."
good,Overall it was a good job fast paced especially on the weekends loading supplies for contractors. Blowing the yard with a leaf blower blower plus sweeping and cleaning
good,"Great middle management team with a solid, hard-working culture of people who want a career advancement.  Unfortunately, it's regularly understaffed due to forecasts which do not seem to be accurate."
good,Lowe’s was a great experience for me as a supervisor it thought me many things I didn’t know it also helped me with some new skills  I loved the pay I’m sorry I had to leave there I wanted more hours
good,Was a great place to work in high school.  They worked well with me in school  and I gained a lot of experience in different departments. It was hard work but rewarding.
good,nice people from management down to co workers competitive salary good benefits fellow employees and the customers are nice and mostlly cordial i enjoyed my time there
good,"I loved the dept I worked in.  My day was always fast paced and I enjoyed helping customers.  The other associates were fun to work with.  We all got along,"
good,"Live nursery specialist is extremely demanding but fulfilling. Lowe's is a great company to work for on paper, but some management teams are better than others."

good,I am grateful to this company for the time i have had with them they have taught me many things and i can maybe see myself working here again one day.
good,at lowes you have to come work do your job and you are good...........the manager are just that manager the other employer are great to work with...but like at any job you have to be carful who you talk to
good,This is a job that will help show you how to become a leader while learning among your co workers. As well as help you grow as an individual to sharpen skills.
good,"Overall a good place to work.  Hard work does not go unnoticed and as long as you aren't lazy you wont have many issues.  Management does there best but are often overworked and stressed by irrelevant things as a result of demands from upper management.  Lots of free staff lunches, events and fundraisers."
good,"It was a learning experience.  Had the opportunity to work in various departments of the store.  "
good,"My general manager was the best I ever had, and I was only a part-time employee.  Very relaxed culture.  Everyone had pleasant attitudes all the time.  Every body helped each other out in all departments.  I only quit because of an increase in hours at my primary job.  It was the best part-time job I ever had."
good,"Good company to work for, you create solid relationships with with customers, businesses and the community. Good training, high level of knowledge in a variety of areas needed to be successful"
good,"lowes is great company to work for, you learn a lot of experience working with customers and and vendors .it's very fast pace work place you have to be customer focus and friendly to be able to communicate .management are sales driven and customer service is number one.and that's what drives Lowe's business. by being number one customer oriented.people.you have to meet and exceed sales .must preform outstanding customer service.keeping up with inventory is a real challenge .meeting new customer every day is a real joy. when they come to you for an advice to help them select the right product.for their home. and put smile on their face and a big thank you when they leave. it's a great feeling when you know you have the knowledge and the experience and able to use it and make some one very happy."
good,"Actually a pretty decent job. However if you work here get your own bank account to direct deposit, I had a big issue with the card that they provided me with and never got paid while I worked there. I finally got paid almost 2 months after leaving. Its hard to end up with full time hours. You have to be there for a good bit to receive full time hours, Its very relaxed and slow paced on average. If youre looking for a pretty simple job this would be it."
good,Good place to work for. i met a lot of nice people and felt very comfortable there. its a very clean place and very orderly. Te best part about it is that going to work everyday is exciting because i would learn new things everyday and i love learning new things.
good,"I've spent around 3 and half years working for Lowes and my favorite things are the benefits and my current management/department crew. I used to be on the front end for almost the full first 3 years and it's an exhausting place to work both as a cashier and a head cashier. Now that I work on the salesfloor it's much more laid back and there's a lot more positive interaction with customers and associates. The current store manager is hands down the best person I've ever worked under, my direct manager and ASM are also really easy to work with and management in general is pretty good right now. Unfortunately though, to get out of the frustration of the front end, in order to move to the sales floor, without a specialist position opening, the only option is to take a pay cut which I think is kind of ridiculous. I work significantly harder now than I did before and get paid much less than before. I have learned an enormous amount both in workplace related things as well as homeowner information. Lowes is a wealth of knowledge for selling tools both technology wise as well as interacting with people and I've learned a huge amount to apply to my everyday life as a homeowner which is pretty priceless."
good,lowes is a great company to work forthey offer many benefits to their employees. Its a family oriented company that cares for their employees. they do holiday dinners as well as othe celebrations and gifts.Like any other job you have your fair share of outgoing coworkers as well as those who dont want to see you succeed. Pay no mind to the negativity and its a great job.
good,I was able to do my own work at my own pace and there was never a time where there was not work for me to do. The managers were great and they were very understanding. I enjoyed this job very much.
good,It is a good company to work for .with good benefit's. I would recommend is to others. it would be good for a young man or women to get started. Work hours are good.
good,I enjoyed helping the customers find the products that they need. the employees were helpful when I first started. Management helped with training when needed. It was a good experience working there
good,"it was fast paced, and you barely get a break. or a lunch unless you work so many hours at a time, and then they will keep you over even if you say you cant"
good,The overall work environment was relaxed but fast-pace. If you had a question that you couldn't answer for a customer another associate wouldn't hesitate to come and help. I got certified to drive a for-lift while I worked there (not required). The management was mostly great and they stopped and taught you what you wanted to learn.
good,great company to work for to gain entry level experience in customer service. also management works very well making sure customers are satisfied with there merchandise.
good,not a bad place to start but don't make it your future don't get it wrong I love my time there and the position I held but its great a second job or for younger people that's in high school
good,Store 1795 was a great family to work with. I enjoyed my time there and the retail experience i gained. Managers could have had more responsibilities and help out with lower associates.
good,I was at Lowes for about 10 years learned a lot of my management and training skills in that time.  Decent job for starting out managing. Would recommend to a friend.
good,Fun job.
good,"This job is great for college students due to the flexible hours."
good,"I worked here as a seasonal for sometime, and once you got over how physically demanding it became (spoiler alert: you're gonna bulk up quickly and lose a lot of weight because of how much movement you'll be doing), it's a very friendly, very laid back atmosphere for the most part. During the periods where lots of customer traffic occurs (spring & summer, especially Mother's/Father's Day or July 4th) you will work for every cent you make in that paycheck. My co-workers were amazing, very friendly and understanding who often made time fly and your job much easier. You're allowed to take breaks whenever needed (in moderation of course), and because of where it's situated (this one was in Havertown) there was access to many places to enjoy your hour long lunch breaks. I felt appreciated there, the company and that particular location made sure they took care of their employees often hosting free events during the summer time like BBQ's and contests to win desirable prizes. "
good,This job is perfect if your into customer service and need a job that offers competitive benefits as well as pay. Job may be really slow at times and then busy the nxt.
good,This has been a good part-time job while attending college. Lowes offers tuition reimbursement which has been helpful. My managers have done a good job working with my schedule.
good,"Just don't talk and keep working. You will be paid well and get opportunities. There is opportunity to move around, and overtime is usually seasonal. Management can suck at times."
good,Enjoyable and fast paced. I loved planning the execution of product line reviews for my market and then seeing the fruits of our success after execution with the incremental increase in sales to forecast. Lots of room for improvement within the deployment of tasks by corporate but it is noticeable that they are evaluating everything for each project released to the field.
good,"Lowes is a god place to work, failed to meet medical accommodations for longer than 3 months for severe ACL strain that may have occurred due to constant lifting, had to leave. Good pay rate, benefits, and hours for night shift. Ample notice given for OT work."
good,I was employed in the install department. It was my job to coordinate the home project between the installer and the customer. If there were any situations that the customer was not satisfied with I went back to the installer to correct the problem until the homeowner was pleased.
good,"Answer calls, answer customer questions, promote our business, create order for our customers, give delivery times, take credit card information, meet goals"
good,Working for Lowe's was good over all. I learned how to drive sales and credit. They needed a better training program for their management team. The company was family oriented. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy products that we sold. the most enjoyable   part of the job is the way we all worked as a team together.
good,it was cool. i liked it. i recommend it. i dont know. cool hours. cool people. nice people. nice pay. all that.  nice managers. fun work. fast paced. i recommend it.
good,"Results driven company.  Management is very supportive and looking for individuals that will look out of the box for unique ideas to improve processes.  Fast paced, ever changing environment.."
good,Good coaches and human resources.Very helpful whenever I needed help. If you come to work and do your job you will be okay  My job is in different temperatures sometimes hot sometimes cold.
good,"Its a great place to work, busy and fast paced job environment.  Always had new employees and management was always involved and great to work for in this location"
good,Great place really good people Interesting for the project oriented person you never stop learning new things it's great the people are more than helpful with anything
good,Good job for retire military and people that knows about building materials on there home. I learned a lot by working there good benefits nice working atmosphere
good,I loved the job the people the hours the responsibilty. But at a a big company you are just a number with limited chances to advance. Thank you very much
good,Lowe's like all retail companies are trying to keep up with amazon. As such they are trying to cut cost. Some of the stores have had issues with the change in management structure. This is causing issues with customer service due to high turnover.
good,Fast-paced place to work without too much oversight. Supportive environment to foster teamwork and good moral among employees. My only quarrel is Lowe's has the ability to switch your employment position at any time with or without notice.
good,This is a good place for me to use the knowledge I have acquired during my construction courier  to help the do-it -yourself person.  I've learned a lot about the products that they sell thru their training programs
good,"It's a ok place.  It's retail so remember that, hours are not always the same.  it all depends on people who have been there longer or who call out if you can pick up extra hours."
good,"I worked there for several years and enjoyed the experience.  The most difficult thing was the changing schedule, some very early mornings and some late nights.  Other than that, the job was enjoyable."
good,Everyone is very helpful and will make sure you have the training that you need to advance in different departments. They are very good about working with your schedule and you have guanteed weekends off ( every weekend). The staff is very friendly and always greet the workers while they’re headed to different department.
good,"Lowe's is a fairly good place to work. The management are good and the benefits are great. The hardest part about the job, is just standing there all day waiting for customers. As a cashier, I have to literally just stand there all the time. I can't walk around like other employees can."
good,"My typical day would be to down stock product, fill holes with inventory that's in stock, reset new product that comes in, customer service, special orders, shipping and receiving."
good,Because of my knowledge of plumbing Home Depot offered my]\e more money to come work for them so i excepted  their offer.Like any other if you have  the right personal and management its an awesome place to work.
good,"Ensuring department(s) are customer ready at all times while inspiring engaging, customer-focused behavior, mitigating and reducing customer complaints, and driving positive first impressions for customers upon entering the store. Enabling and empowering a team of Customer Service Associates (CSAs) to deliver the best possible customer service experience in the store. This includes responsibility for customer facing activities on the sales floor (e.g., greeting customers, listening and probing to understand needs, identifying solutions), as well as down stocking, inventory management and area recovery. Also responsible for coaching, mentoring, training, and continually monitoring Customer Service Associates within my area."
good,Great thing about this job you meet people from all types of trades. You get great ideas for home improvements from the customers. The co-workers are outgoing. May get overloaded with customers especially if you're setting up special orders
good,"Overall a good place to work, never met another employee I did not like.  Management is generally excellent but are sometimes overburdened and cannot always provide the amount of help and coaching required.  There were some staffing issues when hours got tight but the culture is such that everyone bands together and works across departments."
good,Very welcoming workplace culture for new immigrants. Encouraging and helpful management. Great place to get you started and give you some work experience in Canada.
good,"Company itself is a great company to work for. Great benefits, contributors to the community, and always changing to fit demands. On hands with customers and collaborative work environment."
good,"This is an all around great job for someone just coming into the job market. There is plenty of room for mobility, and you need little to no experience coming in. They literally teach you everything you need to know."
good,a great place to work good co workers fun environment  good pay an hours hard work environment relaxed good management learned new skills and talents.
good,"I loved working at Lowes. The customers were awesome , but the management team was awful. The staff was always starting things and kept mess going on in the work place. If you are a student I would not recommend you to work here because they do not like to work around your schedule."
good,"Flexible hours and promoted my education. While prior knowledge of products and tasks are necessary for customers, training is provided and fellow employees do a great job of teaching. Not a bad job for those in university or recent high school graduates."
good,I would unload a truck and then disperse mechandise. they days went very fast. I often felt like i was at work for only 30 minutes. Constant and stable hours too.
good,I was the cashier in the outside Garden Department. Helped check out customer and load them. Worked in the customer service by answering calls taking their payments and helping customers with their internet orders.
good,Fun work place to work and fast placed loved meeting people and helping them solve problems ad building strong relationships with the customers and fellow employees
good,I really enjoyed the challenge of being a sales specialist at Lowes. I really enjoy helping people and trying to find a solution to their individual wants .
good,"It was a very chill environment for me to almost mindlessly stock shelves and be able to think and do other things in my mind. I used to listen to music and audiobooks while doing this job all of the time, at least until headphones were banned from use. Even afterwards, however, I still had an empty space to myself."
good,Working outside in the summer in N.C. was very tough at first but as time went on you get used to the heat.I liked working there and would go back if they were to call.
good,"The management staff was easy to talk to. I enjoyed the environment to work in, I enjoyed helping the customers with their needs and answering their questions, The hardest part was being short staffed."
good,"i enjoy working for public ,the management is very helpful when you need help . a typical day was busy always something to do.the most enjoyable part was dealing with customers"
good,"Its a good place to work ...less stressful "
good,Enjoyed helping customers love where they live. Lowe's as a company care about their employees. Paid Time off and Holidays. Sick Time as well as short term disability benefits.
good,A typical day at work is to be on time or 15 minutes beforehand. It is a continuously learning environment where everyday you expect to learn new task. Management always has an open door. The culture is very friendly and welcoming. The hardest part of the job is not meeting expectations and the most enjoyable is exceeding them
good,"It was hard work being outside everyday but it was enjoyable. My coworkers work awesome even though they didn't always get along, and the work was hard but satisfying."
good,I would have to work with customers to give them excellent customer service. They would ask me questions and i would answer them if i did not know the answer then i would ask someone who knew.
good,They treated me well and paid me as well. It was a good working environment. The management was very well and everybody seemed to work good together and I don't have very many complaints.
good,Every one at Lowes came in and were happy with my performances from the beginning and was always ecstatic to be at work and actually loved what they did.
good,"I got great benefits, was nice envroment, laid back area, the pay was ok they gave me more hours when asked. approved all time off. got to work and learn other areas."
good,"I loved working at Lowe's. Working at lowe's you are expected to interact with all your fellow humans weather helping a customer with their project of the moment or helping a fellow employee review product from the top shelves."
good,Lowes was one of the better jobs that I’ve had .  Lowes give you a lot of opportunity to move up in the company .  The  work environment was great a lot of  friendly people and customers . Lowes was a company  where I couldn’t see myself building a career .
good,Needed to provide more working hours People are nice to work with and store is clean. Do wish the schedule could be sent by an email instead of driving up tot the store to check.
good,This place was not a bad place to work. Most management was good. The majority of employees there were great. Everyone worked together to bring customer satisfaction
good,Lowe's is a company that is fast paced with a strong emphasis in management being able to do every job in the store. The hardest part of the job is the hours. A manager will typically work 60 hours a week. Store Manager will work on average 70 in order to accomplish the task and goals that are needed to be done.
good,"I check emails, and then I set up the service cases, then I check the meat case for out of dates and I remark down meat that is expiring and dark meat. Then I take inventory on meat that I need to cut for the day. When the part timer comes in I give them directions on what to do that shift."
good,It is a great work environment. I enjoy coming to work everyday and all of the staff are very friendly. They offer career advancements to those who are interested.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, buenas prestaciones, compañerismo, oportunidad crecimiento"
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's, I had worked 2 separate positions at the "
good,great place to work at if you love customer service. Lowes 1602 is the best!!!!!!!!!!!! I enjoyed every year workin there . At the time the team moral was high!! you rocked
good,"I loved working at Lowe's.  I was giving the opportunity to learn, grow, and help people.  I was heart broken when Lowe's had to cut back on staffing.  I was one of 5 management field personal that was laid off at the location I worked at.  Have never felt like I have truly found a place until I started driving a bus."
good,I enjoyed the experience working there and would recommend it to anyone who wants a rewarding career. Management is great and benefits are too. Give Lowe's a try.
good,In a day at Lowe's you can have day's where you work a slow clean up day to a fast nonstop one. You are working with the public all day and have to be patience and level headed. You also have to stay ready for anything in a day.
good,"Opportunity for advancement. Steady work and great benefits.Cooperative, supportive atmosphere. Encouraging management team with years of retail experience."
good,They definitely work around your school and life schedule. It is a great place to work while attending college and the pay is better than most places.
good,Always something to do.  Could always go to the management team for help.  Great team to work for.  Could be very competitive at times but that's what drove me.
good,Started on the weekend team and graduated to a department associate and then changed to a different department. Learned how to do just about anything in the store to accommodate a customers wishes from cutting wood and all kinds of flooring to ordering window coverings to plumbing. Always able to advance or learn new things.
good,"Lowes as a Company overall was a great well- paying, easy to advance in company.  Holding High levels of Management Accountable for some of the poor interpersonal relationships depended upon which store you were at.  Typically Senior Management with longevity were favored in any sort of employee relations concern. That is the only concern I ever had with the company.  Otherwise all other employees were handled fair. "
good,"My job was filled with responsibility, hazmat program, out for repair program. On top of damage claims for everything returned to the store. It was the people that I worked with that made the job unbearable."
good,The training is up to date and easy to follow through. The lead people are very helpful in training and getting you up to speed on how things run. the department managers are all way there to help guide you in helping the customers. The HR staff is very knowledgeable and have gotten all the training and paper work organised to streamline employment. Store assistant Manager seems to be involved with you and what happens in the store as well as everyone else.
good,"great place to work, everyones friendly and supportive. You really get to know every customer. Relaxed atmosphere and very nice staff. everyone has each others back"
good,"It was a great experience for the most part. The work day was fairly easy and I learned quite a lot about large retail merchandising and now can you just about all you need to know about paint. The management was really nice, overall. The hardest part of the job is just knowing where everything is off the top of your head, but they provide you with months worth of training just to make sure you're ready before they throw you onto the floor and you will honestly never be alone, someone will always know if you don't. The most enjoyable part was probably mixing the paint and getting top shelf knowledge about home improvement."
good,Management was very kind and fair. Very diverse workplace with friendly coworkers. Mostly busy days with constant work. Can get hard and overwhelming with extra work.
good,"I think it is a great company, sometimes things happen."
good,"Lowe's is great company.Enjoyable part is helping customers with projects from start to finish. Enjoy working all areas of the store.Learning what projects customers are working on and how Lowe's can provide the right mix of product and services."
good,Big company with lots of opportunities and provides free training. Has good management and nice working environment. Has good good working transparency.
good,"Lowe's was my first taste of civilian life after two enlistments in the Army. It was a fun and exciting place to work with a lot of different employment opportunities within the company. Not understanding that I needed to apply for new jobs within the company, HR took advantage of my naivety and rather than help me out, let me move from night stocking to daytime customer service without just compensation. That is, most employees see a raise when they move from stocking to a sales/customer service position. I did not out of inexperience.  "
good,"I worked at Lowe's for little under a year and man I loved it, unfortunately, I was seasonal and they let a lot of seasonal people go and I was one of them no grudges I honestly liked everything about the place if you had a good team and manager like I had."
good,"Was just a temp job for me, but I would recommend the job to others as it is fun, quick paced, lively, always moving, they train you well on what you need to know, and management is great."
good,A normal day begins by clocking in near the tools section and proceeds to checking in with your manager to find out what your target area that you'll be working in. Working cashiering I'd head to the front end and check the list for which register I'm on and then continue my day from there helping customers get checked out as needed.
good,There was always something new everyday. Management team was good and the employees I had under me were great. I had a great experience working with Lowes.
good,I really enjoyed the fast paced customer service. I enjoyed helping all the customers with their project needs. I made friends while working there and enjoyed the work.
good,"Learned a lot. Learned how to close down a store, drive boxed trucks and drive a tow motor. Good learning experience, it was just a seasonal job. I really enjoyed the job"
good,Liked employee's and Managers. Always opportunities to move up in this company. Learned about products in different departments. Great benefits. Everyone was willing to help each other out when needed.
good,"I stock mulch and rock bags with a forklift for 8 hours a night with very little physical labor.  the most I'll have to do outside of the lift is adjust forks and break down a pallet.  The job is outside and overnight, so it is cold. Managers are friendly and are required to listen because of an open-door policy, but I feel that they take the time and care when you bring a situation to their attention."
good,A decent retail place to work. Basic work requirement. Able to lift and move objects over 50 lbs. The work schedule was nine-hour days with a one-hour lunch break.
good,the interacting with customers were very exciting but challenging at times. coworkers willing to work together. Lowes was like family away from home.Incintives were great.
good,"Just a normal workplace. You have to put up with a few things every now and then, but it's no big deal. Just audits. Making sure you're doing your job to meet the goals of the company. Just a simple process. It used to be at least a way to get you away from your job, for a while. Now is just done while you are doing your job. Now they just talk to you afterwards of what you, might, have, missed."
good,"It was fun to work with customers who always expect a highly knowledgeable person to deal with their needs on the product they are buying. Learned a lot thru these customers in daily basis."
good,I learned how to operate different equipment such as forklifts and reach tools. The job wasn't to stressful as long as you took time to learn your department. You don't get paid much unless you get in with the Pro-Team or some type of upper management. No real complaints
good,"Great working there. I enjoyed working with the"
good,This is a great place for college students to work. They worked with my schedule and payed pretty well. It was a easy job with minimal lifting. They do give bonuses.

good,"Throughout the workday at Lowes, I was very energetic. The co- workers, managers, and customers provided great energy that was contagious. The day was filled with assisting customers,  communicating with customers, and team work."
good,This was a great work environment. We were encouraged to work as a team and the work was fast paced and steady. I would recommend any one wanting to work with a team they can grow with work here.
good,"I learned many things while working at Lowe's, such as cash handling, balancing drawers, customer service, and being a leader for those I was in charge of. I enjoyed helping customers with their projects, or even for something quick they needed, even though sometimes it could be very difficult. I thoroughly enjoyed my job at Lowe's."
good,"Lowe's has good benefits for both full and part time employees. The work atmosphere is pretty good because of comradeship among the employees. They work together as a team to satisfy the customer. Work can be hard at times but rewarding."
good,"I learned many things there, specially Appliances, Electrical and paint departments the managers were very friendly an helpful. the employs were very nice and provid"
good,"Great company to work for. Benefits are real good.opportunity for advancing,  is stressed. 401k, credit union, and employee stock options guarantee retirement goals."
good,I worked at the warehouse on third shift. It was nice at first but the hours get to you. Management was nice and understanding. oiuld recommend the warehouse. Good pay
good,"Loved working with the customers, sometimes they would be aggravated because they couldn’t find what they were looking for and being able to find  it for them was great."

good,Lowe's was a really great place to work. I would recomend anyone to get a job there. Management was very good and so was the pay for it. I would work there again if i could.
good,Great  in store management. 
good,Each day was different. Some days were good and some were bad. Looking for more consistency. Sometimes the customers are hard to work with and expect us to be miracle workers.
good,loved working here. constant on the job training. plenty of dept. to choose to work. laid back and friendly work environment. very safety oriented of course.

good,I highly recommend anyone to work at Lowes if you enjoy home improvement.  Lowes is a fun place to work and the employees are friendly and team players.  Retail is hard work and at Lowes you stand hours on your feet. The fun part is asking the customer what is their project and helping them with ideas and finding the materials they need to complete their project.  I enjoyed being a cashier and talking about the customer's project and suggesting other items they may want to purchase.
good,"Arrive to work, get ready, clock in and start my day. Walk outside to assist every customer i possible can with the biggest smile on my face. After thank them."
good,For anybody who is looking for a easy-going nine stressful job Lowes is the best way to go and also if you were looking for a job around the building lumber or anything else in that category Lowes is the easiest way to start a career
good,"Working at Lowe's is a retail job, you have corporate rotations, so your schedule varies from opening, mid, to closing shift.  However,  I have worked for Lowe's for 7 years because I chose positions that had set schedules, there are a handful.   Having a set schedule is very important when you have a family.   You can move up to a service manager or assistant store manager."
good,Lowes is a fast paced customer centric environment. As a part time employee shifts are flexible. I was able to set a schedule while I went back to school.
good,"It is a nice place to work but you have to have a lot of patience, you get along with the coworkers managers are cool the managers and nice person if I could go back I would love to go back"
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Lowe's, when I was there they had a great management team and for the most part they were easy to work with. I would go back there if the right position was open."

good,There is no typical day. I have my responsibilities to try and handle along with everything else that comes along in the day that I am asked to do or handle.
good,A Typical summer Day for outside lawn and garden associates is smiles and cool breezes while assisting customers with Day to day things such as pits for plants and mulch for lawn needs
good,"Very exciting place to work . Can be a little overwhelming sometimes."
good,"Since partially retiring, Lowes has been a great experience.  Being given the opportunity to work in several departments, I enjoy customer and staff interaction.  Mentoring other new employees and working with a variety of products, services and individual/commercial customers has been enjoyable."
good,"Lowes was a fun place to work. The people I worked with were for the most part kind, fun and worked hard. The management team cared deeply for their staff and did whatever they good to maintain a healthy work environment."
good,"This company was very good to me. When I had to move back home (another state), they worked hard to get me a transfer so I could stay with the company."
good,I enjoyed working at Lowes it I s low stress job and I was able to meet people from community while serving them as well. The Mangement team was easily accessed and very involved in their employees . I also enjoyed  working in lawn and garden center especially during spring and Christmas season.
good,The other associates were very open and encouraging towards me and offered their assistance whenever they could.  The management was also very understanding and provided me with the flexibility to do what I needed to do.
good,Great place to work. The only reason that I left Lowes is because I was offered my money at Stanley Black & Decker. This is a company that a person can grow and excel fast.
good,Fully structural day.  I worked four-10 hour days and had weekend off.  The work environment is stressful and tedious.  Confined to headset and chair unless otherwise allowed to take breaks.  All breaks are logged into and accounted for.
good,"great place for side job or second job "
good,"laid back job and a fast pace Job"
good,"Work over 12 years, enjoyed my time there. Friendly staff and co workers. Made me feel as part of a great team. Fast paced never boring day. Learned the home improvement business."

good,In years at lowes the company was good to me in many was great pay and a balanced social life was a plus as well learning different management skills it was a very nice job and id recommend anyone to apply
good,"Not a bad job, but not amazing. Lots of retired part-time workers, not great for career advancement. Raises annually - nothing special. Have to work there close to ten years or so to make anything worth living on."
good,So I was quite surprised by the majority of co-workers that were extremely friendly and helpful in transitioning my past into the retail culture it was quite enjoyable to see that many people were cooperative and eager to assist a new employee. This is for the most part why I am looking for advancement in Lowe's career opportunities
good,"Enjoyed working here, I just prefer faster paced work. They treat employees well and pay decent. My biggest gripe was the lack of job clarity, sometimes I wasn't sure what my responsibilities were."
good,"During my time with Lowe's I learned new and cutting edge management techniques, a diverse perspective of the business and an in depth understanding of employee engagement."
good,"This was my first full time job as a teen. Was a great job for me, i had the hours and the pay i needed at the time. Working as a cashier gave me much needed customer service and retail experience."
good,I would unload trucks with merchandise for stor with a forklift or pallet jack.Then I would take out ontoo display floor with pallet jack and put away on shelves. Sometimes would use a stand-up lift to put away or an order picker to put stock away on upper shelves?
good,"any job can easily stress someone but there's only a couple things to be on the look out with lowes. If you are bothered by ignorant customers and cannot keep your cool, maybe this isn't a job for you."
good,Provided great customer service and manageable communication between Lowes and customer up to the time of installation and during installation. It was a great learning experience
good,very strick and on top of their business. management knew how to help associates when needed. can always trust management. days went by fast. customer service was my favorite. always multi tasking and computer based projects
good,i learned its a hands on job and you are currently helping costumers find what they need. i learned when you have good coworkers to help you out and are all on the same page on things it makes they work force more helpful and less stressful
good,Fun fast paced and room for advancement. Family like environment. Challenging and exciting job working outside of the store was rewarding a chance to interact with customers and get a more satisfying experience in performing daily work duties.
good,Daily tasks kept me busy. I learned that hard work and great customer service comes a long way. The workplace culture was good. The hardest part of the job was working alone during customer peaks.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customer find what they were looking for.
good,"Lowes is a very great place to work, very friendly work environment to be in and apart of. Lowes is also very diverse and a costumer friendly environment because the customers happiness is what matters most at this corporation."

good,Good place to work if you are looking for a part-time job. Managers are great and easy to talk to. I loved the work environment and the people I worked with.

good,This was an ok job. good for a first job. management is terrible. hr doesnt care. no room for growth at all no fulltime unless you suck up to managers.
good,Working at Lowe's Home Improvement Centers was a great place to work with a environment filled with great employees.

good,"lots of exciting things to do "
good,Working at Lowes is a lot different then all the other jobs I've had and there are more people there who are willing to help with just about anything.
good,Great store to work in. Corporate needs to rethink some of their recent decisions such as removing store based deliveries in exchange for third party.
good,"Lowe's values its associates and offers opportunity for growth. Lowes offers excellent benefits and flexible scheduling days and evenings. The retail industry requires working nights, weekends and holiday work hours that can be difficult for family life."

good,working well with others
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's, my position was Front-End Customer Service. I cashiered and worked in the customer service section. Management was very good. They were very flexible with hours which was necessary as a college student. They also pay really well. It is a quick-paced job at times. They are also strict on policies."
good,"It was slow on some days, but the days it was fast paced you were going all day long. The management is top notch and make you feel like your voice matters. And the hours were good, and they were very flexible with your schedule based on your lifestyle."
good,"productive place to work especially in the summer time, can be be a job where you learn alot from not only co-workers but customers as well. its a job that can be fun if you make it"
good,"Management is friendly, accessible for help, and motivational. All of the employees work together for the main goal of customer satisfaction. The workplace is a ""family"" environment, where the employees care about each other."
good,"Lowe's was an interesting job. The environment was fastpaced and more often than not, one had to train themselves with the essentials. It is definitely not a bad company, but management could be more efficient in the orientation process."
good,the people her at the lower stores for the most part know what they are talking about but some of them don't. They have the ability to get whatever it is you want in a timely manner

good,i would rather not talk about my experience with lowes . im moving on to the next chapter in my life . thank you for your intrest but im not disclosing any information
good,"Lowe's is a great company. Good pay, advancement opportunities, good people, overall great customers. My store just personally had poor management. They continually made errors on every single employee's schedules, and mine was nearly on a weekly basis, especially after year 1 (I was there for 2 & 1/2 years, so it really became an issue for me). Additionally, they never commended me, after many times over the years where my customers have went to them to tell them how amazing I was at my job, and/or how much they loved whatever it is I did for them. I never went looking for compliments or anything, but not saying a thing to me, ever, while my customers went out of their way for me, was wrong, and definitely not the way I would manage things. There is more that I could say negatively about my personal experience, at my store, but overall Lowe's is a great company, and a good company to work for. I don't blame them for our poor management."
good,I was promoted 6 times in 5 yrs so it wasn't terrible there is room to move up i just wanted more money. I feel like for being a senior manager they could have paid better than 17.69 an hr and others who were same level of management made way more than i did and im one of the only managers that will do physical work right beside our team.
good,"Working at Lowes was FUN. I worked the inside lawn and garden department. Just after I was hired the department manager was after a 5% increase in sales for the year, we ended with a 15% increase in sales. It was a team effort.  Lowes gave me a chance to expand my sales efforts by sending me to training schools which gave me a chance to sell product with a better understanding.  I would love to go back to work for Lowes."
good,Overall a decent place to have a job although long term employees are not treated with the respect they deserve and there are those that make bad decisions for the store. Also a great lack of communication between department heads.
good,"The pay is competitive, the benefits are great and their willingness to work with employees on their availability is exceptional. Lowe's is a great place to work."
good,Lowes has been a great place to advance my business skills.  Lowes continues to be a great place to work and has been focused on allowing employees to have a work/home life balance.
good,"stocking shelves, inventory, always on your feet, moving from one department to another or covering other departments while someone is out or at lunch, answering the phone, giving good customer service."
good,"The overall culture of the company is positive and collaborative.  I would definitely suggest Lowes Foods as a good place to work. Every place of business has its bad seeds, but Lowes Foods is very good at handling addressing issues brought forth by employees."
good,"Good place to work, nice people, heavy security, Great lunch Food, plus ATM."
good,It was fair and the managers treated you like people. The pay is good for what type of work it is and every employee is a friend there. They really take care of their employees and make sure each one is happy.
good,Collaborative team atmosphere; interaction with customers is generally fun. Some new trainees for management have little or no training as managers and have unrealistic expectations.
good,"The team makes a great work environment. If the employees respect each other and work as though they are part of a great team, they will succeed and have security."
good,"The Pro Desk is busy from the time doors open to 6PM. Management allows Pro Desk associates to manage the business and enjoy the success of obtaining and exceeding goals.  That's the enjoyable part of having a harmonizing team striving for the one goal, Store success."
good,"Overall great place though over worked most mornings doing freight, we got little help at last of chain. hard being on feet all day, vests hot, nice clean bright stores, growth opportunities"

good,"This was a great place for me to learn how to become an effective team member.  I attribute a lot that I do and know now to the few years that I was employed here.  If you're thinking about it, then I say give it a go. Its a great company with good advancement opportunities; unless they have changed them since then."
good,I only worked there for a short time. It was good work and payed well. A great company to work for. The location I started in closed many years ago. Lowe's is a good place to work overall.
good,"I learned a lot about children and adults how they function in their homes--the good, the bad, and the ugly.  The hardest part of the job was not having the experiences each client faced because I was their age so I hadn't got the chance to relate to them until years later.  I enjoyed helping the clients shop for inexpensive clothes, tutoring them, and keeping them calm."
good,its a really good place to work when you're first starting out! love the people and you always end up making great relationships with everyone. Always such a positive energy
good,cool place to work great environment the environment is fast past. the experience of working at the company was a good experience and the people are friendly.

good,"I've worked here for 5 years. Never had a problem, I've been able to move up from part time seasonal cashier to several management positions. I've always been provided with what I needed to succeed."
good,cool place to work I enjoyed the people and customer service part of it   The company has some good points but the STORE MGT has always got a way to cut cut cut and not reinvest in people
good,"Great people to work with and a balanced work pace. A great culture and growth opportunities, and room to improve your personal skill set. Lowe's is a great company."
good,It’s a very nice place to work as long as you do what you are told . But a typical day at lowes will be just to help customers feel comfortable about where they are living.
good,"I currently work part-time on the weekday team. My hours are 5-9 Monday-Friday. I enjoy having the weekends off but I don't enjoy working every evening and having to give up time with my children. I enjoy working here, the employees are like family, and are always willing to help out when possible."
good,"This facility is excellent for those who are currently in school, or even to make a career out of. Leadership training is offered to all employees interested in obtaining a leadership role in the future."
good,"lowes Home Improvement was a company to work for to gain beginner skills. Forktruck license, early mornings and some overnight shifts did me justice. Great company to work for."
good,they will hire people with management experience to manage something they know nothing about is the only bad thing other than that i loved the place i would go back

good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Lowe's, I was saddened that the schedule I was placed on didn't work out with my personal schedule but happy with what accomplished while there!"
good,Management shows compassion to their employees. Great work/family ratio by the company. Promotes hard working employees. Good benefits and training. I highly recommend looking at this company for your next job!
good,Fast paced environment that deals with contractors and retail shoppers that come into the store to purchase product to fix up their homes and businesses.
good,I have enjoyed working at Lowes it is a fast paced sometimes high stress job that I do Like. Like any other job there are good days and bad days. I feel that sometimes it is mismanaged by some and over managed by others we all seem to have a decent relationship with management. I would encourage people to apply at Lowes as it is a great company to work for.
good,Love the Company and believe in it. Every store is situational on how their leadership leads. Lets just say some stores do a better job than others. However as a whole. Lowes is one of the only companies that will support you and nurture you on your developmental goals.It is up to you to set those Goals and go for it. I just think that some stores do a better job than others.
good,Good work-life balance. Only a handful of people are at the office before 8am and after 5pm. Strong leadership in finance department. Enjoyable campus.
good,Finance department has strong leadership team. Plenty of opportunity for lateral rotations. Does not offer much structured training. Excellent work-life balance in my experience.
good,"You have somewhat hard work, overall is very fun and an easy place to work. Managers are great, most people are great, great point system, great bonuses every month."
good,"Work was pretty good at Lowes, a typical day would be considered laid back/ to very hectic. It was my first job but i loved it. I learned lots and my job kept me on my feet. The hardest part of the job is dealing with stuff I haven't quite learned. Overall good job."
good,"I have worked for Lowes in 2 different stores, in 2 different states, they have both been excellent experiences. I would gladly refer anyone looking for a good paying job with great benefits to Lowes."
good,"Días de trabajo en equipo."
good,Overall this is a great part time job or full time job if you aspire to advance in management.  I found managers let you do your job with minimal supervision.
good,Lowes is one of the best organization that I have worked for.  The management was fair and were very well trained. They had a well balanced staff and was very fair in there promotion selections.
good,had a couple run ins with sound interesting poeple that I have worked with. The work place is super cookie cutter. expect them to keep you right at your hours no overtime.
good,"I'm not going to lie the job can be stressful sometimes just like any other job. The load puller job itself is really easy basically you just pull orders for delivery for the next couple of days, if there's any problems email the department that the order applies too for help. It not complicated."
good,Worked the lumber aisle and was my first job. It was not bad but a little slow due to being a new store.  I had to drive a hour so that was tough due to the lack of hours. Left job to do construction.
good,i enjoyed working there.... people were nice staff was awesome  was a nice place to work... easy and well put together place....  would work there again

good,I was only working 6 months for Lowes when I was promoted to team lead. I actually really enjoyed working for Lowes. I would work there again if given the chance.

good,"My day consisted of various tasks, from cashiering in different departments, stocking products, answering questions or directions to find products for customers.  Hardest part was being able to keep everyone happy.  Communication within the departments was a bit rough, but overall i loved working there.  Making people happy by helping them was always a plus."
good,"This company was a fast paced work environment, management was supportive. Lack in training exercises, does not offer ample time to complete training exercises, due to work load to complete."
good,Its a good job and very teachable for all ages. I have learned respect for every individual.  I really enjoy the very friendly atmosphere.  I love shopping there.
good,"A typical day at work as follows is setting up the department for the day, inventory, helping/assisting with customers project needs. My mangers are pretty awesome, anything that I need or any issues that I have it is taken care of."

good,Learned many areas of the home improvement field.  Worked  very closely with customers to make sure their dreams were achieved  Worked closely with contractors and installers..
good,the hardest part of the job was finding support and training for my particular position. it seemed as though no one could guide or advise me about the expectations
good,Lots of Customer interaction. I was a Customer Service/ Returns Cashier. I really enjoyed my job and working with all the people. Management was easy going and easy to work for. Must be able to deal with the public.
good,"I worked for Lowe's in many areas of the store, and was well respected for my work by my supervisors.  I was in high demand because of my work ethic. Unfortunately, upon moving back to VA I was unable to get work with Lowe's in close proximity to my home."
good,"favourable work hours, weekends off."
good,Helping customers find product and assisting with any other needs that they have. Assisting with order product that we do not have in the store. Money handling in terms of the register and confirming how much product costs.
good,as long as you are a hard worker and show your value you are treated well. I have enjoyed working there from day one. the environment is like a big family; not always perfect but always there for each other.
good,"Fun place to work, very fast pace. Management would make fun healthy competition. They are willing to work with your schedule. Salary is not that great for the job you do."
good,"The Lowes family is one great family to be apart of. The staff is very friendly and customer driven, management isn't afraid to get their hands dirty. They are willing to get on the sales floor and drive sales."
good,"Productive work environment"
good,"I liked working there, it was just the pay wasn't there. the salary they start the drivers at was a little low. and less than 30 hours a week was not a sustainable pay."

good,"A regular day can be easy or tiresome depending on How Many Customers are coming through."
good,Was brought in with a team to facilitate enterprise wide strategic planning effort. The concept was great and well run. I found that work with the VPs was rewarding and interesting..
good,"While being there, I feel that I did lose something when I quit. Though there were the times when I got to do things that I do not like, it was easy to get used to. Sometimes, you will have to expect some uncleaniness in some stores, but if you have the feeling to clean, you will be an asset to the store. They do not treat you as a number at the store-they give respect. Though they do not have a union and the starting pay is low, there is opportunities. Keep in mind they have a great break schedule, and they stand by their visions and values towards the company."
good,"fast paced work environment with friendly associates. Have to be able to multitask. Helping customers most enjoyable part of the day."

good,"Walking into an accepting my position at Lowe's Home Improvement, and never thought I'd enjoy it as much as I did. A staff or great, the customers were friendly and I really liked how the customer base stayed the same. A lot of the customers were doing big home projects so it would see them often."

good,"This was absolutely my most strenuous job, however it made the pay and work more rewarding. Being on my feet all day, I was all over the store helping customers and doing a lot of lifting. The store was quite understaffed, yet the coworkers were still so willing to help. It felt very satisfying to help a customer complete their Summer projects."
good,"One of the best jobs I've ever had. Great group of people. Worked in the garden center which I loved, being outside suited me. During the winter months I was ask to move inside and work in hardware and also in appliances during and employees maturity leave. Opportunities are endless with hard work."
good,depending on what managers are there depends on the whole stores work environment. stressed some times being there. more then likely thought i thought about going back
good,"As a Area manager I was able to travel to stores all over the state, walk stores and work with amazing people, helping management increase sales and profit. By reducing shrink and working on Sales plans. I also worked on creating a culture of safety within the store. "
good,"Basic retail store job. Some good managers and some bad. Pay was decent with yearly increases, and opportunities to learn and advance in other departments throughout the store."

good,Productive work place I was treated fairly and enjoyed my seasonal time there. I liked my boss. The hardest part of my job was the bags of mulch I threw  every day.
good,"Classic retail enviorment- preform customer service, as well as inventory and stocking.. it is always a great joy to be the person that solves customers through your knowlrdge and products."
good,"I'd easily recommend Lowe's to anyone who is determined and willing to apply themselves to learning new things about basic home repairs and construction. New employees will learn an overview on a lot of different areas such as; flooring, walls and windows, paint, gardening, outdoor tools and accessories."
good,it is a place where you can make it what you want.  work hard or just go with the flow and get board  I enjoyed the busy fast paced day at my store.  learned all the departments
good,A day of work would be a new learning experience everyday. Coworkers that had year of experience in there job titles would give countless of new ideas and information in all different fields.
good,"Started as a part time cashier. Moved to full time customer service (no raise), then I moved to Full time Head Cashier. Decent raise. I hope to soon be a Sales Specialist for Appliances. (BIG raise) As I moved up it became obviously more stressful but more than anything it seemed as if no one in the store actually cares about anyone else individually. Everyone is out to make their own jobs the easiest possible."
good,It was a fun place to work. I used it as a second job and it was great for that.  They work with you most of the time on your schedule.  Great group of people that I worked with.

good,I think Lowes was a good job I never had problems with any of the employees or the management there.The job was fair with the hours and I learned a lot from working at that job
good,"overall Lowes is a great company, most of the staff is friendly and kind towards customers and other associates ."
good,"As an employee you must be able to learn quickly, be willing to work nights, weekends and holidays. Must be flexible to work in areas that you may not have experience in. Training in forklift operation and licensed is a plus. Hardest part is the rotating schedule."
good,"Different attitudes of customers on a daily basis, had a medium family value with the co workers. Was very comfortable there, satisfied with all my daily jobs and worked to the best of my ability to accomplish them"
good,"•	Responsible for managing the lumber, building materials, millwork tools, hardware, inside season, outside season, flooring and plumbing departments."

good,"I would go into work, count large sums of money, open up the store. Place the register in the drawers. I would begin my day with a smile, greet customers and sale sale sale. I love my job at Lowe's."
good,Lowe's want their employees to work and feel safe at work. The hardest part of the job is the heat. So be mindful to drink water throughout the day. Employees learn how to operate different equipment for their job duties.
good,Loved working here! Great place to start working and great place to learn customer service. Great pay and hours. Would definitely work there again. Happy place
good,I had access to a lot of training and career development. Wish I didn't have to leave Lowe's but I have to relocate as soon as possible. Been with the company for 11 years and they have always treated me fairly.
good,Very  nice quick pace employer with great benefits and pay. Flexible schedules and on the job training. Meet great people along the way and great customers.
good,We need better manager that would hold people accountable and to many employees that complain about everything. This is me come to work an learn everything about your job and other area in the store it may not pay off on that job but it will somewhere in life always do the right thing .
good,Easy going work atmosphere at the store. Was able to work in multiple areas of store. This allowed to learn more about various departments to be more valuable to customers.

good,I really do like working at Lowe's. I used to love working there but management is now structured differently. In my opinion the store is now run ineffectively which cause more grief for the employees.

good,I loved working here. the staff was sensational and I enjoyed helping patients . I would recommend this job to everyone . this hospital cares about the patients.
good,A typical day starts with clocking in and checking the manifest on how many items are on the truck so that you will know how many palletes are needed.
good,"Lowes is a great job for self improvement and gives chances for advancement if you put in the work for it. In delivery aspect, some days will be long hours, while others may be cut short. Average is usually about 42 hours a week with hourly pay. Benefits are decent, but kind of pricey. Overall, Lowes is a great step from other retail jobs and can help you get where you want to go in your career."
good,"I enjoyed working for them, and I would work for lowes company again. I met really nice people/ coworkers. There was some things I wasn't happy about with the store I worked for."
good,The head cashier was about making  the schedules running the shifts. Doing deposit making sure that the employee have breaks on in time. Also making sure that the employee's make sure that the customer aren't steeling
good,It was a good place to work. Moved up several times while I was there. The hardest part of the job was wanting to get more done than time allowed. And that not all customers and employees were treated the same by all. I loved working with all employees and customers.
good,It was an exciting place to work because everyday I got to meet customers from all walks of life; had the best management team ever; they truly demonstrated (the open door policy) and were accessible to their employees.
good,"Good work environment. Good food, management, kids workshop. They work to give you good hours and work with you if you need anything. Willing to help out and understand"

good,"Lowe's is a good place to work, they offer good benefits, good training, but not very good advancement options. I would definitely recommend other people to work for them."
good,I work at Lowes 20 years  The company has great opportunities and benefits.  I had many achievements during my time as a store manager.  There is great opportunity for advancement.

good,"Ran cash register, assisted customers in locating product/ departments."

good,I like my job for the most part. But I am finding out how messy the management team can be.  The work schedule is what it is.  You have a corporate rotation.  Some people work more that others.
good,"Treats everyone fairly."
good,"Lowe""s was and is a great place to work. They take care of the their"
good,Lowes is my dream job. I wish that I could have stayed but was only hired part time and they dropped my hours to low to survive. If not for that I loved the people and that sense of family was wonderful.
good,Most everyone is nice there and enjoyed working with every one. It keeps you busy most of the time. You can work different jobs. They post for employees to apply so they can move up if they choose
good,"typical day at work is staying outside in the heat all day, loading heavy wet bags of mulch, and smashing fingers in-between pavers. management is fair, he's pretty relaxed, culture is fun."
good,Lowes is a good company to work for but hard to move up the ladder.  Lowes is a large company with many great idea and offers the staff courses to take to continue their learning and in hopes of moving up with in the company.
good,Very productive job. Good pay.  There is a lot a heavy lifting and you have to be quick to make percentage. You won't get bored in this job but tired for sure.

good,Lowe's is a great place to work. The benefits are good and they treat their employees well. Employees are trained well and are encouraged to train in other areas in order to advance with the company.

good,"Lowe's over all if good place to work, offer really nice benefits for the ones who really need them. "
good,"Well Balanced Work Culture-"
good,"lowes was ok, help costumers, pull orders and load trucks using forklift, the management was pretty bad. they lack communication and appropriate staffing to do the job"
good,I enjoyed this one the most the picking up appliances and installing them all over Philadelphia was fun. i liked to meet new customers and learn the new appliances that lowes had to offer inside and out. the days were longer than expected but the new faces and smiles were worth it
good,"It was a decent place to work, some deliveries were not ready when they needed to be delivered.  Some Contractors would want their delivery the same day even without regard to others who were on the schedule first."
good,"Very fun place to work. I was a college student while I worked there and it was a great part time job. They did not accommodate my school schedule very well, but that was the only issue."
good,Nice place to work. Some customers were nice and some of the workers were nice. Others were rude and not so nice. Managments was really nice and helped a lot.
good,Overall working at lowes has been a positive experience.When they changed the workforce structure we had a lot of disgruntel employees.People felt like there work load doubled.
good,"The job itself always leaves a new day literally a new day."
good,Being organized and friendly is key.  Don't try to be perfect and help everyone because it can cause problems with your work day.  Every store is different in managers and customer base.
good,"Lowe's is an ok job, however they are constantly cutting positions, especially department manager and corporate positions. Job responsibilities are maximized, however the work days go by very fast."
good,"Nice friendly place to work. Good start pay, they help when needed, good benefits. You can move up fast if you would like to. Management is very helpful and understanding."
good,My review for Lowe's is the same review I did for the outside Lawn and Garden Associate. Lowe's is a fair and driven company to become better and better each day they open thier doors.
good,lowes is a fast paces company that anyone can grow and learn in if they apply themselves. lowes has great people to work never dull. lowes is a place where  you can make great place to make friends that can be like a family. people you will keep in touch with for yeas to come.
good,Overall Lowe's is enjoyable to work for. The management is very friendly and willing to help employees out. The work itself is very fast paced and based on moving as much product as possible but as safely as possible.
good,Fun and productive workplace and environment. Employees were kind to one another. Overall i had a really good experience working at this location even if it was just seasonal/
good,Overall a great company but managements need better training in order to bring out the best in their employees. Need to make their employees feel more valuable working there.
good,I had a great time working for lowes. The employees were nice. Store was clean an organized. The overall atmosphere was great. I always had a great time working.
good,I enjoyed being an assembler at Lowe's I liked training other people to help them become at their job FORKLIFT OPERATOR TOOLS LUMBER THE PEOPLE WERE FRIENDLY
good,"On the days I worked I would walking into work and immediately would check to see if the days delivery was pulled from stock. If not i would work the fork lift, if needed, to get it ready for loading. I would load up into the truck with the Driver of the day and begin the drive to the customer's house. once at destination we would unload and bring it into the customer's home. on occasion we would also bring out the old equipment from their home and also do installs. if deliveries were done before my time to get off was done i would help in the garden section and help with display."
good,My job was hard at times but the people I worked with made the day go by smooth. My managers were awesome and I felt like the hard work I did do was noticed. Helping customers was great and rewarding.
good,Great management and co workers. Getting to know the regular customers made the job very enjoyable. I would recommend friends and family to work at Lowes.
good,"Lowe's is an excellent company. Fair pay, good benefits, and good opportunities to grow within the company. If you want to relocate, they have plenty of locations to allow the ability to move with the company."
good,En este trabajo aprendí muchas cosas .....como manejar diferentes tipos de forklis
good,"Lowe's believes in creating a tight-knit family of employees.  Work is fast-paced, and there are a lot of demands placed on workers, but the concept of family encourages you to help your neighbor...because we are in this together, and we all need help sometimes.  I learned that you can rely on coworkers like family, in and out of the store.  I learned how to let a bad customer not destroy my day.  Management structure is changing and everyone is picking up extra duties; the transition has been choppy.  The hardest part of the job is letting go and not staying to help for just one more project, thereby going over on hours.  The most enjoyable part is walking into work and hearing your friends yell out your name in joyful greeting (even on a busy Saturday).  It makes for a good start to a long day."
good,Friendly work environment.Enjoy helping customers and learning about home improvement.Hard to restock because of volume of customers that visit this location.
good,"If you like working in retail, Lowe's isn't the most horrible of places to work. You basically have two types of customers: those that need a quick fix, or those that want to spend lots of money. There really isn't an in between. Other than that, the culture really depends on what store you end up working in, so before applying, I suggest walking around the store. If there are happy employees, go ahead and apply. If the employees are on edge, run!"
good,"okay so at lowes they want to give everyone a chance to cross train I was trained on everything in the store."
good,"Help Customers shop for Kitchen Appliances"
good,Lowe's is a great company to work. The people I work with make the job a complete joy. Since the restructure a few months ago the stress level for all the new support manager positions has increased. Days are usually long and full of obstacles that go unnoticed by upper management.
good,not a bad place to work. I wasn't there for very long because I needed fulltime work. I was told I could go back anytime I needed to. liked it there alot
good,friendly and fast paced. I like working here. The staff is wonderful and the perks are pretty great too. the only thing I don't like is that I work PT and still get over 20 hours a week.
good,good place to work lots of hours lots of o.t. learned a lot in using different power equipment to load and off load my truck great starter company when getting youre cdl
good,"I enjoyed working there, enjoyed working with the public. They provided their employees with good benefits and was helpful when any employee needed help"
good,I liked working for Lowe's I was able to move up in position and got regular raises. I was able to learn a lot about paint and plumbing and the inner works of a big corporation. The other employees were always fun to work with and i was able to transfer to another state if I wanted to.
good,"The employees are all nice people, the hours are flexible, earned vacation, opportunity to move up within the company.  FMLA is offered and good health care coverage"
good,Was a pretty good work environment. Didnt have any issues until the end. The manager that i had issues with was finally fired and is no longer working with lowes.
good,Good company to work for. I previously worked in the store years ago. Coming to the corporate side was a bit different I thought they would be more organized and more efficient as a fortune 500 company but i was very surprised. They didn't really have their stuff together like I thought they would they played it by ear a lot. Also it is a sink or swim type of job.
good,"It was a great job. Most days were fast paced and busy, with new things to do and new faces to serve. Was a lot of fun, fellow co-workers were easy to get a long with and made the day enjoyable."
good,"clean environment fast past service a must , have to be available weekends nights holidays,  must past a back ground check, have to be able to stand long periods"
good,"This place was awesome with great benefits. They start you out asset a resent wage and then give you a dollar raise every year. Decent Pto, get your schedule a couple weeks in advance, even part time employees can get health benefits. This place is almost always busy, so it keeps you moving."
good,"Lowes is a great company to be employed in fact one of the best retail stores. I've been employed since January 2001 with no regrets of wasting time working for the company, truly a memorable experience!"
good,"Work was very challenging and very very under staffed, when fully staffed it's a good job with good pay. They have gone through lots of changes recently that are severely affecting the morale of employees."
good,its an good place to work if your going to school or want another job they start at 10 an hr its just like any job in customer service its the company also has great benefits
good,"I worked at Lowe's on two different occasions.  I was a department manager responsible for scheduling of employees, financial reports and ordering and stocking merchandise."
good,very good company to work for that promotes team and individual growth.  team and family atmosphere that is very contagious.  very customer oriented place.
good,excellent company to work for.. Very good entry level for a first time delivery driver. Many  areas for advancement.  Provides  A GOOD WORKING  surrounding.
good,"Good Job, Was There Over A Year. To Big Of A Store. I Work Better In A Smaller Store Environment, Over All It Was A Great Experience For Me. Just Didn't Seem Like The Right Fit For Me."
good,Very Good company to work for.  Enjoyed job in helping all the customers worked well with others. Liked to learn to use all the equipment . Was not for being in trouble for personal reasons would still be there.
good,i enjoyed my time at lowes but unfortunately there was no  room for growth and advancement  with in the company and  you feel very stuck in your  position
good,I enjoy working here. I am a seasonal part-time employee and am hoping to obtain full time employment with the company. The hardest adjustment for me has been having to work two jobs and adjust to my work schedule.
good,"Customer focused atmosphere, with sale driven environment. The company is evolving, which has caused for structure changes. The new leadership structure is causing some expected disruption. Lowe's is working towards becoming a home improvement destination for its employers. The company is invested in employee engagement and safe working conditions."
good,It was a busty store to work at did not have set hours . benefits weren't bad. wanted a normal hour job. liked the people that worked there customers were fun.
good,Has a friendly staff. Is a clean and safe working environment. It providers descent benefits such as discounts and health insurance. It has different work schedules.
good,Got included seamlessly into the process and its been smooth sailing ever since. Work days fly by and i can genuinely say i dont mind working here at all
good,"I held various positions at Lowe's.  I always tried to do my best in each position.   There  was always plenty to do in any department and I kept myself busy, whether it was with customers or daily duties with the department.  I enjoyed both the customers and group of employees i worked with."
good,This is great company to work for decent pay and benefits. Would definitely recommend this company to anyone who wants to work and learn about home improvement.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Lowe's. I had really great co-workers and decent managers. The pay was really good, and if you went to management and ask for time off, you can usually get it off pretty easy. I like to volunteer at a couple different outreaches and I had help managers will really good about letting me have time off to do so. They also gave you decent break time. Really put your heart into it, people would notice and compliment you for your work. Overtime, team spirit really built in my department."
good,"I look back fondly at my time with Lowe's, but wish they could still afford me. I hit my financial ceiling pretty early as a customer service associate. Management can vary by store, but my manager is one of my favorite people to have met. This is a great place to work if you're in college or retired. They couldn't match my salary request once I graduated."
good,I would have continued to work at Lowes if I was not offered an opportunity to improve my position and for my personal growth.  Great company and great work environment.
good,Nice place to work. The people were friendly and the pay was decent for my position. I worked as a cashier and overall enjoyed my job. I recommend this position.
good,Lowe's is a good place to work. They take very good care of employees and are a family based company. They have great benefits. Enjoyed my family at Lowes. Hard work but I enjoyed and looked forward to the final results.
good,Lowe's was an excellent place to work until the underwent a stor-wide management reorganization and the existing (excellent!) store manager relocated. The store swiftly went on a downward spiral and new manager seemed overwhelmed and ineffective.
good,Everything about my job was great the people the environment the lack of drama. I enjoyed coming to work every day never really dreaded it. The breaks where wll planned for my type of work. Over all it was a good experience
good,Lowe's is one of the best companies to work for as per my experience. Received bonuses and pay increase semi annually. The Management is top quality for sure. Any one whom has the chance to work here would be wise to do so.
good,"A typical day consisted of driving a forklift to stock lumber on the steel racks and unload lumber trailers. It was a fun place to work at, but they were highly strict on everything. Just ask me if you want to know more."
good,"My position with this company was very very high paced and demanding, which was one of the most enjoyable parts of this job. The hardest part was that I was the only person in that position."
good,I really enjoyed my time there as a part time employee. The managers at my store were great people who really wanted to help anyway they could. It was understood that when everyone is happy and helping then the store overall is what benefited.
good,"Lowes give you knowledge about everything that consists of that deals with creation, innovation , and building. The friends you make while working are great, along with meeting new customers and help bring their creativity to life."
good,"Buena empresa para laborar, con buenos servicios para el trabajador, pero hay mucha rotación de personal y eso afecta el trabajó en equipó y estabilidad en el área."
good,"I mostly enjoyed my time employed at Lowe's.  Great people, great team environment.  I worked on the over-night stock crew and anytime someone got done with their stock from their designated location they would always go help any other member from the crew that was in the proverbial crew."
good,"Lowes varies by mileage, but as a seasonal employee at the Battleground Greensboro, NC store I had a great experience. The managers are pretty chill, and the work-culture encourages working together and helping one another. "
good,Lowe's Home Improvement was a great place to work at. The business has grown and it's very professional in all settings. The capability and resources that Lowe's has is fantastic and useful. People are Lowe's are knowledge and hard working
good,Lowe's Home Improvement was an awesome experience for me. From helping customers to stocking shelves. The family like community was a breath of fresh air compared to other places of employment. There was continuous support from management. They seemed to actively seek out those wanting to move up in the company and try to motivate those who seemed less enthusiastic about their job.
good,It was through Spherion that I was able to find employment with Archway Marketing.  If it had not been for them I would not have been hired full time.
good,"Some days were rough but most jobs are like that, very nice place to work if you don't mind getting dirty. Depending on what department you worked in, the physical requirement is high."
good,"loved it, fun work environment. Liked working close to home. Met some amazing people there. Management was great, very good leaders during and outside of work."
good,"Lowe's is relatively a good place to work. Management is helpful, you just never have much job security. Customers that you interact with can be difficult but overall most are very nice. The most enjoyable part of the jobs are the people you work with.  Lowe's provides a safe and fun environment to work in."
good,"Being Hired for a seasonal position is a little scary. But they worked with me in all aspects.  I will return if I cannot find work for the schooling I just completed."
good,"Worked there until I graduated college, positive work environment."
good,"Learn a lot about home employment, building materials, management, and sales. Lowes is a great company to build a career if you are driven and want to make you way to the top of the ladder in a company."
good,Good place to work threw school but management makes many promises they cannot follow back up. Mostly finger pointing and escape goating. Pays well though.
good,The job isn't the most fun kind of job. The employees that work there make the job 10x more fun and enjoyable. But management is very picky about everything!
good,There is no typical day Lowe's. You never know what you are going to expect that certain day. Management was alright until there was a big layoff. The hardest part of the day is trying to keep everything calm and keep moving forward through a busy day. The most important thing that I have learned is having patience.It is a key factor at Lowe's. The most enjoyable part of working at Lowe's is making memories with the people you work with.
good,"Days went by exceptionally fast due to the task being never ending, simple days mixed with great customer communication. Worked as a cashier and a loader so it was easy to find more work."
good,"The benefits at Lowes is unmatched, their stock options and discounts were extremely lucrative. They are a fast paced work environment but do pay extra to the hardest workers."
good,"Customer focus is the main goal. If one is given a task, one must be aware of the customers in the area and be ready to stop what is being done and help the customer. Hardest part is having to cover several departments due to call ins. on the bright side time goes by faster if one works with those that are willing to help."
good,"Great company to work for, however you must wait 6 months  for insurance.  Must be able to adapt well with weather conditions,Motto is work hard, play hard."
good,I think that the Managers and the employee's under should come to an understand no matter what is going on. They have great benefits and the pay is good. They have get together for the employees.
good,"Only complaint is a lack of advancement opportunities, and a few poor managers over time. Friendly atmosphere and coworkers, good teamwork promoted. Can be excessively busy at times and schedules might not have departments properly staffed"
good,"Honestly, I must say I enjoyed working here. There were some ups and downs at this workplace but what workplace doesn't have there ups and downs. I enjoyed the work environment. It was a great experience. I didn't always feel accepted like I was a part of the crew but I knew that by doing my part, I would help others to excel. I believe that having a selfless attitude about every situation, nook and cranny, will help you to see the positives more than the negatives. I no longer work there, but to say this place wasn't worth working there it was. Now, I must progress elsewhere but I will see this work experience as a stepping stone instead of a stumbling block."
good,It was a good fun work place good boss good benefits good pay the only negative thing was that I got hurt and there is no time to heal so they had to let me go.
good,Always something new to do at any given day. Dealing with customers non stop. Helping them find what they need and also resolving any issues at hand. Store has come to be a giant family.
good,Satisfying work and always hard work to be done all day. Kept busy made the day go by faster. Co-workers where always friendly and hardworking as well so it made the job easier.
good,A typical work day consists of answering phones and customers request. I've learned what each department contains. The management is really laid back and understand. The culture is extremely friendly. The hardest part was knowing all the right screens and the most enjoyable part is helping people.
good,"I've worked here for three years as a cashier. It's been great for the most part, and the people can be really friendly, however sometimes things can get out of control, and the managers can forget a lunch or two, especially when things are hectic. It may also be hard to find people to load heavy stuff into a customer's car while you're working the register, and if you have no loader, you'll often be pushing carts for the better part of the day. Other than that though, it's great!"
good,I only worked at lowes part time but enjoyed it as a college job. the management was very accommodating working around schedules for a full time student.
good,"Good work experience, hard workers, accommodating management, good benefits, problems solved quickly, fast and efficient customer service, clean environment."
good,You bond with co workers as well with customers. Achieve the goals and the whole team gets rewarded. When customers interact with you a personal level it feels like they are part of your family.
good,I thought it was a very relaxing place to work cause of the people who worked there and everyone who came into the store. But I would say some customers where very rude but I handled that stressful situation easily.
good,great place to work. Good benefits. Good hours to work. I would recommend to anyone to try to get hired at this place. Great pay.  I really dont have to much to say.
good,"Great place to work with right management, benefits are good,HR was awesome.steady work schedule, multiple job opportunities in different departments  ,great for young energetic ppl."
good,Great place to work and the store as a whole works well together. The work days can be fast depending on which part you work in. Over all Lowes gave me quality experience in customer service.
good,"Lowes is a great place to work for, but the staff is what made it so much better. I recommend this job to anybody looking for their first job. Be prepare to service customers."
good,"I enjoyed working at lowes part time because I like being around people. I love to do my own home improvements so the discounts were wonderful, and I was able to stay fit"
good,Lowe's is a productive work environment that allows many opportunities for learning advancement with friendly employees willing to provide assistance.
good,"fast paced."
good,"It is sometimes a hard place to work at, as the customers are rude and are impatient. Down stocking is a regular and nightly. Although sometimes the co-workers that close don't down stock and leave it for the opening associate. My managers are all pretty approachable and understanding and work with my schedule as I study. The hardest part of my job is that there is no enough coverage when one goes to lunch or break. One thing I've noticed is that this place burns out their good employees and leaves them hanging, as the good employees pick up the slacks of those who do not work as hard or just there to get a check."
good,"Lowes is a great place to work."
good,"Full shifts are typically 9 hours long when you include the 1 hour lunch break, and two paid 15 minute breaks. The work environment is mostly pretty relaxed. The company is definitely  focused on customer service. I was able to learn a lot about home improvement there as well as customer service and how to work with others. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I got to work with. After working there I became a loyal customer and sometimes still go back to the store I worked at to say hey to the people I used to work with."
good,its an awesome company to work for. I work with a lot of unique people who I will never forget. the company treats you like your part of a family. I learned a lot from this company.
good,"I worked there during college for a part time job. I learned alot during my time at Lowes, I worked very hard as well. There is a lot expected of you for what the pay is."
good,Great place to work and start your career at. Good way to boost up your resume and good to know what you can go for as a degree in college. This place will have everything to start your career
good,"i worked lawn and garden and although it was hot outside it was a fun and great job. helping customers with fences, mulch, stones and plants while operating a forklift iswhat is expected of you from day to day."
good,Hectic but its defineltey a decent place to work great pay benefits could be better roome for advancement but limited ob security ....................
good,It is a fun company to work for. Some management is great and others are not which is to be expected. Compensation is slowly being taken away. You're sometimes forced to do other peoples work.
good,As any retail business we are always looking to be the leading edge in our retail segment.  Lowe's continues to focus on how helping individuals love where they live.
good,"Working at this place it was a exciting Every day was different it was a challenge with customer special orders, vendors ,delivery drivers.If i had the opportunity i will go back to company."
good,"This was my first job, so it was a new and exciting experience for me. A typical day at work involved helping customers, watering plants, making sure the department I worked looked appealing. I also stocked and organized other departments. Working at Lowes taught me valuable customer service skills, it increased my communication skills. I gained knowledge about plants, now I am able to identify names of plants just by looking at it. I also learned facts about other departments. For example, seasonal, electrical, and plumbing. The workplace culture is wonderful, I met many coworkers that have impacted my life in a positive way. We always tried to maintain a positive atmosphere as we worked. We were a team after all. My job at Lowes was actually pretty easy. I believe many people wouldn't mind getting paid to water plants and help customers. The most enjoyable part of the job would probably have to be learning something new everyday."
good,"Great company, not really a lot of room for advancement due to company restructure. As far as benefits are concerned they have Medical, Vision and dental for you and dependents. They also provide a great flex pay account in which throughout the year you put in a certain amount for card that is used somewhat like a debit card, It can be used for Doctor visits or even balances for glasses. "
good,"I meet a lot of different people which I enjoy. There is a lot of paper that comes with job. Answering phones. Everything that comes into the store has to come through me, so I have to make sure I'm entering the right numbers with the product. The hardest part of my job is getting management to help when I have an issue. What I enjoy most are the hours and I can work alone and with others"
good,There is always work to be done and the employees help each other out all the time. The managers were great. The hours were good and so was the pay. Loved working there full time.
good,"Good place to work. "
good,"Good environment, Company that wants you to Love Where You Live and Where You Work. Lots of different opportunities for advancement. Good benefits, decent pay. Variety of different schedules available."
good,Company will always do well due to the structure. However the 7 days a week availability is rough. Things would be better if they paid a salary differential depending on shifts.
good,Worked as a stocker for one summer. Good pay and a friendly atmosphere made this a decent summer job. Short hours and strange times made it hard to schedule around
good,I enjoyed working at Lowes in inside garden. I helped people select the right lawn and garden equipment to meet their needs. To me I really liked this part.
good,I enjoyed working for Lowe's Home Improvement. I liked being able to help customers find what the needed for their home improvement projects. The only reason I left is I needed work closer to home and I was unable to transfer with Lowes.
good,A great company to work for.  Always busy and team work is apparent for this companies success. Lowes of Morehaed City is a wonderful place to work.  The associates really have a sense of family.
good,"I enjoyed taking care of customers needs. I enjoyed taking care of goals and making the company grow. The team work together was great, and we looked out for all safety rules."
good,"Short staffed often,work load on customer service can be a lot. Good people who work there, but some of the good workers get over looked. lowes is changing for the future."
good,"I enjoyed working here.  I got to see how the ""competition"" of Home Depot operates and the work experience that was gained from this place was invaluable."
good,I really enjoyed working for Lowes. I loved working with the employees. Management does need a lot of work. The hardest part was keeping up the fast pace.
good,I have learned much from working at Lowe's Home Improvement.The company has enriched my managerial skills and has supported my education as long as it did not interfere with my working schedule.
good,A typical day at Lowe's had many ups and downs depending on the rush of customers. Some days you would feel like you didn't stop while others you would be searching for stuff to do out of boredom. Where I worked in Lowes had friendly and fun people to work with and really helpful management.
good,"Great company to work for.  A lot of shift work and so was ready to advance in my career and have better opportunity for home balance.  Very fast paced, and a lot of reporting was learned.  The company should do a better job with upgrading all systems so that Microsoft office interface is accessible, and easy to use."
good,"I loved working at Lowes, I worked in a lot of different  departments, wihich I liked versitality, friendly people as customers coming in and also co-workers"
good,"The best part of my job at Lowe's is, it's really awesome working with nature. Watering those pretty plants and flowers brings a relief. It's absolutely wonderful dealing with different customers."
good,"Sales Specialist/Team Lead"
good,Lowes is an okay company to work for. benefits are okay and I would probably work here again if I had the opportunity. I unloaded trucks and did customer service
good,Working at Lowes has a Relaxed atmosphere with a good management team. Connected to the community in a Military town gives a 10% discount to all Military.
good,I enjoyed working for lowes but their is a lot of favoritism that exist at that location. Also the hours were always switched so it's not good with a family of young children.
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work. I enjoyed my time with them. Unfortunately, I was one of the ones that were let go in the reorg. I worked in a good dept. but several people had issues with balancing their personal life with their work life due to the demanding times of the call center. I probably would not return to work there due to the uncertainty."
good,Everybody in the staff just needs to collectively work together . Corporate is so worried about the customers but they forget about their employees ..
good,Processing invoices and calling customer. Talking to a different vendors. this is what I really love about this job.  You can also earn bonuses for getting vendor to get in the Discount program.
good,Lowe's is a high paced action packed day full of great interactions with customers and associates who just want to make a difference in the community we live in.
good,"Great place to work hard, have fun and make money by providing legendary service and great prices at everyday low prices. They valued honesty, integrity and mutual respect for everyone."
good,Moved up very fast to management but stepped down to become an appliance specialist and was on pace to make 90k when they decided to take spiffs away from all employees. I would've loved to stay working there but I couldn't swallow a 45k paycut
good,Good comany where I learned many things related to Home Improvement. The Management  is also nice and always having helpiing attitude for employees. Work culture is always fine.
good,"I worked as a weekend team associate. I was to assist customers all around the store with no specific department of my own. The pay raises were great for a part-time job, started at $9.89 and when I left 2 years later I was at $11.??. We had holidays paid whether we worked or not, also had PTO."
good,"If you have open availability and work hard, Lowes is a great place to work.  The company has been going through a transformational change for the past 7 years.  The Retail landscape is EVER changing with is both a good and bad thing.  If you stay store side and within Sales, you could have a long career."
good,Good place to work for just to many changes happening fast. Worked there for 8 years. Management was welling to work with the needs I had to help my son with Autism.
good,I enjoyed working here but the position did not provide enough hours to have a living income. The management was wonderful and they sought to problem solve if needed. The position was fun and creative but be prepared to get into some form of shape if you are not used to working more physically.
good,It is simple. work hard and get rewarded. You need to have a strong work ethic and be able to problem solve on the spot in order to take care of customer and associate obstacles.
good,"Great people to work with,  awesome environment. Always worked as a team and made the best out of every situation. Very good managers always found a solution too any problems."
good,Usually a large number of works come in for morning shift and last up until 4-5pm. It was fun as time flew by really quick without most of us usually noticing. Learned some skills such as building and communicating as a team player. The hardest part about this job is that customers would request assistance despite not knowing anything about that department.
good,Amazing people work here. Every one of the coworkers that I have met has been extraordinarily nice. They work with you well and are a good company to work with.
good,"The other employees were very friendly and there was a comfortable, but focused workplace. Managers would constantly talk to employees and were hands-on."
good,"A lot of things to do here"

good,Spent 13 years with the company. it was great until they lost the culture. It seams like they are trying to get it back. I would recomend it to someone if they are looking to start a retail career.
good,"Overall my experience with the company was good, though more so toward the end of my time there, the management started cutting loads of employees and expecting the remaining employees to do 3 peoples worth of work."
good,"I liked working here nice people, great management. I unload trucks and put everything that comes out on the floor. The worst part of this job is if your the only one of your unload team to come in you have to work the truck by yourself. You may get some help, but not as much as you want."
good,I started as seasonal but with hard work I was hired on and moved to the paint department. It was a good place to work for and the pay rate for being a part time job is very well.
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work, management and the coworkers are very friendly, and make you feel welcome, The company brings in food when you work on the holiday which acknowledge that they appreciate you work on the holidays."
good,THe main reason for leaving was relocation for spouse's new job.  The one of the down falls of this company is that it will not allow transfers between stores and managers often had the ability to block people from moving to another store.

good,Over night crew came in the store at 245 am to unload the truck from the previous night and stock the shelves with the heavy equipment before the store opened. otherwise we would have to block off the isle due to possible hazards
good,"Great company, great benefits and always evolving. Fast paced environment with plenty of training opportunities. Close knit but welcoming store associates."
good,"The average day is good. Perfect pace, but the day can drag on if you slow down. Management is good at keeping you busy, to help the day go on a little quicker. Weekends during the Spring and Summer are the most hectic, but the day blows by like it's nothing."
good,"This work experience was very different. I learned more about myself while on this job. There were a few challenges while working with individuals from very different walks of life, but none the less, there was growth."

good,"I learned how to set up a store from just outside walls to putting in shelves, unloading the trucks, putting up inner walls and general set up to get the store ready to open to the public. I also learned how to do warranty tasks. I worked the returns desk and really liked helping customers to figure out what they had purchased and what the didn't need or really did need."
good,Good place to work to balance life and work with 4 day work weeks or just 3 day work on the weekends. heavy lilting can be hard but not a bad place. not bad

good,Everyone within the work place was extremely helpful and had knowledge in many areas. They offer seasonal positions for those who have other obligations such as college.

good,Great company to work for!  They are willing to invest in their people through training and development.  Their values and purpose are focused to aligned with both customers and employees.
good,"I work in a Distribution Center for Lowe's.  I like my job and the company seems to really care about their employees.  The culture,at least locally, pays lip service to safety, but so far, has stressed performance far more than safety in what they hold people accountable for.  Funny thing is, when we are our safest is when we have our best days performance-wise."
good,"Lowes has a good benefits and a friendly culture. There is room for advancement at lower levels, such as hourly sales associates, but not much upward mobility in senior management. Pay is consistent with retail, low."
good,lowes is  good place to work with good benefits and a decent management team....you will learn many new skills and have opportunities to advance in to different positions

good,you have to stay busy at all times make sure you are doing the right thing and move at a good paste and the management is good and the most enjoyable part of the job being able to interact with the customers
good,"When I was a cashier at Lowe's I loved helping the customer find exactly what they needed for their homes. I loved the environment and most of all the people. The only thing i didn't like about that job was the other employees. Everyone seemed depressed and unhappy with their jobs. I just loved waking up everyday to come and help a customer. I felt useful. The greatest thing is when i had customers come back and say thank-you, the colors you helped me find made my daughter's room her favorite place in the world. Or when someone would come back and say thank-you the tile you picked out saved me a lot of money on my kitchen. If i didn't get bed rested while pregnant with my daughter i would have never left that job."
good,"In a typical day at work is busy, productive, and fun. I have learned many thing about the different departments in this store such as plumbing, electrical, lumber, and many more. The co-workers is what really makes working here fun."
good,"Goodyear just underwent a re-structuring and I cannot speak on that, however during my tenure I went from a Seasonal CSA to Department manager very quickly. Senior store management rarely changes, so if that's a goal you best have ALOT of prior experience. "
good,"Its a good place to work overall. Everyone is nice, the dress code is pretty laid back. They try to make it fun and interesting. They also make it pretty easy to advance."
good,The culture at the Lowe's corporate office is ever changing and evolving to fit the current customer.Employees are constantly asked to do more with less and working 50 to 60 hours a week is normal and expected to succeed.Very exciting place to work since one learn a lot
good,"enjoyed working with customers, fast paced ,enjoyed selling home products.enjoyed working with local contractors also local business owners.large amount of co workers in one building"
good,"Woking for Lowe's Home Improvement is definiely one of the best jobs I've had so far although it still could use some improvement. The systems are out dated so they crash quite often, the exchange policy needs to be revised (Ex. Plants should not be returned, especially bought on clearance), better communication on the sales floor to the cashiers, and managers should be evaluated more often."
good,"Good place to work, similar to other big box hardware stores. Other employees were decent to work with. Management seems intelligent and connected to employees."

good,En la empresa siempre cada ciertos dias se hacian fiestas de aprecio para los trabajadores y asi todos podiamos convivir sin tener que preocuparnos por el trabajo.
good,"I have worked with Lowe's for almost 4 years now and I have never had such a greater experience with retail, that I have with Lowe's. Lowe's does not micro manage you like Walmart, etc. They give you the power to handle situations on your own. Whether, it be handling customers or projects Lowe's trusts you to get the job done right. Management is always there if you need them and they do offer sound advice. They respect your privacy and don't talk about you or others behind your back. They give you chance's to move up in the company and HR is willing to work with you to help any problems you may have. The only bad thing with their company is that they are restructuring the company right now and are demoting may senor staff which includes pay cuts. With in mind you make up your decisions."
good,They are the kind of company that promotes the kind of enjoyable and family mentality in the workplace. It is my belief that Lowe' is committed to taking care of its employees which in turn makes the employees want to take care of the customer and the company.
good,Staff gets along well with each other and with management.   Great place to work as you get to help a variety of people with their needs.   This is really fun when you have an understanding of the various products.

good,This is a great company to work for with opportunity to grow.  Great Benefits as well as friendly employees to work with.  Company also has an inside cafeteria and a coffee shop/
good,Lowe's Corporate Offices was a great place to work for the past 13yrs. The opportunities to work across various Departments and learn all areas of Retail are endless.  I started in Merchandising and was then promoted through to Logistics and then lateral moves to Store Planning Layout and Design.  I enjoyed working with Engineers and Architects to find the the most effective Store Layouts for our customers and helped to resolve any store setup issues in the field by our Project Managers.  My Project Management skills were honed working with several other departments to pull projects together on time and with the most efficient use of space available.  I trained new team members on Department Processes and guidelines frequently.  Management at Lowe's is excellent in that they want to help you succeed and are willing to invest heavily in your training and constant development.  The workplace culture at Lowe's was always very professional and inclusive.  The hardest part of my job was being able to provide world class customer to service to all clients while multi-tasking multiple projects across multiple timelines.  The most enjoyable part of the job was successfully completing projects and receiving positive feedback from our clients that we delivered a product that exceeded their expectations.
good,Working at Lowes was about Mastering Customer Service and learning what it takes to deliver great Customer Service Skills. Lowes also provide paid training for advancement.
good,This is a great job for kids that have just graduated high school and want some extra cash. The only thing is the pay is not that much if your looking for a lot of cash.
good,Unloaded trucks and enjoyed the work environment. Sometimes we have two trucks in one night and not enough people to unload but you do your best and that's all that is asked of you.
good,"Positive workplace environment. Managers do their best to work with you to improve your skill set, and work within your skill set while you continue to develop new skills."

good,"It was nice to not have management over your shoulder at every turn while working. The culture that lowes established was very fun, some times corny."
good,"I'm a cashier and I would say my job is pretty stress free. There are stressful times, but overall it is a laid back type of experience. "
good,Strict rules but in general the staffing is filled with a diverse set of people you get to work along with. Managers tend to break apart working in pairs and focus you to do individual work.
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for. They offer great benefits. They are heading up in the class of customer service with making sure each customer ""Love's where they Live"""
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowes, especially the customer interaction. Unfortunately it was only part-time and I was in needed full time employment. *******"

good,The environment was great and everyone got along really well. The managers were ok and some were understanding and great to work with. Overall it was a great place to work with some great people.
good,"Management could use more structure, but otherwise this is a great place to work. Lowe's offers very competitive wages and benefits to both full time and part time associates."
good,"Some stores are very stern and dictate you like a dog, where as others are more friendly and willing to work with you schedule; given that you go to school. It all depends which store. Working for Lowe's can be hit or miss but overall my experience has generally been positive."

good,"Putting up freight, cleaning/down stocking department, tending to customers, order management and completing paper work for installs."
good,"Worked the Hardware and Tools departments, helping customers with any of their home projects. Gave them advice as to which hardware and tools would best suit their needs."
good,"Identify staffing and projected sales levels for the day. Adjust as needed. "
good,"Firstly, I wouldn't characterize myself as a floor installer. More of a grunt, but I can install floors. What I learned most from working for Lowes is that it's all about patience with yourself and learning more as you go along, instead of diving head first and not being able to accomplish anything to the best degree you are capable of. "
good,"the hardest part of the job was learning all the codes for the lumber, the management was well organized and helpful"
good,It is retail and if you have ever worked retail you know what is going on. There are days where your main concern is customer service and Helping others.

good,"good company good benefits however I would have never totally "

good,"Diverse Team members"
good,"worked there trough college , loved the management team and the employees. Everyone was so friendly , as for cons there were very few , one of the pros is career advancement"
good,Lowes is a good company to work for they are just cutting back on full time employees. I have been employed with them for seven years and there is no chance for advancement.
good,enjoyed my time there and learned a great deal about customer service. had a lot of fun working with other associates and doing my job to the best of my ability.
good,Proactive Company.  Rotational retail schedule is expected to pursue advancement. Good pay for the industry. Pride in Customer Service is a must to work here!
good,"I enjoy speaking with my customers to discover their needs and guide them towards the best products for their projects. "

good,"Unfortunately, as a senior citizen I was assigned an absolutely inappropriate position, Outdoor Equipment Department ( lawn mowers, grills, snow blowers, and outdoor furniture) one of the heaviest and awkward to handle product area in the store."
good,Lack of communication between employees and supervisors. Everyone wasn't on one accord at this store. A lot of things we had to figure out on our own.
good,worked for company for 4yrs many changes and advancement. customer focused company which is a great thing sometimes forget the employees that help drive the business
good,Fun and entertaining because everyone has a different profession and everyone knows what is best in different situations. I would suggest for high school students.
good,"Lowes in a nutshell is a fairly decent company to work for at least in part that they have decent training, decent pay usually a little over current minimum wage, management that usually does care (depending on location of course), and hold decent events for their employees. I would recommend working for lowes as a decent starter and transition job while going to school"
good,The work culture was very engaging. Management would do little activities to keep up the momentum in the work place. They genuinely cared for the co-workers.
good,"Arrive in the morning, check delivery list to verify what will be delivered, make sure customers have been contacted and the deliveries have been pulled. In working here my knowledge of appliances and home improvement has increased. Management will listen to issues and concerns. The culture comfortable. The hardest part of the job is delivering large appliances on second and third floors. The thing I like best is helping others."
good,I enjoyed working for lowes. It tested communication with all kinds of people. Learned to always be positive and learn multitasking skills to help customers and keep department stocked at same time

good,I like to come in and say hi to all fellow co-workers. I ask them how they are doing. Management works well with you. Management has worked with me due to some unfortunate  events that have happened. I truely thanked them for working with me.
good,Personally i enjoyed my co-workers and advanced very quickly. It also had pay time off for even part-time employees. I had an over all good experience working here.
good,Haven't worked there yet. i will see when I get the job. I'm hoping this jobs is everything they say it is on the radio. I don't know the hardest part of the job yet.

good,All skills that are necessary to succeed and grow are taught to you. While some days are difficult there is a great sense of teamwork that will help you get through those difficult days.
good,Over all Lowe's was an enjoyable place to work. Very fast paced good pay and benefits. Most enjoyable part of the job was my immediate boss for most of my career and co-workers no matter what store I was working in. Hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers
good,"I would answer phone calls while helping the customers in the store. Being timed on internet orders and helping with installed sales. Learning to keep and safe and clean work environment. Learn to work individually and as a team, Working with a team that motivated me to be the best employee I could be. Help train employees to build their career and help them grow as indiviuals."
good,Working for this company is very interesting you learn new terms and just dealing with new people. They have a great staff too and that's another thing that makes this job easy.
good,Lowe's is wonderful to work for. I have great co-workers supervisors and customers. Every job has those days where you want to leave but here is great. I look forward to coming here even if it is only part time.
good,"Easy way to get learn real world practices, good people, hardest part is heavy lifting without machinery, good management throughout, clean stores are a plus"
good,Its a fun place to work where to if you need help the managers will actually help you. They also work around your schedule if you go to school or have a 2nd job
good,I enjoyed my time here. The pay was good and the hours were pretty consistent. Hour long breaks were really nice and lots of 15 minute breaks. All around cool place to work.
good,"Lowe's is a decent place to work, with lateral movement if desired, most stores have a family type culture.  I had a great department manager and zone manager, they where both positively engaged, they made we want to work for them. Only complaint I had was the random work schedule.  Full-time employees have a set routing scheduling but part-time employees fill gaps in the schedule, so it can be all over the place."
good,"The hardest part of the day is coming back from lunch trying to load trailers & keep up wit the lines. The management at lowes is pretty good, as long as your job get done no one will bother you"
good,Lowes is a great company to work for while going through college. It helped me pay my bills. It is a friendly working environment. Hard works pays off.

good,Very good company good people good pay did alot of charity work  with the hurricane Katrina relief efforts. Work here was very stressful and rewarding all in the same day. If I was able to work at this store again I wouldn't hesitate.
good,"Working for Lowe's is nice--when I am at work, i learn a lot. there is a lot of room for growth, and at my store in particular, we have a group  extremely motivating managers. They are big on teamwork but of course it is up to the employees to exemplify what it means to be a good team. The pay is pretty good starting off and so on. Of course you run into some common issues such as rude, impatient customers and etc, But overall it's a good place to work for."
good,"Return and payments, answered phone calls and transfer calls thur out the building. I leander patients and waiting, do i could help the customers better."
good,"Typicaly days were long as during my several years there they continually remaind understaffed. I ended ip covering several departments for the vast majority of my shift and was expected to do no less. Most of my coworkers were pleasent enjoyable and helpfull people, but theres always one rotten apple in the bunch, which never really bothered me. I learned how to opperate several styles of power equipment, like motorized palletjacks and forklifts, which are quite nessecary for wharehouse work. I enjoyed my time there but would be much happier moving on to something better."
good,"Lowes was a great place to work, the company invested a lot of time and money to improving the customer experience. Very good daily operational practices made it easy to accomplish daily goals."
good,"worked for lows food not lowes, wrong store not this location thank you . i can not comment on this place of buisness cause i never worked here they pulled the wrong store"
good,"Working for Lowes was never exceedingly stressful.  They were willing to help spread the work load if it was too much for one person, and the prevalence of all positions was evident.."
good,Some of the best co-workers I ever had. Employees were very friendly and easy to call team members. The store was greatly organized. The management team were highly supportive and offered assistance when needed.
good,It was great to get back into management and help fellow employees. I learned that I need to be positive at all times at a job. This is a good company and helped its employees.
good,"During my time at Lowes, I would report to work each day and be assigned to an area which required help. This would be motivated by stocking requirements, sales advertisements for the week, absent employees, etc.  There was a good working relationship between management and both full and part time employees which helped to provide a enjoyable work experience. The hardest part of my experience was knowing all the different products available, to insure the proper information was relayed to customers."
good,Love this place. Best first job to have. They were wonderful and great with their associates. I encourage people to work here. Its pretty fun too. Good benefits.
good,"i enjoyed working at Lowe""s great management team   they take good care of you great employees wonderful atmosphere  lots of customers to help great place to over all."
good,"A typical day of work would involve me reporting to our outside garden shop, straightening up our work area and loading heavy bags of soil, mulch and concrete decorations into the vehicles of customers. I learned what each type of soil and mulch is excellent for, how to locate sales items in our system, how to check if other stores have a sales item and how to prepare customer orders so that contractors can pick them up. The management was great and they really got themselves involved in our work if we really needed their help. My co-workers were excellent in their priorities and worked very well together as a team. The hardest part of the job would undoubtedly be when we had a very large sale on our soil or mulch and we would occasionally have to load anywhere from 5-25 40 lb bags into the vehicles of customers with little to no assistance. I truly enjoyed being outside and enjoying the fresh air, helping to water the plants while simultaneously helping customers."
good,"Changing Culture and friendly associates. Nice start pay for employees with great benefits. Great learning culture, easy to shop and find things in the store."
good,I worked in assembly and really don't have much to say because I never saw a lot of it being in the back of the building most of the time. this is a retain environment.
good,Had a great career with Lowes.  They were a great company to work for while there and are heading in a great direction.  Would recommend starting a long career with Lowes as I did for 16 years.
good,This is a great place to work with helpful managers. I love the fact that they have a set schedule . Although in my case I felt overwhelmed with so much going on.

good,"Good company. Good benefits. Good working environment. Sometimes a very high paced environment, with expectations of providing excellent customer service. The associates are great to work with. Standing or walking on cement floors is probably the hardest part of the job. But, you do get used to it. Helping customers is the best part."
good,I personally enjoyed working for Lowe's overall. Typical day was rather laid back and easy. I worked in various departments so I learned a lot about all different areas.
good,"Its a very nice and easy job , your unloading the merchindise off the trucks.. You also have to take the scan gun and scan the boxes that you pack on the pallet so the company can keep track of what's being shipped on and out"

good,"Well, I worked at Lowes Home Improvement back in 2014. I was part of the customer service team. I constantly helped people throughout the store with any thing needed."
good,"My typical day at Lowe's starts at 5am where I count every register's till to make sure there are no overages or shortages and then replenishing the drawer with the appropriate starting amount. I've learned very good customer service skills that I can apply to future jobs through the means of credit card applications, returns, phone orders, faxing of documents, handling a large amount of telephone calls, and more. The hardest part of the job is when problems arise that is beyond my point of help, but in comparison the most enjoyable part of the job is helping out the store by being a team player and making sure that every customer walks out with a smiling face."
good,"Lowe's has been a nice place to work for the last 10+ years. I've made a lot of friends and although each day presents it's own challenges, overall it's a pleasant place to work."

good,"I start my day by logging into the store computer to check any incoming purchase orders(P.O.s). I have both the phone numbers and emails of all my vendors so that I can make any necessary adjustments so that my garden doesn't get overwhelmed with too much of one product. On certain days, I have appointments with customers who have specific needs for the project that they are working. Other times I have to receive any shipments from the outside vendors. This process includes verifying all the product that is on the paperwork provided by the vendor, and ensuring that is accurately entered into the Lowe's computer system."
good,Lowes is a good place to be employed but just trying to see if there is anything that might be a little better schedule for my family. Lowes has awesome benefits and does take care of employees.
good,"I was very good and fast at installing carpet and I loved doing it, but the pay was in cash and the people at Lowes were not always ready for me to get the carpet so I had to do it myself."
good,I love interactions with people. Great place to work and build a strong career path. Awesome management team. Loved traveling and coming in contact with different kinds of people and personalities.

good,"Lowes as a company is purpose driven.Their purpose is to help people ""love where they live."" How do they do that? By helping their employees love where they live. Something that makes Lowes stand out among other companies is the culture and the atmosphere where I work. The work environment is warm, welcoming, and inviting. Managers and Senior leadership help cultivate creativity and collaboration by establishing an environment that is respectful, diverse, and characterized by it's integrtiy"

I've only been there for a 5-6 months and I like the people there and the environment. the management team works with you to help you improve as an associate I learned leadership skills, team work skills, and a few life skills in the past couple months while being at lowes."
good,"Lowe's keeps their employees busy with either customers or work lists. Both customers and the work lists are sometimes challenging, but at the end of the day you feel a sense of accomplishment. Lowe's taught me great customer service and how to work with a team. Other employees at Lowe's are willing to help other co-workers and customers. The hardest part is finding a balance between helping customers and completing your work list by the end of a shift, but is certainly doable. Personally, I love helping customers better their experience at Lowe's."
good,"Enjoyed work experience. People were nice to work for and I work my hardest everyday!  Great work environment, enjoyed assisting customers, being a team player."
good,"i liked it,  straight forward money was ok too.. the work life balance was good..just have to work on the weekend and the hours are difficult to work close then open etc"

good,"Its great to have as a first job, I recommend Lowe's as a career builder. Lets anyone become anything with the right training and communication. Community work is always a plus"
good,"The culture is good, the benefits surprisingly excellent.  An open and communicative air encourages a close working relationship with management and co-workers which, in many stores, fosters a sense of camaraderie unusual in big box stores.  "
good,So far in my life Lowes has been one of my better jobs. The company is pretty good to their people and you get a sense that everyone is willing to help each other.
good,"Very great company with welcoming enviroment, management was great and approachable. Would gladly work for them again."
good,"For an organized and detail oriented person such as myself, Lowes allowed me to prepare for further employment. I gained knowledge on not only the product within the store but valuable communication and computer skills. My co-workers were very helpful, cooperative and made  what would have been a very routine work experience very engaging."
good,I have never regretted working for Lowes. i have been treated very well and as a specialist im also paid very well. i would recommend Lowes to anyone looking for a good company.l
good,Lowes has been evolving over the years and has started to finally make sure its employees are their number one priority. Great benefits packages available for all levels of employment within the company. Need to invest more time into molding their people to be future leaders within the company.
good,"great people and nice place to work for. I unloaded trucks and stocked shelves when need, management is really great and easy to get along with. most enjoyable part is the people"
good,"Decent job, professional slow, simple tasks required. decent pay but not somewhere I would stay long term. Pretty flexible but seasonal job only. Looking for something that makes me think."
good,Have worked for Lowe's San Antonio for 18 months as a cashier.  I have a good part time schedule.  Coworkers are friendly.  Most head cashiers are good with employees and customers.  Lowe's management was very supportive when I had to be off for 3 months due to heart surgery.  Only complaint is chronic under-staffing in virtually all areas but that is not unusual in retail stores.  All in all a good place to work.
good,"Good Management, And very talented Team leads they help us a lot to do our work easier and confidently. Management is more care about employees and there welfare."
good,"Lowe's offers a lot of benefits and good pay, But doesn't have enough employees. You most likely will be over worked. They have good products and good deals when applying for a Lowe's credit card."
good,Could be more fair to their employees. Some people are left hanging whilst others are made to bust their tails for lackluster rewards for strenuous efforts.
good,Receive product from truck doors while driving a forklift. the management is ok there they will listen to your problems or ideas and do there best to fulfill them.the co-workers are great willing to help anyone new.the hardest part of the job is being in a truck thats over 100 degrees.the most enjoyable part of the job is the environment. also no one bothers you.
good,Overall a good place to work. I enjoyed meeting new people and seeing old friends in a new atmosphere outside my old career. I wished the temporary position had lasted longer . It ended approximately one month earlier from the date stated on the hiring contract.
good,Lowes is a great company to work for! Its a  fast paced work environment. the work is easy but you can easily get hurt if your not paying attention . your on your feet the whole shift but it goes by fast because of how much work your doing. great company and the pay is good.
good,"Productive workplace that strive to meet daily tasks and goals. The environment is encouraging. The management team is fair, honest, and seek ways to satisfy the customers."
good,"However getting more than 25 hours is impossible if you are part time. "
good,"A typical day at Lowes would be pretty smooth. I'd learn alot about where certain items are located, I'd also learn about paint, appliances and lumber. All of my managers are very professional, they care about the employees as equally as the customers. I get along with all of my coworkers, I often work well with others. I honestly don't feel like anything is difficult about my job, I am pretty satisfied with everything. The most enjoyable part of me working at Lowes is knowing that I helped a satisfied customer."
good,"Awesome place of employment. Okay pay, decent benefits. One thing they do at the distribution center which I like is the bonus. They have a performance bonus. How this works is if you can get 120% on you job performance for the month. You'll get a $1.50 bonus for the hours you worked that month. It turns into an extra $200 a month or so."
good,"Great teamwork environment, satisfaction in helping customers complete projects. Trusted to make own schedule for department, inventory control, and satisfying customer issues."
good,Lowes I's a great company to work for. I delivered appliances to customer.  Plus it teaches you get customer service skills.

good,Lowes is a very hands on employer. They recognize the employees for almost everything that they do to achieve maximum performance. Outside lawn and garden is an amazing department to be a part of. The co-workers are amazing and willing to help in any way they can. Management is very knowledgeable in all policies and procedures.
good,I loved it there just not the hours of course. But the employees and management are wonderful. Its a great place to work if you are retired or are in school.
good,"I learned better communication skills between customers and myself as well as co-workers and myself. The hardest part of my job was the fact that some customers were rude and very impatient. The most enjoyable part of my day would be when I accomplished my goals for that day as far as getting my work done and making customers days. I also learned to be more aware of my surroundings and go with my gut feeling. I was able to save Loss and Prevention over $3,000 in one day. Management was very reasonable and very well to be apart of their team."
good,"Lowe's is a good company to work for while you are going to college. They are very flexible with your school schedule. The management is very reasonable and they work well with each other, as well as employee's"

good,"Great work environment, not completely upfront about how hours will work when you're being hired, pleasant managers, comfortable dress code"
good,A very good company to work for. Safety is a priority in this workplace. The upper management has an open door policy and are overall great people to work with and deal with!
good,"A Typical work day for me is starting off by Cleaning the Restrooms and break room. Tasks such as taking trash out, Moping, sweeping, washing tables. Then I complete a Safety and hazmat sheet to make sure the store is safe around that area. I pick up trash around the parking lot and make sure there are no break in areas and things to that nature. Then to end the day I help costumers and stay outside bringing in Shopping karts."
good,Great place to work! People really care about you and your well being. Great benefits and great culture. Its really a great company to start your career. Although for HR managers there is not a great career path. For ops managers there is plenty of room for growth.
good,Focused on customer service to drive sales.  Schedule has some flexibility but regularly scheduled 50 hours per week on a rotating open/close shift.
good,"A typical day at work is a busy day that consists of many many things. I am a person that likes to work at a very good pace so time could move effectively and efficiently. I do more than what I am supposed to do, as I know how to operate many aspects at Lowe's. Managers are very friendly towards me as I am to them. I adhere to all tasks that I am assigned to, and if I can I will do other tasks to pass time. I am very talkative and friendly towards my co-workers. Almost every worker at Lowe's at the location at work at knows who I am and always greets me with a smile, as I do the same. As I work 2 jobs and go to post secondary, the hardest part of the job is to be ""punctual"". I am always on time for work, but there are times when I leave 30 mins to an hour early so I could catch up on school work or get to bed on time so I could wake up at 5am in the morning to go to my morning workplace. There are many things to enjoy about working at Lowe's. My most enjoyable part is helping customers that are very friendly and I love my co-workers."

good,"Offers great benefits,management always works with you and offers great starting pay.Part time hours aren't so bad but is hard to move up in the company."
good,"It was a good place to work.  They paid well, had good benefits and the people were easy to get along with.  The environment was good though management could be a little overly serious and high strung.  This was understandable because management had the least stable jobs and could easily lose their position.  The fact that management would be a little high strung, the hours of operation and customer service aspect were really the only downsides to the work and none of it was really awful, it could just be a little aggravating."
good,"Good working conditions, managers are team players, A very safe oriented company they always want there customers and associates to be safe."
good,"you have to be able to stand for long periods of time, the hardest part of the job is to stand for 12 hours at a time. The most enjoyable thing about working there is the steady work environment."
good,"I love my job. I love working with my coworkers and managers. "
good,"Helped rack and stock store when it was new. Enjoyed the work and quit only because I had better offer with EGS Cabinets.I cashiered, stocked and provided customer svc"
good,the people there make it fun to go to work and the managers are all really helpful. The pay is good for the level of work needed. The most enjoyable part world be the fellowship with the other associates. The hardest part of the job would be learning where everything in the store goes.
good,Lowe's was very flexible with my changing work schedule for each semester while attending school. Management there was reasonable and would help out with a lot of problems with customers.

good,I work with this company for 10 years.  I enjoyed working with the people giving them good customer service.  I would have retired from this position if they didn't downsize the company.
good,"Overall a great job, and company to work for. But like all others lots of stress, but pay was good and helped to endure the stress. Best advice is get into a position that you enjoy and make decent money and stay. Upper Management jobs come and go quickly and there the first to go."
good,always willing to nurture talent and provide possibility for advancement.  Store level management at most locations leaves a lot to be desired.  Middle management over worked

good,"Lowe's as a company is a great place to work, they really valued my opinion as a kitchen designer. The management team always made sure I had the tools to do my job and is flexible with my work schedule to make sales."
good,"Helped customers feel important, worked in customer service to insure the best service possible, worked as and cashier, and helped sales increase."
good,Fun to help customers with their projects. Co-workers helpful and friendly. The only thing I did not like was the long drive there.
good,"this job showed me the end and outs of being apart of company and how to become a good employee. It was my first experience with customer service . so I had to learned to deal with different attitudes also well show good customer service skills when it was not warranted . the most enjoyable part was being about of a team that was fun and interactive , where it was fun to work and had the feeling that the team was making the job easier"
good,"Fast paced store, good overall management. Flexible schedule for students. Feels like the company appreciates their employees."
good,good company to work for. fast paced. you have good training an coworkers are very helpful. you meet all kinds of people an need to have some patience dealing with attitudes an situations.you have 1 weekwnd off a month. sometimes this can be a bummer. you also work most holidays but pay is good.
good,"Lowes is a great company. my experience working with Lowes allowed me to better my work ethics and not only learn from the job, but to learn from the people within it as well"
good,so many people think they work their but they really don't . to work at a place you have to be productive and help people when they need the help . and my experience has not seen that.
good,"The job is physical and tiring. The weather makes the job exhausting. The pay for the work required could be better. The job is fun and keeps you busy. I love my department, so I enjoy my job. I wish full time was an option. or health insurance. The management team is like a family, they treat you better than most managers should. They have team meetings everyday and bring attention to good workers and acknowledge good customer service."
good,Job was very hectic on week days very hard to help a lot of customers due to size of store and multiple departments. The job was a very manual labor intense and long hours outdoors.
good,Typical day at work involved either setting up new merchandise or resetting existing merchandise had good team of people I worked with our manager was very good at her job and if you ever needed help she never said no. The hardest part of the job was sometimes it involved extreme physical labor and the part of the job I liked most was the schedule
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Lowes. A typical day would start with me running 4 miles to work, once at work there would be a team meeting with daily assignments, After the assignments had been handed out I was pretty much left on my own to get the job done.  The only times I would hear from the management was when I had finished my job and needed another assignment or if the managers needed to switch me to another task.  The hardest part of the day was when other employees would begin trashing the work place.  The parts I enjoyed the most were the nice conversations I was able to have with other employees while still being productive and getting things done."
good,"A typical day would start off with me getting there at around 6:30. Once there i would make myself a cup of coffee and get a new pair of gloves from the vending machine. Then, at 7 before the day starts we would have a 10-15 minute meeting to let us know how much work we were going to be having to do for the day and how the previous work day was. After the meeting we would start making our way to the work area and stretch while the other workers would start building their loads so I could band them together. Once the first one is dropped the day goes by pretty smooth with a somewhat steady flow of loads being dropped. Once we were done with our work for the day i would either go outside to tighten the cables around the emptied trains, or go to the other side of the building to help the people tarping the loaded trucks finish their work."
good,"Going to work and seeing where i'm placed at, and doing my job description to the best of my ablity. I learned if you take your time and ask for help from your co-workers,and management when needed things tend to run alot better. The hardest part of the job i would have to say is when it gets really busy and some customers get loud,and kinda rude,it can bother you a little,but when you realize it's comes with the job you dont take it personnel and add to the already negative energy.The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to gain more experience,and and use my people skills on the daily bases."
good,"Maintenance and custodial work, landscaping, operated the forklift, was an order picker, worked the star wars, was a floor scrubber, provided excellent customer service, and helped in all departments."

good,"Typical day at Hollister was always busy, always something to do. Enjoyed working with co-workers, they were always very nice and easy to work with. Scheduling was very easy going, didn't give hard time if you needed off for certain days or even a weekend every now and then. It's a great first job if you're in high school or fresh out. You learn a lot about customer service."
good,"Challenging job daily trying to stay ahead of shrink and shrink related issues with operations, externals, and internals.I spend my day training the associates and management staff on shrink, physical security, and safety. The management staff and associates are supportive and willing to learn. Over years I have learned management skills along with patience in order to succeed. The associate involvement and accomplishments are very rewarding."
good,"Lowe's was just shy of being a wonderful place to work. Everyone was extremely nice; and I was constantly learning something new on the job. The management felt like they were actually part of the team, and would set wonderful examples of how to have a productive day."
good,really loved the people i worked with but job was really hard not the delivering part but the loading of appliances into customers houses and I needed a job where I wouldn't have to hurt my back or worry about getting injured.
good,8 hour shift. Job to make customers leave happier than when they entered the store. Co-workers were easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job was they hours scheduled (tough when you are full-time in school). Management was very well done.
good,Great place to work. Fast paced. Managers change very frequently. New lowe's vest ready program put in place to train employees on the job before they are actually put on the floor to work is a great idea.

Also oversees coverage of registers and store supply usage, performs opening procedures, and provides excellent customer service by assisting customers and addressing issues."

good,"My experience at Lowes was wonderful! I love the people I worked with, the pay good and management was flexible with my hours.

good,"Great Company not sure why it was added again here, I worked with them from November 2012 until the present day. Great stability and employees."
good,"I sacked groceries for this company. I learned communicating with the public. I also swept the floor aisles, stocked the ice cooler and cleaned the produce. My co- workers were all friendly , the management was fair. The hardest part of the job was keeping up the fast pace it takes to be a sacker. The enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the public."
good,All of the employee were great people to work with and was a great experience. the hardest part was unloading the trucks and they were packed stupid and kept falling.

good,"A typical day at work is coming at 6 am and have no clue what time you're getting off. I learned a lot, judging lumber such as, which one is good against the rain and which one is not. i learned to operate heavy equipment to install appliances. The management wasn't so great but my co-workers were great they helped me out through rough days. The most difficult stuff about this job is that you don't know what is going to happen you know accident happens while delivering a 30 cu fridge you could either drop it or scratch something. The enjoyable part about the job is using tools."

good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for overall. The pay is very respectable, management is always open to new ideas, and the people are a joy to work with. The only downside to the company is that the work life balance is non existent due to a rotating 4 week schedule."
good,"you unload truck by hand , and using all kinds of tools and eqyuimpent ,  your manager will treat you like a superman, they will expect you to work so hard that you want to quit ,, they will not fired if you dont still or hit anything or anyone,,,  but they will make your life missirable until you quit."

good,Good People. I have no complaints above this work environment. Its very fun filled and has great energy around the work place.
good,"Lowe's provides an excellent atmosphere that is fun, safe, and comfortable to work in. I was worried about not knowing where things were when a customer asked, but you can always look to a fellow employee to give you a hand....with anything! If you've never used powered equipment, that will change."
good,"sin palabras"
good,"The pay is great, great benefits, hours not too bad, however management is terrible,  co workers are amazing, the most enjoyable part about the job is learning new things every single day"

good,Great pay and benefits. Provides training and room for advancement. Great mix of agriculture and retail environment. Good hours depending on position. Great company to work for
good,Fast paced retail environment. Provides advancements. Each location is different as far as management goes. If you enjoy multi tasking and learning different things daily this is a great place to work. Good benefits and pay. Hours very depending on position.
good,"Prepare and complete orders for delivery or pickup according to schedule (load, pack, wrap, label, ship)"
good,"To be the best and treat everyone with courtesy and respect , so customer can have a great shopping experience and want to continue shopping there."
good,Not really a great place to look for a career in my opinion but still overall a great place to work. There are many job responsibilities but never enough people employed so everyone is usually having to cover 3 areas at once whether they know or not anything about what they are covering.
good,"Lowes provides you with exceptional customer service and always a warm greet with a smile,its a nice company to say the least."
good,There is a good atmosphere here. Management helps out a lot and does well in training. There is a good mix of employees and they give a lot of younger people a chance
good,"Lowes will give you great job experience as well as people experience. There are many different departments that you can work in that will give you great experience in necessities like flooring, electrical, plumbing and hardware."
good,"I work 5 days a week there and while my job is actually fairly easy it gets old fast. The pay is great, the people are great, there is even occasionally free food. But it can become very tiresome and when only one person is unaccounted for the amount of work is greatly increased. So taking days off is something that can be unfortunate for the group. However some days there is no truck and so we help others in the store or do whatever the manager has planned for us. Which can also get tiresome because its not something were use to doing or have ever done before."
good,Signature Health Care operates with a business strategy that brings alignment organizationally with the people who do the real work in caring for residents.
good,"A typical day at work consists of helping nice customers check out their merchandise in a quick and friendly manner. I also helped customers find their merchandise within the store. The hardest part of the job was remembering exactly where everything was in the store, along with understanding all the steps in customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers in the front end and in customer service."
good,"Schedule associates to work stations."
good,"My days were always great, I came into the store with smiling faces and gretted everyday. I went to my computer and started with my daily routine. I always had great people around me who were always williing to lend a helping hand."
good,A typical day at Lowe's was always based on customer service and working as a team. Freight flow to ensure all products were available to customers. Good management people.
good,"Generally a good company to work for, Every store is different and run differently depending on those who are managers....some are very by the book and some seem to make up their own rules along the way. Opportunities for advancement are good if you work well for your specific store, but don't hope on transferring. Lowe's has great benefit programs available to both part time and full time employees and the pay rate is decent compared with other retail employers."
good,Friendly fellow employees with a fun filled work environment. Very professional environment and staff. Proper training was issued to all new employees.
good,"I believe that Lowe's is a great place to work for all ages and skill sets. Solid corp. culture and stable place to work."
good,Loved Lowe's...the family environment amongst coworkers. Worked hard and played hard! Customer service was #1! I enjoyed most customers.
good,"Great place to grow personally and develop if you work well in stressful situations. Hardest part of job is managing associates and meeting time lines with little wiggleroom for  payroll hours. Depending on store, great management."
good,Overall my experience with Lowes is generally positive.  They are a forward thinking company who is generally rooted in the community where they operate.
good,A typical day at work is helping customers with their purchases. Stocking the soda machines by the front registers and keeping the front end by the registers clear of carts and any other items that might be hazardous to our customers. I've learned a lot about the public and I also train the new hires. I get along and enjoy a large percent of my co-workers. I believe the hardest part of the job would be getting loaders to the front to help the customers with their large purchases. Most enjoyable is fellowship with my co-workers and my customers.
good,Good place to work if you are going to school or do not want to have any sort of life outside of work.  Due to scheduling.  But that is retail for you.
good,"In my short time working at Lowe's I learned better customer service skills, and I met many nice people. I became more punctual and with the help of co-workers and management, my work experience was a positive one."
good,"You are expected to do everything and know everything with little support from management. With what they make you responsible over, you are treated not so well and always the last to leave. This was just the store I was in."
good,Overall a great place to work. I enjoy the seeing the smiles on my clients faces when they come into the store and with a project in mind and I'm able to help them find everything they need so they can build that new deck for their family or whatever project someone brings to my attention.
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about numbers but how you personally grow.The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside colleagues.
good,"good place to work,work load a little heavy but employes are friendly pay was good,good working experience.They have cut back on supervisers and employees."

good,I worked there for almost 10 yrs. I got to know a lot of people there and still communicate with some of them. Its a very family first business and I also loved what I did it taught me a lot of things about appliances and about communication with others. Also learned how to drive different types of lifts there.
good,"My duties were usually pretty simple; I loaded merchandise on customers vehicles (sometimes by hand, often by forklift) and also brought out pallets of merchandise (mulch, concrete, etc) for customers to buy on their own. I also cleaned up, especially if I was closing."
good,The job is very demanding in the area that we live. The store is consistently in the top 10 in volume. It can be stressful but the leadership here tries their best to help you succeed.
good,Brinks is a decent place to work. There is little room for advancement in smaller branches. Overall not terrible place of employment.
good,"A typical day consists of starting with ensuring all monies are secure and receipts are secure. Later, I am responsible for assisting all store patrons and directing traffic, while maintaining phone lines and the customer service desk."
good,With a right management it is a good place to work. Working in the garden center never was routine that what made it fun. There could be a lot of policy changing that did not make sense to the sales floor . Employees pulled together when needed.
good,"it was nice helping customers. "
good,I found my Lowe's experience to be a great impact upon my life. With a flexible mind set almost everyday presented itself with new challenges to overcome. I learned that most customers just want to be heard and validated as individuals. Before I entered management they engendered my respect making my transition seamless. The hardest part of the job was leaving. My move to Florida effectively ended my time there. I enjoyed finding solutions to the needs of my customers.
good,for me it was a place to help improve my customer service and up my knowledge of home improvement. co workers were great with teaching and helping customers.
good,I Loved this job and the people i worked with had so much knowledge of what they do. I knew working there I would get a great knowledge.
good,"Fun company to work for meet  a lot of good people and learn a lot of good skills to help take care of customers, not very consistant in hours or coverage"
good,"As a cashier at Lowes you clock in and go and see an head cashier so they can place you at any register they need you.  You basically spend the entire day at the cash registers in each department.  It can get boring when the store is not busy, but on the plus side if you are working pretty much all day you get two 15 minute breaks and an hour for lunch and there are plenty of restaurants in the area so you don't have to go far.  Overall being a cashier at Lowes is a great start and fairly easy place to work at."
good,"Working at Lowes wasn't as bad as i thought it would be its actually a good job, everyone who works there are very respectful and great people"
good,Great company that offers a lot of room for advancement. Their IT department is really advanced and the culture is very team based.

good,"Great company that offers great pay, benefits, and potential for increase if you work hard. Customer focused and willing to help out its employees.."

good,"Everyday duties walk the department make sure all is in place and check for orders leaving that day or product that needs to be order,call customers to follow up on there details."
good,Can be very demanding but also fulfilling.  I enjoy helping customers and employees.  It is fast paced and exciting.  The opportunity for advancement is very limited.
good,"I liked working for the company and wouldn't mind going back.  Although some of the associates weren't always the nicest, and the store had multiple complaints toward them.  I always liked making customer experience the best possible for each customer."
good,Customer focused company with excelent benefits and pay. Great supportive management to help develop there people. Growing in Mexico and Canada so you will have great Potential.
good,"Work at Lowe's is very intense, but you stayed very busy. It can be physically demanding many times as well. I always enjoyed working with the customers to assist them with their needs and projects. I have worked at 2 departments there: Outside lawn and garden and building materials."
good,"I got to work at any times they needed me, and I would clock in grab a walkie talkie and a rope for the carts and I would head out into the parking lot. Then I would collect the carts left out there and bring them back. When anyone needed me to load merchandise they would call me on the walkie talkie to go do it. I interacted with customers a lot and other employees."
good,"I only work part time, but they still let me have health insurance, as well as two weeks paid vacation every year. They're very fair and understanding. My main problem is that communication with management can be very difficult, and while my schedule is consistent, I am often left alone in a department, because none of my coworkers were scheduled during my shift."
good,"Enjoy working and meeting new people. At the time management was great to work with. Hours was great, pay was great but the distance that I had to drive was long but for the most it was worth it. Enjoyed the job very much just dealing with people is great for me."
good,"Every one work together. Daily purchase orders, inventory control, stocking shelfs, set up installs, contact vendors and search for products. Contact installers to set up installs. Great management and co workers are always helping each other."
good,"A typical day at work would consist with me being on time, dependable and eager to learn.  My job responsibilities over the years has been from Customer Service, Sales, Cashier, Filing, Answering the Phone, Word 2010, etc. And to do whatever it took to get the job done efficiently."
good,It was a joy to work at Lowe's the employee and management staff were easy to get along with and made work fun. They are willing to work around your schedule if you have kids or are still in school.
good,great company good benefits.  easy to move up in company .  great bonus structure. decent pay. customer focus.  sales driving .  great oppurtunities.

good,"it was a very nice environment to working with people from different parts of the world, great managers and a wonderful team that i worked with."
good,"An extremely responsible position, yet the company offers the correct training to project the best customer service to the customers and to become the best leader to your fellow co-workers. Learned how to manage a group of 16 plus cashiers and how to calmly deal with upset customers. Addressed customer inquires and resolved complaints. Created training manuals targeted at resolving difficult issues regarding customers and employees."
good,Good solid company with growth potential if you're ambitious and hard working. Opportunity for advancement. Team oriented environment.
good,Customers from all back grounds come into the store and expect you to know about every last department and fix there problems whether there is someone in front of you or not. Besides that it is a great place to learn and gather ideas for your personal home improvement.

good,"Workplace a good environment to work in, co-workers are eager to help one another as well as their customers that come through there doors."
good,Most employees and customers are very nice. There is a lot of advancement if you work hard and get to know your supervisor. Not many employees do much outside of regular duties because most of them are older and retired. Good environment to work in though.
good,I have worked at Lowe's Home Improvement for 12 years. It is a great company to work for and there are a lot of opportunities for advancement.
good,"When I worked at Lowe's, everything was great; environment, co-workers, benefits, location EVERYTHING !!! Until we switched our store manager and all h3ll broke loose, he was firing people left and right and many came back because he was reported to corporate. At the time, I wasn't trying to come back while we had the same SM but now they have switched HR and the SM; I have re-applied and is currently waiting to hear from them. If you want to work for a company that values their employees with great compensation, benefits starting immediately and a awesome atmosphere... go to Lowe's !!!"
good,"I come in to work each day looking to make an impact."
good,"I help customers find what they need, took inventory, and stocked. The place was a great place to work, everyone was nice and very supportive. We always stayed busy with things to do."
good,Liked the actual work because it pushed me physically. i had to think  in order to fit items into a limited amount of space. Nice pay but tough hours.

good,"It was comfortable work place and u could feel it when you walk through the doors for work every morning. It was about the production, it was about working hard doing your job in a safely matter. Knowing that this is a busy company everything was very organized which made the job a lot easier."
good,"A typical day for me is leading, coaching, inspiring, and motivating my team to help customers love where they live. I love to inspire people it is something that I truly feel that I was put on this earth to do.  I have discovered that there is always something new to learn. If it is not from your customers, then it is from your staff. One important lesson that I have learned is that you cannot manage each person the same. My coworkers are all unique in their own way. Each of them have their own personality and development level. My job as a manager is to find the right leadership style that will bring them to the next level. The hardest part of the job is the realization that you cannot do everything in a day. I am an very hard worker and it can be hard for me to accept the fact that some projects do require time to complete. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get the chance to build working relationships with your team."
good,"I love Lowes, it was a beautiful place to work and grow as a associate. The Management was helpful and they went above and beyond to help anyone in need. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, they made myself as well as other associates feel welcome."
good,"Taking Care of all Commercial Customers and making sure all their needs are met, Learned Several different areas of the store and its departments, I work with some very supportive coworkers who believe in working together as a team to get all jobs done, Hardest part of the job is the manual labor of lifting extremely heavy items, Enjoyable part is taking care of my customers and making them happy and having them be repeat customers"

good,"I love the place that I work at. Overall it is a great location and my coworkers are like family. Dealing with customers is the hardest part of the job but once we help them and make them happy, it s all worth it. I have learned many skills by working at Lowe's including customer service skills, time management skills, and most important multitasking skills. Working for Lowe's through my early 20's was probably the best decision."
good,It was a fun place to work and the management was great when it came to working around schedules. There is also a lot of room to grow within the company.
good,"cashiering, zoning, making sure the store is safe for customers, money handling, processing returns, answering phone calls, answering customer inquiries, showing customers where merchandise is in the stores."

good,I delivered any merchandise that was ordered or set up for delivery. I loaded and offloaded the merchandise. When there were no deliveries I would help out in the store with the register or just helping customers in the store.
good,"Awesome place to work good people lot off support career wise as well as personally,"

good,"Easy company to work for, lots of room to advance if thats what your seeking. You will learn alot of skills there using power equipment and so forth."
good,"Teamwork is a must and is developed greatly in the Loss Prevention and Safety department.  Across Southern New Jersey 12 stores communicate, relay information and work as a well oiled machine.  Not only is teamwork built amongst peers, it is also built with all associates within the store."
good,Lowe's is a good company to work for. I like the people I work with and I'm able to help customers and answer their questions when it comes to a project they want to work on. Management encourages changing departments and cross training. They are also supportive of moving up in the company.

good,"A typical day at Lowe's can vary depending on the time of day.The morning and afternoon time can be very busy. I work at customer service, so it can be very busy. I learned how to do credit card applications, returns, process internet orders, and help customers on the phone."
good,"i start ,y shift at 9pm, if they need help unloading he truck i go assists them if not i go to my designated work area and stock the shelves"
good,a day at work is day with fun and wonderful customers. hardest part of job is getting your work done in timely manner. management is wonderful they give you help when need and you can go to them for anything.

good,"ran cash register, sweep floors, process orders, assist customers locate items, down stock product to maintain full shelves for the customer, always felt appreciated for the work I do"
good,"Very productive work place. Lots of multitasking.Got along with every one. Employess there cared about each other and lots of team work. Check status on customer orders and followed up with them. Contacted vedors to follow up with orders. Pulled frieght, stocked it and unloaded. Inventory products every weekr. Kept departments clean. Crossed trained in mutiple departments."
good,Good managers. Day starts off with any new task first then the same  as yesterday with different people. If you enjoy speaking with people as I do then this is your place. Co workers are great in showing you how or what you need to find out how things work. The learning center is different it is all computer with little direct direction. You must understand some computer knowledge. Hardest part of day is keeping the customers happy. Some times no matter how hard you try the public can be just straight mean. Keep smiling no matter what is said to you!
good,great company to work for. they pay well for the job that you are doing and there is room for advancement. the operation hours allow you to be able to balance work life and home life. and they have part time benefits
good,I enjoyed working at Lowe's as it provided me with a chance to work with all kinds of people and help them with their goals. I also found it rewarding to get work with people from all walks of life.

good,I enjoyed my time at Lowe's. it was a great company to work for I enjoy helping customers dat was a typical day I learned if the customers is not happy theres no sales my co workers we help each other as a team the hardest part bout my job when the customers was not happy the most enjoyable part bout my job was working in a friendly comfortable environment
good,"You worked hard everyday to meet deadlines, but the best part of your day was working with great employees and interacting with customers."
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work there is potential to move to different positions, and room for some growth. The management is good to work with and is always willing to listen. Work days mainly include helping customers and re-stocking store shelves, but for me it also includes managing employees, and attending to urgent matters. Co-workers at Lowe's are great everyone has a good attitude and come willing to work on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job for me is trying to get everything that needs to be done, done, because of how busy the store can get even with a good work ethic it is still very challenging some days."
good,"Scanned and bagged  customer's purchases.  Ensure that items were in stock.  Accept and process customer's returns."
good,"Lowe's Corporate does try to make it's phone support excellent. Though one will have to deal with many typical call center stresses (high call volume, irate customers, looming sales goals...) the environment provided by management is supportive and encouraging. Talented representatives are often given opportunities to expand skillsets and make lateral, or sometimes upward, progress through their career. Sadly, customer service agents are encouraged to push products and make phone sales, even with customers who declined to speak with a sales specialist."
good,"Lowes was a great place for me starting out as a young mother.  Within a few months I was able to start training in different departments and promoted to different areas of the store.  I loved my job as stocker/receiver but the position was eliminated.  We also helped with inventory management, resets for the PSA's and customer service.  I enjoyed the 6 years that I spent at Lowe's but left due to needing daytime hours."
good,Like any job has it's pros & cons. Great pay love the rotating schedule. Customer issues make it hard but it's harder when you don't have an ASM who will do her job.
good,"ok website, the job was always short on help, trucks were late to arrive, management didnt care about employees, pallet jacks were old and didnt work well to unload truck, forklift ran out of propane often,"
good,"great people to work with. They will help you get where you want to go and provide any assistance you need, and work with you."
good,Enjoyed the staff and the interaction with the customers. Merchandising and overall store operations were a great fit for my talets
good,all is fine. They have good management and a safe place to work. A day there is long. Your co-worker work together good try to help all the time. the most enjoyable part work with good people that do there best to help when they can
good,"team work is a must, learning different positions in all departments, most everyone is customer related skills to create a positive impact with all we do at Lowes"
good,"It was a very easy job, I did cashier work and I also worked doing insides representative sales. I did cashier work and I sold insurances to items being sold"
good,Assist customers in finding the right building materials for their housing needs. I learned about customer service and managing time and cleaniness throughout the job. The co-workers were really friendly and supportive.
good,"Everyone is treated on the same level.  Part-timers are offered extra hours when there is a need for it and are scheduled overtime when they expect a lot of business.  There are many different areas to work in, some of which can be partially learned while at the register while much of it requires a more hands on approach.  Staff and management are extremely friendly and get along well for the most part, but certain stores seem to be difficult to get ahead in.  Recognition is not always given, making people feel a bit under appreciated and the chance to move up is usually taken by one from another store already in that position or an outsider hired off the street.  Still, there is high energy and the Voice Team tries to do a monthly meal to help keep everyone happy and energized and the store is rewarded for maintaining proper safety standards on a regular basis."
good,"Things are always changing, but you need to keep an open mind for that.  The company is more geared towards making the sales for the stores and they need to listen more to the employees of The Call Center."
good,Lowes is a very credible company. The typical day consists of assisting a multitude of customers and tasking in your down time. You're alwasy busy making the day go by quickly
good,Great pay for what you do. Nice family atmosphere and good benefits. Flexible schedules and supportive management team.
good,I loved working at Lowes. I loved helping customers with their home improvement projects and finding what they needed. Lowes also had good benefits for employees and their families.
good,"A typical day is mainly standing at the registers for hours. Helping customers can be a little rough, especially when they aren't appreciative. But the co-workers are great."
good,4 star rating. I have worked with this company for over a year and it has been great. I enjoy my co-workers and customers. I wish that more hours were offered.
good,"Typically, I go into work, do my job, have easy chats with my fellow employees and customers, and leave. Nothing is too challenging to the point where it interrupts the work flow once you get the hang of it."
good,"Working with the public is never a dull moment.No two days the same,like having a different adventure each day.Management and coworkers as well as myself work as a team in our every work day.Also being able to make a lone decision is instilled in our responsibilities as well."
good,I have worked with the company for 12 years and have learned a lot and enjoyed it. Well rewarding from customers and co workers

good,"Great company to work for, excellent benefits.  Most employees at lowes have a great by in with there customers and show genuine concern for the customers remodels."
good,"Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. You are given many opportunities to learn different positions and take on multiple roles but you have to be willing to take the initiative. Management can get overwhelmed depending on the volume of customers and issues which typically arise in each store, but they try their best to be present for the team. Some departments are more involved throughout the whole store than others, which sometimes creates disparities and frustration, when its efforts are not credited and recognized in a meaningful way. Our human resources department was very organized and tried to acknowledge each associate's effort. Overall, you need to be a team player and motivated in order to make a difference within the company, but you won't regret it. The store policies may need to be reinforced."
good,great fast paced and everyone worked as a team. Mostly all management was on bored but some you had to kiss butt in order to move up in the company and that was not my cup of tea.
good,My day usually starts off slow but good. I greet my co-workers and customers. If they were in a bad mood when they got to work their mood usually changes after I get there. We are like a big family at Lowes. The majority of us get along well with each other. My co-workers are very helpful and accomodating. The hardest part of the job is lifting things and listening to customer complaints when we don't have the product that they are looking for. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the smile on the customers face because they had a great shopping experience at our warehouse.
good,Loved working here at Lowes. Great benefits.  Good upper management.  You meet new people every day.  You never know what you are going to see.

My co-workers were like family, and very supportive. The hardest part of the job was to have to stand still in one place, but also was an advantage. The most enjoyable part of the job was to know that almost every customer I encountered I put a smile on their face"
good,"On a typical day I took the orders of customers and prepared the paint to be the color and sheen desired by the customer. I would down stock shelves, help customers to alleviate problems with products, and help customers to locate items around the store. I learned a lot about the products, methods, and people that are involved with painting and home improvement in general. The management was great and helped me to learn the necessary skills and get through the training process very easily. My co-workers were a pleasure to be around. The hardest part of the job is the fast-paced environment during the summer time when many customers are coming in to purchase paint. Hearing about a customers successful project and knowing the small, but important role that I played in completing it."
good,Variety of people when working. Good environment to advance and gain knowledge of the company. Great benefits even for part time workers.
good,I learned a lot from lowes. Just by working in different parts of the store all the time an working every shift. The trainers and managers are all very good teachers an are hands on with the employees an customers. Only con about management is that there scheduling needs much more improvement.

good,"learned and experienced something new everyday."
good,Customer contact is plentiful and you're able to impact customers directly with smiles and visible willingness to help.
good,What I like most about Lowe's would have to be the people that work there. If it wasn't for them I would not enjoy it as much.

I operated a for lift to unload trucks and stock the lumber. The company is good to work for the management and co-workers are great and very helpful if you need help with any thing."
good,I really enjoyed working at Lowe's. There very understanding if your traveling public transportation. They also accomidated with my scheduale with me taking care of my grandmother. I learned a lot with  the Loss prevention tactics they taught me. They taught me how to identify certain characteristics of a customer.  Learning safe ways to apprehend a suspect.

Pull the loads up to the loading dock and unpackage them. load them according to order in which we will stop. head to first stop and deliver product and install if necessary. when done at the end of the day finish filling out paperwork and turn in and clock out.
good,"My day was spent receiving freight delivered to the store via fright companies, I.E. UPS, FedEx, etc. as well as from vendors. I was responsible for conducting quality control checks as well as detail receiving merchandise. In addition to these duties, I also operated powered equipment (forklifts, electric reach trucks, electric pallet jacks, order/cherry picker) safely and efficiently, to load and unload merchandise delivered to the store by transportation trailers or flatbed trucks. I also input information into the store's inventory software,( bill of lading information, discrepancy reports and adjustments, etc.) While not receiving freight, I maintained the facilities with daily housekeeping, and performed any tasks or projects assigned to me by management, and completed them in a timely manner.The Management team at Lowe's was very approachable. Any and all concerns that I may have had, I could bring them to their attention and have them resolved, more often than not. My co-workers in the receiving department were like family to me. Having spent the last 8 years with the same group of people, we made it a point to assist each other, whenever or wherever we needed help. The most difficult part of the job, was toward the end of my time at Lowe's. Due to budget cuts, my store was forced to keep a skeleton crew operating the store. Having very little coverage on the sales floor, it became increasingly difficult to complete my duties and responsibilities, while having to provide additional support to the sales floor.The most enjoyable part of my day, was having completed all"

good,"I absolutely love the calm environment. I have been given the chance to better my Customer Service. Management is easy to work with and very understanding. Co-Workers, are very friendly and keep the work area, enjoyable. They are also very helpful. The hardest part of the job is, not knowing where everything is located, so that I could better help my customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is, that I am working with one of the best teams, that I have had the privilege of working with. Also, I enjoy working for the public. I have many reqular customers, that I look forward to seeing each day."

Each day at Lowe's brings something new, whether that is new customers, potential business accounts or general day to day tasks it is very easy to make the day fly by. The hardest part of being in management is getting all of your employees in departments on the same page. The most enjoyable part is being on a fast growing exciting company that has a bright plan for the future"
good,Starting working for lowes while I was in college. They were very good about giving me opportunities to grow and advance my career.
good,"Each day at Lowe's proves to be an experience in managing tasks and customer service relations."
good,"Forward thinking company"
good,pushed in carts bagged merchendise  did go backs this was in pay was way above mim wage good job to get you through college like it did for me
good,"I enjoyed working here.  The benefits were good and the pay equal.  The team I worked with was remarkable, but some management was lacking in their skills.  They provide food on occasion to reward for safety."

good,"Typical day at Lowes is helping customers. "
good,"loved working here, very organized company. if I'm able i would definitely go back"
good,"My day consisted of working the register, making sure no one walked out the gate with unpaid merchandise, meeting and greeting customers who entered and exited the business. My managers were great to work with and they solved my issues accordingly. My coworkers work kind and friendly and help as much as they could. I can say the hardest part was putting up with people who had attitudes. The ones that thought they owned the company and that everyone should drop what they are doing to help them. Even if the employee was already helping someone else. I always enjoyed taking care of those customers that were there often and pleasant."
good,"days are usually good, but can be hectic just like any other job. learned how to operate a forklift. management was great. hardest part of the job was dealing with the public.  I enjoyed the fun people I worked with."
good,"Arrive at 7;30 start opening procedures, check calendar/email for up coming appointments, up dates, make a list of must dos, greet staff and in coming customers, answering phones, and basic operational duties.  In my banking career I have acquired a vast amount of knowledge from bookkeeping, accounting, cash handling, loan application, loan review, credit scores, short term notes, mortgages, titles, and the list goes on.  I always enjoyed my co-works and rarely had a dislike for any of them.  Sometimes the hardest part of the job was turning down a loan app. or a up set account customer, but for the most part I truly enjoyed the bank."
good,"All in all it was a good company to work for. They payed extremely well (comparatively speaking), but promotions were based on the buddy system, and if you weren't in good with the management you had 0 chance of even being able to apply for a promotion. Favoritism is rampant, and frankly, the people that get promoted usually have no business being in positions of authority."

good,"A typical day at work while I was at Lowe's consisted of me counting the cash tills from the prior business day and completing a daily deposit for pick up via an armored car service. I would compile financial reports from the prior business days that included: daily cash sales, credit card and debit card transactions, electronic journal logs, cash register activity reports, and merchandise credit redemptions. All this information would be strategically placed and filed according to date and titled: ""Daily Business"" these reports would be kept for future reference and district audits. I would then order currency for store operation (I generally ordered money twice a week depending on need and customer volume). I would also research cash variances that appeared after completing the store deposit with the help of loss prevention and the electronic journal. "
good,A great workplace environment to be at. Everyone knows what needs to be done and it gets done as a team effort. Everyone helps each other out with the vast departments. Co-workers available by phone call or page to answer any question a customer may have.

good,"The job is alright. The people I work with for the most part a good. Management can be a little tough, probably like any company. I think there is absolute room for growth, if you like retail, but I'm looking to move on to something I really love. I would recommend this company to others looking for work while looking for work!"
good,"My typical day consisted of working stocking freight for at least half the day, then working with the receiving team and helping them out with anything they needed.  I was over a team of at least 15 people year round with various job positions, so I had to be versatile enough to learn and understand each job function.  I was responsible for training any new employees hired in the store on power equipment once they had been thru the orientation process.  The hardest part of the job was the schedule, 2A-11A, this was a hard adjustment to make for me, but I understood the reasoning and tried to support the decision fully.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people, I enjoyed working with all the different personalities and learning new things about everyone."

good,Lowe's excites employees and encourages good working relationships which in turn helps us to service customers with the same enthusiasm. Lowe's also encourages on the job learning through many different programs. Management is there to support and encourage associates to reach their full potential.  The hardest part of the job is product knowledge.  Lowe's is most enjoyable for the employee recognition and activities.
good,There is never really a dull time so the day goes by faster than most other jobs.  They are willing to work with you if you want to get into management.  Managers were caring and easy to talk to.  Co-workers are what kept the place going.  Its easy to work when people are working with you.  Hardest part of the job was the weekends when you are constantly running around.  Most enjoyable part was the atmosphere.
good,"A typical work day included providing friendly customer service skills to each and every customer and increasing sales in anyway possible for the advancement of the company. Remembering that safety is a big part of the job and to always put the customer first. I learned that retail is not something that I plan to do for the rest of my life. Working at Lowes was a motive for me to go back to school.  Management was horrible at Lowes. I worked for them for almost two years and I had seen more than two managers get fired including the store manager. For the most part I had very understanding co-workers but when it came to head cashiers they took their job more seriously than I attended. In my opinion, some of the head cashiers treated their general cashiers like they were nothing more than a worker instead of a team player. There was not really a hard part of being a customer service associate. I learned the material fairly quickly and preformed my job well. I have had experiences with rude customers but that's all part of working for retail. The most enjoyable part of my job were the checks and the bonuses."
good,"Good place too work,and good co-workers.....Most enjoyable,and good management...Thanks"

good,"Learned a lot about mixing paint and making stains"
good,"I have created a lot of friendships in my time with Lowes. Overall great place to grow. I am an outside sales rep which during the Spring/Summer time you will work 60-70 hours per week and reap great pay, during the Fall/Winter months, workflow will typically slow down a quite a bit. In turn, your pay will drop dramatically."
good,"Great atmosphere, management was always very helpful.  "
good,Great place to learn how to work as a team. I also learned how to take to take initiative with little to know guidance.
good,"Very enjoyable work place. Co-workers and customers very friendly."
good,I learned how to be independent and rely on my skills that I had to deal with customers. This job is great for networking if you are interested in the skilled trades field. Management  was okay co-workers were from all different walks of live from college students to military veterans. The hardest part about the job was we would run out of certain products during the peak season.
good,"The day goes by fast when working at Lowes. I can never say that ""I am never busy."" I learned how to use the cash register, and I learned how to tell when a customer did a ticket switch or not on an item. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers."
good,"I was hoping for a career working for Lowe's but got fired for claiming a thrown away item found the trash can.  I was told they were going to make an example out of me and my actions, re: policy and employee handbooks explanation 'bout claiming item from trash.  Very petty, strong course of action, no hand slap, no warning, just "" your Fired For Stealing"" no debate no chance to defend myself or explain my situation.  I felt like I was one of their most valued employees, my qualifications and sales results were always in the top 5 of the store.  Felt like I was well liked and very good at my job, not to mention willingness to always help my fellow associates out whenever needed.  Always on time, never missed a day of work and was always willing to pitch in and help other deptments with gripe."
good,A typical day at work-Helping customers load things into there vehicle. Collect carts from the parking lot. Help customers inside the store. I have learned a lot about all the different products that Lowe's has to offer. It was a great experience to work here. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers that have an attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning about all of the Lowe's products.
good,"Learned excellent customer service, management was great and welcoming, co-workers were helpful and friendly. Hardest part was on the spot problem solving. Enjoyable job because you're always talking to someone."
good,"Typical day is dealing with customers and making sure they are all taken care of.Make sure they get wow customer service and coach and train employees.I have a great upper management staff and we all compliment each other.We have a diverse mix of employees and customers that shop at the store.My co-workers are hard working and always willing to be team players most of the time.The hardest part about my job would be to balance customer service and impacting customers with tasking and daily duties.The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customer, and sharing my knowledge."
good,They are a great company and many advancements. The management team is friendly and help anyway that they can.
good,The Temecula store is fast paced and consistently busy. Multitasking and being calm under pressure is necessary. The coworkers are enjoyable to work with.

Before the changes the job was absolutely great with great benefits employee appreciation days with games and food.  Great environment over all.
good,"I started there working the front end doing carts, loading, and cashier and shortly worked up to be a CSA in the paint department. I still helped the front end when needed and other departments such as electrical, seasonal, and appliances. I stocked shelves and gave customers advice on home projects that they wanted to take on. I was also part of a team that had to control inventory and notify loss prevention when I saw somebody shoplift or act inappropriately. I really enjoyed the customer service part of the job as I was great at talking to people and giving home improvement advice and tips. The hardest part of the job was trying to be in all departments at the same time and continue to deliver the same quality of customer service but was able to do so."
good,"During the week, you spend most of your time developing new skills and working with some customers. Traffic picks up toward the end of the week into the weekend. Managers are there to assist with any difficulty. Managements allows us to make executive decisions without feeling like we did anything wrong. everyone works as a team. The hardest part of the day is when there is more than average customers without enough coverage on the sales floor. The best part of the day is working with the ""do-it-yourself"" customer to help them from the beginning to the end of the project."
good,"its  been so  long ago"
good,Loved working in the open environment. Great place to work. Recommend anyone work there.
good,alot of benefits and a learning experience in several areas.

good,"This position is perfect for students or just for extra income on the weekends. The schedule is set, the day goes by rather quickly. Its a guaranteed 20hrs and you're done for the rest of the week. Its also pretty much a floater position normally in seasonal but I'm usually hanging out in paint!"
good,"Depends on your management, decent benefits. I don't want to write this.  Good company but it's retail."
good,"I Manage 5 different departments and over 20 different employees, I am responsible for ensuring that all 5 of my departments meet budget for sales.

good,I love Lowes everyday i would come into work with a smile on my face and knowing I will have a great day.
good,A typical day started with a lot of cleaning up. I learned something new almost every day which was nice and kept me on my toes. Management was good did not have to work with them much other than them asking me to see if I could fix things that needed repaired in the store. My co-workers were real helpful when I needed them. The hardest part of my job was trying to clean the store and stay out of customers way so they could shop. And the most enjoyable part was meeting new people which could be customers or new employees.

I enjoy working to help people complete the projects they're working on.
good,The most valued part of my day is when I know that through out the day that I accomplished something and feel good about my job.
good,Lowes is a great company I would just love to work in a hospital atmosphere or anything dealing with children.

good,Good atmosphere and programs. Reach out to community with programs and have job opportunities.
good,"While every day you can expect to break a sweat, get paint on you, and be worn out.. the great friendships made with co-workers and conversations had with customers makes your work worth it every day. The management works with you as long as you do your job well. You get what you put into it. Expect to work hard.. slackers don't last long. This helps create a positive and friendly environment to work in."
good,Lowes is a great company to work for because the associates work together to create an exceptional atmosphere of customer service for their customers.

good,a typical day is full of learning and great for the chance to excell
good,The hardest part about working at specific Lowe's is the tendency for the managers to favor certain people regardless of that person work ethic.

These may include facilitating an orientation for new-hires if management coverage is poor, or completing the daily cash-flow process if that employee calls in sick; which includes reconciling the tills from the previous day, preparing all the book-keeping for management approval, and preparing the daily deposit for armored car delivery.  The most enjoyable part of my job is turning a customer's bad experience into a good one.  I love turning an angry or upset customer into a happy one; and the same applies to my cashiers.  If they are having a bad day, I love turning their day around by being as helpful, jovial, and polite as I can.  The hardest part of the job is trying to complete several tasks at once to the best of my ability.  I am usually able to multitask, but sometimes when coverage is low it can get a little hectic.  I learned how to be a better leader in the Head Cashier position, I learned how to calmly handle any irate customer, and above all I learned how to interact with people in a positive way to overcome any conflict that may arise.  The management team, like most, had its great members and its not-so-great members.  But, as I previously stated, I learned how to navigate and work around each"

good,"great company to work for. would recommend it to others, cant say enough good things about it"
good,"Working at Lowe's is very fast paced and multitasking skills are a must.  While employed at Lowe's as a manager I learned exceptional customer service and complaint handling skills.  I learned how to properly manage inventory, how to order and merchandise products to maximize sales/margins, how to manage costs, and inventory loss.  I also developed my skills in managing an income statement.  I was taught how to develop and mentor other employees and create a proactive store culture. The most difficult part of my job at Lowe's was having to handle numerous tasks at once in a fast paced and constantly changing real time environment.  Building long lasting relationships with customers, coworkers, and vendors was the most rewarding part of being a manager at Lowe's."
good,"I absolutely enjoy everything about my customers, my job requirements and responsibilities.  My team that I work with daily puts forth incredible effort. "

Paid sick, holiday, and vacation time."
good,"I currently hold two separate positions at Lowes. One being an Unload associate the other being a Sales Associate/Cashier. A normal day in the Unload position would consist of Unloading a large delivery truck consisting of about 1,200 individual boxes stacked to the top of the trailer stretching back about 50 feet. My job is to efficiently remove the boxes and distribute the boxes onto pallets divided into different sections for different departments. I am in charge of filling out the paperwork for the unload process and inventory. I also run a crew of two other less experienced unload associates and I am in charge of guiding them through the unload process smoothly, efficiently, and address problems as they arise. Although I am not in a management position these duties feel into place out of necessity as there is no freight manager on duty during my shift. The hardest part of the job is dealing with items stacked/loaded incorrectly in the truck. It is time consuming to remove these items effectively without damage to the items. For example two skids stacked on top of one another  with a water heater and light bulbs on the very top hanging off the edge.The most enjoyable part of the job is my management and coworkers. There are many people surrounding you that make it fun to go to work. They also treat you pretty well there as you normally get a 15 minute break and an hour lunch in a 9 hour shift. The downfall to the unload position is that it is only a 4 hour day position in which you work at a very fast pace to unload the freight in time so a break is normally not in the picture"
good,"A typical day at work for me is basically identifying customer needs and fulfilling them. I also supervise cashiers and loaders. While most are pretty compliant, there is the occasional few that like to be non-productive."
good,"Working at Lowe's was a great experience. I learned a great deal about home improvement and working with customers. Management was beyond great, always helpful and there when needed to provide support or answer questions. My coworkers became great friends and were always goal oriented. My typical day included about an 8 hour shift, in which I would work with either solo or up to a group of 3 people. I was always assisting customers with their shopping experience, while maintaining a clean and presentable workplace in my department. I spent nearly half my day on forklifts, rotating product and keeping the shelves fully stocked with lumber, sheet-rock, ext. There wasn't really a part of the job that was hard, and the most enjoyable part was working in such a friendly work environment."
good,"Constant movement , Team Work , Nice employees, its a good place to work , and also have and nice pay"
good,"A day was always fast paced and customer satification a must, I learned to read blue prints, and alot of construction imformation"
good,I would get to work and punch in and start bagging the groceries that people buy and take them to there car and then when its time to close I would fix up the store getting it ready for the next day.

good,"I have enjoyed working at Lowe's. I am still working there and would love to stay with them. I am a returned employee. I used to work with Lowe's over 10 years ago, and so when I moved back to the States a year ago, I tried it out again, and they took me back. I would stay with them, but looking for a second job. P/T job for extra cash."

I learned to work well without supervision. I have great coworkers that will help out if needed. I have good management with no problems. The hardest part is being short handed and not having any assistances. The most enjoyable part is when the day goes as smooth as planned and I don't have any slip ups."
good,"Each day demanded something new of me. Every time I arrived, a different task needed to be finished and I learned the skills necessary to accomplish those within a short time frame due to the workplace that required me to work quickly, efficiently, and with tact around customers. I learned a lot about communication skills between myself and customers and myself and my management. The upper management was difficult to deal with, providing that the store manager and her assistant would give me conflicting and contradicting tasks, but they got finished regardless. The most difficult part of the job was having to satisfy the customer while accomplishing what management wanted done and still getting my tasks accomplished. The most enjoyable part of my work experience here was the crew that I worked with where we watched out for each other, but especially my immediate supervisor who provided consistent support and encouragement and help with jobs where necessary."
good,"As a cashier your shift is the same almost everyday, transaction after transaction. When I worked customer service or the return desk it could cause a little stress, but it wouldn't last forever. I became more knowledgeable in home improvement and repair items and what it's like to make that last minute dash to an open store to get something to fix a plumbing issue. Years later I experienced my own emergency one night and that was my thought as I walked thru the doors of the store. "
good,"Spent my days delivering appliances, so I was never in the store. I liked my co-workers and management, very easy to work with. Pay could be better, but provided decent benefits even for part time employees. Would've liked more than the maximum of 30 hours per week."
good,Lowe's is an excellent place to work if you are into retail/home improvement settings. Lowe's is fun to work at due to the people and projects you are exposed to. While doing this job you learn so much about all sorts of things. One of the drawbacks to this job is that it is entry level pay.

good,"running register and seeing new and returning customers and making there shopping visit as pleasant as we can. You learn something new every day whether it's from an associate or a customer.

good,"While I loved being a part of this company, it was sad that I chose school over Lowe's. Store manager didn't agree with me going to school so he made me choose. Therefore, I am no longer with the company."
good,"Overall is a great place to work with friendly co-workers, fun atmosphere, and helping customers with projects and designs. A typical day of work consists of calling customers to check up on projects and installations, checking projects for errors, building new ones from a blueprint to a full estimate, answering questions, providing exceptional product knowledge and expertise about flooring, cleaning, stocking, building displays, directing other associates to their priorities."
good,"A solid company to work for.  They emphasize customer-store relations.  Depending on management, a particular store can either be good or bad, but usually management does a good job and takes care of its employees.

That's when the store goes into a big cleaning kick so there is always something to do.  Management is great they will back you or give you the tools to succeed.  Co-workers are decent and they are always there to help when needed.  Hardest part is trying to complete everything in that one day but that is also one of the best parts.  The absolute best is when a customer gets ecstatic about finally finding what they are going to install in their home for the next 20+ years."
good,Assisted customers with their purchases. Process returns. Answered multiline phone system and directed calls to the correct departments.
good,"I am still new so my review would be of very new employee. I usually do training on computer when I first get to work then spend the rest of my time on the floor taking care of hardware and tool departments. The job so far is good no complaints as of yet but, like I said I am very new to Lowes i have two weeks into job with them. Retail is retail no matter if you work at Lowes or Walmart pretty much the same, except working at Lowes is far better. I am also a part-time employee."
good,"Retail is long and tiresome in general.  At Lowe's is just as other retailers except there is usually something that always needs to be done.  A typical day at work involves filling orders, helping out people who need help finding items, and stocking the shelves.  Depending on what store or department you are in is what really decides how management is.  If the department has a good team and everybody does their job equally then a day at Lowe's is a breeze.  If the department is understaffed then there will be a problem.  The hardest part of working at Lowe's would be pleasing all the customers.  Juggling multiple customers at a time is pretty cumbersome.  On the other hand the most enjoyable part of the job to me is driving the equipment.  Overall, I enjoy working for Lowe's and for a part-time job the pay is fine too."
good,"I have learned to run a cash register, handle customer returns a little about lumber and the garden center. I started as seasonal on 5/30 and was hired permanent PT on 7/6.  So far management has been good.  There are a lot of young seasonal associates that haven't learned the value of having a job and not complaining yet.  The hardest part of my job is standing in one 3' x 3' spot for long periods of time.  My favorite part is talking to the customers and helping them."
good,"Good fun environment at my store. Great pay for what I was doing, for the most part. Good management, great fellow employees."
good,"Lowe's was a great place to work and had a really fun and positive working environment. Everyone said hi and was friendly and I looked forward to working there with positive people. The starting pay was good and we got paid every two weeks, which was different for me. Learning the skills there was pretty easy. Advancement took a year on average was what I heard from other employees. Management was good, very down to earth people who listened to any complaints or improvements that could have been made. They're usually busy in the summertime and when the colder seasons come, hours get cut and there are fewer shifts to work. "
good,This is a good place to work. I met some nice people while working there. Pretty much do the same things each day.

good,A typical day at work is started with a morning meeting for everybody working that morning.  They let you know what is going on with the store and get you hype for the day.

The most enjoyable part the commissions and bonuses."
good,"I definitely enjoy helping others. The environment was kept professional, yet made fun by interacting with customers and offering various discounts and appreciation days. Management was always right beside employees and helped assist customers while handling other tasks. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting and keeping the department neat and organized. The most enjoyable part was the working atmosphere. "
good,The staff is friendly and courteous. The customers are nice. Relaxed environment.
good,"Walking the department before each shift starts to get a general idea of what needs to be stocked or downstocked.  Also making sure that the customers are always checked on and taken care of in the department.  Had to have a spotter with you at all times on the fork truck.  This is because of policy and to ensure the safety of the customers as well.  Co-Workers are amazing to work with in that department and always there to help when it was needed.  Used the saw to rip or cross cut any type of wood that a customer needed to have cut.  Overall a good place to work, especially since I'm a seasonal/part-time employee"

good,"A typical work day at Lowes consists of greeting the customers, helping them with their selection and also answering any and all questions that pertained to their project. I believe the greatest teaching Lowes gave me was the understanding in all aspects of customer service, construction, and inventory. Although Lowes has very good management staff the constant fluctuations of managers make it a very difficult work environment. My co-works inside my department are rich with knowledge and forth coming to share their experiences with any one. Unfortunately the most difficult part of the job is the chaotic schedule. However, customer satisfaction is the greatest part of the work that can be found at lowes"

good,Lowe's is a company that has the potential for employees to advance. A typical day at work was very fast paced with interaction of a diverse group of customers and co-workers as well. The co-workers worked as a team in order to provide customers with great service. The hardest part of the job was working in the heat in the garden center during the summer months. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers.

good,good work environment people are good to work with and nice place to work
good,I love working retail and I love home improvement. I enjoyed helping people create something and improve their lives.
good,"Retail is and it will always and forever be the same, this store is no exception. Having many different departments with about 4-5 employees throughout the day definitively makes customer service an easy task to preform. Even though sometimes it seems as if the core values of ""being a team"", are overlooked by even some of the higher ranking managers in the store."
good,Assist customer with kitchen/bath design upsell kitchen appliances and cabinetry. Salaried position would work on average 50 -55 hours a week if required. Responsible for productivity of hourly staff with daily goals and department task.

I have learned how to multitask, organize myself to complete my goals, communicate with customers, make angry customers happy again to avoid further issues, sell, reach goals. I have a little bit of a management role at times with assigning worklists, following up on them, and training personnel. i work very well with my co-workers and its a teamwork mentality. the hardest part of the job is satisfying every customer, because not everyone wants what you have to offer. So you have to sell them into what you want them to buy. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people interaction, both customers and co-workers."
good,"Working at Lowes was a wonderful experience. The employees treat you like family and it was always nice going to work where you know people genuinely care about you. I learned a lot about home improvement while working there. I got to know a lot of the contractors on a first name basis. They taught me a lot and in the end they knew they could come to me for new ideas on how to fix or design things. That was the most enjoyable part of the job, having people trust in my knowledge that I gained while working there. One of the hardest parts was to actually gain the trust of some of the customers. I started out as a cashier and ended in the Hardware Department. Most men do not like asking a young girl for tips on home improvement. I proved myself to all of them."
good,"I enjoyed working at this store. We went through two store managers and they were both great. It was fun learning to use the lift and I enjoyed the physical labor. It was a lot of fun dealing with the customers. It was a little stressful at times while helping customers in areas that I had little knowledge of. Overall , I'd say that they are a great company."
good,"Working at Lowe's was what you would expect. After training, I was assigned to work at the lumber/contractor check-out area. I was told this was because they thought I could be trusted to work alone with little supervision. I liked it because I had steady weekday hours. I did learn some things about lumber and building materials. I enjoyed the customers. I saw some of them repeatedly because they were contractors that came in regularly for supplies for their jobs. The hardest part of the job was being bored in between customers, which after the first few hours of the day was a lot. I was not allowed to leave the register area, so helping out in a department was not an option. I did enjoy my co-workers, most of them were helpful in teaching me things about the lumber/building supplies area. Managment was ok, I did not have any problems with them at all."
good,"Helped several customers, learned how to use register, do special orders.

The hardest part of the day was trying to help customers that could not speak any English. Management was always available to help with any concerns thru out the work day."
good,"Shift started at 6pm til 4:30 am.Monday thru Thursday. In's, and out of getting product in the warehouse, and out to the stores.

I have gained great customer service and organizational skills through this company by collaborating with customers as well as employees, and management. Management at Lowe’s seems to have to many micro-managers running the store; I get told to do one thing and and than get told to do another thing by another manager. Though, I get along with everyone including managers and co-workers. Lowe's is flexible when personal family needs or schooling, they are great on that. I haven’t encountered many hard parts of the job but if I have a weakness I will either ask for help and remember how to do it next time. The most enjoyable part of the job is making the customer leave happy so that they come back."

good,"A typical work day included me completing customers' returns while maintaining a clean and safe environment for customers, co-workers, and myself. I definitely learned how to multi-task; on some occasions I also was asked to help on register or in customer service. I learned to appreciate working in such a busy store."
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for the benefits are good the pay is equivalent to other local businesses and the people are friendly
good,"I begin my day by greeting customers and coworkers. I take my position at the register and process purchasing fees for the customers, as well as answering any questions they may have, to the extent of my knowledge of the company products. If there is a question that I can not answer, I proceed to locating an associate to the particular department of which the customer is inquiring about. If and when I can not reach an associate, my next move is to locate a department manager or the next available associate/manager."
good,"The company was staffed with great management, competent coworkers, and had an overall positive direction. The company culture was one to be emulated. The strenuous work was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the friendly customers and being able to find solutions to their dilemmas."
good,"okay place to work good management. good hours, friendly enivroment"
good,I develop and excellent team because of my on hands management style so I always go the respect that I needed. I its hard to grasp all your departments when you are over I nside and Outside garden area because of the short window to capture the most sales for the store it weas much better this year givin the help. But you dont have much time to address the neccessary other department like Electrical and Plumbing as well as having to make sure the store is being address if givin strong department managers who are willing to step up you can master a very smooth transitional day at work. I guess I take on alot to do all that I can where the associates always called me because I was always on the sales floor and not sitting in the office sending out email and texing I know this is the new day and age I am very energetic and willing to assist where ever is needed. I had the best team in inside and outside garden we work together when ever it was needed they could rely on me I also rewarded them letting them know I was there.But it was hard to know other managers were in the building but they would always call on me. I didnt complain I JUST WOULD KEEP GOING. Rating of Lowes an 8.
good, Sales and customer service
good,"A great job for a college student, fun and exciting.Pleasant envirnment to work in."

good,"I worked the cashier,checking out customers. The hardest part was trying to keep people from stealing, The most enjoyable was going above and beyond for customers."
good,"I show up for work around 9:15 pm. My shift starts at 9:30pm and ends at 6:00am. The crew and I usually sit for awhile discussing our day we had and then we begin working. I stock the shelves with new product that has just been delivered, after our break we start cleaning up the store for it to open. Our boss is pretty cool, he is new to the shift, but has been a manager before. The guys I work with are well rounded and fun to be around. The job it self is not hard at all. We enjoy are breaks due to we all sit around and joke with each other."
good,Great opportunity to advance within the company. Diverse co-workers and a great environment to work in
good,the hardest thing was to c the customer go some where eles because we didnt have what they needed or the employes that only came to work to get a check and not the customer
good,The most enjoyable way to explain a typical day is work. You are designing great inline spaces and free standing units. Working alone as well as in a team enviroment. The Management was lacking most of the time. The individauls that work here are awesome in everyway possible. The hardest part of the position was leaving due to the economy. The job and the individuals are the most enjoyable location I have every worked at.
good,Stocked shelves for up coming days of operations. Met quite a few good people to work with and be around.
good,"Through this company, I had the opportunity to grow from from a front desk associate, to a sales coordinator, and ultimately an assistant general manager of a thriving hotel."

good,Lowe's has been a great place to work over the years and has taught me quite a bit. You end up learning various aspects of home improvement without even noticing you learned it.
good,Lowes is a great company to work for because they encourage and support personal development in management skills.
good,Start out with a meeting to prepare you for the day the excitement that they deliver all different training in many areas the management was very good they look for you ability's and recreated your weakness into great strenghts my co-workers were very challenging because a promo kepted us competing the hardest part was inventory the most enjoyable part of the job to be anounce as top leader in the market area beating out major populated stores

good,It is a structured place where they heavily focused on team values.
good,"My work flow just required me to help the any questions, purchase and issues they may have. I learned alot about the different types of paints, home merchandise and plant types for different climate types. My co workers were all hard working and kept to themselves. There was no hard part to the job. I enjoyed helping the customers as usual and thats about it."
good,Worked for Lowes for 20 years great place to work. I will miss everyone that I had the pleasure to work with.
good,Decent place to work. I enjoyed meeting all the customers and getting to know them.
good,"Lowe's has been my all time favorite job in my working career so far. I love the people that work there, the managers, the benefits and the customers. It is very fun working there and fast paced in the peak seasons. All the employees are very friendly, helpful, and fun to be around. Everyone the has an overall great attitude and work ethic."
good,"A typical day at work for me consists of ringing customers out. My managers are nice people, annoying sometimes. I love most of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is memorizing where everything is and directing people to the right department."
good,"I enjoyed working there, I made alot of new friends. We always had a good time, and helping each other out. Enjoyed working and helping the customers. I chose to leave and return to my previous employer."
good,Unloaded truck in morning and worked through out the day putting up stock.
good,"A typical day at Lowe's had a lot of one on one customer focused interaction. Many different departments to get to know. Everyday was always a new experience. I learned many different things during my time at Lowe's. I leared how to cut glass, how to bulid many different things and gained new knowledge on the various types of power tools and hand tools. I was one of very few people that were cross trained for all departments. The management there was constantly changing but for the most part they did a good job. The Co-Workers were great. I made it a point to talk with everyone of them at least once a day. The hardest part of the job was Closing the store. There was so much to do in such little time. The most enjoyable part of the job was doing deliveries. It was almost like a well deserved break."
good,"Great work environment, pay and benefits. Just be prepared to do a lot of standing around. Outside lawn and garden cashiers get left outside for an additional 15 minutes after shift because management forgets about them. Overall, good company to work for, but boring job."
good,"I was a cashier. I stocked shelves, helped with customer service and returns. I loved the people and learning about the products. The people were really helpful."
good,"I started off working on the floor with costumers 40 hours a week as an summer position. I moved my way up to a part time permanent employee. I picked up how to do my job on a daily basis and perfected my craft. The hardest part about the job was dealing with the light boxes of light bulbs.there wasn't any enjoyable parts of my job because its a ""job"". I come to work to fulfill my duties not to have fun."
good,This companies benefit package is second to only one other. There is ample room for advancement. The work enviroment isn't bad either. The only problem I saw working with Lowe's was this---- When your employees tell you somethings bad at least look into it. If they had I would still be there today.
good,"I learned more than I expected to learn about night stocking and recieving from my time at Lowes. at recieved extensive training in the process of becoming certified in forklift, reach lift, cherry picker, and electronical pallet jack operations."
good,It was great to be around those people who work there. I enjoyed the fact that I learned about the products sold in the store.

good,"Very stable and low hours. Good pay, nice management, and fast pace."
good,While most places will have issues as with any work place the pros out weigh the cons and one store does not speak for the rest of the company in regards to how it is ran.
good,Great opportunity for advancement. Serves it's purpose for a job. Life is what you make it.

good,"I've worked with this company for almost 5 years in May. Working there has helped me grow into the person i am today by bringing me out of my shell. I am now comfortable with talking to people, customers, and associates. I recommend this job to people"
good,I came to the company after Home Depot would not allow me to transfer stores. Lowe's si a complete different animal. I felt as if they actually care about their employees vs home depot. They really worked with me on training for a position I thought I would never be able to achieve and they were very flexible with positions during my pregnancy. After I came back after having our child they worked with me to acquire the best positon as well. Thumbs up to Lowe's!
good,"I loved working at Lowe's but due to lack of cashiers, I was forced to work almost every weekend and that was hard for me to do because of horse competitions."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my experience very much at Lowe's. It was a learning curve for me because Lowe's combines a warehouse atmosphere with a retail environment, but I was able to catch on quickly."
good,"Lowe's was a good place to work. I started out as a seasonal employee and two weeks later offered a position at customer service desk. Two months later offered full time, Which you can only work 39 hrs. per wk. I got pregnant in my 8th month of employment and I asked HR to place me on part time. Was refused and I miscarried two weeks later. I was out five days while I was going through my miscarriage and came back to find that the store manager had placed me down to part time status with only 10 hours a week. An employee their went and told the store manager some lies. I was called into the office with five members of management and I advised them that their was no truth in what this employee had told them. I quit and I contacted corp about what had happend and they investigated it and awarded me my unemployment benefits. The only thing that I disagree with is how the team of management treated me. I enjoyed my work and the employees and dealing with the public. I do miss my job but, I have to move on and find a new job. I am focused on finding a job in the areas of work that I have done. But, willing to learn new things and I want to advance in any job that I do."
good,"It's a really great place to work at if you're a student or if you are only part time. They work well around your school schedule and they understand if something comes up. Everyone is very friendly and you feel welcomed, as a new worker. Managers are also very respectful and nice, not very intimidating."
good,I left because I had a problem with my manager the other manager were cool fun my manager was not he has something against me so I was let go buy him.
good,"I enjoyed this job. I loved meeting new customers, and how focused we were on customer service. Very understanding management team, the ability to grow and advance is there."
good,Honestly this was my first retail job and I loved it! My favorite places to work was lumber and outside lawn and garden. The staff was so friendly. It’s more like family rather then co workers. I would definitely work there again.
good,Nice place to work.  Everyone is friendly.  Management is happy as long as you do your job. Customers are also friendly.  The pay is good and benefits are offered to part time employees.
good,Great customers and hard working staff. Lowes has good benefits and job security. They work with their employee's to balance home and career. Career advancements always available for the hard working individuals.
good,Professionalism was of great significance towards my productivity and genuine customer service ethics. The concrete stability gave me room to further my career and options on going to college at this time.
good,This company is a decent company to work for.  They work alt around people who attend school and the benefits are good. There is shift work involved if you don't mind shift work.  The store that iWork for is amaizing but I have noticed that the company is starting to decline as far as the way they care for their employees.
good,The staff at the Saint Robert MO Lowe's was great! Everyone great customer service all of the time and could rely on each other if someone needed help.
good,"They always understood if i needed off. They also worked with my schedule, considering I was in school at the time.  The kind coworkers and customers made the job easier for me as well. It was just a great work environment."
good,Lowes is one of the best jobs I have had they value there employees and the customers and most every one works as a team that the one I worked at it also was a fun experience
good,"With plenty of restructure over the last couple years, the company continues to evaluate the core focuses to continue to succeed with many online competitors. The Customer continues to be the driven focus and providing excellent customer focused service each and every day."
good,"Lowes is an excellent company where you  could feel like family, you manage a life balance, the company is focuses on giving you the necessary training to be able to play your role within the company"
good,Great place to work for 10-20 hours a week to make an extra buck!  PT benefits include paid vacations and holidays and don't forget about the employee discount.
good,"I really enjoy meeting people so the most enjoyable part of working at Lowe's is meeting and getting to know the customers. My co-workers become like my second family. There are good and friendly people working at Lowe's. Since my position is cashier, my typical day is taking good care of the customer, whether it be to check out purchases,helping locate a product, or assisting customers with any returned purchases. Lowe's uses the DOS systems in all their programs, so I have learned how to operate the registers in DOS mode. The hardest part of my job is the boredom that comes with slow sales days, especially since I like to be busy. During slow months, the company does cut hours, which is the reason I'm seeking other employment. Overall, Lowe's has been a very good experience. I'm happy to know I can still have association with everyone since Lowe's is where I'll be shopping for my household needs."
good,"Friendly environment, willing to help in your development and success. Plenty of work and sometimes overtime. Focused on customer service and employee success."
good,"+ :"
good,I enjoyed working at Lowe's - one of the best managers I've ever had. No micro managing and able to do your work. Organized with good teamwork. I would recommend working at Lowe's
good,"My time at Lowe's was both fun and educational. However, it was in retail and retail at entry level doesn't pay enough to afford the things I wanted. The work environment was great. People I worked with were fun. Only reason I left was for substantially higher pay at next employer"
good,"It was a very exciting work environment, working with coworkers was very easy and manageable. Customers were easy going and were very patient. I was able to work overtime if needed."
good,"Lots of being on your feet. Cashier and basic customer service responsibilities. Very stationary, though I was moved to the lumber side of the store where it is more contractors. In the regular retail area it's mostly just small customer orders that are scanned quickly, while in the contracting side it's more large orders with higher quantities."
good,Great Company to work for. The people you will meet and work with are amazing and it will be the Hardest thing that i will miss about not working there. My Position was eliminated but i have no regrets. Retail is tough no matter where you go. Thanks Lowe's for everything.
good,"I enjoyed working as the department manager I was given almost complete control of the department, my team, scheduling, and taking care of all customer service issues."
good,I learned alot about retail working for Lowe's. It was a great company that seemed to drive both service to the customer as well as maintaining employee morale.
good,"In semi-retiring, I was seeking a new opportunity that required part time availability and provided a totally new experience.  Scheduled to arrive at 530 am on most days, I found the variety of tasks and responsibilities to be refreshing.  Management has a tremendous workload upon their own shoulders, so checking in with the department or store manager regarding any special priorities for the day was the first thing undertaken, daily.  Workplace culture was good and what you make out of it.  Most challenging portion of the position was (at times) maintaining phone and customer service response for 2-3 departments simultaneously, due to employee call outs and late shows.  Most enjoyable part was making sure every customer either found what they came for, or more!"
good,"Hard working and always had something to do. The job consist of  assisting customers to the fullest of my ability. Wheter i load,guid,or show them what going on."
good,"Human Resource Generalist duties including recruiting, interviewing, orientations, training, benefits, compliance and development of new and existing associates. I’m"
good,"Relaxed environment. "
good,I have been with Lowe's for almost 9 years now. I have been lucky to have leaders that strive for their employees personal growth. Training and knowledge is available if you want it.
good,"The stocking job wasn't the best of best jobs, but the atmosphere and friendly co-workers made up for the bad.  The overall store was kind of unorganized with overstock.  Hard to find places to put stuff when the overstock is full."
good,Lowes is a good company to work for and has pretty good benefits  they have flexibility in their schedules  management is nice and always willing to lend a hand when help is needed
good,"Its hard becoming fulltime. Need to offer ft jobs to seasonal workers 1st."
good,A day at Lowes customer service and dealing with internet orders. it was either dead and we just cleaned and put up returns and I would check the online orders every Friday to make sure they were still in place. Most of the people weren't bad to work with at all! very fun loving individuals. recently policies have been changing over and over again and it is very unprofessional now. just need a change.
good,"They schedule comes out and the expect you to check it daily. You basically on call daily. Hard to plan with your family. They expect as a Team to go bring buggies in during shift and at end of night. Saddly they hiried 3 guys to do the lot and the just flirt with young ladies and not there job. Time to go at end of your shift, you have to wait because you are lock in and the manager will take their time.  Good Luck.  will come"
good,"Lowe’s is a great company to work for , they are able to work with your outside life by working around your availability. They are problem solvers and make sure that every question you may have is answered in the most helpful way as possible. They will work with any problems with outside life , and make sure you get hours to have time off and still get paid ."
good,"I liked meeting and helping different customers with their needs. During the spring and summer I would help with the plants. I would help water, put out plants and mark them down. I also helped load cars. For  Christmas I would help set up the Christmas trees and pull them out for the customers. Everyone had to help keeping the pine needles cleaned up for safety reasons. For the three months lawn and garden was closed I was a cashier inside, pull internet orders, worked on the floor stocking, and helping customers. My daily task changed with the seasons. What I learned most was I like a changing work environment. Management would always greet you when they saw you. If they had time they would ask you about how you are doing. if we had a suggestion for improvements they would listen and make any corrections needed. We got to enjoy longer lunches to go to the employees barbecues with a dunking tank to dunk upper management or to play games. Once month there was something going on for employees. They also set up a program for new employees to have a mentor help them. The hardest thing I did was give my two week notice. I knew I was going to miss my co-workers and customers.  I still enjoy the friendships I made at Lowe's."
good,"I really like working and helping the customers with locating and assisting with the information needed for products. I stock shelves, ran cash register, load car with products. Clean department and put up displays. Also processed credit card payments."
good,"I loved working at Lowe’s, it’s definitely not your average retail store at all. This is a steady paced job for someone willing to listen and help people. Not only are you helping customers but your literally connecting with them in order to better improve there living. If your a good listener, problem solver, or critical thinker then this is an ideal job for you!"
good,"Loved my employment here until I had an issue with a fellow emoyee who came to work daily High, smoked on her breaks, who was with the company for multiple years. She was lazy and refused to do her job properly and tried to use me as a scapegoat. When push came to shove management and HR refused to help me. So, I quit."
good,"Pay was average, working conditions were fine. You've shopped there. You can pretty much see what the deal is. They treat the workers fairly and well, in my experience. I worked the Lehi store in Utah."
good,"Lowe's is a very customer-focused environment with a wide array of job areas that can suit almost any potential employee's needs or expertise.  The job is rewarding, whether that satisfaction comes from helping a customer in need, or getting a difficult task done throughout the day."
good,"The management is great, job is easy going, not too hard as long as you do what you're supposed to. other associates are a real pleasure to work with, friendly work environment"
good,Par rate too low..and members should be cross trained for multiple departments.  Management positions should be easly available and training should be available.
good,"Start at entry level, but advancement can be quick with the determination and the desire to do so. Fun atmosphere and very good health benefits are also good incentives."
good,"Lowe's is a fast pace environment.  Must be a self-starter, goal setter, and seek out learning and training individually.  Advancement opportunities are available if you become knowledgeable in other departments."
good,"Opportunity for advancement "
good,"My every day life at Lowes was helping customers, down stocking, safe areas, and the people I work with.  As far as management it was ok I never had a problem with any of them and I learn a lot from my management team. I would say the hardest part of my jobs as being a manager was taking action towards people meaning writing them up. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and solving customers projects that they was working on."
good,I was trained in a pilot store and Corporate came in often. I learned first hand the Company Culture and fell in love with it. I was fortunate enough to have a great management team and learned so much. I transferred with Lowe's across the country to different states and really enjoyed most of the stores. It's really too bad someone from Corporate can't be at every store.
good,"Requires much of your time on your feet.  Use of work cell phone and laptop.  Salaried position.  Merchandising, supervising multiple stores.  Interesting, fast pace and will keep you busy."
good,Great benefits/pay and enjoyed the people I worked with. I loved the work I did interacting with associates and customer/ potential applicants.  Great customer service.
good,My typical day at work will be verifying the floor and my papers . Checking the orders for customers and complains . Ordering merchandise from the warehouse and vendors . Verify the employees on the floor and evaluate them.
good,I love working at Lowe’s and I love my co workers. Lowe’s doesn’t tolerate harassment of any kind or discrimination. Ok pay but awesome benefits. I have no complaints. Lowe’s really takes care of their employees and families. I am so blessed to be working there.
good,I’ve learned a lot working at Lowe’s and it was my first time working retail. They have great benefits and for the most part will try and work around your schedule
good,"I worked extremely early mornings ranging from 4am-5am."
good,Filling shelves and tables with flowers and plants. Making sure plants were watered daily. Working managers were part of the great team work. Very hot during the summer and cold during the winter. Loved being outside and talking to customers.
good,Good environment overall. Managment is good and very understanding. Co-workers are always willing to help each other. Hours take some getting used to can sometimes be difficult to balance with home life.
good,"This is the best job that I have ever been offered since I moved to Florida 20 yrs ago (  :  I have been working at lowes for 2 and a half months and most recently was terminated due to no fault of my own, the company decided to hire outside contractors to replace the employees to do the same job for less money, this does not seem fair to all of devoted employees thathaveweaboandbeyp"
good,"Me dio la oportunidad de trabajar con exclusividad en servicio al cliente, pero la empresa bajo en sus exhibiciones y normas de seguridad, siendo 60 dias el maximo de dias de seguridad de empleados sin tener accidentes."
good,"I really liked working at Lowe’s because everyone was super friendly and didn’t rush you to learn everything very quickly. Pay is good, especially for starting out at the bottom."
good,"Fun place with lots of opportunity to help customers. Very friendly co-workers. Typical big box. Sometimes staff was too short. However, I felt that the management at this store was very respectful and fair!!! Lots of opportunity to learn as much as one wants to learn. Training could be better for the sales applications."
good,"The job is decent for the pay and OT is offered quite frequently. You may experience a stressful day or two out of the month but nothing too drastic. The work is as easy as you make it. If you show up every day, the work won’t stack up and become overwhelming."
good,Great place to work keeps u busy so time flies. People there are great and customer friendly. Never boring can always learn new departments. You also get a discount to work there!
good,"I love working for Lowe’s, it’s like having an extended family. We have lots of fun and work extremely hard to met our goals. Everyone is important to making the team successful."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent working for Lowes. The employees were knowledgeable about their respective departments, as well as friendly to me during my employment there."
good,"Worked at Lowe's as a product service associate, responsible for daily execution of in-store VSM projects. Which consisted of the merchandising of new and existing products. Perform these task with little supervision, and maintain an excellent quality of work."
good,"It is a good company to work for. The management are very helpful and friendly, as well as a friendly culture. The hardest part of the job is having to lift multiple heavy boxes in very hot conditions, but the most enjoyable part is being able to talk to friendly co-workers."
good,Lowes was a fun company to work for where i learned many applicable skills for life as well as future careers. While working there i learned many team work building techniques and was able to get certified in three different types of machinery
good,I took another job making more money but in hindsight Lowe’s was the better one. For the most part if you did your job no one ever bothered you at this job.
good,Good working inviroment frendly and welcoming. Teaches a lot to trains and lets u Lear at your own pass. also cares about there employees. Lowe’s really cares about costumers and employees.
good,Overall a good company to work for. The management at my store are pretty laid back and approachable. Management will to help if you need it. Scheduling is fair and consistent.
good,"Lowes is a decent company for mature workers.  Inexperienced retail workers are not encouraged here because management spends so little time micro-managing.  You really have to be self-motivated and a go-getter to succeed here, but there is room at the top, especially if you used to work for Home Depot."
good,Nice place to work. If you really work. Not for lazy peopple. Pay can be better and air pollution in the facility is a big problem. Temperture is hard to handle sometimes. But still better than other places to work.
good,"The fast-paced, friendly work envrioment was great at keeping me busy enough to enjoy the days I worked. Everyone I worked with was an amazing friend to me, and whenever I needed help there was always someone to the resuce."
good,"I loved working there. Some departments required hard manual labor. They usually pay very well. I enjoyed the work environment very much. Some stores have good management, others not so much."
good,It is fast paced which makes the day go by quickly and the majority of the customers are also a pleasure. There is plenty of room for advancement and the training was simple.
good,When i started the training was great and very informative. The training is not like this anymore. Most of management is pretty great the others worry about how they can through their weight around and be rude.
good,I was a Cashier/Customer Service Representative which was fun and very slow at times but it would get really stressful when I was the only person at the service desk alone and had 5+ people wanting to return items or pick up orders and even apply for credit cards and also answering phone calls while doing all of it. I would call for help from the managers but they were busy dealing with other customers. the managers were always nice and fun to work around with and did always have your back.
good,"The store that I worked in for a year and a half was wonderful. I was a part-time customer service rep and was paid very nicely for running a register. I also earned PTO as a part-timer. My coworkers were great and always supportive. My hours were consistent and I worked only on the days that I was available. I was available Tues, Thurs, Sat & Sun. I was never asked to work on a day that I wasn't available (including black Friday). Raises go in yearly and automatically on your anniversary date. Management can be a little inconsistent. My first store manager was exceptional. The second one that came is wasn't as good. Nice guy just not as effective. I always recommend this particular store to friends when they are looking for work. I've heard stories about other store locations but this one has a reputation for being one of the more enjoyable ones to work at."
good,Felt like I had joined a very large family whenever I started the job there and it was a very good time. I first learned to drive a forklift there and that has helped me out exponentially.
good,some employees are very hard workers while others seem to be found.  The company is very community oriented and supportive of volunteer work by the employees which is nice.
good,It was ok but not much opportunity for advancement. The job was easy. The manager stayed off your back most of the time. The benefits were on par with most other companies in the area.
good,"the pay was good, they worked with you on your hours, some of the management had their favorites.  the culture is friendly and safe. if you are with the company for long enough there was room for advancement."
good,I spent a little over 2 yrs at Lowe's and really gotta chance to see the bigger scheme of things play out. Most ppl I worked with were awesome and very friendly. Management was even pretty cool (only a handful)

good,It’s a great place to work. Some things could be changed there but the store I was at is in a rebuilding process to up the sells. But need more hands and feet to be able to get the job done there.
good,This time of season is very busy and stressful at lowes.  Just seems like we don't have enough employees to cover.  There is always room for improvement.  The employees are great to work with.

good,"Lowe's is a great company that has provided me with invaluable growth  as A HR professional. The company offers very competitive benefits and has a employee friendly culture. I enjoyed my thirteen plus years at Lowe's will always be a customer for this company. The new CEO seems to be taking the company in a different direction but I hope that it maintains the sense of ""Family"" that has allowed the company to be successful this far."
good,"Wonderful people."
good,The work atmosphere is mellow and inviting. If you're willing to learn there's plenty of chances of likely advancing your skills. Cross training is provided so get all you can.
good,A typical day at lowe's you see a lot of the same customers again and again. Lots of them are contractors or labor workers. It's nice to have people that know you and have a good conversation with about a new project they are working on for their house or just for work. Overall an amazing place to work at.
good,"I took the job right out of college. They offer great compensation and benefits. I wasn't aware that I would be maintaining performance metrics the majority of the time I was their. There is a little opportunity for process improvement projects, and they do empower you to make some decisions. I took the job w/o realizing what I was getting into. Not a lot of excitement, but it is a good place to learn about how distribution works, and they have strong values. The people who work there are great. There is a lot of room for advancement in the company from the Field IE position."
good,Worked nights with a lot of good people. It was a good place to work. Always good support from management. Was a very safe place to work and they offered employee discounts.

good,"Slow-paced, which can be boring. Good pay and good people. Not having to work super late is a plus. During the winter, the store closes at 7, which was awesome. Sometimes we were able to leave earlier. Snacks were usually provided in the clean break room."

good,I actually enjoyed working for Lowe's as a seasonal employee and learned plenty from the experience. Management was very professional and helpful to me.

good,Lowe's is an awesome place to work at managers are very good and they are willing to work with you. Need to work on giving raises to employees though.
good,"Solid management and protection from rabid customers if things escalate too quickly. However, I wouldn't go back due to management constantly saying ""I do not care"" any time I had an issue that I wanted to bring up. They paid me at $12.04 an hour for a year due to my age and experience."
good,I have learned alot about home improvement since starting at lowes. It also gives you good experience dealing with customers needs for their homes and how to overcome any problems they may have.

good,Working at lowe's i learned a lot about a variety of trades. Contractors are always coming in with a good attitude and are patience when the store is packed. Management is also very understanding about work/personal life and try their best to help you in anyway possible.
good,After working at my current store for over a year-and-a-half everybody has become like family to me and it's one of those things where whenever you leave it's going to be a difficult leave because you're going to miss them all
good,Lowes is a good company to work for. The pay and benefits are OK. The down side is the skeleton work force. The pay is good till they say oh by the way your responsibilities now include doing what the those three did before we cut their hours.
good,ok place to work not the best pay. I Dont want to wright anymore so im just rambling to get to the hundred and fifty characters they want me to put in to move on.

good,"Worked part time, was not too stressful and provided enough money to spend, worked with co-workers at front and moved in the store every couple of days. Not much stress but was not my first time in the retail department. Other employees were willing to help and management at the store was helpful"
good,I got to learn more about plumbing and enjoyed working with the people that I had at Lowes. I was a temporary seasonal worker and had alot of flexibility they was easy to get along with
good,"Lowe's is an amazing company. Like I said, I had nearly 19 years of tenure there. I was 100% loyal to Lowe's. I enjoyed the very detailed work, keeping my job functions organized and easily understandable by all customers. I made it a mission when sending out communications and/or publications of reports to never leave a stone uncovered. Never leave a potential question unanswered. I truly enjoyed working with different departments within the company. This not only made sure everyone was on the same page, but allowed you to gain knowledge from everyone else as well."
good,Lowe's was a great for me to work it gave me a chance to prove myself to be a part of your team and I will be always choose to go back to work for anytime

good,"In six and a half years i learned about electrical work, plumbing work, appliances, flooring/carpeting, tools, and hardware. As well as learning supervisory skills."
good,It was nice working there. Sometimes contractors weren't the happiest but that comes with the job. The workers were like my family and to be quite honest I miss it there.
good,Great place to work for your first job. The managers were nice and cared about what they did. The workload was very manageable and the other employees were always willing to help.
good,I worked here after college and did not have much experience.Lowes allowed me to get my feet wet and build my knowledge. I am grateful to them for this.
good,Working for lowes is fun but professional at the same time. Coworkers become family and customers become great friends. You learn to be comfortable out of your comfort zone and great problem solving skills.
good,"The most enjoyable part of any job at Lowe's is the customer satisfaction. It is very rewarding when you provide what the customer needs and making a quick and enjoyable shopping experience for the customer. The environment of the workplace is heavily dependant on the quality of management and associates. If you have associates that care about their job and have good customer service skills and good management in a store, then it is more than likely to provide quality customer service and a well organized store."
good,Lowe's is a great place to work. You can learn a lot from both the customers and the other associates. I love the new direction the company is headed in .
good,Works well with and your schedule. Management very friendly and approachable. Overall job is nice and simple good steeping stone into customer service and sales.
good,Lowe's was a fast pace working environment. There are definitely room for advancement and great opportunities. You just have to be ok with relocating to get that type of opportunity.
good,I would reccommend working at any Lowes. Lowes cares about productive employees. I was blessed with lots of over time and worked hard for some of the best supervisors and management in my region.
good,"A typical day at work consisted on going through the daily checklist of what to get done, while giving customers an enjoyable experience during their visits to the store. What I learned in my position was how to take care of different types of plants, what pesticides to use where, what materials to use to build outdoor equipment, and skills to improve my customer service. Management was understanding during circumstances that arose during my time there. The hardest part of my job was making sure not to over water certain plants that we would receive.The most enjoyable part of my job was getting certified to drive the power equipment."
good,Very friendly and management is great. All employees are very helpful. Very inviting environment and training is very helpful. You can always find someone to help you.
good,Great place to work I love the people I work with the only thing I don't like is the hours and during slow season it's hard to survive on 15 to 20 hours a week and being paid every two weeks don't help
good,"Much like anywhere else you work, as you've been told most of your adult working life, there are good ones and bad ones. I've made a lot of really good lifelong friends while working there. I especially value the way Lowe's takes care of military veterans with a 10% discount, small way to give back. "
good,"Lowes allowes for individual advancement, as far as you want to go the employees will work together and also share information to make responsibilities easier."
good,"Friendly employees, many management changes making if confusing to work there at times. Upper management and middle manage conflict with each other, Sometimes you can feel very lost working there."
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work, the employees are friendly and work together as a team. The company gives you the tools and resources to achieve your goals. Management listened to your needs and concerns and provided solutions. the hardest part was our delivery system which i guess when it come to big box store its a process they work on."
good,I traveled  and was promoted in 8 Lowe's stores in 5 states. The training and promotions were always available. Learning and teaching associates and helping them develop was very satisfying.
good,"Clock into work, check internet orders, pick the internet orders. Most enjoyable part of the job was the co workers. Answer phone calls, take care of customer complaints."
good,"Explained item function, suggested appropriate lighting, fans, construction needs.  Stocked merchandise.  Backed up sales people in neighboring departments."
good,"Lowes was a comfortable job to have for a few years as I was trying to figure out what to do with my career. They did have opportunities for advancement, however, holidays and weekends were mandatory. With a growing family, I was in much more need for more stability at work, and it was with a heavy heart that I left Lowes. "
good,"the work environment was fairly relaxed, the staff was knowledgeable and outgoing. I enjoy my employment here. If the hours where more stable i would love to stay on."
good,"Most fun job I've ever had. Worked there for three years and fell in love with the job and the coworkers. Memories I wouldn't trade for the world. It will get fast-paced every now and then, but your team carries you. The employees work hard and are team players. Management CARES!"

good,"Lowe's gave mandatory breaks to all workers and made sure that all problems were handled in a timely manner. The management listened to all problems that workers had, personal or work-related, and did their utmost to solve them. The hardest part of the job was making sure customers were checked out in a timely manner when the store was busy. What I enjoyed most at Lowe's was the other employees. Everyone was extremely friendly."
good,"I enjoyed  working at Lowe's. It was fast paced in my particular Fashion Plumbing dept, The only reason I have for leaving is my personal circumstances have changed and I have relocated to the Comox Valley, There is no Lowe's 😢"
good,Great place for young and upcoming people in the workplace. You will learn a lot about customer service. Management can be risky in some store areas. Moving up has gotten more difficult over the years and i regret is moving towards the Amazon model of business.
good,Lowe's has many opportunities for people who want just a job and those who are looking for a career.  There are opportunities in stores as well as in the corporate settings.
good,"Had a wonderful boss, good team to work with."
good,"fast paced, customer service,team work,fun, and positive.I learned most departments and worked in all of them.Managements was wonderful.The culture was a team mindset customer focused. The hardest part working there were split shifts I signed up for to add hours into my schedule. Everything was enjoyable."
good,"I grew up around Lowe’s, due to my father being a contractor. I thoroughly enjoy working for Lowe’s. I work with some really great people and enjoy my position in the store."
good,"Assigned as Loss Prevention/Safety, we conducted various safety inspections and preventative instructions for the company.  Working with all groups of employees from each department make the work fun at times.  It is a customer related environment.  If you really want to help someone, you can.  The hardest part of Loss prevention is inventories. but working with people helps."
good,"The job can be fast or slow paced pending on weather and the time of year. Pending on department you usually keep a steady pace, and the management is reliable should you need an override or you have a customer issue you can't resolve. Overall if you need a job and are reliable you and don't have a career path in mind Lowe's is a great place to work."
good,I enjoyed my time with Lowe’s due to the team I was privileged to work with throughout my time as an employee. We always finished our tasks for the day quickly and were able to assists in other store needs.
good,"Fun workplace with great co-workers, some nights were better than others, but overall a good working environment. Job wasn't too hard or difficult and wasn't asked to do more than required"
good,"typical day: selling, cutting, and special ordering of window treatments."
good,Lowe's has great opportunities for career advancement. It is fun to be able to talk to people and help them with their projects. There was constant moving and being on your feet
good,Challenging fast paced ever changing environment.. Everyday is a new journey where you have the ability to coach and train new and existing associates on how to better the business and customer experience.
good,Overall a great place to work aside from one manager I had no issues. The only thing that really bothered me is the heights which I have a fear of. The people there are great to work with.
good,"Sale skills are highly emphasized, communication with customers building relationships to maximize sales, conducting cold calls to local business to increase store foot traffic."
good,Lowes Foods is a great first job or part-time job. Pay is minimum wage but the work is not difficult. Pace can vary depending on the time of day. Hours are flexible.
good,Being a part of such a large successful company was a wonderful experience. Great opportunity to work within a corporate office environment. Professional setting.
good,"I worked as a seasonal HR Coordinator and absolutely loved my job. The people I worked with became a second family, and my position in particular allowed me to meet a plethora of amazing people. I learned so much. Everyone was driven, and we all worked toward a common, clear purpose. I was tragically sad to have to move away."
good,help customers and ring them up. learn to sale and give great customer service. management was great always help when needed it. having to help three to four customers at a time which doesn't happen very often. working with fellow employees and joking around
good,"company pays great and the insurance was awesome. fast pace work environment, friendly customers, company advancement opportunities, flexible working hours."
good,"The general manager was great!,  Lead management was very "
good,"I work Night Shift for the Covington Lowes in Louisiana. I like it for the most part, Easy work. Not really any hard work at all. As long you have basic common sense and good physical health I believe this job you be the job for you. The night manager for me is such a nice, understanding person. The workplace environment is about 50/50 though, There is a lot of seniors working there, As a young man my age, I am a very outgoing, talkative individual. And it's hard to relate or even talk to the older gentlemen that work there. But there is some nights it isn't that bad and their mood changes. But the most enjoyable part of the job is using the lifts. I've always enjoyed heights so that's a stress reliever for me at the end of the night."
good,"Customer service , loading unloading and inventory. "
good,Fast pace work environment. Understaffed at times during heavy flow of customer traffic. Learned knowledge of proper food handling and food processing.  Beautiful displays and promotional items.  Hardest part was the forfeit of breaks to keep up with sales floor.  Over all good place to work.

good,"Lowe’s was a great way to earn money, stay active and healthy at all times. Learn about working in teams and how to communicate and solve problems as a group."
good,I have worked at Lowe's for 7 years.  Throughout that time I have had the opportunity to work with a couple different managers and staff.  I started at Lowe's as a cashier and moved into the delivery department.  Both job duties are fast pace.  The worst part about this job can be dealing with disgruntled customers.  The best part of the job is the managers willingness to work with staff as far as schedules and other issues.
good,From unlocking equipment for customers propane tanks calling code 50s for help with loading giving change clear and drawers out doing drops making a schedule for the day to make sure everyone was on schedule for lunches and breaks and dealing with call offs and so much more I love my job it was unfortunate I had to leave the way that I had to leave looking for something similar
good,I enjoyed my time at Lowes. It wasn't hard to balance work and life but sometimes it felt like the overall morale was low. Always seemed be on a skeleton crew. Benefits are amazing and I honestly miss working there minus the pay and morale of other employees.
good,Lowes is a great company to work for. Product service associate is the best position in the store working Monday through Friday. 6:00AM-3:00pm. Every day is a need new and different projects.
good,"Great company, excellent benefits and always believing in taking care of customers. Flexible working environment with different work/customer challenges hourly."
good,Very good I rellly really really really like work here. It would recommend this place for anyone that needs something that’s part time and just need a little extra cash
good,When I worked there it was a team environment but now most employees just try and push their work off to other people so they can be lazy. Not everybody is like that but some are.
good,"great atmosphere, everyone is there to work. learned a lot about different things such as lumber, tools, appliances. Learned how to key multiple types of locks and many other things."
good,"I loved working with my colleagues and the customers, management was very optimistic about the workers and safety.  They were always looking for new safety issues for the workers and customer"

good,All expectations for employees are clearly stated and reasonable. Management provides workers with all tools and resources to accomplish these tasks and to improve as a worker. Management is helpful and assists employees to become the best they can be at their role.
good,"it is a friendly environment, calm. it is not a heavy load of work where you will kill yourself but at times it gets slow. there is a lot of learning to do."
good,Management could not have been better I feel.  They worked with me when I needed time off and gave me new tasks knowing I could handle a different challenge from my everyday tasks.  Also workers were looked after during the summer with fresh water constantly supplied.
good,Good people work there! Willing to work with your schedule! Try to make it a team environment! Can get hecktick on some days depending on the traffi! But all around good place!
good,"My position required me to stock items, unload trucks, load trucks, remove products for customers, forklift operator, delivery and set up appliances in store."

good,"Typical day at work would involve reviewing sales and operational opportunities to drive sales and expense optimization. "
good,"The position of load puller is somewhat limited to the receiving area, although customer interaction does occur when pulling items from the floor. The shift was also in the evening, so foot traffic was much slower. However, the work environment was okay and finding help among coworkers was not too troublesome. Most of the management was helpful, but spread thin."
good,"Very fast paced job that includes stocking by hand and with power equipment such as a forklift, Tons of customer interaction every day, and had to be ready for customers in any kind of mood. Management there was excellent although communication is always difficult in high stress and fast paced environments."
good,Team work is how most companies thrive. At our store we help each other by not only doing our own jobs but by pitching in when other departments need help.
good,Great place to work.. Benefits are excellent but salary is low. There is a family like atmosphere. They work with you when you need time off. The people are wonderful.
good,The people I worked with were polite and always helpful. I always got the hours I needed and I have to keep typing to reach the one hundred and fifty c
good,"I learned a lot about retail sales from working at Lowe's. I was able to have a flexible part-time work schedule while being eligible for 401K, bonuses, stock options, and discounts even while being a part-time employee. The hardest part of the job was obviously dealing with difficult customers but that comes with the territory."
good,"A typical day at work would be providing outstanding costumer service while assisting costumers with any questions they may have or when they need any wood cut."

good,"Worked at the regional office in mississauga.  Most departments appear to have room for advancement except for IT.  Management is good, brand new office is great with a new contemporary feel."
good,lots of counting change and running credit cards. I learned how to deal with customers and run cash registers. I liked seeing dogs come in on shifts i was working.
good,"Lowe's is awesome. I really love working here. Not for the faint-hearted though, due to the toughness of retail. Must have open availability on the weekends, which is very important."
good,Lowes is a great company to work for. You get 10% off and at Christmas time you receive 20%. They are willing to work with you if and when you need time off.
good,In over all experience  Lowe's offer slot of perks that other employers don't. They are willing to work with your schedule  if needed and  professional.

The managers always pushed having a clean work environment not only for employees but for customers as well."
good,I enjoyed my time at Lowe's and found the work to be quite rewarding.  I felt that the Management team was supportive and encouraged anyone who wanted to excel.  They empower their employees to be critical thinkers and provide exceptional customer service.  I was very fortunate to have the wonderful experience of working with some great mentors and associates.

good,"A typical day a Lowes consist of down stocking to keep everything looking good and having to deal with customers and providing good customer service. Since working at  Lowes I've learn a lot about paint and flooring mostly, I have also have much experience in the garden area with the plants and different kinds of top soil and mulch for the plants and flowers"
good,"I enjoyed my tenure at the Lowe's Service Desk. They provided many opportunities to learn and gain proficiency within a Fortune 50 company. The work/life balance for our team was ideal (four 10s, 3 days off each week!), but after getting in the company wasn't really able to offer any advancement. The job could be mundane at times, but exciting at others."
good,Lowes is a stable employer with possible advancement .  Management is good and working culture is team oriented.  I enjoy working along with others achieving positive costumer service.
good,Daily Tasks included keeping a positive attitude and broadcasting a charisma that was charming and polite for individuals to walk up and greet you with.

good,"Good management team, decent place to work. Flexible hours and everyone seems to want to work there. Overall it was a good place to work and a nice summer job."
good,"I was very fortunate to have my time at Lowes, I learned a great deal about how to improve skills I had knowledge of already, as well as learn new skills along the way. Management was very helpful in times when knowledge was lacking and made sure you understood how to do it on your own before they would leave, making sure no part of the team was left behind. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing genuinely happy customers. Watching a customer leave with a thank you and a true smile on their face was very rewarding. The hardest part of the job was not being able to find exactly what the customer needed or wanted. Whether we didn't offer it or we couldn't collaborate a solution, it was discouraging to have a customer leave unsatisfied."
good,"As students having all these available hours were very convenient and I was able to focus on my studies, however that work environment of a cashier can be very strenuous"
good,"Lowes is an excellent place to work no matter the department.  You truly feel like a team there.  Unfortunately management can be very poor given the wrong people, but that is rarely the case. I just bit into a bad apple.  However,  in general Lowe's can be an awesome career choice!  Because of how wide the selections are in the store, you can easily find the place you love."

good,"Working at Lowes was a great experience. The people were friendly, everyone was happy to help each other, and the management was wonderful. The area was peaceful."

Most of the employees were very friendly, as were most of the managers. I only had a problem with a couple of them. The hardest part of the job was time management sometimes. The most enjoyable part was the family atmosphere."
good,Love it love the people I works with like my managers was there for a lon time my department closed and I decided to move closer to home.was there for almost 10 years
good,"If you do your job efficiently and effectively then you gain the respect you deserve. When you show up on time, never slack off and have a positive attitude then your experience will be great."

good,"Interaction with customers daily as well as contractors means you will stay busy. Very family oriented culture, Hardest part of job was going through third party manufacturers on mainland (6 hour time difference.)"
good,I think lowes is a great place to work. Only been employed for about 2 months but i like it so far. Coming from walmart anything was an upgrade. The pay is a bit low so i dont see myself there for long sadly.
good,"Great co-workers, but monotonous work; not very challenging. This is a good place to work, steady work and hours, also a great way to get involved in the community."
good,It was a great place to work. Only bad thing was that they did not have room for growth. Once you reach a certain level it all becomes political. Many higher positions were filled by outside applicants.
good,"Rewarding career however it can be tough sometimes, especially with new changes.  Higher ups seem a little out of touch with day to day requirements. I learned a lot about servant leadership."
good,"I come in early and clean up the back room, organize, and set up pallets. Then the rest of the guys come in and we work the truck until the truck is emptied or the time is up.If we finish before the time is up, we take out everything that's on the pallets out to the floor to be stocked."
good,Lowe's had a wonderful learning environment and everyone was very friendly you could call Lowe's employees family always a joy to work with. The people were definitely the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,loved working here! It was fun and relaxed and the dress code was nice. Jeans and any shirt and shoes with closed toe and heal.  Coming to work was never a drag!
good,There were a lot of issues with Upper Management in my time at Lowes. A lot of switching and firing out of the blue. Hard to keep track of who was in charge.
good,Working at Lowe’s is like having a second family. Your co-workers and management truly care for not only how you are as an employee but how you are as a person. It’s a great place to work at if you enjoy a fast paced environment and working as a team player.
good,"Great place to work and network with people. It gave me a lot of experience (as an entry level IT professional) in fields like PM, Scrum Master, and Business Analyst. "
good,"My day sometimes starting out at 6:00 a.m. .In that case we would have left over freight to work .AM to do are many inventories .In which we would use that to control what we had and didn't have . After a certain time all of our focus would go to helping customers and providing the various services there we offered at the store ."
good,"Provides excellent training and benefits, good working culture for the most part, as in all companies this size there are some exceptions. Very organized well structured company."
good,"I came home tired a lot, but I got 3 days off to recover and the pay was good. I was seasonal, but they still taught me how to use a forklift and the conveyor belt. The hardest art was just getting through the aches and pains, but it was a decent job to have. The most enjoyable part was when you were left alone to do your job."
good,I loved working here. Customers would come with all sorts of problems or projects. I have been in the industry for a few years so I know about the area and being able to apply my knowledge with their eagerness made for some exceptional creations.
good,"Lowe's is not a bad company to work for. The only reason I want to leave is I want to get into the career I went to school for. "
good,"Ive had a good time here its a very good job ,lots of chances. There is always growing here.Just a slow pace .But offers benefits like 401k  Dental ,vision"
good,Life working at Lowes was not perfect but I would not describe it in a negative light. My store manager at the Macedonia/Northfield store location was probably one of the best managers I had in many years as a professional. My market Manager was fairly new to the position but was fair and readily available. What was probably my biggest complaint that I was told my income potential in the position was limitless as long as I could sell the product. This was true but the person in charge of providing reliable installers to install the work I sold was not able to effectively do his job and this was probably the biggest complaint from everyone in my position with Lowes as a Project Specialist. This severely impacted my ability to achieve a limitless income growth as promised at the time of hire. What I learned is that just because you work for a billion dollar organization you still have to deal with the human factor at many points inside the organization and that can test your patience greatly. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the loss of customers for things that were outside of my control and then hurting the relationship that I built with that customer to begin with. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the install went smoothly and the customers thanked me for the very transparent process I was able to provide them with along the way.
good,"I am sad to say there is a lot of co worker turnover. This is due to the management. I have only been there for about 9 months and I feel very welcome. I will say if there is ever a problem, management tends to side with the customer. One must tread with caution because they hold you responsible for a variety of tasks."
good,"A typical day working at Lowes is pretty high paced and stressful, but we have each other to lean on for emotional and working support. "
good,"I worked in the plumbing dept and had a blast. I enjoyed working with people everyday and learned  a lot from my boss and management. It's hard work and a lot of heavy lifting from top shelves. "
good,This is a fast paced and sometimes stressful job. You deal with mostly great customers and sometimes you have the occasional ugly spirited customer. My direct manager is awesome and great to work for.
good,would recommend for part time employment . Did not like the inconsistency of no set schedule. there is room for advancement if desired they do not discriminate on age
good,Its not a bad job. The workers are fun and easy-going. the only problem i had was the scheduling wasnt too good. we have a lot of workers but on days we needed it we were understaffed
good,Lots of jobs in retail are not great.  Lowes is one of the better retail jobs out there.  Pay is good. Benefites good. Discounts on stuff. Flexible schedules.
good,"There are lots of jobs out there in retail.  Many employers do not value their employees, but Lowe's does.  They pay a little better then most. Good benefits too."
good,"I would help my customers. Then I would get locked in the money room to count the prior shifts net gross. Then start making my lists of all coins, and dollars to get from Brinks when they came to pick up the deposits."
good,"Lowe's was a tight knit company where they seem to care about their employees, at least at my store, and it was a great place to learn new skills and meet new people (whether they work there or are customers)."
good,"Choose your position wisely, based on the type of person you are. If you are the kind of person who can't take being given many jobs because you can't handle stress don't do it especially on holidays"
good,I worked at Lowes for a few years while I was in graduate school. I enjoyed my time there and would even consider going back to work my way up to a store/regional management position.
good,"Lowe's is a good company with great employees, but most positions at Lowe's do not offer full-time hours. My current position allows me only twenty-four hours a week."
good,"My only problem with Lowes was that during your training they never give you an employee handbook which tells you what is expected of you as a Lowes employees. They wait until you do something wrong then write you up and then tell you about rules and procedure in the employees handbook which you were never given!!!!! The training sucks for front end cashier!! They just throw you at the register and tell you to smile and thanked the customer. But never tell you about opening the store or closing that you are responsible for unlocking doors at opening and locking doors at closing!! Mind you this is at the Fort Gratiot, Michigan store I don't know how they do at other Lowe's."
good,Other than the retail hours..The support and tools provided by Lowes allowed anyone to be successful at all levels. The benefits package options were some of the best.
good,Pretty easy job. Made friends so the job was a lot easier. Everybody looks after one another and they have good options for benefits. Above minimum wage
good,"Lowe's has a family culture as well as a team oriented culture.  I loved working at Lowe's but wanted to pursue a career in nursing.  During my time at Lowe's, I made a family with the other employees.  It can be stressful at times when your under staffed, but the joy of helping customers achieve their dream home is an awesome feeling."
good,It’s a great place to work and get experience in customer service.  Gives benefits to part time employees as well full time employees. Benefits are awesome
good,Been several years since i was there but a good company.  I had very good managers at the time but I hear many things have changed since I left. Biggest thing is I wish the A/C would have worked better when I was there.
good,"A typical day of work at Lowe's consist of being ready to start the morning with doing DSHR, which is checking your department for safety violations, then doing IRP, which is scanning aisles for merchandise that isn't on the shelve, then work on the freight if there was a truck the previous day. From working here I've learned how to balance helping customers, and doing a worklist, to make sure everything is equally paid attention to. I'd say the hardest part would be doing this. Sometimes we are swamped with customers and find it often that they need our assistance, therefore making it harder to get our worklist done. Management for the most part is understanding, they expect you to do your best even if that means you didn't finish the task at hands, within reason. The most enjoyable part would be when coworkers are around to assist you. You get to enjoy conversing and working, which makes the day go by faster."
good,Lowes was a good place to work. I developed some excellent professional relationships. Lowes is a very strong company with a very strong and bright future. I only left because I didn't want to live in Albuquerque any longer.
good,Let's just say you'll get plenty of exercise! This was a fun place to work. The people were great! The projects were fun and allowed you to learn new things. It was fun to see how we keep the shelves of the store stocked for our customers.
good,good place to meet various people in the community and learn new things. very easy work most people aready have done theyre research they just need to be shown the product. you don't need to be an expert.
good,"Benefits are ok for entry level job, hours are flexible, relaxed environment, annual assessments are easy, one week PTO, 7 unpaid sick days, holiday parties."
good,team work is key and evryday there is something new to learn. i enjoy it all over all. Just helping the customer with any questions or direction to whatever there needs are. And riding the folks machines getting wood or other products from top stock.
good,"My day starts with setting up and outlining the days work, Making sure product is ready to leave the store with installers for on time service. Working with my team to complete daily task and order management while making customer calls, coordinating install schedule with installers and customers, front end support and helping customers find what they are looking for, One of the hardest part`s of the job is not always being able to fulfill customer install need date, I enjoy using my knowledge to make the customer happy"
good,"During the five years I was employed by Lowes; I worked 8/hrs per day. My co-workers were friendly and helpful, and even though I worked in receiving  I learned and experienced all departments of the store. The management at Lowes was helpful and with the open door policy listened to employee suggestions. The hardest part of working in receiving was unloading trucks out during winter months. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my fellow team associates."
good,It's so wonderful to live 5 minutes away from my favorite Lowe's - a workplace I love going to everyday. For the past 17 years I have been traveling every week - huge commutes! So right now I am falling in love with my hometown all over again. A big part of my falling has to do with reconnecting with old friends. The most enjoyable part of my job at Lowe's is the people - old and new friends alike!
good,I enjoyed the management and employees but the customers are very difficult. They made it hard to continue in the company. I'd work for the company forever if i could.
good,"Lowes is an awesome company to work for. The only down side is their wages are super low compared to other companies in the area. The incentives you can make are enough to cover your health, dental, vision insurence. All around its a good atmosphere. I would rate this job 8/10."
good,"Great store in Radford Va. Terrific Store manager who lead by example, putting together an unmatched team from upper management , dept management , to customer service associates, that set our store apart from our neighboring stores"
good,Unbelievable growth over the last 5yrs. Purchase of Rona creating opportunities. Great management team. Positive environment. Always looking for strong growth potential candidates from within the company.
good,You can do several things with one job title. So you never get bored or tired. Its nice helping customers find there products and gathering there materials.
good,"The people I worked with were amazing. They became my family.  The mangers took care of everyone. I enjoyed going to work mostly everyday . It can get busy, but it makes the day go faster."
good,I enjoyed the employees and managers.  It was fun yet professional. Occasionally there wasn't enoigh hours but most of the time it was worth it to come in anyway.
good,"Lowe's is a fast paced, fair place to work. There is a great opportunity  for advancement. The culture is customer service as first and foremost with employee satisfaction as an essential element toward that goal."
good,"Most days are very busy. Not enough employees to take care of customers. Like working with the public. I've learned a lot from Lowe's, like building materials."
good,"fast pace environment sales volume was great, plenty of work to keep one busy, Benefits and compensation very good,management was mostly supportive,most employees i found to be helpful and supportive of each other. the hardest part of the job was working two or more depts at the same time, the easiest part was the actual selling of the merchandise."
good,"I Love my job is a fun, place to work just too much walking on concrete.  ready to see other possibilities."
good,"The work culture was phenomenal and the company was very employee first. They have several flexible shifts, the manager was friendly and professional, very good benefits, stress free environment, all around good place to work."
good,"This was my first job and it was a blast! The people that created the community were always so wonderful to speak with and help. I enjoyed transitioning from bagger, to cashier, to self checkout. Breaks were scheduled and for the most part, it was never too crazy."
good,"It was a great place to work at, there used to be 4000 people at the corporate HQ, however now there is only around 1500. Many of which are looking to leave."
good,"Walmart was a great company to work for, I learned great customer service skills from the company. The store i was employed by was a very fast paced store. The Management team was great to work for. Advancement was very much encouraged. I really enjoyed working with the public."
good,Constant moving.Fast paced. Requires you to really know where everything in your department is located to fully help all of the customers needs. Definitely walk out with more knowledge about home improvement afterwards.
good,"I made alot of friends working here. I was taught how to handle the toughest customers. Management was easy to talk to. I did run  into some people with bad attitudes, but you learn how to brush it off."
good,Lowe's was a great place to work fulltime while I finished my education. Management was organized and the compensation was very fair. Paid vacation was offered.
good,"We had a team of three and always had a reset to do. It was fast paced and did require plenty of hard work and working without supervision. Communication was key with management, especially with department managers."
good,It was a great place to work until it seemed the bottom line was more important that employee loyalty.  I just wanted to go down a different career path
good,"A typical day you will deal with customers at a very fast pace, then some days none will show at all. "
good,"My unit has the best mgmt team I've ever worked with  You are expected to be on time and work,  You do get 15 minute beaks and a full hour for lunch."
good,The location i worked at had some pretty good people there. the managers were nice and the department managers were good at their jobs. it was all around a good place to work.
good,"Lowes was a great place to work for. Yes it has it's cons, but as far as job security and management and the work itself, one can't complain about it. I would recommend working for Lowes."
good,"Lowes is a company that you can truly grow with and benefit from , they allow us to get power equipment certified. Have the privilege of becoming a lead"
good,"Dealt with the stores Receiving Clerks and associates with ETA’s for the product customers have ordered, claims of missing/lost or damaged product."
good,"A typical day depended on what schedule you worked.  Morning shift would be stocking.  Daytime shift was customer service.  Evening shift would be cleanup, flat stacking and facing product for the next day."
good,"Lowes is a employee friendly company that will do as much as yhey can for thier employees, it is also big o n coustomer service which made for a great shopping experince for our coustomers."
good,"did not want to leave, but the pay was dismal and I had to care for my family.   I really enjoyed lowes and working there.  They allowed you to learn as much as you could to help the customer and encouraged us to be customer focused."
good,"Even though my driving position was eliminated for outside contractor, can't really say anything bad about the company. Managers at my store were great, fellow workers will be missed, I will still give them my business. Good place in general."
good,A typical work day involves customer contact.  Most customers request information on products and require education in home improvement.  Our management staff is always available to assist and help create a non-stressful environment.  The most enjoyable part of working at Lowe's is customer satisfaction.
good,Great place to work quick advancement fair pay good management great people to work with good place to start a career if u want to friendly associates
good,This place is good to work at if your looking for a small side job while in college I would not ever consider staying here for eternity how others have. Management is okay depending on your department. There is a little too much micro managing that goes on and definitely favoritism. People come and go here quickly which kinda tells you something about the company.
good,I really enjoyed working for Lowes. I done a lot of different jobs during my time there. I believe that I would still be there today if it wasn't for the lack of hours and low pay.
good,It was a wonderful to job to have as a student. Managers were awesome at the location I worked at and most customers were great too. Work/life balance was non-existent though. If you have x days off because of class - you WILL be scheduled every.single.day. that you can be available.
good,I loved the job and the people I worked with.  The pay was ok but not great. Store management was excellent.  Pay was controlled by corporate so managements hands were tied and was not able to pay better.  Benefits were great as far as insurance ect...I would have stayed had the pay been more competitive for the job title I held.
good,"Lowe's Contact center is good if you are looking for job stability. Awesome benefits, on-site cafeteria, coffee shop. Management are caring to your needs and are understanding. Always willing to work with you. People at Lowe's are friendly, always giving a smile and saying hello. Hardest part is the job being repetitive, once passed that work is that much smoother. I enjoy many potlucks that teams host. Not good for the health but it brings people together making a very good team setting."
good,Hands down my favorite place. The opportunity to advance in your career was always available. Also the relationships built of trust with customers became very rewarding.
good,"Depending on the management Lowe's was a good or frustrating place to work. The management team seemed to have set the atmosphere.   The store manager was changed every couple of years.   At times it felt like a family atmosphere where everyone cared for everyone, and at other times if felt like people were only looking out for themselves.  The hardest part of the job was many times we worked shorthanded, which frustrated everyone, especially the customers and that came back to us because that made them harder to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was some of the regulars that came in, it was nice to have met so many good people. What I learned on the job, I mostly taught myself, at the beginning of my career Lowe's would send us to product knowledge classes, but one of the many cutbacks was the classes....its a shame, you would think they would want us to take the time to know the material that they wanted us to sell, and sell better."
good,Lowe's is a good company to work for. As a manager there are good opportunities to help people love where they live. Associates overall are glad to be there.
good,"Lowe's can be a great company to work for depending on your life style/schedule. If your a people person and can get along with many personalities, and don't mind a not set schedule in many departments  then this job could be just right for you. I have always been a people person, can work around many personalities. If you have the ability to multi-task then this job could be for you! For the most part I enjoyed most of my time working for Lowe's."
good,"Typical day included filling stock, assisting customers, cleaning, maintaining department, answering phones and covering the front end if necessary.  The company provides benefits for part timers."
good,Lowes is a great company to work for. They offer plenty of room for growth and change with the opportunity for advancement. I loved the fast paced environment.
good,Not interested I'm no longer employed with lowes and like to keep my options to myself it is not my place to say what is wrong or right with any place  because one persons opinion doesn't mattet
good,Being the retail sales manager I worked long hours and alot of weekends. i learned alot about materials for the home. The hardest part of the job was taking care of upset customers. Most enjoyable part was helping people reach there dreams of remodeling or building a home.
good,This job trained me in a lot of different professions and helped me find out what I wanted to do with my life. I left on good terms and went on in pursuit of my own desires.
good,"at lowes you get to learn so many different"
good,Lowes was a family friendly enviroment.  I was part time and management worked around my family obligations and allowed me to balance working and being a new mom.
good,"I learned alot from this job, because it was my first. I learned about it people. its stock, location, and employees. The job was relatively easy nothing too hard about it. Everyday seemed about the same."
good,"Carrying out tasks on whatever equipment you're assigned for the day. "
good,"Fast competitive work place with good team work. Receive your work schedule, pull your products, and load your truck. Deliver your appliances and install meeting customer's satisfaction. Learned a lot about different cultures while delivering their appliances. We had a very diverse and team oriented work place. When working with staff that was pulled from another area because of staff shortage, was the hardest part of the job. When making the customers happy was the best part of the job."
good,Don't get payed for the amount of work you get put threw. Other workers don't see the importance of helping others. But it's a healthy work environment and if you have the right friends there your good to go!
good,"There are many good employees who work hard to earn their living. I realize that there are rotten ones who gives the company a bad reputation. Some employees hide to escape work, some are mean to part time seasonal employees, they are rude to them.  I believe that the store management can solve this problem if they pay close attention to what's going on in the store. I am please with some supervisors and store managers.  They are pretty knowledgeable and experienced in their jobs. They just need to get rid of some rotten employees."
good,"Lowes is a pleasant place to work ,where you learn to love where you work ,and live."
good,"good place to work and good benefits, I would recommend Lowe's to other people that are looking for a good job that is flexible with students and people working multiple jobs."
good,"Overall I really did enjoy working for Lowe's, and i would definitely recommend Lowe's as a great starting place for anyone getting into the work force. With the recent changes I felt my chances to grow in the company were diminished, so trying to make a career out of this company would be difficult. Other then that I would go back and I do enjoy the company as a whole"
good,Lowe's  is a nice place to work sometimes it gets a little out of control with the customers but it only comes in groups we have cook out all the time and peopl i work with r the greatest
good,My mother was the Manager. So finding time where I could/couldn't work in-between my sport focuses was very easy. lovely & friendly staff and homely community.
good,Working at lowes was a great experience for me. The employees were nice but the work environment could be stressful at times. The work schedule was good enough for me.
good,"Everyone here are easy to get along with, we are able to get a lot of work done. We normally restock the shelves, load customers, and pull orders that come from customer service."
good,I really like that place it showed me about working and that was my first job and it was a great job and if I could have the  opportunity to work there again I would and lowe's is a great place 👌🏽
good,Fast-paced working environment. Mostly everyone knows what they should do. Teamwork is always encouraged. Self-motivation is always key here if you want to grow.
good,Lowe's Canada is a great place to work for a career and also for students.  The hours are very flexible which was nice for me while i was in college.  Great work environment and great employees.

good,"I enjoyed working for Lowe's, the management was very good, and liked the benefits. I would recommend Lowe's as a place to work and buy stuff from...."
good,"Great place to work.  Great team and management.  Work can be hard, but helping customers with their projects and seeing them through completion is so rewarding."
good,It is a fairly fun place to work and everyone treats you well. Only negatives I really have is that my manager has a one track mind mentality and does not really listen to me or my coworkers with issues that arise.
good,"Great way to start a career. Salary is good and they have great training. I worked there for 7 years and they have great benefits. The work can be stressful, yet rewarding at times."
good,"Lowe's is not an enjoyable job but if you need experience they will hire anyone. You will have no help and lots of work. The amount of requirements you have to complete in a day are unreasonable and not fitting for the pay. "
good,Lowe's throws you into sharks with no life vest. Not considerably hard work but the lack of teaching is impeccable. If you are good at adapting to new environments and taking leads this is the job for you.
good,"it's a pretty cool place. Working here, i learned a lot about gardening. All the different flowers, soils, and mulch. Never knew the difference until i started working here. It's refreshing really to just be outside and enjoy nature at its best!"
good,"A typical day at lowes is mostly organizing the aisles of your department, and also if a manager gives you a specific task they are usually not hard but are sometimes time consuming"
good,"I actually enjoyed my lowe's experience. I sometimes regret leaving, but I was at a crossroad in my life. Lowe's has GREAT health benefits, easy schedules, schedule flexibilty, and great pay."
good,"I normally get to work around 630 and open the registers before my crew gets to work around 7. I make sure all of my employees are there on time and where they are supposed to be. I usually spend to rest of my day give cash and change to the registers that need it, giving overrides, dealing with customer complaints, fixing IT problems helping out management on tasks that they have to finish. Basically just making sure that the front end of the store is running smoothly."
good,I have  been with Lowes for 4 years  is a great company however  when you are trying to promote with init hard. The company and and  management is  great as well as benefits. The hours are crazy with I didn't work alot of Saturdays as well.
good,overall i really enjoy working here it's a laidback place to work. my favorite department is the garden center because i get to enjoy the open nature of being outdoors.
good,"If you like a fast paced environment this is the place.  You will learn effective communication skills, problem solving and customer service. Always something new to learn."
good,"I have worked for lowes for about 10 years now on and off and I can say that It has been an experience some good and some bad, But I wouldn't take it back for anything I love lowe's The great people I have met there, the stuff I have learned and cross training in all sorts of departments. I would work for lowes again."
good,"Over-all Lowe's is  a great place to work, I love the culture and the drive to putting the customers first. The instilment in every associates to never loose a sale was key for me."
good,"As Head Cashier I was in charge of the interior front end of the store.   I managed approximately 2 dozen employees, worked the customer service desk, opened and closed the store handling all the cash in and out. People were friendly and helpful. Management was great. I would recommend working there."
good,"I am looking to relocate and would with Lowe's if they have the right opening in the location I am going. They have cut back on so many jobs because a few people decided to try out and spend $5billion dollars on a system that failed. Therefore, I don't know if I will have a job opening available or not."
good,"Lowe's is a very customer-based company, they have good customer service and they offer pay based on experience."
good,Excellent job opportunities and great place to grow professionally and personally. They really do care about employees and customers. Lots of different types of work available for all types of peopl.
good,"A great place to work even though there is no room for advancement with Lowe's new structure. The new structure with no more department managers has put a big burden on departments. The efficiency has gone down hill. "
good,I started as a team member and quickly advanced from trainer to salried management. They provide a great culture and training. I have enjoyed working there for over 10 years.
good,"working in differeng areas in the store. time alloted so time is a facture in our evertday work."
good,"my daily job duties is inventor prep, unloading trunks, customer service/sale and department clean up. My Management team in very well in insuring we do our jibs in a quick and safely manor."
good,"Lowes offers many opportunities to mo e up in the retail industry."
good,"I enjoyed working at my store. Management was great and the work culture was realistic for the general public.  Employee morale is good.  The hardest part of the job is the long hours on your feet.  The management I worked for is awesome, caring, attentive, and supportive."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Lowes, I worked as a seasonal cashier and was offered to stay on as a regular after summer ended. They will train you on anything you want to learn but my experience was that I wasn't offered any career growth as in moving from cashier to any other CSA position no matter how many times I applied or interviewed. Eventually I left because I needed full time and better pay for my future."
good,"fun shift ringing on register walking a lot. I have learned a lot about "
good,This career path was a large part of my life and I had the honor to advance from the bottom to the top inside the store leadership chain having worked in almost every job imaginable at the store.  The company continued to evolve and be very forward looking.  I opted to leave Lowe's to take on new challenges at new places.  For nearly 15 years I enjoyed my time.
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowes, because of the people I worked with they were like family. Management was fair and understanding when it came to time off."
good,"Typical day as an Unloader was about persistency and teamwork "
good,If you come in with the mindset you're going to get your work done you will have a great time working here during my time here there were two types of Associates the ones that work hard and never complained and then the other. I had a great experience with this job the hours were decent the pay was good. They were very accommodating when needed. Definitely room to advance.
good,"I've developed a robust assortment of colleges, as well as repeat-customers that personally seek me out for the knowledge that I've gained over the course of many years."
good,Good company to work for. They really care about their employees. Only bad thing was that there were very few weekends off. And as a driver you never knew what time your day was going to end.
good,A typical day at work for me is to help everyone love where they live and make their life easier. I have learned communication is very important and always be safe no matter what. Being a manage to me on what I learned is more than just managing and telling other employees what to do u also have  understand your co-workers how they feel and help them in tough situations and praise them when they are doin well. Safety is first in any job. Lowe's culturally are safety first and and then customers...The customers are always right and we provide excellent customer service to every customer.  The hardest part for me is to train other new young employees that don't want to really work.  I love to be efficient and make customers feel good about there selves by providing excellent customer service.
good,"self explanatory,  learned supervisor skills and great techniques for customer service, the most enjoyable part of the job was connecting with the customers"
good,"A typical day was doing outs and stocking, price changes and waiting on costumers. How to sell appliances and write up orders to be delivered. Management was easy to work for. Workplace was good and friendly. Dealing with rude customers. Meeting new and friendly people everyday. We were like family. Good place to work and learn different things and skills."
good,"It was a good place to work. Got me pretty far and to push my self in finding new things I can do. I was certified on five pieces of equipment, the fork lift, pacer, center Rider, squeeze with two attachments, and pallet jack. I was also in the appliance department and building department."
good,"It was a great place to work i had a great store manager who taught us alot and made it a great environment to work in, Able to talk to management and get positive results. I was able to advance with the correct guidance I was given. Over all a great company to work for."
good,Great for those who like working in a warehouse-type setting. It is what you make it. You get out of the experience what you put in. Their compensation is very competitive and the benefits are great.
good,"I enjoyed dealing with my fellow employees, the teamwork was Great. I really enjoyed the comradery. The hours were good, and flexible. I liked the location."
good,Great place to work as team. Fast pace job. Fun working with the challenge of customers. Seeing or listening to customers projects as they complete them. Team work is essential.
good,"Most members of management are sub par and only put in that position because they are very friendly with the hiring HR. People who work on the sales floor should be given to opportunity to work toward a management title but unfortunately, with Lowe's, if you're good at something you get stuck exactly where you are at."
good,I loved my job and position.  Not crazy about the restructuring that took place.  There is no where to advance to now it is a dead end job but great if you just need extra cash.
good,"Lowes is ok place to work,can be very stressful at times because they put customers always first and even when you are 100% right about something customer will win always. As a delivery driver with flat bed truck you are required to pull and stage appliances and all merchandise for third party truck deliveries and deal with it in the morning most of the time and then make sure you flat bed truck runs are ready if not pull them your self and it is not always easy. This job is for someone with happy attitude and easy going,if you easily get mad for everything then it is going to be very hard"
good,"I actually really enjoyed working at Lowes, however the drive for me was taking its toll even after 2 weeks. I was driving an hour every day to work. I basically would go in and get on the phones as I worked in the call center as an HR Shared Services agent. I would tell people about their benefit options, insurances, severance packages, etc. "
good,"There is no typical day in retail.  But my day consisted of taking care of the customers by providing excellent customer service. I learned so much in my position here, I was given the opportunity to better my self with many opportunities for training in various departments  Management overall was good to work for.  Work culture was providing good service and keeping busy, sometimes stressful during peak hours. "
good,Lowes was a great company to work for as far as pay and duties. I was able to switch position numerous times taking on different roles an enjoyed each.
good,Great place to work get to help customers by answering questions to help them with projects they might be working on. Learn about new products in the home improvement industry. Management there to help easy to get along. People work as a team and help each other
good,lowes is a great place centered around family and friends. please visit the store and make your own conclusion. please visit lowes.com and apply if interested.
good,Provide seamless service as you do everything within your guidelines and ability to assist customers to love where they live and employees love where they work.
good,It's more later back can fall all asleep with the lack of work you have so you have to try and find something o do well the position I have so far other than that it's pretty awesome need another job cause I stay outta state and I need a job where I currently live now had to move close to my mother due to she had a stroke.
good,"I love the people that they hire, it's always been a fun place to work. The only thing is that you may have a problem getting an issue taken care of in a timely manner, some managers have ""better things to do."""
good,"Excellent place to work!  Terrific staff, awesome management.  Good training program and very helpful and tolerant co-workers.  Fun environment.  Great benefits."
good,"Typical day at work was showing up and clearing the parking lot of carts. I would then get a list of things to do from the head cashier. I would help customers load heavy/bulky items into their cars or trailers when asked to. Basically helped with anything around the store that needed to be moved."
good,"I have enjoyed working for Lowe's. As a company, they make every attempt to take care of their staff. They have excellent training on computers. But, when out on the floor, their training is sporadic and they fail implement on the job training. Many people struggle with this problem. You are expected to cover other peoples area of work with no training or knowledge of their area. Fortunately, I have experience in almost every area of the store."
good,"I learned how to run the cash register system.  Most of the management  knew what they were doing and could help in various areas of the stores if needed.  As a cashier here, you were expected to do than just play cashier.  Meaning you were to expected to run returns, clean the bathrooms and take out the trash from them and the front end, along with the managers offices.  If you were male, you expected to do all of the heavy lifting and getting all of the carts at once, with no help."
good,I obtained forklift training.  The management is friendly and helpful in all aspects.  They want you to succeed. The people are friendly and helpful.  The job is hard but you can succeed.  The monthly bonuses are great.
good,"Lowe's is a great company with decent enough benefits, and ample room to move up, professionally. In my experience, nobody 'enjoys' working retail, but the majority of us made the most of it, and as a whole, were pretty close-knit! While some of the managers were quite competent, upper management could have certainly been better."
good,I work the weekend shift which is Fri- sun team member work 12 hour shift 6am -630pm the work varies to department to department but all consist of getting product from one location to another so we can get it to the stores. Management also varies through the shift each shift kind of has its own style but we all have the same values and goals. The hardest part of the job is the hours and maybe the weather condition in the warehouse it changes as the season change
good,"very comfortable work place, however there seems to be a constant throughout the company that long time employees take it upon themselves to govern others as if they are management. Also some management seems to be a bit more partial to some employees over others."
good,"A typical day at work is unloading a truck and receiving the product from that truck using a Purchase Order (PO) that provides you with the name and quantity of products that should be on that particular truck. You learn how to read and understand a purchase order, and if you are unsure about anything the coaches are there to help you and to point you in the right direction. The hardest part of the job is staying awake for 10 straight hours, and the most enjoyable part of the job is the money you make."
good,"Very diverse atmosphere which is great. Management is very helpful.  Exciting products come in and out the store.  You have the opportunity to meet great new people, through giving them assistance."
good,It's a good paying job I enjoyed my time working there. They offer plenty of overtime. The environment was great and my coworkers were nice. Very satisfied with this company.
good,If i could go back and do it again I wouldn't have wasted years of my life being an electrician and would have become a manager here.
good,Lowes was a great place to work but has recently gone through restructuring to help build their brand and keep them in competition.
good,"A typical day at work is fun environment I get to work with great people that make work enjoyable. Lowe's is a hug store and I've been working there for a year and learn something new everyday I was worked. Management is great they go over in beyond to help in anyway they can. My zone manager spent a more then a couple of nights helping me clean in close my department down. This to me as a customer service/ loader at Lowe's gives me a stronger sense of pride in respect for Lowe's and my fellow coworkers. The hardest day for me is getting customers that needs help with installing a product. This is hard because even though I know what is need to be used for the project the customers needs help with sometimes I do not know how to installed them. But I also enjoy it because I have great co-workers that I can call that does know how to install the the product or help with the project, and I get a chance to learn the information so next time I can relay that information to another costumer myself. I enjoy the atmosphere of the company and my co-workers the most."
good,"Overall, I have enjoyed my time at Lowe's. I have learned many aspects of the business. Until recently, there has been room for advancement. A recent restructure of the management staff has left me looking for other employment."
good,Days go by quick here you're always busy doing something. You learn alot of different warehouse functions even though you're in one department you learn a little bit about all the other departments. Management is very helpful when you have a problem or concern. They always keep the employees informed about what goes on and any changes. The schedule was really good also i worked four 10's so you always have time for your personal life.
good,Lowe's is a perfect place to interact and help customers love where they live. We provide excellent care to our customers as well as working great together as a team. Lowe's provides great benefits and truly look at for their employees.
good,"Learned how to help customers' purchases at the checkout and on the sales floor.  Not to mention, where most of the merchandise are at, unless they changed the layout of the store. The employees are very helpful and friendly whenever I need help with something. They always sneak a little fun in work so it's not boring. I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to work at Lowe's."
good,good place to work but the amount of heavy work is a lot. above all good people nice environment but large chance of getting hurt
good,"Great place to work, however not many opportunities for full time employment.  I am currently looking for full time work."
good,Lowe's Foods cared about their employees and started them off at a decent wage. Store level management was awesome and friendly.
good,This place has a very good calm environment. The supervisors are respectful. Management is great & they help in any way they can especially the supervisors.
good,"The workplace is nice, and friendly however there have been alot of scheduling conflicts. There are alot of great workers and it's a great place. The conflicts with scheduling is just a bit off."
good,"I've only worked here part time, so I don't have anything to say about the benefits.  The work atmosphere is very friendly and fun, the management is great.  They will work with you so you can get plenty of time off.  The pay is not great but it is good for that type of work."
good,"Since 2009, Lowe's has afforded me with many opportunities within the company. I have climbed ""the ladder"" promoting and moving to different departments as well as working in several locations from New Mexico to Arizona"
good,I loved working with this company for the past 13 years. Because of a restructure I lost my job yesterday to people who has less talent and less experience than me. Not sure how to rate this company. I love the people I worked with. But some decisions made have really ruined someone life. This happened company wide.
good,"Everyday going to work, I see people who make an effort to make everyone feel included of where they work. Everyone says hello when you see them, and are more than willing to help whenever needed. The needs of Lowe's employers are always in the forefront of any decision made. When management see potential for improvement they seek a way to help you get there. Many people have been promoted into positions where their full potential is put to use."
good,The work environment at lowes is friendly and a great place to make connections and have a long term job. I am not one of those people that works well within a big corporation with multi-level management.
good,"Lowes is a great stepping stone for anyone wanting to progress in the retail industry.  The most difficult part of being manager was obviously was work/life balance, as retail only closes 2 days of the year, so work load can get quite heavy especially around the holiday periods!"
good,"Lowes is a great place for working with the customers and being hands on. Everyday is different is some sort of way whether that be of someone new you met, being able to go the extra mile for someone or even just a random slow day. Most everyone is great and easy to get along with and very helpful. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers i interact with on a daily basis. Its either someone new or someone you may have served several times."
good,"I love the job I do here! I've learned so much from the people I work with. Management has never had an issue guiding me when I'm stuck. The previous department manager I had, was very supportive, and really helped me learn the roles of my position. My co-workers are my second family, and I couldn't get through a day without them. The hardest part of my job, is taking the heat, when things get rough. Weather that's an unhappy customer, or trying to replace a cashier under short notice. With that being said, putting my cashiers first was always a priority, above myself, which then made the job hard as well, going without a lunch. The best part of Lowe's is helping a family, love where they live. The excitement of them buying new appliances, or installing new flooring. It's very rewarding, knowing you somewhere along the lines, helped that person love where they live!"
good,The culture at Lowe's is phenomenal. I've met great people who want to help others achieve the house of their dreams to those who want to help the common person fix a leak in their pipes.
good,I been with lowes for 13 + years good place to work the co-workers are nice to work with management is pretty good nothing hard abt it and I work 4 days a week not to bad.
good,Great place to work lots of opportunities to grow. Ability to learn as much as you want to advance yourself within the company. A good group of people to work along side of
good,Lowes is a good place to work many good benefits and good atmosphere environment lowes offers many good people to work with  the job at hand is well if knowing what to do where to go u need to think about working at a fast pace with limited time and limited work u will need to perform well in order to make good with the company offers year end celebration as well as platiniunm performer lunch the co - workers ok but you will get what u get out of them hardest part being productive at a same performe level without going off your task of what u are doing gotta stay within ur performance range and not  have more one day and another another day must have 120 each day most enjoyable part is knowing payday is by and also time to go home call it a day early day vto etc.
good,"Lowe's was an excellent chance to restore my faith in a corporation's ability to make a pleasant work environment for its employees."
good,Cut  hours bad on regular basis over all very good people to work for.great place to go up in the company for a young person it's a great place of employment
good,Given many opportunities to learn various areas of the operations of Lowes.  Fun Place to work .  Great Management.  People are willing to help and train you.
good,"I had a great experience while working at lowe's. Great management , the coworkers where fun to be around and it was a great place to work. I also worked full time there. If lowe's wanted to hire me again. I would work there."
good,"The environment is laid back and friendly, the staff is very welcoming to new employees, you get to know the regular customers and build a work-friendship, management is very understanding and super easy to talk to and they are very helpful in teaching you how to do something without being rude or judgmental."
good,"Working at Lowes is similar to any other retail career, daily duties include assisting customers and basic upkeep. I have learned how to assist customers to the best of my ability in a timely manner and learned valuable selling tools. The job is pretty simple, co-workers get along better than most. The part of the job I enjoy the most is seeing the customers love where they live."
good,Lowe's Home Improvement was a great part time job for me. It was filled with great people who actually took the time out to teach you what you needed to know about each product. Sometimes I was even being taught while in front of a customer which is a great balance in my opinion. I just did not like the fact upper management wasn't stable. Every now and then we'd get a director who just wanted to complain when there was no room to.
good,It was a safe place to work.  The coworkers were not all that helpful at times because the majority of them around me did not speak very fluent English.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the lines when we were in a rush. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the days that we did not have to work.
good,"At first, the job felt very much like a throw away corporately owned time-waster, but quickly it engaged me physically and mentally. It provided challenge for my puzzle-solving and bodily skills. A good environment that I took much pleasure in. I enjoyed my co-workers and the shipping/receiving manager that I worked under was possibly my best and favorite boss ever."
good,I would start my day by checking the worklist from the day before to insure it had been completed. While at the same time making notes of what needed to be done that day. I would print out my cycle counts and any other report was needed for that day and complete them. As well as making sure all the associates had plenty to do and  making sure that those tasks were being worked on. I would order any hardline product that we needed at the time.
good,"A great place to work, wonderful people, a step up in life. Provides you with skills you can carry on into the next workplace. They care about their staff, and they love the customers, striving to make the customers happy."
good,"I really appreciate the opportunity Lowe's gave me to learn, to get to m meet people. Benefit s are great. To move up you have to work but it's worth it."
good,Was a good place to work. Was able to pick up knowledge about products from other employees. My favorite time was working outside garden center registers. Stopped many people from taking out merchandise without paying first.
good,"•consist of stocking, customer service, keeping area tighty "
good,"Working for Lowe's was actually a pretty good experience for me. "
good,"Working for Lowe's was educational for me, I learned a lot dealing with cash and card handling, deactivating sensors, and making over the phone sales. The most difficult part of the job was our mid-day rush when some of the merchandise customers wanted to purchase had the wrong or no barcode. Nonetheless there was not a situation that could not be taken care of. Partaking in the charity event raising money for children with muscular dystrophy to send them away to camp where they would meet people, make friends, and play sports, had to be the most rewarding thing I've done in a while."
good,"A typical day for me was to come into work verify what needed to be done. This could be anything from receiving products, stocking products, assisting customers, and unloading freight from the delivery truck."
good,"It was a great work experience, awesome managers, well above average pay for this area. They are willing to work with you about scheduling or other issues, good benefits and plans, good opportunities to move up"
good,"Enjoyed working for Lowe's ,very flexible to your needs. Nice place to work, helpful staff. Management is willing to work with you."
good,"During my typical workday, I am responsible for overseeing my teams.I check in and help them with any issues they may be having such as helping them to learn about a product, so they can help others. I keep in touch with clients, update them on our progress and make sure they are satisfied with the promotional materials. I learned a lot about our products at Lowe's and how to communicate with other customers and co-workers."
good,Working directly with customers to provide them with the best product for their needs and contractors to build a consumer base.
good,"Lowe's has been wonderful during my time there. Going in, you are trained in each department as long a you are willing to learn. You can move up pretty quickly, but that advancement is not always secure, so be careful and weigh out your options. Overall, one of the best places I've ever worked."
good,"The company has great benefits, above standard pay, but they overstretch their employees. They expect their employees to do so much with so little help. Employees are stretched thin and over stressed."
good,"I loved my managers and the pay was very good for a starting position. I got enough hours and my opinion was always heard as long as I vocalized it in a respectful way. I was fond of all of my coworkers except a few complained all the time and did not like me because of my positive spirit. I will say I did not enjoy one part about being a cashier due to the fact that I stood in one place all day and could not sit or move around and had to stay in one small area. I would say that and difficult customers were the hardest part of the job. I did love making customers happy though and tried my best to always leave them satisfied, and most of my customers were very pleasant and very sweet to me. Overall I would reccommend others to work there."
good,"A VERY GOOD WORK LIFE BALANCE, hardest part of the job for most people is being on time and showing up for work. Management is great and doors are always open , I like the people the best about the job"
good,"Honestly, Lowe's treats their employees better than any retail company I've seen. I was given a good starting wage, with consistent hours and schedule, and promises of raises every 6 months. They trained me on a variety of power equipment, and helped round out some of my skills on others. They management is friendly and easy to talk to, and the coworkers are people who are a pleasure to know. The overall feel for their workplace is enjoyable. One of my favorite things is their willingness to give benefits to everyone, for a small price."
good,"For the most part, Lowe's is a good company to work for.  Have been with the company for 10+ years and have seen a lot of changes.  The problem with those changes is that they seem to randomly 'try out' new policies and procedures on a monthly basis that interfere or change the current ways of doing things to the point employees get confused on how to accomplish certain tasks properly as to not get fired.  However, that being said, Lowe's offers wonderful benefits including Medical, Auto, Home Insurance, stock purchasing at a discount, employee discount on product, tuition reimbursement, vacation time, and good pay."
good,Good job for someone one needs experience in hands on activities and customer service. Learned a lot about maintenance around the store and around the house. Management is friendly and always up for cross training employees when time is right.
good,Lowes is an amazing place if you want to move up in life and have a higher position. I love what i do but now am trying to look elsewhere and find a position that better fits me.
good,I have learned so much working at Lowe's.  It is a great company and just like anything... you will get out of it what you put into it.  They recognize talent and reward you for your hard work.
good,for the most part leaving the company was pretty hard especially the relationships i made with my co workers. i learned a lot working here... considering going back to work at lowes...
good,"Clean, slice meat, customer service, cook food for chicken kitchen, slice cheese, prepare salads and sandwiches, restock supplies, unload supplies from truck shipment"
good,Great store to work for. Good sense of community and always taking care of employees. Part-time benefits are harsh but the management at my store is great. Everyone gets along and is there to work in a drama free environment. Can get stressful in the spring and summer time and is very fast paced but an overall great place.
good,Nice fun and friendly environment to work in.  It's like working with family! Wonderful customer interactions!  Very cool place!
good,"Good job, loved working with the public, great employees. For the most part great staffing.  Hardest part of the job was competitive sales and the best part of the job was working with good people."
good,I enjoyed working here because of advancement opportunities as well as cross training. I never was bored or without work which made the day fly by.
good,"I had a wonderful experience working with Lowe's. I learned a lot, and gained experience in a variety of areas. Everyone was wonderful to work with, and genuinely cared about each other and their customers, as well as furthering the company."
good,"Great company to work for. Great benefits, pay is okay. Management is trained and are able to keep a stable workplace. The only thing that has to be tweaked is the pay scales."
good,"Primary duties include courteously greeting customers and assisting them with merchandise based on their requests, working with installers in providing work details for customers, and working with department staff as a team to complete tasks."
good,good place to work everyone has been nice since i started and i enjoy being around my coworkers. management is good and is always helpful and willing to listen when you need to talk
good,Greet customers and maintain a positive attitude while providing customer service. Complete transactions on P.O.S. system and keep a balanced cash register.  Control inventory in the stock room by operating a forklift and relocating merchandise.
good,Lowe's always allowed you to be flexible with hours and would work around your availability. Lowe's is great for students who need to work full time during the summer and can work part time during the school year.
good,"Learn what Needs to be Done and do it, Daily routine is specific to your department but all Departments help out throughout the store Learn where things are and assist customers to the best of your knowledge. Management may sometimes give you a boring job but cr*p flows Downhill, Lowe's is almost always being cleaned so get familiar with a Mop and Broom. The hardest part of the Job is Dealing with someone who wants a Deal that just expired and you have no authority just pass it up to management. They throw parties if you do a Good Job."
good,"Store ASM are conscientious and hard working."
good,"A typical day involves interacting with guest/customers by helping them find items and cashiering their orders. I have also been trained in other departments of the store so I am able to be of service to guest in the meat, deli, and produce departments. I have learned to be versatile, handle stressful situations with unhappy guest or employees. My co-workers are usually high school students working part time and can often times be immature. Management over me is the Front End manager, Store manager, and Assistant Store manager. All of them have different managing styles but are excellent to work under in most situations. The most enjoyable part of the job is the local guest that come back and create a friendly work environment."
good,Lowe's is a great place to work for. Friendly people all around and work great with anyone's previous schedules. Managers are very friendly and helpful
good,I have enjoyed working for Lowe's.  The company does a good job of supporting its employees.  The coworkers treat each other like family.  Opportunity for advancement is very promising.
good,Great working environment.  Co-workers were always willing to help.  Management was understandable with life situations. Always opportunities for advancement.
good,I enjoyed working for Lowes everyone worked as a team to get the job done to make sure our customers had a excellent shopping experience. My management team made sure we all were doing what we needed to do and they always had our backs when we needed them. I had a awesome management team. My co-workers were wonderful we all help each other and by helping each other in different departments we all leaned something new each day. The hardest part of the job was when we were low on employees but I can say everyone around the store stepped in and helped as much as they could to make things work I enjoyed interacting with my customers meeting their pets and talking to the little children that comes in the store as their mom/dad little helper just giving the customers the right guidance to help them find the materials they needed and making sure they enjoyed shopping with us was the best part of working for Lowes.
good,"Typical day has varied hours. A lot of your duties revolve around the boom and bust prime hours. Mornings are downstocking and taking inventory, posting sales, cleaning and maintaining machines, placing out powered equipment. During the day continues downstocking but primarily involves customer help. The evening shift is creating displays, handling freight in the back, downstocking, and cleaning up shop. I was seasonal in the Paint department and learned a lot about all parts of the store. The management system of LOWE's is very open and friendly. It is easy to understand, and very helpful. Co-workers come from all walks of life. For some its a part time job to keep busy. For others its a seasonal position. It really depends. The hardest part is the actual physicality of the job. There is a lot of ladder work and carrying boxes up and down for stocking. The most enjoyable part was learning a skill and getting to show off as a professional."
good,"I talked to customers and helped them with finding any and all items within the store. I also helped out on the cash register when my help was needed, as well as cleaning my department throughout the day as it was needed."
good,"A typical day of work would be coming in and being all about consistency, which was fine with me, it was very fast paced. I learned basically to ""do more, and say less"" I got a lot more done that way. The management was decent there at Lowe's, very helpful, but sometimes, depending on the mod, you'd have to fend for yourself. My co-workers were very sweet, most older, so I learned a lot from them. The hardest part of the job was when I was in the Garden Center, lifting heavy bags of mulch was a difficult procedure for a 115lb woman! The most enjoyable part was being at Customer Service, I always felt good up there, I think just having the customers leave satisfied was no doubt the best part."
good,"Going in and greeting everyone, clocking in at the front, than going to the back and grab my vest from my assigned locker check in with the head cashier to see whose break i'm covering and than go to my assigned place in the store, greeting customers daily and helping them find the product they need or answering any questions that they have, cashing out customers or doing a return, My co-workers are all friendly and willing to help out if needed, the hardest part of the day would be the afternoon because that's when it is very busy and there are a lot of people coming in and out the store . The most enjoyable part of my day is when I help customers find what they need or assist them in the right direction."
good,I would come in every morning at 8am and head straight to the back of store where our warehouse is located. I would then review all deliveries that needed to get done that day. Then I would check each and every item that was going to be delivered and make sure all items were not damaged. Then I would call each customer making appointments throughout the day. Then we would load all items onto 2 box trucks and deliver and satisfy each customer. No matter how long it took to get done we were always out till we delivered and satisfied each and every customer.
good,Lowe's is a great place to work. My work/ life balance was the best I had received as a retail manager. Their training approach for a new manager hired from an outside company is very lacking and their computer operating systems are very out of date and so far behind the competitors its a little shameful. But all in all its a great company to work for.
good,"A typical day at work starts with checking in with my fellow head cashiers to review the day's break schedule and to discuss any issues with cashiers, extra tasks to be completed, and plan of execution for the rest of the day."
good,"Easy to talk to boss and co-workers.  No such thing as a typical day, constant interruptions.  Gratifying to be able to help someone plan their future."
good,I worked at Lowes through out college and it wasn't bad at all. They were very flexible with my school schedule and the workplace morale was through the roof. Good management. competitive pay.
good,Each day a learning experience was great for me. Management was focused to help us and training was very appreciated. Coworkers were very nice and helpful at that time. Schedule was never constant  and  never could take time off in advance because of that. Learning something new each day was very enjoyable!
good,Emloyment at Lowes was a very educational experience. Typical day was very routine and productive. I learned a lot about working with different ethnicity's and personality's . The co workers were some of the nicest people I have had the pleasure to work with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the many new managers hired. The most enjoyable part of the job was the rewards of doing a great job with the customers
good,"Clock in get delivery orders together, load them on the truck and deliver to homes and job sites.I learned to properly build orders and arrange stops in a proper order for drop off."
good,"it was a reliable job with not so good management, the co workers were good and mostly we worked well with one another.  a typical day consisted of arriving pulling down our sheet of deliveries then loading them onto a box truck and set out.  we would plug addresses into gps and start deliveries.  we had a lot of hard deliveries into small homes and not so kept ones that were dirty and falling apart.  we always got the job done and were polite.  I had fun working with friends there and enjoyed the satisfaction of finishing a job."
good,Worked as a Department manager for 10 years.  Biggest part of the job was customer service.  Overall a good place to work.  Need to be flexible not the same shift everyday.  Fantastic Benefits best in the retail industry.
good,Lowe's is an awesome company to work for! They offer multiple was to actually grow inside the company. The hold their employees to the utmost respect for fellow employees and for customers.

All about training, training is the key, the resources are there for you to use, utilize your tools for advancement within the company. The hiring process is too long, you covering 3 departments by yourself , at the most 4 months, before they hire someone to help. But there is a lot to learn, you have to want to learn. People are my passion, I like to see them happy that make them a repeat customer. I've managed payroll, did money drops, worked on Kronos, inventory team for 8 years. Love it!"
good,"Lowe's offers a lifestyle vs. a job.   Corporate Office is geared towards family and productivity.  With walking trails to a full scale cafeteria and various eateries, doctor's office, pharmacy, and dry cleaning services, Lowe's tries to think of everything to make the employee life simple."

The most enjoyable part of my job would be my team members, loyal customers, and managers. I very much so enjoy my work environment everyday."

If you make production, which isn't hard if you stay busy, you get e2 points.  Every e2 period which is 4 weeks you get points if you made over 100% for your production.  These points then in turn can be redeemed for prizes.  When I worked there I ended up getting 2 game systems free as well as several household items and a few gps units through my e2.  They also have e2 lunch which is free as an incentive to give 100% every day.  They give out prizes as well during these lunches through a raffle.

good,"Lowe's wasn't a bad place to work. My job as a cashier was nice. My coworkers were all very friendly, and the managers were very cool. I learned how to run the cash register. The hardest part of the job was closing because that's where we had to put back all the returns of the day. We also had to sweep the floors, restock the snacks at the front, and take out the trash. The most enjoyable part was being able to work with good people."
good,"on a typical day was fun in out going I enjoyed going to work because every day was a different day and that's what it fun and exciting ..I have learned that u have to communicate with your employees to make sure that the job gets done and it makes it fun when your not putting everything on one person its called team work ."
good,Very easy job and the management team supports everyone below them.  Everyone there is friendly to be around and are willing to help out with any problems
good,The atmosphere is easy going but you stay busy. Job safety is important to them and it feels like a safe place to work. Managers understand the job and know how to do every job that the workers they manage do. Pay is fair for what the job entails.
good,"With friendly management and coworkers it's an easy place to show up to, do your job, and go home without any worries. I've learned great customer service skills, how to keep loyal customers after a tough situation, and many other useful qualities that will help me in other areas of the work force."
good,The staff was always very helpful and willing to  listen and very accommodating. Sometimes customers were difficult but i found that listening and explaining thoroughly was all that was needed.
good,"Lowe's is  a great company to work for. It has a very positive atmosphere. You gain knowledge that you will always be able to use in your everyday life. However, the hardest part of the job is the rotating schedule."

Lowe's has given me opportunities to gain experience in the retail world and has given me a chance to learn about its stock, tools and equipment to help customers and ourselves need it be the demand. Management was firm and just when it needed be but also friendly on a peer to peer level. They listened, understood and guided all of us in the right direction need it be situational advice or even a personal need. They kept things work professional and environmentally friendly."
good,"Before I started working at Lowe's, I knew nothing about home improvement. After two years of experience, I have extensive knowledge of various aspects of the field.

good,the best benefits I have found in retail. been with company for almost ten years. growth was good but has recently slowed. giving less advancement and opportunities.
good,"The average work day starts a 7pm and ends a 6am.  These hours are Thursday through Sunday; four days on and three days off.  During these hours, we replenish all the stock sold for the customers that will arrive the following day.  During the short time I have been there, I have learned a good deal about sacrifice.  We are currently short handed so all employees have had to step it up a bit to do their work as well as the extra work load.  The hardest part of my job would be the hours just because it is a different sleep schedule.  The best part is the managers, from weekly bbq's to work incentives."
good,"Hours will vary at Lowe's but typically I start my day around 7:30 and start working on current projects for customers to get them ready for the sale. This includes a couple of hours on the computer entering information into our different systems (depending on the project). The rest of the day will include following up with customers to see if we are a good fit for them and them for us as well as running 2-3 appointments that are scheduled, and maintaining relationships with our installers."
good,Lowe's is a great place to work. Customer are nice and don't often get irritate. It has some friendly employees and some that are not people friendly and have short tempers. Overall i enjoy my job. just wish there were more hours offered over time rather than so many hours in a few days.
good,"I work with my family in this business, my co-workers are my brother and my father and I enjoy myself. Lowes can be incompetent with ordering doors and windows incorrectly, but they understand that me and my family know what needs to be done to finish the job. So I can little complaint"

good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's, good colleagues, flexible hours...though must be able to work holidays and weekends. Time off for personal reasons always granted. Must enjoy assisting customers. This is a service-oriented job. Didn't like the company job culture as corporate doesn't seem to value their employees and in fact appears condescending to its management."
good,"Being a cashier has its perks but it's a lot of standing around just waiting for a customer. I learn a lot every single day I am there. The management team is amazing. The people that I with are pretty good, we treat each other like family. The hardest part can be the irate customers that you get from time to time. The war veterans that come in and tell their stories."
good,"Overall, Lowe's is a great place to work. It is a fun and safe work environment. The hardest part about working there would have to be actually getting everything done in one day."
good,"Un dia tipico en Lowes comienza con una pequeña reunión con el jefe del departamento para conocer las actividades que se realizaran durante el dia o en caso de ser turno vespertino, conocer aquellas que aun quedan pendientes por finalizar. Antes de realizarse la apertura de tienda a clientes nos aseguramos de tener el departamento con el correcto acomodo surtido y limpieza para recibir a nuestros clientes, desde la apertura hasta el cierre de la misma se brinda atencion al cliente en el momento que lo requiere, al finalizar el dia se realizan actividades similares a las que se ejecutan antes de abrir tienda con el objetivo de mantener el departamento en orden y limpio para el dia siguiente. "

I have learned lots things from every job I have worked and use the skills I learn in everyday of life. the management I have worked for has been good and bad but in the same aspect I have learned what to do to perfect my job in the good and bad ways in what not to do.

First off a Typical day at work would include me zoning the halls of the departments. I would walk through any and all departments to help customers that might have needed help with something. I was not glued to one department, I was on the weekend team which allowed me to be anywhere and everywhere. I also knew how to work the cash registers which was an advantage for me and other cashiers that might have needed help. When code threes where called over the intercom I was able to help.

good,"A typical day at work included working on electric, lp gas, and diesel powered equipment such as forklifts and yard trucks.  I rebuilt brake systems, hydraulic systems, and gear boxes.  I learned something new every day with this job.  Our management was understanding about most situations.  The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to leave work at work and having the ability to have something in life.  Not just working for a paycheck."

good,Lowe's is a really great place to work. It is by far the best retail company I have ever worked for. They are extremely generous to their employees. 
good,"Fun workplace and amazing team work. If you ever needed help finding something or getting clear direction on what to do, it was very easy to find. Co workers were all very friendly and knowledgeable. I worked in the flooring, paint, windows and blinds, and electrical departments. They give you great training and understand that we all have lives outside of work as well. Very nice stock plan and 401k, benefits are good. Hardest part of job was having to move heavy ceramic tiles. Great hours and a great learning experience. They train to operate heavy machinery including a forklift. "
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work. Advancement and full time status were quick. Hard work is rewarded. Like most retailers, there are busy and slow times, but there is always something to do.  "
good,All co-workers are great to work with.  Everyone tries to help each other whenever possible.  The hardest part of my job is the weather.  My most enjoyable part of my job is when I see a customer walking out of the store with a cart full of plants and products that will help make their landscaping beautiful.  I thoroughly enjoy helping all the customers with their landscaping.
good,"Sales, stocking, operating a forklift and customer service. Very nice people to work with!"
good,"I would print tally sheets for all special orders and add locations and put them in new locations, then receive them in LRT gun. Receive all LTL loads. Supervise the two receiver unloaders, receiving clerk ,RTM clerk and LTL stocker. Make sure all paper work got received and filed."
good,"I enjoy the varied work, and the Culture and Values and next to none. "
good,Lowes had been a great company to work and advance in. Management was very good and treated their employees with respect.
good,Managers are very helpful and will show you new things if you are willing to learn. Very nice associates.
good,"Lowes is definitely a great place to work, especially if your a college student. Pays way more than any minimum wage job you will ever find. As for full time associates, schedules are horrible. If your pay doesn't help out with the bills, it is just too bad. The schedule has no time for you to even think about getting a little part time job to make ends meet. But overall, a good place to work"
good,"supervise front end in helping customers. Price fixing overides."
good,"Lowes Home Improvement is where I got most of my job experience, I learned from customer service, power tools, electrical/wiring, and plumbling. The work area is always busy and will always learn new things not just from my fellow associates but also the contractors who comes by everyday buying products. I would recommend this company to anyone who are looking to become a carpenter or someone who wants to become a manager."
good,A typical day at work consist of helping customers.
good,There are a lot to learn at Lowe's. It is a nice place to work.
good,"I liked working at Lowes, the pay was really good, they were not too hard to work with, I felt like a got a good days work everyday."
good,Love working here however their are a few things that could be worked out
good,"I worked as a Cashier at Lowes. I was a part time employee, I worked around 5 hours a day, five days a week. A typical day was generally ueventful as I am well versed in the practices of cash handling and needed little to no guidance."
good,"A typical day at work consists of clocking in and then heading outside to round up carts and inside to assist where needed on the sales floor. you greet every customer you see and assist them to the best of your abilities. I learned a lot about home improvement and how to use power equipment such as the Saw, Forklift, ETC. The Management wasn't the greatest though. My co-workers were nice. i made some good friends who i still keep up with. The hardest part of the job is in the busy part of Summer when the store is packed and you have to be everywhere at once. You'll be constantly moving for your whole shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction you get from helping customers. They offer tips and even though you cant take them it's still nice that they offer. Overall, this was a very enjoyable first job."
good,Good place to eat and do side work its an ok company havent been to many so this one is good
good,"Get my job the places where I be deliving the appliances. How to route out my day the fastest route. Good guy know alot about the business. Lifting the appliance up stair to the second floor. Going home make everybody happy with there appliance, and hook up right no leaks."
good,"I enjoy my employment at Lowe's I enjoy dealing with the public, and handling customer issues as they arise. Being with a company like Lowe's changes on a daily basis. My day starts with me walking the Department make sure that it is clean and organized. Then I delegate tasks. The Hardest part of the Job I would have to say would be dealing with not being able to assist a customer, because I can not get something that they want The most enjoyable part , is fixing a customer issue, Like a appliance that is damaged, and being able to get it serviced or a new appliance."
good,Interacted w/ contractors/builders. Learned about bulk and large purchases of materials and tools for commercial sales. Management was on hand to help in any way. Co-workers had to work as a team to make it all come together. The hardest part was some lifting involved. The most enjoyable part of my day being able to assist new and repeat customers and build a lasting sales relationship with them to ensure their return.
good,"A typical day at lowes is began by checking e-mails and order managment. I must call all customer to update them on their installation or special order ETA. I work in the flooring department so im always learning something new, installation proccesses, the best product to use to lay flooring, the diffrence between all flooring product. I love my co-workers and managers. They are all very helpful and we work very well together, to make sure customer leaves happy. sometimes their are very picky customers and that can be hard to deaL WITH. However, it is also the most enjoyable part to see a picky customer happily return because of good service. I love working in custmer service."
good,a typical day at work was arriving at work to hear the announcements and hear how busy we were going to be for the day. then we went straight to our work areas. opened up the doors to the trailers and started loading product onto the truck in an orderly fashion to fit as much in the truck as possible. sometimes using forklifts and clamp trucks. i learned how to load a trailor correctly and how to drive forklifts.
good,"Home Improvement retailer that emphasizes ""wow"" customer service. Diverse culture/work environment lead by diverse managment. Different areas and aspects in a given store from cashier, loading, floor departments and receiving; but all lead back to customer service."
good,"Lowe's has been a rewarding experience! The associates are extremely helpful and friendly and you feel part of the family. Some changes need to be made regarding the less-than-enthused associates and the amount of gossip flying around is far beyond unprofessional. My family and work life collide with little hope of bending due to scheduling, but overall, I recommend this company."
good,14 years experience great company and benefits looking for a slower paced environment preferably in a management position
good,I desing Kitchens and am able to give people thier dream kitchens and go step by step through the process. I get to go out and see what we created.
good,Lowe's is a great place to work. They are one of the best paying retailers and provides great opportunity for advancement as long as you work hard and have the best interests of the company in mind.
good,"Very good campus, good place to work, nice weather."
good,"The first prart of the stocking ,customer service,and speciale orders.The secoun part is cleaning and geting ready for the week end events.I leard how to lead at team, management was great.Co-workers was not konwgable about products.Hardest part was ficking co-workers mistak,The most enjoyable prat was the customers."
good,A pleasant place to work and most of the workers and management are very knowledge of there position
good,"Enjoyed working at lowes ,meeting new people and helping them."
good,"I loved working at LOWES, but the learning material was unavailable to dept. workers. I was hired as LP and placed in Returns which was a good place for an LP personal person to work. It was when I hit the floor as an Electrical Dept. Worker that I found myself lost in my work. Yes I know basic things about electrical, like what a wall socket is, light switch, light, fan, how to install a fan, and etc.. It was the wiring I was selling on a daily basis I didn't know about. I would ask for material to better inform me on the product. Only told to go in training room and get on the computer. So, I tried to go and use the computers to only be denied time to do so. You were only allowed in there on work hours. Which I didn't have the time to do, for I was on the floor covering multiple depts. and no time for proper training. So when a customer would ask me what wire they needed to wire their home, I would have to tell them that i am not qualified to tell you that answer. It would be best to ask your electrician. When I should have been able to tell them they needed a particular wire."
good,I had no dislikes about lowes i loved when i was working there great experience and a chance to grow.
good,"A typical day at work begins on Friday evening after a week away, catching up with friends at work, meeting customers and leading them to product, hooking customers up with specialists for harder questions."
good,A typical day at work consisted of working as a team unit to help run the entire store as one effficient unit. I learned that having great iterpersonal could take me a long way and that some employers do value education. Management was some of the best management staff I ever worked with. I miss the co-workers we were a team unit regardless of our department. Having weekends off and the staff.
good,"I learned that there are all kinds of customers that come into the store. I'm normally in an office, but I'll go to customer service to do lunch breaks, give loans etc.. Most customers usually know what they want, have a list, or are always in a hurry! You also have those who are not sure on what they're looking for and just need a little inspiration. Then, there are customer's who are doing a huge projects and need extra help. Knowing how to identify what kind of customer coming into the store ensure that the customer has a good experience."
good,The store I work in is really laid back. I've worked a lot of jobs and this company is probably the best and most leaniant one I've worked. Currently I'm a cashier and hope to move up. The managers are pretty cool so far. They will listen to you and be respective if you have a positive attitude. Not a lot of companies will just throw in a good word for advancement like Lowes will. So far I've been working here for a little over a month and have spoke with upper management about moving to the floor and am waiting to here back soon. The only thing I dislike is when the store gets slow and you have to work self-checkout or be a cashier in general and deal with that can make a long shift. The pay could be better but am content with it so far. The schedules are crazy. You get a long lunch and break. So far so good. Lowes is very professional and will test your people skills or improve them. Overall I would recommend this company to anyone college student or average joe.
good,"My day to day job duties consist of calling customer helping them every step of the way with their remolding projects, following up once their project is complete seeing how was their overall experiece in our store from start to finish. My management team is good at supporting their staff with ideas that can benefit the company. My co-workers are great team players and I enjoy working with them all. They make my day go by fast. There is nothing hard about my job at all. The most enjoyable part of my job is the two ladies who work in the office with me, they are funny and have great sense of humors. We all get along great, and we have fun while working."
good,"A typical day at Lowe's CSA/Returns is ""Non-typical"". It can be a very hectic area which requires constant multi-tasking. One of the many skills I've learned is to take a dissatisfied customer and apply the necessary people skills to turn their negative experience into a positive one. Our management is well experienced and permits us the ability to handle most situations within company guidelines. My co-workers and I all work together to provide the highest level of customer satisfaction. The hardest part of my job would have to be not becoming upset when a customer is focusing their frustrations directly at me. The most enjoyable part of the job would be when I've been able to resolve an issue for the customer to their satisfaction."
good,Hardest part of job was getting veteran employees to adapt to new technological changes that the company needed.
good,"Cool job met alot of wonderfull people,would give a great deal of consideration to being employeed there again"
good,Very nice company but still needs to grow.
good,"For the last three years I've been with this company, I have gained more experience in the work field than I have in the past. It's because with a bog company like Lowes that I learned new things with so much involved and different opportunities."
good,"It depends on the day what I do. I do anything from check out customers to look up receipts, to make credit card payments. Every single day is different. Some days I open up and sometimes close. Customers come in."
good,"A day in the garden center at Lowe's is extremely fast paced and unpredictable. Customers come to Lowe's for ideas on how to improve their home, inside and out. Customers need heavy items which we get for the customer without exception. The hardest part of the job is probably dealing with heat outside and working within that heat. Management is great at my particular store, they're open to ideas and ready to lead in all instances. My co-workers in my particular department are excellent, we get along with great ease which leads to a smooth operation of the garden center."
good,I currently work at lowes and it has it's ups and downs but overall it's a decent job. You get paid good and have opportunities for bonuses and raises. It's difficult to move up in the company or to other areas of the store.
good,I learned a lot about construction and plants and so much more which has been helpful for me to this day. Lowe's was my first real job and i enjoyed my time there a lot. My co workers were all friendly and easy to work with. Hardest part of my job was lifting 300 lb rail road ties.
good,"My position is Customer Service and I am daily duties are helping customers to the fullest, solving problems, help manage the front end, and lead by example"
good,Lowes is great they have an awsome work/life balance. All of the employees are friendly and helpful. I had set hours on the weekend with helped out greatly. The management provided good guidance also. The hardest part of the job is your always on your feet so body aches are common.
good,"Being a Head Cashier, at Lowe's is very stressful, it can really make or break someone, allot of people depend on you for your leader ship and you definitely have to be able to be adaptable"
good,"This company treated me so well, that I came back as a part-time associate after being gone for five years in 2011."
good,Learned the retail side of business. Worked closely with FP&A on cost models.
good,Benefts that are good for singles and families.
good,"After 10+ years with Lowe's , I can say that I enjoyed all but the last 2 months or so. A manager change in the store was bringing down the morale in the associates and the other managers.Motivating by fear became the new standard, which I did not agree with.The work was challenging and the pace was fast which I personally enjoyed.I left there with no regrets,and a nice 401k.Liked to order for depts,and merchandise the store."
good,Working at Lowes is alot of fun. You're always doing something different everyday and the people you run into always have an interesting story to tell. The only con is that the hours are inconsistent and you don't get many hours at all.
good,Great place to work if like interacting with different customers situations. Steady work enviorment always ability for advancement.
good,"When working as a dept. manager of customer service i would work 3 different shifts. etc..open,mid,close Work with the head cashiers to make sure the customers shopping experience was at its best that it could be. Print several different reports to see how the cashiers were performing one being their EPP's/RP's and if needed to do training and answer any questions they may have. Train new cashiers to be their best and knowledgeable of the work place.I am also responsible for the cash office. I work with a very supportive staff. The hardest part of my job is that i can not make every customer happy every time. The best part of my job is when the cashiers call me to let me know about the EPP or RP that they just sold and they feel good about it. I have learned that the big box store front is a challenge to make every customer happy when they leave. I believe that knowledge is power in life and if i can help a employee with that it is a good thing."
good,Lowes offers a professional work place that an employee has oppurtunity to advance if they choose.Training program is above average and easy to understand.Flexible scheduling is also a plus.
good,• Unload and receive all types of merchandise in big box environment.
good,A typical work day consist of checking customers out in a timely manner and assisting customers with finding products within the store.
good,I really like working at Lowes. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers. Most of the co-workers are nice and helpfull. Everyone always puts the customers first.
good,- A typical day at work for me was loading trailers while working safe.
good,Sign out equipment needed for the day.
good,I loved all my coworkers. great relationship were built and learned more about serving customers in a bigger retail store. Most customers were older/elderly so you have to cater to them a different way
good,"Fulltime insurance include health, dental, and the best vision plan."
good,"I enjoyed the job unloading trucks. It was only part time, just wish the hours were longer. Working at night was great. Time seem to go by fast."
good,"typical day at work was clocking in at 4 in the morning. after clocking in i'd head to the back to get the equipment to put up freight and stock freight (forklift,order picker,pallet jacks,). I would stock freight where it belonged throughout the store. I learned quite a few things especially about houshold tools and appliances. I learned how to use the equipment and was trained to use it in the most efficient way necessary. Management was overall pretty good about doing stuff in a professional manner and taking care of the store and maintaining a very good work environment, all the managers i had ever met had treated me with the up most highest respect. The hardest part of my job was me not being able to get a higher number of hours so I can take care of my expenses. The most enjoyablepart of my job at lowes was the people. The customers were almost always nice and the staff all pretty much did there partto make it easier on all of us."
good,"-busy, fast pace, dusty"
good,"Never a dull moment, running into different people and situations at lowes."
good,Working at Lowe's was fun. I worked outside all by myself. Unloaded flatbed trucks all day. So that made my day pass by fast.
good,"Lowe's has very high standards, and expects nothing less than awesome customer service from their employees. It is hard work, but fun and rewarding. The management really do want you to succeed, and they try to give you every opportunity to do so. The hours were difficult for me (4am to open), but nothing a little caffeine won't cure."
good,"I have been with Lowe's for just over a year now and am quite happy with the job. I came in knowing nothing about plants, but have learned a lot as they provided me with the basic information I needed to do my job. Being a full-time student, it is vital that I have an employer that schedules around my school schedule; Lowe's does just that. All members of management are friendly and seem open to questions and concerns. They treat you with respect and dignity however some co-workers are extremely disrespectful (this is life). Overall, I would highly recommend Lowe's as a great place to work."
good,I enjoyed working there very clean also an amazing work environment.
good,A Great Work experience for me. I Learned a lot from this job.
good,This company was pretty fair to their employees and treated them well .I was the pricing co-ordinator which i loved i also got to deal with customers and help them with their purchases. The management was family oriented and Lowes is great about promoting from within.
good,Good Management job and advancement Salary is fair and stable
good,"Lowe’s was a great place to work at. They had good benefits, good staff, and everyone was like family. Everyone was very friendly and always talked to you when they saw you."
good,Lowes is a good company to work for sadly they dont offer much for a injured team member. They however had great staff and a great management team. On the other hand I had asked to be in a different depth on behalf of more hours and was immediately declined do to a injury I had sustained while in the warehouse
good,Good Company with good managers from my experience. I just desire better paying opportunities and more hours. Currently the company has alot of part time employees and alot of us are not getting on a average no more than 24 hrs a week .
good,It was a great place to work once the new hr manager took over and everyone was given fair chances at job advancements and opportunities. I fairly enjoyed the people and management but ended up needing to quit to stay home with my new child.
good,"Working at Lowe's allowed me to re enter the work force after a gap year  while I traveled with my wife who is a travel nurse. The job was physically demanding but also allowed me to be part of a team of workers that was able to efficiently and effectively receive and offload full delivery trucks in a timely manner."
good,"I accredit Lowe's to almost everything I know about the real world. I was fortunate to have a ""floater"" position there and was able to work in each department at some point in my stay there. I now have the knowledge to repair/replace almost all household items along with other good to know things like plumbing and gardening. Overall the Lowe's experience is the peak of an entry level retail job and I recommend it to everyone I know that is just joining the work force."
good,"They have a strict policy on being tardy, so you must be careful. I do however like the way the company is operated, it good management at the top, as I do see a bright future for the company."
good,"The company has really great benefits. "
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work. Of course there are reorganizations and leadership changes, but it's a great group of people who work collaboratively across different divisions. I like how each division is treated much like its own company and given pretty broad freedom to operate."
good,"good place to work, good management, friendly atmosphere, could be paid more but decent for the type of work. Some people work harder than others but thats any where you go."
good,You learn a lot from different people around you and businesses around the holidays are pack and make sure you are paying attention to what your doing
good,"My typical Lowes work day would consist of cashiering, customer service, and stocking items located by the registers. With previous customer service experience a new skill I learned was working big company computer systems. Management played a big role in my experience there, they are very involved with each employee and their stats. Hardest part of my job was when Lowes was slow and everything was stocked I would have nothing to do, and I like to feel productive in all aspects of my life. Overall my work environment was wonderful coworkers were supportive, and you new everyone who worked in the company."
good,"Plenty of summertime overtime available, paid holidays for permanent employees, good employee discount benefits/retirement/sick pay etc."
good,Fun job good people flexible schedule exceptional training total team environment great experience for newcomers to the job market great job if you can be a team player and a goal oriented person who strives to succeed good company to grow with and move upward to fufill  personal career goals.
good,"I love working for Lowe's. The company is taking many strides to improve market share. With that said, there are some feelings of unease about nearly every role. There is plenty of room for growth of you live in the right areas."
good,I loved my job and all the people. I knee there was something nee to learn each day. The company is now moving my job to night shift. Other than them moving the shift to nights I loved it.
good,"I loved working at Lowe's, I was treated with respect and given so many opportunities. Typical day was learning the task you were assigned that day and setting off on your own for the whole day on equipment. Lowe's cares about safety like no other company I've witnessed and 90% of coworkers and management are friendly. Sometimes work can be stressful but as long as you work hard and have good ethics you are appreciated. No job is perfect but Lowe's is pretty good."
good,Working at Lowe's in the call center was a great experience! The only worry I would have is that the company has been laying off different positions for a few years now.
good,"Being in a call center isn't for everyone. However, Lowe's is a great place to work. The agents and leaders are overall very positive, supportive and encouraging. Security is tight and it's trusting. For a few days I had to leave my driver window down, and I didn't worry at all. There are always e-mails stating that something was found and turned into security, rather than something lost or stolen. One time I left my phone in the restroom, and security messaged me that they had it. If you can withstand the customers and being confined to your desk and phone, then it's a great place to work. The energy is positive and everyone is friendly."
good,I enjoyed my time at Lowe's. It was a nice place to work. The Benefits are good. There are flexible hours. I would go back and work there. I was there for 17 years.
good,Overall one of the best companies I have had to work for. Culture is great and the Management Team I work under is Really Good. I am sure this will differ from location to location but I guess I am lucky. This is Retail and you have to put in what you get out. Poor attitude will sink your boat really quick. Started as a Sales Specialist and was able to jump into a DM position in under a year. This was by hard work and determination. The people make the job and you determine how fast you move in the company.
good,"overall lowes was a great place to work from transitioning out of the Army. I learned a lot of skills like mixing paint, cutting blinds, the register, working outside lawn and garden, etc"
good,"Good management, team oriented atmosphere, most people genuinely care about what they are doing at work, very fast paced place to work and the ability to find out what the customer is actually looking for helps"
good,Do what is asked and it is an enjoyable place to work. They have a flexible schedule and great benefits. Also if you like the ability to change a person's day this is a great place to work.
good,"I've been working for Lowes in Saskatoon for nearly 3 years, and despite having a few rough periods adjusting and having very slow days, overall the experience working here is the best I've had working in retail. "
good,"I love the store I work for. We have a great management team and associates. The job can get stressful, just depending on what role you have. Sales specialists are required to meet certain quotas and requirements monthly and are expected to maintain sales and relationships with customers. Overall if you are self-motivated and like a challenge then this is the place to work. There is potential for advancement in the company."
good,It was a great place to work. I never was dreading going in to work. Management was good. Coworkers were helpful. It wasn't enough hours is why I wouldn't give it 5 stars. I would and have recommended it to friends.
good,"Working at Lowe's has been a great experience. Overall the company offers a competitive salary and benefit package. There is plenty of room for advancement, if you choose to."
good,"Excellent workplace. Ample opportunity for growth. Teamwork atmosphere. Safe environment and well-maintained equipment. It was really, really fun and the snacks were great."
good,Easy to get along with people who work in your department. Assistant managers are willing to go the extra mile for you. Tasks that you need to perform are very easy.
good,"There is a lot you can learn about and all the areas of home maintenance and improvement while working here. There is always opportunity to move up the employee ladder, or even just to switch to a new department simply because you are interested in learning more about it. Slow paced most of the time but you can always find something to work on. Closing shifts are painfully slow, due to very few customers coming in after dark."
good,it’s a good job to start at at my age and the pay was good i just wanted a day job cause i’m starting college the mangers were cool and overnight team members was cool also.
good,"While employed at Lowe’s, Great experiences came all the time. Through interaction with customers and my fellowship with other employees. Lowe’s was a great place to work!!"
good,Lowe's provide great service to the customers. To assist customers with their needs and provide quality customer service.. Always offering a helping hand. Greet them with a smile and provide awesome service.
good,"This is a great place to work. Whether it's part time or full time. In west chest, ohio management is great. They have been very helpful with scheduling and are very fair. Im glad i met them and happy to work for them."
good,The only bad thing is that when the season changes and spring/summer is over hours get cut. That was the only down fall from going from full time to part time hours
good,"Its a work environment, knowing skills of cashier is important. You are always interacting with customer. I enjoy my job. A lot of standing,but I like the customers. You must deal with the rude, not happy people appropriately. It is like any other job out there.As far as benefits I have not inquired about because I am part time,if I were full time I would look into benefits."
good,"Lots of benefits, good pay, flexible hours, and room to grow."
good,Nice place to work great team members.   The Tampa store management was supportive.  This position has been eliminated from Lowes and I am glad I started my own business before that happened.  It was a good experience.
good,Overall it's a pretty good place to work you just have to perform the basic functions do your due diligence as far as secure in your area and cleaning your area income to work with a positive attitude
good,Nice people a good job experience learned a lot of skills I was a big to alot of costumers got alot of help from employees when I needed help and I helped them when needed
good,"Hard to determine the culture as newer manager is assembling his staff, likely going through corporate guidance with continuous changes. Always behind in the  daily ""audit"" requirements. Perform your duties as required and you may keep your position."
good,Working at Lowes was a good experience for my part. I gained some good friends and relationships during my tenure there. I have respect and fond memories working with Lowes.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Lowe's they gave me an Awesome career in Human Resources, they paid me well, you get what you put into it.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my Employees, they have some really great people working for them."
good,A typical day at work is about 5 hours. Depending on the day of the week it’ll be busy or relaxed. Friday through Monday it’ll be busy but the rest of the days of the week it’s relaxed. I’ve learned how to work the cash register and also learned a few things about the garden center & other parts of the store. I really like the managers. The hardest part is being in the heat outside in the garden center. But i really love how to customers make my day sometimes .
good,"Lowe's was a great company to work for, but there are always changes which affects employees. Some positions stay and some don't. Had a really great time with Lowe's though."
good,"Unloading Trucks when i didn't have a truck to unload i always went to the sales floor to help customers, i learned how to operate a reach truck and order picker. management was pretty good to me no problems., The hardest part of the Job was trying to get the truck unloading in the time flame was allowed but it always got unloaded. Talking with management  helping customers and working with my friends."
good,Great place to work and management will work with you on pretty much anything. Had fun awesome coworkers and sometimes they would feed us or give us little perks like tee shirts or hats to were.
good,Everyone is so fun to work with and are so helpful in teaching you your job! I enjoyed every day of work here. Only down side was sometime scheduling problems but otherwise it was great
good,"If you like being around others and aren't afraid to approach customers, this is a great place to work. There's minimal favoritism among management and everyone seemed to get along. It is retail, the goal is to make it easy for customers to shop with us and to leave a positive impression so they don't go to competitors. Customers will wreck your department and you are expected to keep it clean. There are times when the sales floor is minimally staffed which can be stressful since we are expected to help anywhere around the store. Full shifts (9 hours) get an hour lunch and part shifts get half-hour lunches. There have been job cuts in the past so long term job security is questionable"
good,"On a daily basis from my work experience a Lowe's, everyone was respectful to one another, and were able to develop the relationship with one another to know how to work with each other. For my position, I was constantly accomplishing all required tasks during my entire shift in a timely manner. With my responsibilities, I became more efficient in public speaking or become more competent in communication though customer service. The management was a mixture of different results, such as having different styles in leadership, but everyone were still able to adapt and perform their duties with no struggle. The hardest part about the job was to deal with unnecessary rude customers, yet I was capable of handling the situation in the best possible way to prevent any more stress between the employee and the consumer. The most satisfying part of this job was the manual labor, and being part of a team."
good,Great place to work. Freindly staff and management. Competitive wages and benefits. Hours to fit my schedule. Clean and safe work environment. Freindly shoppers.
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work. For the most part family oriented! Pretty fast paced at times, but makes the time go by quicker. The people are very friendly and are very helpful."
good,usually getting items for customers filling shelves and helping other departments. its a lot of collaboration involved in Lowes because of power equipment.
good,"Huge push for customer service, which I'm all about. However,beings that sales is not my strong suit the changes to my position are making me re-evaluate whether this is the right fit any longer. Huge restructuring within the company that is slowly stripping away my job functions. As administrative work is dwindling, I am spending more time on the sales floor."
good,Great work culture when working with a productive team. Changes for advancement. Swing-shift set rotating hours. Great benefits package. Supportive management team.
good,"Great management, everyday has tasks. The only downfall is when they cut paychecks consecutively causing problems with living. Other than that, they are a great team to work with and train you properly on your specific job skill."
good,"I’ve been with Lowe’s for four years and just started in my fourth store (by choice). I’ve been lucky to have great management and co-workers in all of them. There have been lots of changes lately which have taken some adjusting, but for the most part I have no complaints. The advancement opportunities are there if you want them...I’ve been promoted 3 times in four years. The work can be stressful, but the associates make it worth it and I enjoy what I do."
good,"From the stories I hear of other people working in retail, I would describe working at Lowe's thus.  Other locations will punch you with two hands.  Lowe's will only punch you with one.  Corporate has less control than you would think -- effectively the Store Manager has a lot of control over your store in terms of who does what, how much you work, and how good or horrible your experience will be."
good,"Dealing with customers in person or over the phone. Solving problems for clients. Managing day to day office issues and with co -workers. Trying to solve clients issues and problems. I loved working with my co-workers and my clients,"
good,After one year and a half as a driver at Lowes I was promoted to a managers position which I held up until the day I moved back to NY.  Would recommend it to a friend
good,"for me, it was fun easy work."
good,"I am part time so I am not there long enough to hate it. I like most of the people that I work with, my managers are very compassionate and always work with me if I need to change my schedule. I really like the benefits and the 401k company match."
good,"Job started at 4pm and ended whatever time we finished unloaded truck of 1500+ items/products. "
good,This is a good place to work if you're just starting out also have good benefits most certainly good promotions as well they have realistic goals for you to achieve.
good,"My time at Lowes was great. The only thing I did not agree with was that while here I was looking over an entire part of the store, but was not given a supervisor roll."
good,"Because of the variety of positions in the stores, stress levels, treatment of employees, etc. is inconsistent. Favoritism is blatant and not necessarily deserved."
good,I worked at Lowe's for about 6 years and I enjoyed almost every bit of it. It's a fun place to work and you make instant and long lasting friendships.
good,"A typical day at Lowe's is every morning you will do a security check, unload freight, and look for missing product. The culture is amazing at Lowe's, every manager is understanding of life problems and they look for every chance to help you regardless of their position. The hardest part is if you are working in a technical department such as electrical and you have a pro customer come in and they know more about what they need and you have no idea of what they want and it just ends in frustration."
good,I love working with Lowe's Companies. It was very good pay. I just tried something different and moved away. abut I would tell anyone to apply at this job. Staff was friendly and good peoples to work with.
good,"Lowe's was a great place to work.  Meetings are the only problem-- simple tasks that could be accomplished with a phone call or email are scheduled through meetings.  If I wanted to talk to my boss, I pretty much had to schedule a meeting, not because she was aloof or didn't want to interact with the team, but because she was constantly in meetings."
good,"Great opportunities for advancement if you want, excellent benefits, work life balance is a struggle but thats retail.  Excellent management at my location"
good,"I love working here, would recommend it to anyone. interacting with the customers and getting to know them as everyday people makes me happy that I know they can count on me to get them in and out with no problem. I just want a better life for my daughter and I."
good,"Good for any age looking for steady work and plenty of room for advancement. Stead paced work, nice customers, employees and management. I learned alot, made friends and loved learning all the different departments. 10-15% discounts."
good,"We were a small store with close ties. We took pride in servicing our customers, and keeping our store clean. We met our store projections in most areas of customer satisfaction and safety. Loss of inventory an the city failing to meet the projections for renovation hurt store 3039!!"
good,Highly fast paced job. with continuous wok to do. if not working with customers you're making sure your department is neat and clean with holes filled and nothing missing on the shelves.
good,Lowes helped me in so many was. I came out of Lowes a better person. They gave me a opportunity to better my self. Lossing my job was very hard on me.
good,"I’ve been working here for over a year now as a first job and I have no regrets! They pay well, work/life balance is awesome, and everyone is easy to work with."
good,"A great company to work for, great benefits and room for growth if you like the selling environment.  Company on a new path new CEO so a lot of things are changing."
good,The garden center is a great place to work if you are a hard worker! it is not for the faint of heart. you'll be out in the hot sun lifting heavy bags of mulch and fertilizer with limited breaks indoor in the AC. But overall a very rewarding place to work.
good,"There was collaboration between the load builders and shipping, but that could be thrown into chaos by the fact that cashiers were required to take orders from customers at all open store hours. These orders might not reach our hands until the next morning, leaving us to have to take time to build the load the day of delivery. This delayed fullfilment of the orders to customer locations."
good,"It’s a great work environment, the pay between service mgr and ASMs could be a little more competitive. I do think the bonus program can be better distributed between employees"
good,"Lowe’s is a good place for people of all ages to work. Many employees are retired and wanted to come back to work somewhere and came to Lowe’s. Others are students in school, and some have made a full time career out of this company. It is a good place to work where you will be treated like part of the family!"
good,People I worked with were great. I think managers are a bit overloaded but they try their best. Work/life balance was off. At times all I did was work. Good money but I like being home too.
good,"I have had great opportunities with Lowes."
good,"Learned many new things.   How to drive many styles of forklifts."
good,"Day starts on the move, for most part it can be a very fast paced environment.  You cover a lot, to include other departments, cashier function, stocking, multi dispositioned customers, loading vehicles, store cleanliness, multiple employee call outs."
good,"I was a lumber clerk, stacked, made displays and helped customers. I liked the job and I have always wanted to go back but they will not hire me back?"
good,"My work at Lowe’s has been enlightening and inspiring. I was a loader which means my general duties were keeping the parking lot clean, picking orders from their designated homes as well as the shipping and receiving. I would help customers load their cars when something was too heavy for them to lift on their own. But when there were times I had nothing to do I would walk around the stoke, make sure things are tidy, and direct customers to whatever it was they are looking for."
good,"I worked  at lowes  for 18  years  and I love this company  and the people  that I worked  with ."
good,"This is a great place for people to acquire an income while gaining work experience as a customer service representative and a laborer. In addition, it is a good company to attend for work since there is room for advancement and growth. It is also important to note, that the management team at Lowes is pleasant to their employees, which creates a motivating work atmosphere."
good,Lowe's is a perfect place if you need a temporary job to find a better job or you are starting out into the world of work life. Lowe's will work with college student to work with your class schedule
good,"Enjoyed the Cashier Customer. Service , Employee interface.  It obviously is Home Improvement.  I'd like to step unto another arena of servicing and working.  I am ready for something beyond gardens and 2x4's with all respect I say this."
good,This is a fast-paced job where you will take back to back call with little time between calls. The management team are there for you when you need them. Take a long time to use paid time off since you have to be there for six months first. Downfall is that they focus too much on stats instead of just the regular customer interaction.
good,Fun and educative. Felt like family. Was able to work in different departments and learn more about them. Helped me gain more confidence because I was give good criticism.
good,I would still be working at lowes if I hadn't had family issues at the time. People were great to work with and the company was fantastic. They offer much more than the competition.
good,"Working Receiving at Lowes was the greatest"
good,Helping people solve their home living problems.  Gives them a whole new view of where they live. Helping customers solve their problems with lawn equipment or their home repairs..
good,"I like working at Lowe's. The job is not super stressful, my coworkers are really nice, the management is pretty good and the pay is fair in my opinion."
good,"Typical day working at Lowe's. I come into work & I'm greeted by co-workers & customers. I clock in, go to the break room to put up my personal items in the locker and to get my vest. I'm also greeted by customers and co-workers on my way back to the front end while getting info from head cashier on which register to be on. I make short conversations with customers & co-workers during the day while customers are making their final purchases. Putting away snacks and drinks for the next business day. As well as cleaning around my work area."
good,Good to work for a place where the managers work as hard and the employees.  meetings with all employees every day a plus.  Ask for help and you will get it.
good,"Everything is great just that sometimes they will cut your hours."
good,This is a great job for someone who maybe doesn't have warehouse experience. It gets your foot in the door and familiar with how things work. While setting an excellent standard for things like safety.
good,I love working for Lowe's it a great and fun place to work .I love interacting with the customer and my coworkers and having the opportunity to grow old with the company God bless.
good,"Pretty good place to work and grow. Really learn a lot the department your in and adjacent departments.  Also Lowe's pays very well for the work you do. Management can sometimes be a hassle, but usually they are very supportive."
good,"Lowes is a great place to work and build friendships. Pay is great and so are benefits. Management will make or break the store. If they care, like actually care about their employees and their job is a great place. Some stores are great at this some aren't."
good,"Tough to get employees at times.  When short staffed and someone calls in sick, the bare bones scheduling makes it tough to service customers to their expectation."
good,I love it how they give discounts to employees and a very fun place to work at esp if you are working outside garden. Very good company to also start your career with
good,"great benefits"
good,"Collecting carts, moving stock, loading/unloading customers cars."
good,"Wonderful place for a starting point,  great people to work with and really great benefits. Really good place for students to work while furthering their education"
good,Very accepting people here. Again I was very young knew nothing  about my department. And after just a few short months there I feel as if I am an expert in the lumber field. they also have great benefits. A super cool one is they cover a part of your tuition if your going to college :)
good,Cashiers could  use more floor tours as so to know where to direct customers to items needed. Or a chart of sales floor. Also would be nice to have more one on one training at register. Older cashiers need to remember when they were new and learning.
good,"Very fast paced operation that dives into installations, specialty sales, delivery and .com.  Great benefits, great people, great opportunities.  Hardest part is that we have company  directions that filter down through the chain of command that all get a different ""spin"" vs. following one direction and makes the job sometime very difficult to balance."
good,When i first started the manager trained me to do every single thing that I needed to do. Very friendly staff and very organized. Would recommend this for students and anyone looking for a extra job.
good,I loved working for lowes as a company since they offered plenty of benifits for their workers and give you requested vacation time as long as you requested off within the amount of time required. But the management was terrible with scheduling and always seemed to have favorites. Most of the other workers are fine besides a couple annoying cashiers.
good,Awlways something to do. Help others if need be. Train in other areas that is not yours. Run register is needed help and got backed up. Dress casual and that is great.
good,"Cashier duties at Lowe's include customer service, cashier, processing returns, and taking credit card payments...easy to advance, fast paced, easy to learn"
good,Great opportunity to work for this company. Always nice and helpful when not knowing what to do in certain situations and departments. Great hours with good pay.
good,"I enjoyed the garden center although it was hot some days, busy weekends, made time go by fast, learned about care of plants. hardest part was standing on concrete for many hours a day , customers were friendly,"
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for but if you get a bad management team, they will make your life miserable."
good,I learn how to work the registers I learn the different departments in 
good,"My job at Lowes added to my experience in the warehouse.  I learned how to run a forklift.  I learned the importance of teamwork to get the job done on time,  It was a great experience to work with the whole store. My main jon was to unload the trailers that delivered product to the store.  When the trailers were done or late,  I often  pitched  in to help customers.  I dealt with other store associates and the public during those times. The culture at Lowes was that of teamwork and pitching in.  Everyone was friendly.  The best part of the job was the feeling of accomplishment everyday when the trucks were unloaded under the time allotted.  The hardest part was the turn over in the warehouse.  It was often short handed and a new crew member had to be retrained.  I enjoyed my time at Lowes."
good,"I've worked at Lowe's for over two years and have enjoyed my time there. I've been given many opportunities to advance. I started out as a part time cashier and currently work full time in receiving as well as a couple other position in between. Lowe's is also a great company if you're looking to relocate as there are many locations that are constantly hiring. I've relocated once myself across the state and have known many other employees that have also relocated, some of which across the country. There salary is competitive and the benefits are impressive. Overall they're an exceptional store to work for."
good,"working for Lowe's is a great stepping stone. it gave me so many options to advance in the customer service field. I learned a lot of new things dealing with the customer service. "
good,Professional environment with strong emphasis  to provided a great customer service. Very active fast phase and energetic environment  . Great company values.
good,I enjoyed helping providing assistance to the customers. I learned knowledge of all departments. I learned how to communicate with different managers.
good,Working for lowes has it perks great location and they have great benefits. Their system were so easy but had to quit do a family and they could not hold my job for me.
good,"Very Good Temporary Position for me starting out I learned a lot about team work and being a good customer associate here."
good,Lowes is a great place to work its a full of friendly people that love what they do and they take pride in there work especially the lumber department / building materials we butt heads sometimes but we get the job done
good,Lowes is a great place to work. It was stressful during the restructuring but after that things have calmed down a bit. I enjoy it and would recommend anyone to work here especially if they have knowledge of anything that would involve Lowes
good,Management was very well organized. It could be very stressful at times since it was dealing with customer service but you do learn a lot. The pay is pretty well compared to other jobs.
good,I would do inventory of the store everyday with cycle counts and maintain the safety of the wellbeing of the staff and the customers. I made customer service one of my number one priority of safety.
good,"Overall I loved my experience w/ Lowes, it was full of career advancement and opportunities to better myself and my community."
good,i actually loved working for Lowes only issue was that i was part time but if i could have gotten more hours i would have definitely stayed with the company
good,"If you do your job, they let you run your day your way. if you don't, they are on you all the time. The interaction with customers is huge part of the job."
good,"greet the customer and proceed to check them out while making sure the alarms in the merchandise is deactivated, and wishing them a good rest of their day."
good,"Management is friendly. If you like working with the public, it's an excellent place to work. They are willing to work with your schedule. Plenty of opportunity to advance with the company."
good,"The job is not a hard one. Everyday was something different. The store was clean and very well maintained. Great bunch of people to work with, Management always took care of  the associates and treated everyone fairly."
good,"Days at work can be either good or bad depending on customers"
good,"Friendly and diverse work crew. Communication needs improvement between management and the different work sections as there are often confusions with customers' pick up orders. Every month, they reward their staff with a birthday cake for the birthdays in the month and food for a month's end celebration. Reasonable hours as a peak employee."
good,"great part time work, no complaints. hours were good, management was helpful, plenty of room to advance. Very laid back atmosphere. Good discounts. "
good,"Not a single person i couldn't get along with. Everybody is super nice the pay is good too. Rarely had any problems with customers, its a all around good job!"
good,"Management sucks, but it's an easy job. People that work there are nice, but the management has favoritism towards certain people. The starting pay is no good, you have to work yourself up to get decent pay."
good,"It may not be for everywhere but I enjoy the people I work with and we all work together to achieve overall tasks throughout the day."
good,i worked here for 4 years the management was great. I enjoyed the atmosphere of being with people who enjoyed there jib as much as i did. The pay and hours was decent up until they cut hours due to the new regulations .
good,Lowes is great enviroment to learn different skills and to move up and advance in management. Lowes have great benefits and job security is great. Customer Service is a Must
good,Very fast paced and is a great place to work. I need a different environment that will help me grow with more of a challenge. Lowes is very helpful especially when there is a crisis.
good,"I worked for the Lowes in Savannah, TN for a little over two years. I enjoyed working with all my co-workers. I loved all of them. The only con was I worked almost over 2 years and never got a full time job."
good,"The company is really trying to maximize their profits. That in turn means trying to do more with less. I understand the principle, almost all companies are going that way. It sucks for the employees on the sales floor though. There never seem to be enough people working in the store at any given time, but that is always going to be true. No matter what the staffing looked like the employees are always going to want more people so they have to do less. The thing that all of these retailers have a hard time with is finding that fine line of where staffing needs to be. Now all that said, the average employee is higher paid than a lot of retail jobs start at. So there is the trade off for the employees. The only real complaint that I can come up with for the company is reducing the number of full time employees and increasing the number of part time. Again it is trying to maximize profits, but in my experience part time employees as a group are not nearly as invested in their careers as full time employees are."
good,Great pay and very flexible. staff was very helpful and caring. learned pluming from the ground up and was trained. They are very understanding and care about there employees
good,Lowe's is a fun work place you get to work with a wide multi culture group of customers and coworkers. You have the opportunity to learn something new every day and management is always willing to jump in and help if needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was my was the daily interaction with my coworkers.
good,"Safety is a large part in day to day operations at Lowes and they always strive to be as safe as possible. They have many rules and reasons for them, You can always feel safe and there is an on site safety manager."
good,I worked for them for 10 plus year and am working for them now as well. They do care about their employees and will help them out in many different ways.
good,"Excellent Employees"
good,"A typical day at work revolved around the customers; going over blueprints, appointments, etc...  My work there brought me to create some lasting friendships and my bosses were hands-on. One particularly stressful day, just as I was getting tired, my favorite boss stopped me for a friendly chat. That inspiring gesture gave me a second wind that lasted the rest of my shift."
good,Enjoyed learning a lot of things about plants..co worker as well as customers...overall it was a great.place ...food wagon out front serves us all wel
good,"I had heard several horror stories from people who either worked at Lowe's CSC themselves or knew someone who had. My experience working there has been almost entirely positive. There is a lot of re-structuring that causes some uncertainty, but they have been very good about keeping us informed as progress takes place and decisions are made. The dress code is relaxed, with a ""dress for your day"" policy. Employees are encouraged to take their laptop and work in the coffee shop area or move about the building as they choose, even allowed to work outside and enjoy a scenic view. My manager has been one of the best I've ever had, and is very down-to-earth and communicative. They offer a flex work schedule and work from home opportunities."
good,"I loved my job at Lowes!  Management gets to you sometimes and there are always the lazy employees and the grumpy ones, but overall it was a great job.  Most frustrating things for me were the call-offs and late employees, so the faithful employees had to work extra hard all the time to make up for the call-offs."
good,"it good to work at lowes, Good Job Work/Life Balance, Compensation/Benefits, Job Security/Advancement, Management"
good,Es un lugar con buen ambiente de trabajo buenas prestaciones y con procesos de evaluacion y políticas que benefician años empleados
good,"unload trucks receive product in and stocked shelves."
good,I work in the call center and I really like it. They provided good training and are supportive. I have an amazing supervisor that meets with us regularly to talk about strengths and areas where we can improve.
good,its a good place to work i've worked in worse places. Its retail so we work holidays. i love the people on my team and my manager is cool. he doesn't micromanage and i like that.
good,This was definitely a great job to work at. I loved the management and how well they worked with my college class schedule. There is plenty of room to advance within the company!
good,"I had to leave to travel to my country to get married. I also had some experience in plumbing section. We started in a new store from the scratch. So, me and my coleuges learned a lot."
good,"Very knowledgeable staff. Treats their employee great. You are assigned call ques based on ability. Colleague support is readily available to help resolve call issues. Typically , schedules are based on 4 work days and 3 off days determined by adherence."
good,You can get easily attached to people and make great friends.  Sometimes customers get nasty but you can see past them because the good ones overshadow the bad.
good,"It's a nice place to work and you can get attached to people.  Sadly, it's a revolving door when it comes to certain positions, so your attachment is severed quickly."
good,"Productive and fun place to work "
good,"It is a good place to work: you get 30-40 hours a week. The  managers are understandable and nice. The more you work, the better of you get in terms of status."
good,"I loved my delivery job here, sure there were bad days but they were few and far between. The scheduling system they used to use was hit or miss but when they did their jobs the day went well. I had no intention of leaving until the higher ups in corporate decided to cut all delivery drivers to save money. Management at my store was amazing and did what they could to make our lives easier, the hardest part of the job was for sure delivering large fridges to small houses. I loved delivering patio furniture and lawn equipment because it was just dropping it off outside the home, getting a signature and moving on the the next delivery."
good,"a new adventure every day,and you got to interact  with alot of great people,it taught me the area were i had just moved and it was a great learning experience"
good,Typical day is pretty much for me is come in and clean out break room top to bottom. Clean restrooms very thoroughly. Fix any and every item needed repaired that day.
good,I am responsible for facility maintenance. It's hard to advance. The culture is competitive but my fellow employees are friendly. There are employee cookouts and quarterly bonuses.
good,"I was very happy there, my son got sick and they keep my spot even though I was gone a few days. Then I got sick and they were worked with me as well."
good,I love working here because I get to make customers happy based off my engagement with them. Recommending products & ways to do projects was a benefit to this job.
good,While I worked at Lowe's the other employees were very friendly and helpful. The training was hands on and thorough. Management was kind and recognized when employees went above and beyond for customers.
good,"Loved working there, never wanted to leave it was grate pay and long hours.  Managers where a lot of fun to work with. My hours where usually 2-11 from Mondays though Saturdays and 12-9 on Sundays."
good,Lowe's Home Improvement Company offers a great entry-level position start to anyone interested in learning strong customer service responsibilities and leadership.
good,"A typical day at work involves extensive customer service and employee relations.  I have learned that although a customer is not always right, you treat them as if they are, and you do your best to reach a resolution suitable to all parties.  "
good,"Lowes was a GREAT place to work, good culture, awesome name brand when talking with family and friends. The only reason I left Lowes is my store manager was HORRIBLE to work for, He fired almost every management and specialist position. He did not represent Lowes culture so I resigned."
good,"Working at Lowes for the two months that I was hired for were pretty good. I learned a lot about plants, mulch, and other outdoor products. The management team for my department was amazing however the HR department lacked in communication with their employee"
good,"Overall, Lowe's is a good place to work. It has a beautiful complex with a mesmerizing environment, and a nice walking trail around a lake next to the office. The interior designs are also pleasant with fantastic views of the outside, especially on the upper floors. I learned extensively the different methods of working and different project methodologies, including both Agile and Waterfall. I do like the workplace culture as well, with many friendly co-workers. I'd say the hardest part of the job was working part of an Agile team where meetings were constant and my calendar was almost always filled to the brim with them. The most enjoyable part is definitely the nice facility and working with a project that has the waterfall methodology, as it has not as many meetings, and I am allowed to work with more discretion."
good,"As a student, I needed a work place that would grant me time off for school or studies when I needed. I would ask teachers when tests would be to give myself proper time in advance for days off to study or at least shortened shifts from work, and both areas of my life complied. It gave me a reasonable salary given my experience with opportunities for a raise. It was somewhat fast-paced in the afternoon, but not stressful, and the biggest competition would be to get people signed up for credit cards. Otherwise, this place was very relaxed and comfortable to be at."
good,Good work environment and opportunities for advancement. They have plenty of opportunities for all walks of a career. They have a good training program.
good,Company gives you every opportunity to succeed.Benefits were outstanding.Always someone to reach out to if you needed help with something.Received great commendations from management.
good,I never though I would work a register or being a customer service associate. I can say working in the Health Care field has sharpen my Customer Service Skill a lot.
good,Lowes has given me  many things to appreciate and i fell that from any place ive worked ive been accommodated the best here. typically i think that dally life is quite packed with eventful experiences.
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's. I had great coworkers and managers. I found the job to be fast paced but manageable. I never felt overwhelmed, no matter how busy it would be."

good,Great company to work for I would go back to work @ Lowe's again enjoyed working with my long time co-workers that I've work with in previous Jobs & had long work histories with
good,"Mi día comenzaba realizando auditorias por departamento en donde se  anotaban las incidencias para su posterior corrección,  auditaba camiones que entregaban mercancía a clientes, auditaba la mercancía de alto valor como cajas de cable, taladros, asistía a los empleados en temas de seguridad, capacitación de curso de seguridad a personal de nuevo ingreso,revisar y monitorear el CCTV,, me aseguraba de que se colocaran los conos en áreas donde se transitaba con montacargas, asistía a clientes en temas de primeros auxilios cuando ocurría algún incidente dentro de la tienda, los martes teníamos junta donde se veían lo temas de merma por departamento y se implementaban en conjunto con los jefes de las áreas planes de acción para la mejora o disminución de merma,etc."
good,"My experience was pleasant, the management was always present and uplifting as possible. Fun place to work. The only thing that i did not appreciate. The managers were not always on the same page when asking an associate to complete/assigning certain tasks."
good,"You will see a lot of change but for the good,  They will not be a company that will go out of business because they failed to adapt to the ever rapid changing consumer market."
good,"I worked at Lowes for 8 years and I learned so much while working there. The management and my coworkers were awesome! "
good,"staffed 13 registers, controlled staffing budget, maintained accurate cash handling policy. ordered FE merchandise. Maintained a clean and safe work environment."
good,"Good place to work, friendly employees,  advancement is there.  Training is there as well and learned a lot from the contractors who shop there.  overall good place to work."
good,"enjoyed working for lowes, they are a great company. Customers are awesome to assist with daily customers who get to know you as a person, just wish they paid more hourly"
good,"The job is not a bad job at all, I am just trying to find a job closer to my field and I am also use to extremely fast pace work, which makes the job boring to me. I am just a cashier, so all I do is ring up customers and make sure my aisle is stocked and clean. I always enjoy to learn from my customers by asking what they plan on doing with the material they are purchasing. The work place culture is just a bunch of people messing around most of the time, when time is slow instead of taking inventory of their unit. The most stressful thing about the job is some customers that are having a bad day and want the cashiers to feel the pain they are going through in the moment making the job extremely stressful for short bursts of time throughout the day."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers to get what they wanted and needed to complete their projects. Unfortunately, the company did not provide enough help to give the customers the time and attention to their details."
good,"really great staff"
good,"Lowes gives you lots of opportunities to grow as a worker, and challenges you to be self motivated. The work environment is very relaxed and easy going."
good,I learned how to work with customers better and how to properly water the plants in the flower garden. The workplace was nice and friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers
good,"If I was going to work in relail again, I would prefer it to be at Lowe's Home Improvement! I believe the products to be superior and the environment is superb!"
good,"Very fast paced job.  You will not be bored and your day flies.  "
good,The time I spent with lowes was absolutely fabulous. I would still be there if It weren't for the job cuts. They cut all sales specialists and department managers.
good,"I believe that Lowes is a very nice place to work. I genuinely enjoy working with all of my coworkers, and even socializing outside of work. Management, on the other hand, is not what they seem. From my point of view, they can have a select few that they tend to favor more than others."
good,"I have worked for ten years with Lowes. There is a routine keeping your area in a clean, sellable position, but there is a good variety of day to day work in dealing with different customers. They train you very well, so you feel confident helping. Management is good, though this year, they laid off many management positions, so we are still getting used to the new system. It is a really good job, though, especially for retail."
good,Good place to work for retail/warehouse. Lots of opportunity for advancement. If you make it known that you want to move up you can. I went for part time loading cars and getting carts to full time stock in less than a year.
good,If you have a good staff they can make the work enviorment fun. The work load can be heavy depending on what department you are in. The enjoyable part is that you will never have a dull moment working here
good,"I held many positions in the store,  from entry level to store management.  Plenty of opportunities to advance. I enjoyed my time there,  made many friends and contacts that I hope to keep for years to come."
good,"A typical day here involves stocking and filling of shelves and displays throughout the entire store, it may seem like a lot but its a fairly easy day to day thing. Its a nice job if you just want to forget about your job at the end of the day."
good,"They had a great way of making computer games to teach you how to learn your job. I learned how to set up a store from just outside walls to getting it set up for customer shopping. The culture was fantastic, everyone was willing to help everyone else, and the management was sincerely interested in helping us better our lives and careers. For me, the best part of the job was working with the customers. The worst part, was that I moved out of Owatonna and the drive wasn't the best in the winter."
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowes, I learned a great deal from the employees and the managers.  I was able to do several different jobs while working for this company.  They has great benefits for all employess."
good,Lowes is a pretty good play to work. When I first left Lowes I left because I thought it was a horrible place to work. But after working in other retail I have found that Lowes is a great company.
good,"A typical day at work consists of working with a team to accomplish a common goal. What I learned is keep your mind open to new ideas. The management work very close with the team members, and always encourage you to achieve more. The workplace is a safe and friendly atmosphere where we all get to accomplish our goals for the day. Right now the hardest part of the job is the travel distance since our family relocated to Brooksville. The most enjoyable part is when we as a team come to the end of our day, the store looks ready to present our product to the public."
good,"The work here seemed a little focused on sales, but that's to be expected with a home improvement company. You will get to know the regulars as many local labor workers frequent their local home improvement store. Balanced work, great training."
good,"Must always have the ability to multi task in various departments, Have open availability for scheduling purposes.Must enjoy dealing with the public likes and dislikes with the store directly as well as oerall"
good,typical day included stocking freight and resets depending on season. great managers and good coworkers. nothing hard about my job.
good,". Everyone work together"
good,My time at Lowes was great. I learned so many things and got to meet so many different people. Even though I was laid off I would still recommend this place as a great place to advance and move up.
good,"I liked working at Lowe's because it had a great environment of people and things to do. I didn't always agree with management and sometimes had a few issues with some managers, but all in all, it was a great place to work."
good,"great first job learned a lot of customer service skills "
good,Assisting in setting goals for the people in my department and helping them achieve them.  Making sure that the department is always show room ready.  It is an ongoing process to make sure that we have the correct amount of product and very important to keep a safe work place. One of the hardest part of managing this large department is the small things.  I learned early on that small things can become large things if I don't keep a close eye on them. In this department one of the things that brings the most satisfaction is when a customer comes in really upset because something has broken.  I take the time to find out what is wrong and do everything I can to fix the problem.  Seeing them walk out with a smile really makes my day.
good,"I have been with Lowes for three years now and have learned a lot!  I started out at seasonal garden and was taught the job from a very knowledgeable and hard working supervisor, which made me better every day.  I wanted to experience the role of cashier and they were helpful in the process of that job role change.  I have remained in that job and enjoy experiencing new and old customers daily and helping them with their household or contracting needs."
good,"Had good working environment with supervisor, working with different cultures , working in different departments , paint , lighting , hardware,lighting ,any where supervisor need"
good,great  company  for  advancement-great  work/life  environment-receptive  associates-Great  team-buiding-receptive  to  new  ideas-every  day  can  be  different
good,Worked in a new store. Advanced quickly and given the proper training and resources to learn my role. Plenty of co workers for helping with major projects with in the departments. Management was good at backing there employees and there personal advancements.
good,"Servicing customers, inventory control, adjusting cycle counts daily, scheduling, invoicing sales. rekeying locks, managing and providing associates as well as myself with the necessary skills to provide excellent customer service."
good,"There were many opportunities to leave a lasting impression on the customers that came into the lumber department, and I was able to retain the ability sort lumber."
good,I have been with Lowe's for many years and have found it a great place to work. The managers seem to really value their people and every team I have been a part of has worked very well together. Each person wanted to give more than 100%.
good,its like working for publix but the sale lumber. the do a good job of providing a great sales enviorment.co workers were nice hardest part of job is being there on slow dayslearned a lot there i was typically locating an item i was just learning about or talking to a customer who owns a building business
good,The management works with your schedules and accommodations. It was an overall good job. The only problem I had was the benefits. They were kind of benign. But still a job to consider.
good,It was a pretty fun job aside from the hard labor. Dealing with wood and dangerous equipment. Aside from all that I enjoyed the learning experience when it came to hardware.
good,Pretty good company. I love working for them. They pay good and they have other great people that work here that makes it even better.
good,This company was great to work for. The training was great and there was always opportunity to grow with the company. I would recommend this a place to work for anyone.
good,"Job work, life balance, security advancement,  management, and culture gets 5 stars. Only 3 for compensation, but still great overall."
good,"Lets help customers LOVE where they live."
good,"Its retail.  So it comes with all the retail politics.  Make more money, sell sell sell, bottom line, every day must be better than the last, etc... BUT this company is not union.  Which is great, because the harder you work, the more you prove yourself and the more you go above and beyond is surely rewarded and you will move up if you want to.  Of course, just like every place of employment, some figures of authority are less people-friendly and more intimidating than motivating, but as long as you do your job and the best you can do every day, you will be fine. The benefits are a little on the not-so-great side.  Healthcare is very expensive.  You get a 10% discount on purchases.  BUT you get paid time off, vacation, holiday pay, sick pay (as long as you are full-time).  They have healthcare options for part-time employees.... its also not the greatest but may be better than nothing at all.  They work with part time employees schedules if you go to school or any other reason, part time hours are flexible when need be.  Full-time employees are required to be available during all business hours at the store, but you are guaranteed 2 days off a week.  Overtime is not normal and is actually fought against at all cost, but does become a voluntary option during peak holidays or other times of need.  Quarterly bonuses for everyone if the store reaches all goals for that quarter..."
good,"Team work is the main focus, working together to meet the needs of the customer, I gained a wealth of knowledge about customer service during my employment with this company."
good,Lowes and the employees that I worked with were like family.  I always felt that Lowes supported me.  I was with the company for 9 yrs and have currently re-applied for a position.
good,I've been employed with Lowe's for 4+ years. I've always enjoyed working for them. They're very flexible with scheduling. Everyone that I worked with was amazing.
good,"Great work environment and even better benefits. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers, some can be angelic and others can be rude and obnoxious. Best part of work is the opportunities to make bonus and the work environment with coworkers."
good,"It was over all a good place to work, usually I would be in the Garden Department Cashiering but if I was not there I would be working in Customer Service. The management was the worst part of working here, the amazing co-workers helped but head store management was horrible, never had schedules prepared correctly. I loved going in on a good Sunday morning and being in the garden center, hot but always proved with a fan or heater depending on the weather. The LOWES team had frequent customers you get to know and help, stocking was routine and pay was considerably good for being a cashier and a raise every year helps."
good,everyone was pretty nice and i loved it most of the time. the pay was great and the environment was a very nice place to be. I would definitely work there again
good,My day would start off with me cleaning and putting the motor carts outside then i would welcome each and every customer that came throw the door. The management was strict but good we had order and that's how its supposed to be.
good,"My role was unique within Lowe's. I was the only employee that spent most of his day out on the field. Managing progress on kitchen and bathroom remodels. "
good,good job and good pay busy during the summer slows down after July 4th best place ive worked so far would recommend for someone looking for a career or a summer job
good,I was very satisfied with advancement opportunities I recieved.Customer relations was a plus.The management was always there for you.
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers find the right tool or product for the job as well as loading/ unloading the customers vehicles and stocking/facing the shelves.  I learned how to become a better salesman and a little more about gardening and plants.  The managers were nice but they always seemed to be rotating out of that particular store or getting fired quickly.  My co-workers were great, they were all pretty positive and fun which helped make the day go by faster and made you enjoy being there.  The constant heavy lifting could be the most difficult part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with so many fun/positive people."
good,Management is great. Work environment is wonderful. Calm atmosphere. Days tend to move quickly. Driving fork lift is easy.
good,"Lowes llc is a great company to work for either part time or full time, the benefits are decent for both. except tuition reimbursement is kinda grey, yo basically have to work full time for a year to eligible. but lowes only hire old ppl to be full time."
good,"I like working at Lowe's. I use to work there before when living in Tuscaloosa, Al. The employees and managers are nice and easy to get along with. Customer Service is my thing, I love customer and helping them in anyway possible no matter what is, if its helping them with their account or helping them find something in the store."
good,It is good working for lowes most of the time. The co workers are typically chill and breaks are longer if you work longer hours. Can be over bearing and management can be sloppy at times. But it was a good learning experince
good,you will have a busy day of work. had fun working there. pay can be good as you move up. the benefits are really good. you coworkers become like family
good,This is a fun place to work and there is more than enough opportunity to advance your career. If you let your management know your career plans they are happy to help train you so you are prepared for an advancement.
good,"I enjoyed working with the company, and enjoyed my coworkers. I was trained well which made working there a breeze. I would work with a company again in the future."
good,"This is a wonderful job with great benefits and opportunity to advance in the company. They offer you the benefit of a 401K plan with price match, medical, dental and vision insurance. As well as a variety of other opportunities."
good,good company to work for and great benefits. Very family orientated When it comes to associates. Great career opportunity for long jevity.
good,I really enjoy the working in Lowes . The supervisors and the stuff were great  ! I miss working there but I had to quit because I moved to Madison Heights VA.
good,"Great community of people to work with. Great job with a fun, relaxing, and slow paced work environment. The management really cares about their employees and will generally do anything within there power to help out with your needs. Will train you to drive power equipment (Forklift, Narrow aisle lift, Order picker ect)"
good,"Diverse and dynamic work environment; rarely bored. Close-knit, warm work environment within employees and management. Above min wage starting pay, even at entry level with no experience. Ability to learn several skills and grow/ build resume. Great benefits. Management often kind and understanding on several levels, from department managers up to HR. Company as a whole cares about employee satisfaction, and gives employees paid holidays off to be with family, even if p.t. or temp. "
good,Like any company there are some issues with non productive employees but the company is a good place to work and has great benefits for full time employees.
good,Good people to work with and for.  Would work around schedule and make you feel important.  The management always made sure me and my children had enough presents for Christmas and made sure we were all okay.  Overall a good place to work.
good,great benefits and the management is rewarding in performance and thank you.. you learn a lot from tools to electronics and home furnishings and plumbing. building materials and tools. its a good environment to work in
good,"I really enjoy working at Lowe's due to the volume of customer we see everyday. It's always a pleasure meeting various customers wit different backgrounds.Even though on most hectic day, the managers may not be available, the associates still try their best to assist the customers in any way they can."
good,"You get out what you put in! If managers see how hard you work, they will help you out! Every one gets help from managers, but once you get one ASM's attention, they all see a spot for you."
good,Very professional environment.Train employees to many areas advancement was easy .Low stress high volume work once you learn your job everything else was easy.
good,"You would stock shelves help customers and clean your area"
good,Lowes is a billion dollar home improvement company with locations across the United States. Work daily with a team of 150 people to give customers a great shopping experience in our store.
good,"I had typical days on the job not saying much moving at a slow but steady pace, learned building products completed projects co workers was medium at best just kept things professional dealing with co workers was the hardest although I enjoyed working with my hands."
good,"learn work machinery, was trusted by other employees. was able to build healthy employee customer relationships. management was very motivating to teach on sales"
good,"Working for Lowes opened new career goals. I never knew I would enjoy being a designer.  Lowes helped me find a talent I never knew existed ."
good,A place where everyone works hard to achieve there goals for the day but also help each other. Gained a lot of experience working at Lowes much more than I have excepted. Management and the employees got along very well even if sometimes we did not see eye to eye but very respectful. Enjoy the job every minute of it.
good,"Great place to work."
good,"Lowes is a good place to work. They try to keep employees happy without the customer experience suffering. a normal day for me goes like this :Every morning I print 2 reports. One with whats going out that day and the other of new install product to be pulled. It takes about 30 minutes to print the reports and then check them against product that has already left the store. After that's complete I gather up all the product leaving the store that day and place them on carts separated by Installer. Then I put all the newly sold product in the back of the store where it will stay until its install day. The remainder of my time is spent doing inventory control, solving problems, and assisting customers. The best part of this job is I do not have a manger constantly looking over me. I am left to develop my own daily plan."
good,"Lowe's was a fun and exciting place to work.  While I was there, there were many transitions the company was going through, but I would recommend Lowe's to anyone!"
good,"For my time at Stine's, I have to say the company is so good to their associates.  Of course, every job has their days but they are such a personal company and reach out to their employees and customers."
good,Working at Lowes has been a pleasant experience. Most of the employees I work with have been with this company for at least 5 years or more.  Most of the employees and management are very helpful and we all work towards the same goal of customer satisfaction. Typical day consists of helping customers and restocking inventory. Some heavy lifting is involved on a daily basis but nothing worth complaining about.
good,Manger are pretty much laid back just have all task complete by the end of the day. Lowes is not really good when you have a family your hours are rotation everyday you will have different hours.
good,"As long as you have a great work ethic, you can easily be promoted to different department positions. Most of management is easy to get along with and co workers are all nice and treat each other with respect as long as you work hard everyone will see it and treat you with respect. Hardest part is how small the receiving area we have is, when it is peak season it is hard to find room for all the product we receive which makes the work stressful when you are off loading a truck, trying to find room to put the product and then you have another truck waiting to off load as well. However, that is just a small issue that is not that hard its a great job to start your career with."
good,"On any given day, you would enter customer service and immediately start answering phone calls.  Customers come to the desk and you assist them with their purchases, offer them a credit card application, make sure they leave happy.  Back to the phones, answer calls, transfer calls, make phone calls to customers who's merchandise is in."
good,"Great place for a young person to start working, Lots of benefits and friendly atmosphere. Fun working conditions but management is also young and they do not promote the older more experienced employees. Also Lowe`s does not transfer you if you move, you need to re-apply to go to another Lowe`s store."
good,"I looooved working at Lowes but I felt as though it was too time consuming because the work schedule is so sporadic and you'll find that it will take up any and all free time."
good,"I worked for Lowe's for 3 years and absolutely loved it.  The staff is always putting together fun things for their co-workers to reward them for special performances or sometimes just because.  As a cashier, the hardest part is standing within 7 feet from the register at all times (gets boring quickly once you straighten nearby merch) & having to ask for someone to relieve you to go to the restroom- sometimes it takes awhile for someone to come for you & sometimes your request may be completely forgotten about.  Management was always pretty understanding, calling off is usually an easy process.  The best part of this job was how after several months it felt like my 2nd family.  You get to meet and work with around 100 new people when you start & develop relationships with these people over time.  Even if you don't work in the same department you talk to everyone since you have to call departments and find out where merch is located for customers or ask all kinds of random questions that customers want answers to.  As a cashier, you mainly tend the register but the job includes some odds and ends things as well: working returns & customer service desks, getting carts, cleaning the vestibules, putting returns away, stocking drink coolers and endcaps by registers, etc.  Be ready to stay on your feet for your entire shift except for your break time which is usually right in the middle of your shift.  This is one of the most complained about parts of the job from cashiers (mainly because you just stand in one place, standing and moving around is much different) so get a good pair"
good,"Lowe's is a fun and exciting place to work. Management is well trained, organized, and fair to the associates. Each day, depending on what shift I am working, there is an email or handwritten note with specific job responsibilities for the day, but most importantly management stress that customers comes first before tasks. During my shift, I am usually interacting with customers, answering questions, demonstrating how to use products, setting up orders to be delivered or picked up later, down stocking out of stock merchandise back onto the shelves, occasionally pulling internet order's for customer service, zoning product to the front of the shelves, special projects for the DM, ASM or SM, and any training that's needed. Difficult opportunities presents themselves, when special orders are not placed in the correct bay as noted in the Lowe's system, making it impossible to locate a customer's order, but other than that, everyone in my department does an exceptional job communicating, and working as a team throughout the shifts to take care of the customer and make sure the department shows well."
good,"Its a really great place to work while in college, will let you have weekends off when needed, also a very fun place to work at when you have great people to work with."
good,"Upon arrival the people that I interacted with were great to talk to.  The employees are incredibly welcoming, and are willing to teach you and help you.  The only downfall that I have to give is that you are basically thrown onto the floor with little teaching about the products you are dealing with.  You have to be good with learning on your feet, and be able to tell people that you don't know."
good,"Working at Lowe's was a great experience. There was a lot of employee drama, but other than that it was a great environment and fun place to work."
good,"Great management. Great coworkers. I love working here. Would like to get paid a little more for all that I do, but all in all its good."
good,It was a comfortable environment and sometimes it could be a fun job! It made me excited and motivated towards working to have my own home and I learned so much about home decor and tools and simple handy-man stuff !
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time at Lowe's and loved my Receiving Team.  Management could be stressful as often there were 5-6 immediate supervisors all with their own plan.  As 2008 and 2009 evolved and the company made severe cutbacks on staffing I had to make the decision to step away as I could not manage my diabetes and stick to the store plans."
good,"the job be random, but when you do learned the ropes get use to it. the co-worker are nice people. sometimes the costumer can bit mean to you."
good,They are willing to work with your schedule if your in school and it is a good diverse environment.  I would suggest working here.
good,"Good pay and benefits ,hectic fast paced ,but easy simple work good people to work with.Management turns over every 2 years,you never know what you will end up with."
good,"Lowes is a great place to work, offers opportunity for advancement as well as good pay. My co workers are the best to be around, the hardest part of the job is getting used to the repetitive speaking that you have to do."
good,Enjoyed the interaction with the customers and making sure they were happy with the merchandise they were buying and that everything worked properly and they were satisfied before leaving.
good,"A typical day is helping customers by troubleshooting their problems and finding out what best fits their situation. The managers are all friendly and not to bossy. My personal manager was great and always was polite to you. When he said something, you did it out of respect, not because you had to. The job had some troubles but nothing compared to other horror stories I hear at other jobs."
good,"A typical day at Lowe's involves a lot of customer service.  It is a must that you are able to interact with people every day. I have learned so much working here.  I felt completely out of the loop when I first got the job and now, four years later I can say that I know more about improving your home than the average person. The management team helps build your career from the ground up.  They know what it was like to be a cashier or sales associate so they can relate to you very well. I would have to say my favorite part about Lowe's are the coworkers.  They keep me sane and wanting to come back every day.  At previous employers I would get in trouble for talking to my coworkers and having just a little bit of fun.  At Lowe's I am able to work hard AND have fun chatting with my coworkers and laugh as much as I want to. That is a definite plus for me and is a MUST HAVE when searching for job opportunities.  The hardest part of the job is having to be on my feet all day, so definitely splurge on that good pair of shoes."
good,"Don't know completely what to think, yet.  So far I think I'm going to like it, but not sure until I have more time on the job."
good,"A typical day at work would be running from one end of the store to the other giving overrides, assisting customers, dealing with customer complaints, making sure cashiers are getting their lunches and breaks on time. The hardest part of this job is dealing with unorganized management. I enjoy my job, and the most enjoyable part of my job is encouraging cashiers to do their best to ""upsell"" and coming up with different incentives for the best seller."
good,"I enjoy the interaction with the employees as a HR Coordinator. I feel the working relationship between management and hourly employees is very cohesive. The benefits and upward opportunities are excellent. Overall, Lowes is a great place to work."
good,Assisted my team in unloading up to 30 trucks a day.  Management was willing to listen to new ways of doing things.  Co-workers were always willing to help each other.  Enjoyed unloading trucks but not so much in the rain.
good,"Lowe's is actually a pretty good place to work with benefits, profit sharing, vacation time. other than the rogue manager coming around trying to take charge in any situation. It is a family friendly team oriented place to work"
good,I enjoyed working at my Lowe's because the community there was overall very much like a close-knit we took care of each other and made sure that we all had a successful time there helping customers. I loved the comraderie and teamwork.
good,A great and fun place to work. The managers are friendly and always willing to advise in areas that associates are not trained in. Peers with more knowledge are always teaching others to make their jobs easier and more productive.
good,I was never a person that was interested in tools but that when i started working at lowe's it changed. Being able to fix certain problems in my home such as plastering is satisfying.
good,fast paced work place room for advancement great open door policy outstanding employee and customer relationship feels more like an extension of your own family
good,"I did not stay for long because of conflict in work hours with my full-time job. "
good,"Worked as a Live Nursery specialist. Managed and trained a staff. Managed incoming purchase orders, spoke growers/vendors for quantity and quality of plants/product. In charge of shrink, clearance items, merchandising, weekly and annual inventory. Had good customer relations and obtained commercial accounts for landscaping companies. Received deliveries and worked well with my team members."
good,"When walking into the store you knew that you was going to have a fun day with co-workers.  Our direct support management teams were very well trained.  Our upper management teams were well versed in all situations.  Very knowledgeable.  It was a daily learning experience.  From the Install piece to the customer interaction.  I found that the hardest part of my day would be to get time in for every associate, which I truly desire to do.  everyone in every area.  I mostly enjoyed the engagement piece, with customers and employees.  All of my team was the reason my job was so exciting.  I need them all."
good,"I manage and receive freight for a $57 million store.  Manage a team of 8 associates, who's jobs vary from receivers, assemblers, RTM clerks, stockers, and a receiving clerk.  This is one of the hardest parts of my job.  Having such a diverse group of associates with so many different jobs.  Other areas of the store only have CSA's but my teams varies with many different task throughout the store. "
good,"Lowe's is very laid back, all employees are nice and out going, but when things need to get done they get taken care of promptly."
good,"Lowes is a fun workplace that has a lot of good team members always working together to accomplish a task quickly and efficiently. They give benefits to people who are working both part time and full time. Managers at this store seem to be organized and able to keep things moving along in a timely manner. The only thing that bothers me about the store, is they do not offer many hours per week to part time workers."
good,"Competitive pay and benefits, flexible hours upper management is great."
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work at, nice benefits, and great people. The People that work for Lowe's always make each other feel like family and are always helping each other out to make the work environment comfortable for all but still keeping it professional. Although working as a cashier for Lowe's is difficult at times because you are going to have certain people that you cannot make happy no matter what you do, it pays off in the long run knowing you did your part for a company and everyone there appropriates you,"
good,"Training is online and pretty straightforward. I have learned a lot of great things about retail that one never typically thinks of and is good to know. You learn to appreciate and respect the intricacies of the retail industry. Management is great to work for and with. "
good,"This company has good benefits for their employees. there is employee stock purchasing, bonus, and great health benefits."
good,I learned alot about horticulture and agriculture.I learned how to drive power equipment such as a forklift and reach truck.I learned about home improvement inside and outside.
good,"Lowes is a family oriented place to work with great benefits and advancement opportunities. Management always works with you so you can be with your kids during important events and my co-workers are all friendly, awesome people ."
good,Great place to work just long hours during the Spring and Summer months
good,I put together displays for new products and interact with co-worker and provided Customer Service.
good,This company offers many benefits to their employees. Individual employee achievement acknowledgement as well as overall store achievements.
good,"A typical day at work is maintaining stock on the shelf for customers to buy. Making sure that my department is clean and assisting customers with help getting product and info on how to DIY. I coach, train and work along side my Specialists and Customer Service Associates to help better their sales and knowledge of the department. Seek out training for the associates in my department on new product so we can give the customer the most info we can. Maintain inventory accuracy, job lot quantities, and safety policies for a safe work environment. Through out the day I am helping in different departments for coverage of lunches and breaks. I also help to maintain the stores commercial accounts pertaining to flooring. Checking in with contractors to see if there is anything they will be needing soon and ordering up so we can supply their whole job"
good,"work was fun most of the time, like helping people accomplish what  they have come for, and to teach or tell customers how to plant, mulch, what fertilizer to use etc"
good,Lowes has great benefits and average compensation...I loved working there but I made some mistakes and was terminated that would be my only bad review of them
good,I loved my time working here! If you are innovative and creative then this would be a great workplace. There is no room for slackers at this job - everyone gets held accountable at some point!
good,"Fun place to work!!! "
good,I enjoyed working here.  I left for a job with better pay.  There is always ways to move up the chain of command with this company.  Good work environment.
good,"Helping customers find items and cashing them out."
good,"I loved working with this company, employees are pretty close and treat each other like family. Plenty of opportunities for advancement! I loved most of the employees and customers I worked with. Management is usually well trained and very helpful."
good,I took classes in Baltimore to learn an estimating software with a digitizer. So a typical day I worked on large commercial projects. I put together estimates and negotiated the projects while entering and interrupting job costing on each job.
good,"One of the best places I've worked. Employees were very helpful in the training process and continued to help throughout. Management was pretty good, but seemed to be very greedy for their bonuses to the fact that we were understaffed a majority of the time to save on labor."
good,It was fun but hard work. It was easy to get along with everybody.
good,"I made lasting friendships, learned a lot about home improvement, flexible hours."
good,"Definitely a diamond in the rough, this job is what you make it. If you want the opportunity to learn about all kinds of areas of home improvement, this is a great place to do it and the pay is phenomenal."
good,"I have work for lowes for 4 years, two different places."
good,"I am very gracious that I was hired at Lowe's. The people I worked with was most of the time happy and I loved each and everyone of my customers. Every job has a few bad apples, but that never damper my spirits to my customers."
good,got to work inside and outdoors. great people and can move up fast.
good,The most enjoyable part of the day is when all team members come together to complete a task and everyone is smiling and has sense of accomplishment with out any negative experience
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's and the people I worked with. I learned great customer service and time management. A typical day at work was just checking out/helping customers, answering phones, and cleaning. Management was great for the most part, except I had problems with over scheduling because I was still in school. All my coworkers and managers were easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was that it gets pretty mundane, when ever there are no customers you are not allowed to talk to anyone, so you can get bored really easy. Besides that there wasn't anything bad about the job, it was steady, good income and easy work. The most enjoyable part of the job is actually interacting with the customers, talking with them, helping them out."
good,"A typical day at work would be very busy depending on the season and what sales are going on in the store. I learned how to paint the interior and exterior of a house and with that training I learned different ways to teach my customers the correct steps on a home project. The management were very helpful. They listened to the concerns of their employees and worked with them to overcome any obstacles if time permitted. My coworkers, for the most part, were highly motivated and inquisitive individuals. They always had a question that could always be answered. The hardest part of this job was keeping the shelves stocked while customers continued to purchase the product as I pulled it down, even though that was our goal. The most enjoyable part of the job is teaching customers things that will help them make their homes more enjoyable and having the customer come back to the store knowing my name."
good,"Promoted 4 times in about 18 months. Hard hours, plenty of room to move up if you want it."
good,working for lowes was a great life experience. I learned many ways on how to manage and delegate. I also have an excellent communication skill because of the extensive amount of customers that I had to deal with each day.
good,"I work with a group to set up a conveyor.  We open the receiving doors, cut straps, and begin offloading delivery trucks.  We offload each truck completely.  There are typically up to 1,600 pieces of merchandise on each truck.  We position the merchandise onto pallets so they can be properly distributed throughout the store."
good,I started as a cashier/customer service and  was then promoted to cash room associate. I made deposits for the store and got cash ready for the drawers for the next day. Researched when drawers were off. I loved working with employees and managers. There really was no hard part about my job. I enjoyed working with customers and dealing with cash.
good,"A typical day at work would be helping and teaching customers get the right product to do small electrical jobs on their own. Also verify if they are competent enough to do small electrical jobs on their own or call an electrician to do the job for them. Included in my job process per day, is to help contractors find the right product to be successful on their job. I have learned to be patient and to listen to what the customers want and need. I have been an assistant manager for the company I am formerly working for, but it did not interest me, so I decided to stay as an Electrical Pro. My co-workers are great! most of the time they ask me to help them with projects or lead them to a person that is qualified to do the electrical work for them. There really isn't a hard part about my job. Actually that is one of the reason why I need to move on. I need something to interest me, so I can believe when I wake up in the morning, I am getting into a great program that I am interested in. The most enjoyable part of my day is teaching others and learning from other people and contractors that come in and teach me things I do not know, so I can educate others."
good,Learned a lot about every department. Great customers and great coworkers made the job fun.
good,"I started as a cashier here at Lowes, but 6 months into the job was moved to customer service and 3 months after that was made a Head  Cashier. "

good,"My days at work is when opening I get there at 5am and routine is getting the money and counting them and putting them in the registers and than making sure all the paper work that needs to be done will be ready for the customer service associate to come in and sort it out. Get the registers ready to be used. Make sure all receipt tapes and register guns are in place. Make sure that the front end is set and ready to go. I get it prepared for the customers to come in and shop. "
good,"Everyday is different with something new. Rather it be good or bad. co-workers are friendly, as well as the managers. We learn something new everyday, rather we learn form one anther or a customer. The hardest part of the job is trying to deal with an upset customer.

good,"A typical day at Lowes can be busy, challenging, yet rewarding. There is great team work and many people who have no problems explaining anything to you. Although it's a rewarding job, it's hard to establish a life outside of work with the many different shifts you must work."
good,Fun and great place to work. Learn as much as you can about product and your set!
good,"Days can be busy or slow. There are always people returning items that did not work,fit or were wrong for what they needed. It is always a pleasure to help direct people to the items they are looking for. I have learned that most customers can be very nice but there are a few that will test your patience,  Management is easy to work for and understanding when you need time off. If you do your job well they apprecieate you. The hardest part of the job is coping with inpaitient customers as well as rude customers. I enjoy my coworkers and working with them. The most enjoyable part of this job is the customers who appreciate you for your help  and come back to see you all the time"
good,"I only work part-time and still receive vacation hours and holiday pay. I am also offered health and dental insurance, Lowes takes care of their people."
good,Got to learn lots of new stuff with the company.  Management was great. And meeting new customers every day made the job fun and laid back
good,"Management at the department and store level is fairly good compared to the food sector jobs I've held over the years. The coworkers at my store are surprisingly well varied for a hardware store corporation and generally have a good disposition. My job is quite simple, so I do tend to enjoy most of it outside of the occasional rowdy customer. The department managers at the company that I have worked under do a wonderful job of leading by example. "
good,"Not a bad job at all, a lot of work with customers. Made friends with co-workers and customers too. Management pretty laid back.  "
good,"Very fast paced work place.  Always on the go, meet a lot of people daily, learned plenty of skills around money and about customers."
good,I get to work with different people from different walks of life and meet and greet the people that come into Lowes every single day and help them with the next project they are working on.
good,"This is a location that has limited quality candidates.  Retention is very difficult, I believe because the area is transient most of the time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the diversity of applicants and the challenges to staff the store."
good,"A typical day was watering plants, merchandizing, and talking to customers on what they wanted or how they wanted their garden to look, or explaining what type of fertilizer or ammendments they needed for their soil to make their plants grow. "
good,"Customer service   "
good,only complaint i had was the lack of communication between the managers.
good,Come in do your assigned tasks. Sale with purpose and with your budget in mind. I have learned the importance of a work culture. Management is very hands on. Co-workers are very helpful and you work hand and hand. Hardest part of the job is learning everything the job requires with minimal hands on training. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people that truly need your help and making a difference with them.
good,Here i Worked in a few different departments. I started in the cash and customer service desk. I was then transfered into the installation office. Here I was responsible for over seeing all the installs from decks and windows to flooring.
good,working in retail or customer service there is no typical day at work. Everyday is different. I would work on resets and took care of any customers that were in my sight. I also finished any projects i needed to for management. the most enjoyable part was interacting with customers.
good,"Though the pay is good and the fellow associates are mostly positive and lively, the work hours leave something to be desired and the shuffling shifts between morning and afternoons make it difficult to obtain a second job. On top of the shifting hours, most positions are strictly part-time and do not supply the hours necessary to make the higher pay worth it."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to pull pallets filled with boxes of items for my department, Break each pallet down and stock my department as needed. After my department is stocked clean my department to make sure its customer ready. I learned how to operate power equipment in a safe way and stock . I love management at Lowes because there always making sure there workers are aware of the goals that need to be reached. The most enjoyable part about the jobs was management and co-workers made the job easy,safe and fun."

good,"Retail, its a working business, rotating shifts, a job just like most."
good,"It's a pretty good place to work, all the employees are willing to help, the management team is very supportive and will try to help you the best way they can, the hardest part about the job is slow periods during your shift. the most enjoyable part is pleasing the customers when they leave"
good,"I enjoy my job at Lowes, I get to meet new people and help others. I have learned a few things about home improvement that I did not know.Example ... you must use cerain electrical outlets for bathrooms and there are lots of types of wood working tools for everthing. The people I work with works as a team and that is great! Team work does make a difference. The management is excellent. Although I love the garden center the hardest part to me is the heat in the middle of summer. I get personal satisfaction from helping others get what they want and seeing them happy with their ideas coming to life!"
good,typical day at work consist of promoting sales all day long. In this job i learned how to interact with customers on a professional level and to better read them on their needs and wants. Management seems distant at time but when you do get a chance to express yourself they are there to listen. Co-workers are just like family at Lowes. We all look after one another to help get things done. The hardest part of my job is the long hours on your feet but well worth it when making a sale. But the most enjoyable is the smile on a customers face when you provide great customer service.
good,Fair day pending on whats going on. You learn something new everyday. Management great as long as everybody would do there job instead of putting off on someone else and not getting done. Same as co-workers. Hardest part of the job is not having everything you need to finish the job. when everything is going good and making progress.
good,"it was a great place to work, my supervisor was awesome and the people in general were very nice and helpful"
good,"Great comapny to work for. I was promoted 2 times to a sales manager within 2 years. learned alot, great pay and great managment. Hardest part of job is just adjustiing to the many personalities in the store"
good,"This was a very easy place for me to work for. Given my past experience, I excelled in my daily tasks."
good,"Everyday I would go in and either work a register at the front end, customer service, or returns. My manager was good about letting me cross train on all three and even when the store was slow they would let me go help stock or clean around the store. My coworkers were great. They made the workday go by so much better. The hardest part about the job were the days where you still had nothing to keep you busy because it was so slow. The most enjoyable part was really the coworkers. We all felt like family."
good,"Is a very fast paced environment, with many deadlines on a weekly basis. Learned a great deal on the computor, specialized programs, quickbooks, excell. Managment is very layed back and leaves most employee managing to the main accounts supervisor. The hardest part of the job is that there is very little training, most things are dumped in your lap and it is sink or swim. The nicest part of the job is the lunch provided daily in the cafeteria, freshly cooked and very healthy, we also had a state of the art gym to use."
good,"Low stress job, and great work environment. Never a dull moment from the different customers arriving at the store."
good,"load , and secure load ,,,unload with fork lift ,,, the most enjoyable part is the driving"
good,"Most days were prety much the same, your everyday customers would come in rather it be for shopping or just mingle with the employees. During my employment at Lowes i learned many skills, such as: glass cutting, carpet cutting, processing internet orders, great customer service skills, electrical procedures, cycle counting, how to sell credit, etc..., Authority was keen more so on delivering great customer sevice, because greart service meant a happy customer, The mst difficult part would have to be maintain a productive attitude when the store is slow, finding things to do like stocking or zoning items would be some past times of mine. The best part was definitely being able to help someone in need and guarenteeing your work and creating more everday customers for the corporation."
good,"Long days, great store manager, fun co-workers, benefits started from day one."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of coming in on time and clocking in. Immediately after that, begin loading trucks with merchandise in a productive but fast pace. These trucks were our shipments to our stores. My management team was very friendly and caring of the employees. All of the other workers were very friendly and we all had a good team perspective. The most enjoyable part of my job is the sense of accomplishment at the end of day when all the work is done."
good,•Mixed Paint Colors. Shook the paint cans.
good,My day consists of coming in to work and figuring out what has to be loaded and delivered for that specific day. Deliver and install appliances as well as other product sold in the store. The hardest part of the job is the physical aspect. Having to maneuver appliances (that aren't the lightest things in the world) into tight spots. Sometime having to disassemble the product completely and reassemble it once back inside the house (i.e. French Door refrigerators). The most enjoyable part is the interaction with the customers. I am a very LOYAL employee.
good,"Great job, strong customer service values. Training to become a stronger leader. Supportive management, good and friendly co worker. Hardest part is dealing with customers that believe they know more than you. Which isn't that bad, and the most enjoyable part is helping those customers that really need your help and are grateful."
good,"Lowes is a great place to work, I've been trying to go back to work them because I truly loved my job. Lowes has true customer service and helps the customers with great consideration."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy. From freight coming in, waiting on customers, working with management on several projects. No two days are the same. Lowe's is becoming the leader in technology on our computer system and I-phones. Therefore, there are always new programs to learn and share with your co-workers and the customers. Most of my co-works are wonderful. Some are there to work and others are there to collect a paycheck. Lowe's is very good about weeding out the slackers. The hardest part of my job is dealing with upset customers. Sometimes they have a right to be upset and sometimes they are just looking for a discount. The mose enjoyable part of my job is making my customers, management and co-workers happy. I love to make people smile."
good,"I was a cashier so I stood around a lot. I loved interacting with people, and it was a particulary easy job. There was opportunities to advance which was great."
good,"Top priority is taking care of customers. Secondary priorities include stocking merchandise, filling internet orders, and organizing merchandise and sales floor; all while following safety protocol."

good,"A typical day at work, was always a fun and new learning experience for me. Working with customers, and as a team, you will always learn something new everyday. My co-workers, was very fun spirited, but they knew how to buckle down and get their work done. The hardest part of the job was probably cleaning up, the job was not really a stressful job. The most enjoyable part of the job for me, would be the same in any job. Working with people in general is always a fun, new, and exciting experience for me."
good,The first day I started working everyone was there to try and help me with learning new things and learning where everything was in the store. The hardest part of the job was to learn where everything is in the store.

good,"I think Lowe's needs to improve it's managers, and communication skills with it's employees. Other than that, I had no problems"
good,Lowe's is a pretty good company. As a high school or college student working part-time it would be great. They are very flexible. Full-time I would not necessarily look at it as something to support the family.
good,I have worked for Lowe's for six and a half years and it has been a good employment for me. I work the same schedule every week (Friday- Sunday) and it has worked wonderfully for me. Some management personnel are less than agreeable but I believe that is something you will have at any workplace.
good,I have been working for Lowes for over a year. I work full-time and attend college they are really flexible with my school schedule. I would recommend anybody to work there
good,"Is an okay place to work there's a lot of gossip as a cashier"
good,From the first day I started working I was treated with respect and I'm always told by management how much I am appreciate it it is a great place to work is like one big family and I really enjoyed my job. They respect Veterans both staff & Customers.
good,"This company has a strong direction, one focusing on customers first which is obvious.  They are making a strong effort to move up with the times and be the forerunner instead of the follower.  Changes in executive management has brought about positive movement even though at some expense.  Regardless, a great company to be part of and work for."
good,I loved working at Lowe's the people I worked with. Very friendly. When you need help they help you. They offer you to move up in the company which is great for most people.
good,Overall ran well- pay could be stronger as far as raises but the benefits are great. If you can handle being on your feet a lot and don’t mind an honest workday- it’s a job to consider.
good,"Lowes is 100 percent customer focused. its a fast paced retail enviroment, where your main priority is the customer. I enjoyed helping customers achieve their goals."
good,Lowes is by far is a Fast growing company. Many changes are being made to better the sales volume and technology used within the company. I highly recommend applying.
good,"I enjoy working at Lowes. Everyone is nice and welcoming, they have great attitudes. This is the first job I can actually say I enjoy working at. The benefits help a lot, especially since I’m currently a college student."
good,"Lowe's is an excellent place to start working, they have flexible hours, and a large amount of positions commonly open almost all the time.  The people there are normally fairly friendly, a good place to work most of the time."
good,It was a very good place to work and I enjoyed my time with the company as a Human Resources Manager.  I enjoyed that everyday was different and challenging.
good,I love my job at Lowe's.  I have an amazing Leadership team that does everything they can to support their staff and help make sure there is work/life balance.  The company is in the midst of a lot of change with a new CEO so you have to be willing to go with the flow.  I believe the majority of the changes I have seen are better for the company as a whole. Competitive wages for the majority of the positions they offer.
good,It was easy to get along with the people I worked with and they would always help me with any questions I had with the job. I feel Lowes really gave me a chance to improve my customer service and expand my knowledge on things I didn't have knowledge of before.
good,I enjoyed coming to work to help customers and make people smile in the process... Offering help to other employees if they needed it... I enjoyed fixing things or painting and I was alway good on finishing any task I had in a timely maner to get to the next task

good,"its a great place to work , its fast paced and great friendly people , they care about there employees and the company its self they are always striving to make the company better"
good,"This is not the place to work if you want to advance in your career. The pay is not comparable to other companies, very low pay. You have to be in their click to work there"

good,"While working at Lowe's I discovered that there were a lot of customers and great people that work there. Also, the environment or atmosphere that you would get from the associates when having a bad day or anything they would help and give you great advice."
good,Very strong team environment. Lots of company outings with a family atmosphere. Outstanding benefits but very low pay. A very safe and secure workplace
good,I unloaded trucks for 10 hours a day. The job is basically easy. Long as you pay attention when you are in training so you will get the proper training to do things the right way to get the job done
good,Always be on time and always follow directions and listen to supervisor. And when on equipment in store or outside always make sure you have a spotter to guid you through the store.
good,"go the extra step and you will have no issues---job is to help the customer and go beyond when needed to do it,  Great place to work if you decide you want to put an effort into your job"

good,the people their was friendly I left due to me not getting my raises like I was suppose to but overall it was a great place to work for I like what I did plus I was good at my job and the people loved me
good,Working for Lowes was a great experience over the 17yrs that I was there I learned a lot about retail. For example it helped me open up with other people.
good,Lowe’s was a fun place to work. Every associate in each department was kind and helped make the customer experience better each time. Customer satisfaction was the main goal when working there.
good,I am a FT student and was able to get my BS degree in just three years. Lowe’s worked with my constantly changing schedule and they offer tuition reimbursement.
good,My position is pretty great and I get a lot of help from other employees whenever I have issues. Only issue is that my position is more of a two person position (always requiring safety spotters for power equipment).
good,"It  was a good job and they give good hours.I love the managers they were kind,patient,and I like the open door.Which means you can talk to them about anything and they are there to listen to you ."
good,"Great job, flexible hours, good mgm. Good customer care, good return policy,good break room, good discounts and offers good products for the money. Good delivery service."

good,The schedule is the greatest thing about working at Lowe's. I have weekends off and ollnley work for 10 hour shifts. The pay could be better but in my opinion a great place to work for.
good,"My experience in New Hampshire was certainly different than my experience in Kentucky. Locating to a new store does impose some difficulties. But it can also impose some strengths. There is the fitting in  period and then there is the period where no one knows you so.. you can just be your best."
good,A typical day is helping customers finding the things  they come in to get and making sales. Management are nice and understanding and they help out whenever they can.

good,"Lowes as a company is great, the management teams at the stores can make or break the experience. For a long time it seemed like you had to know someone to be able to work there, that has changed."
good,"Work starts off with logging into your register. Lowes is very fast paced and customer focused. I learn how handle money, problems, and sales in an organized and quality manner. Managers are constantly walking the store for overrides and extra hands in a busy work day. It's very loud and friendly in Lowes. You never know what can come your way so you have to be prepared and postive. The hardest part would be having dependable employees. The most enjoyable part would be the satisfaction of insuring customers to depend on Lowes for a complete choice for home improvements."

good,"Good company to work for . Great benefits. They work with your schedule. And they appreciate their customers and employees."

good,"Worked outside as a customer service associate, most of the time just cleaning up aisles for safety reasons and asking customers if they needed help. Managers were always around and helpful, wouldn't mind helping you with what you were doing. Expectations weren't too high as we had some associates who didn't perform their jobs, but it was an overall nice job for the summer. Had a couple company luncheons which was cool."
good,"Great place to work, great collaboration between team members with in the team and out side of team, great leader ship from manager that also cares for team members."
good,"I have worked at Lowes for 20 years and in most departments using on job training and having the ability to achieve to become a specialist and coordinator in departments."
good,Very Challenging position. Makes you think outside the box. Learning to delegate tasks and not trying to do them all yourself. Communication not just with the people you are over seeing but also with upper management.
good,"Great company and great benefits. Good place to start a career. You will learn a great deal if this is your first job. Great workplace culture, felt like family."
good,"Lowe's is a very fast paced, driven work environment. There is always something to be done. Must be motivated and have a good work ethic. Not for the weak."

This includes responsibility for customer facing activities on the sales floor (e.g., greeting customers, listening and probing to understand needs, identifying solutions), as well as non-customer facing activities (e.g., downstocking, inventory management and area recovery). The Service Manager ensures department(s) are customer ready at all times while inspiring engaging, customer-focused behavior, mitigating and reducing customer complaints, and driving positive first impressions for customers upon entering the store."
good,"They made a special job for me when I decided to go to school. Great retail chain to work for. If you need a seasonal position, they are the ones to choose."

good,Lowe's its self is a great place to work if you can handle grumpy customers! The people are great to work with and it truly feels like a family at Lowe's.
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowes. I worked at a high volume store so we were always busy with physical customers and internet orders. Management was great until the district moved managers around to other stores, we ended with managers that did not know anything about the department they were running and some that have been in their positions for years but had not experienced having so many customers."
good,There is ALWAYS something to be done in each department. The store I'm currently working at is very understaffed so I end up working in departments other than my own.
good,"Lowe's Home Improvement started me out in Lawn and Garden. I quickly moved up after testing out to other departments. Hardware was probably my favorite. Then tested out to move to Electrical, spending about 2 months there. Moved to Cashier and ended my employment with running the cash office. Potential to advance and learn are big with this company."
good,"There are a lot of different aspects of the job, but the main two that make up your day to day schedule is putting product on the shelves through returns, down-stocking, and freight, and while doing that accepting and servicing customers. The best kind of person for this job is someone who can follow orders, has good eyesight, is reasonably strong, can handle standing, walking, and bending over for several hours with out many breaks, good customer service skills, ability to visualize a customer's project and point them to all the products they need, prior knowledge about the products in your department (they don't really train you on the products, it is up to you to really learn them), basic computer skills, and a good attitude about work (there are a lot of grumps, so your ability to keep your complaining to a minimum will be good for you and your bosses)."
good,"Although my time at Lowe's has come to a closure, the culture within the organization was wonderful. Workers were always friendly, and helpful when asked a question. I would not personally consider it as a career, but it is one of the best part time jobs I've had. I'd recommend it to anybody. Be courteous, be kind, and you'll go far."

good,I was a devoted employee for over 20 yrs. It was time for me to retire from full time. They could not offer me a part time position. It is a great place to work
good,"Great work environment with great leaders and co-workers. They put in a real effort to make it feel like one, big family. It is hard to land a full time position but great work is recognized."
good,I was hired for a Lumber man then after a year I move to Cashier then after 2 years I move to Electrical. I love the company very much it's a great job I learn a lot. Everyone work there was great like a family. Can't wait to go back to work with the team.

good,Working at Lowe's was the best decision of my life. The culture and the purpose of the company is something that all employees display both at work and off the clock. Lowe's is built upon strong morals and a background of changing with the times to stay relevant. The best thing about working with Lowes is not only helping customers but working with a team of people that have the same mindset and goals as you.

good,"Love the people, and the environment. Management was always Fair to their employees. Plenty of new opportunities to choose from. Love meeting new customers and their challenges."
good,Great place to work at but if u want to move up they have more positon for u like I started at the bottom and upgraded within 5 months of being there if u put in the work u will be rewarded.
good,Working here was a great learning experience for me. I would not have imagined it would mean so much to me and hurt so much to leave. I would go back and do it all over again even if the outcome was the same.
good,I enjoy my job here but the stress sometimes gets rough.  The hardest part is that it is very labor intensive.  The best part is you have great co workers.
good,"I've enjoyed my time spent with Lowe's through working with a team that takes pride in productivity, honest work, and out-of-the-box ways of thinking."
good,Excellent experience loved working and selling appliances.  I was really good at it. I only stopped working their because I moved to Melbourne. Also they wanted me to move 300 pound refrigerators by myself.  We had no help.  I am 5 foot 4 130lbs.  When a refrigerator almost fell on me I decided it was to unsafe to work there.  I did ask for help and was denied.
good,"This is a great place to work especially for the young adults just entering the work force market.  The management at the location I worked are all very supportive in answering questions, and understood you have a personal life beyond work in the event something came up.  If you put in effort in your job you can definitely advance here.  Goes to the saying you get what you give. The hardest part of the job for me was dealing with irate customers, had to bite my tongue a lot haha."
good,"Good opportunities for advancement as long as you're a good worker and know the right people.  Overall, I enjoyed my time there and made a few really good friends.  They also have some of the best benefits/compensation of any retail business there is.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  You'd be surprised how much money you can actually make here if you work hard and advance through the company."
good,Enjoyed my time at Lowes. I feel As Though I've learned a lot. I also feel As though I'm indeed ready to move on to further my knowledge in this work field. My accomplishments in life are to further my life's goals.
good,"Great company. great Benefits for full time employees and students.  Hours were flexible for students and even had overnight shifts for stock teams. Safe environment, even when dealing with heavy machinery and equipment."
good,"i would start with the returns, process them for credit then do my out for repair, then do the damage on hand, send out the ups and fed ex.Then process the buybacks, and work with the vendors for credit."
good,Great place to work. Enjoyed working with the public. Management and employees were very friendly. Always had  a opportunity to take classes on products in the store.
good,"My typical day at work start by clocking in and getting straight to work. I have no time to start the day off by being lazy and not wanting to work. I am the muscles as some call me at work, because I lift the majority of the heavy stuff on the floor on in the back. so my days are long and hot but i enjoy them. As far as the managers all 4 of my managers are all real nice and easy to cooperate with and are real understanding about certain thing. One of the hardest things about my job would have to be when we are short handed and I have to cover 4 or more departments in one day/night. And lastly one of the most enjoyable parts of my job is the people I work with, they are all nice and easy to get along with."
good,The employees are what make this company. The loyalty and faithfulness to the company regardless of the reciprocation of that is beyond comprehension.
good,"If you work hard, they will reward you well.  Although it is shift work, you know your hours in advance and there is a great sense of family in the store."
good,"Working at Lowe's company is a productive, fun, and progressive workplace with very supportive coworkers. I have learned how to work both individually and as a team member. Management is flexible and works around worker's availability. The hardest part of the job is getting to know everything when one is still new. However, after getting familiar with what is expected of an employee, most of the tasks become enjoyable."
good,"Everyday was fairly busy at Lowes. I learned a lot about helping customers, unloading stock, production labels, using machines to get product down from top-stock and using the computer system to check how much stock we had for customers. Management was pretty friendly and fun to work with, they were always easy going and always working with you. The most enjoyable part was working with my fellow employees."
good,Lowe's is a great place to work for all difgerent types of people. There is plenty of room for advancement for anyone willing to learn and be involved in the job. Overall a great job for anyone looking for an entry position to someone looking to manage or be a specialist.
good,Like working with the company easy people to get along with made it that much easier to work there. The company is great to start a career in and move up easily with hard work and patience
good,"I was a part of the night crew so there were 7-10 of us on the crew at any one given time, and because it was such a small crew and we would work with each other every day we got to know each other really well and it was fun to joke around with the guys."
good,"Typical day at work was work hard, deal with customers, and maintain company policies. The most enjoyable part of the company is the people you work with."

good,"Great management and working place.  "
good,"Great management"
good,"Overall I like working for Lowe's. My position to the company is new so that comes with its own snags that have left me in the dark from time to time. However, I have really enjoyed working there and everything that I have learned. "
good,"I enjoy working at lowes, It has good management and pretty good benefits for a part time job. Fair pay for retail and they work well on scheduling."

good,"Great place to work. Great managers. Fast pace and repetitive."
good,I loved working at the R DC but was promoted at a bad time. Company is great to work for and environment was relaxed. My typical day at work was assigning trailers to the dock doors according to certain criteria.
good,I had a terrific experience working at the South Burlington Lowes. Management and co-workers were there to help and make sure you felt comfortable and appreciated. The company really does become one big family. Wonderful job to say the least.
good,"A typical day at work is clocking in and following your supervisors instructions on what needs to be done from time to time as a customer representative, it could be covering lunches, handling returns, answering phones to answering customers questions on the floor in different departments. Our main our goal is to provide the best customer service for our customers. I love multi-tasking and taking care of more than one thing. Co-workers can be helpful at times which is great. Hardest part is when there is a lack of teamwork. Most enjoyable part is when a customer leaves with a smile on there face."
good,"Lowe's provides a safe, and professional working place for its people. The campus is beautifully decorated with good looking natural plans, flowers. I loved to work for Lowe's."
good,"I love my job , However I always wanted to take off on my career, and I may even still have Lowes on the side as a second job. I love my coworkers and the atmosphere; I plan to move up in my position whether its at Lowes or another company."
good,a great experience working with the company. The management is friendly and courteous to my needs.  Each day is a different experience when providing customer service. The enjoyable part of the job is the feeling you have when helping someone to complete a home improvement project.
good,"Family oriented, great pay and benefits. Great management who cares about the employees. Favorite Job. Good culture, awards, employees are recognized for their accomplishments."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of following up on customer orders and finalizing any open orders"
good,"My co-workers and nice and knowledgeable. I know I can count on them to lend me a hand when I need them. I learn a lot by working here, and love what I do. Lowe's is the most positive workplace I've ever had the pleasure of working in."
good,"Great business to work for. My typical day at work is doing all my tasks in a timely fashion and to be accurate and consistent."
good,The co-workers were great to work with . It was more like family then work . The management changed a lot while I was there about seven or eight times witch made it difficult.
good,"Management within owes is very fair; you can have a good position and wage. It is a very relaxing environment and many different tasks to keep the job interesting. If you enjoy learning about home improvement,   you can learn a lot as an employee at Lowes."
good,Lowe's was a great company to work for. They always had contest to encourage you to do your best. They would throw parties when goals were achieved. The handled problems professionally and really put customers ahead. Their pay rate also started out several dollars more hourly than other jobs in my area.
good,great place to work I learned how to talk to customers better the management is great co-workers are nice helpful the hardest part of the job is unloading the rdc trucks the most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers and making there experience enjoyable.
good,"I enjoy working for the company.  Good management, great co-workers. Very few hours.  10 per week.  They hire a lot of employees so they can give very few hours."
good,"I learn a lot everyday about customer service and the merchandise. I also learn interesting this about home improvement. The training program could use a little improvement but overall i love it there. They have pretty good health benefits. The employees are very friendly and management is very helpful and organized. The hardest part of the job is knowing where everything is in the store, but the most enjoyable thing about working at Lowes is going to work knowing that your going to be productive and help somebody."
good,"We're a big diverse family who is willing to do what it take to keep a smile on each others faces, especially to our loyal customers."

good,"In this company, work and life balance is placed as a top priority. Safety and job security are also among the top priorities of the company."
good,"If you work hard and put in effort and maybe brown nose a bit you can advance in this company, Starting pay is decent for entry level jobs requiring little to no prior experience, higher than most places. Depending on where you go the atmosphere is very friendly. Downsides are: You're on a corporate schedule so it changes unless you can get a position with set hours. Certain positions are very hard to move out of (freight unloaders, cashiers, customer service reps.) But if you keep trying and nail your interviews, you should be able to eventually. Hardest part of the job is understaffing. Makes it very hard for you to help customers when it gets busy if you don't have another associate in your department, Good luck finding help sometimes. The most enjoyable part of the job would probably be the satisfaction you get when you deliver a great customer experience and the customer leaves with a smile and compliments and then asks for you personally next time they come shopping. Co workers are mostly friendly but that can vary depending which one you're working at. Both part timers and full timers are eligible for benefits. Overall my favorite company I've worked for by far."
good,A typical work day would be helping customers find what they were looking for in their everyday home improvement needs. Helping a customer pick something out for their house and making them happy was a great way to spend the day.
good,"I just had almost no issues with this company. Worst I could say is that I got cut down a lot during the depression of the time."
good,Everyday is not like the last.  Enjoy not having the same old everyday.  There is customer situations that require some research to solve their problems
good,This particular store is very busy and the employees here are excellent. They consistently pulled their own weight and helped when another co-worker was in need. Management was always on top of things and did their job wonderfully.
good,"Best Job I have had by far, hope to find another like it in the near future when I relocate."
good,I love the job the manger was good ther. The pay was good you can move up in the company. The hours was good the benifits was good
good,"Very exciting work place because I love interacting with customers, also my co-workers were awesome. The manager Scott was amazing to work for!!"
good,Lowes was good learning experience. Team members were always willing to help when needed. The management team was very supportive. Did not know a lot about the job when first started. Management provided me with the tools I needed to the job done as safe as possible I had to be very efficient and accurate while lifting metal pipes and lumber.
good,"Fun work place"
good,"my job as brought me along way, i enjoy interacting with customers. my job provides me an opportunities to put that basic urge to use  for a purpose. i feel i am working with professionals that i can learn from and they will push me to take on new and challenging opportunities."
good,"Great place to work for a part time job. Lots of room for expansion, and growth. I left for a job in the field I went to school for or id still be there"
good,At Lowes you will ALWAYS have something to do. Even if you are on your way to break you are more than likely to get stopped by a customer.
good,"A business work place that add incentives for job well done. the benefits, health, 401k are very good. working hours varies, but that's not bad."
good,A typical day at work was very relaxed and uplifting. It was in a fun environment but firm when needed to be. I learned an abundance about team work and how to efficiently work with others without conflict.
good,i help people with there projects also i have learned all the differrent board sizes & what their used for. My Management team is really good at putting people were their needed. Helping people is were i get the most satisfaction from my job
good,"Lowes was the absolute best job I ever had. My work week was Mon-Thurs 6am- 4:30pm. The facility was clean and cool. Their pay was excellent compared to other warehouses. Workers were like family, our managers were also great people. Hate that I had to quit due to relocation."
good,"Company is great. Great Mangers, great people to work with. You can grow if you like. Only thing is schedule can be tough. Gives you nights and weekends. No balance for your life. But that's retail. Still a great company."
good,"Management is driven to achieving the best service possible for all customers. As a customer service associate, my coworkers and I all fed off the same vibe to accomplish our store goals. Safety is emphasized everyday which I think is one of the key factors I enjoy about the company. I've learned so much since starting. Home development is a broad subject and one can learn many different things about it. The hardest thing about the job is the never-satisfied customers that retail gets sometimes but once you learn the job you find ways to turn it around."
good,"Busy "
good,"I loved my job, learning new things, training courses monthly to keep your skills sharp , great work environment, great pay, best benefits, family-environment"
good,Lowes provided a diverse work enviroment. There is room for advancement and growth with Lowes. Lowes have a great benefits. The atmosphere is positive and engaging.
good,"The culture at Lowe's in general is very uplifting and encouraging. You either work 4 - 10 hour shifts a week or Friday, Saturday and Sunday for 12hrs and get Monday through Thursday off. The work/life ratio is about the best I've seen. Generally, they try to build you up to take on leadership roles. If you ask for it they do it faster. Very little to say about this company in the negative."
good,Great Company to work for with great Management team. Not one day is the same. Co works are team Players. No hard parts of the job
good,The enjoyable part of the job is that I work in every department. I learned to help customer and answered their questions. My manger was very co-operative. My co-workers were helpful
good,Good place to work. Management was good. Benefits were very good. I enjoyed working there. Big store and customers were great.
good,you learn a lot and you learn it fast. great managers pretty good pay and very helpful upper management
good,"Within the first couple of months, I was trained on a wide variety of things. Such as; forklift, power stocker, reach truck, wood, glass, rope, key and chain cutting, etc. The place had really good pay with great benefits. The coworkers were nice and very helpful. Management tends to treat you more like you're just a statistic and don't take time with individual employees. Tend to act like you're replaceable. The hardest part was trying to get EVERYTHING done because there was so much. The most enjoyable parts definitely were using the power equipment."
good,"Greeting customers,running reg.,cleaning,stocking,etc. I very much enjoyed my time a Lowes and working with the best people. The hardest part of my job was when I had to move to another town and leaving Lowes,the customers and all friends behind."
good,Great place to interact with customers. Communication skills as well as your multitasking skills are able to be well rehearsed.
good,My overall review of Lowes is good. They have benefits for part-timers. Pay rating was good as a cashier. I learned how to establish credit cards and grow clienteles. Co-workers were amazing! Very friendly and outgoing. Everything was great working at Lowes.
good,Excellent customer service. Worked with contractors to get supplies at a affordable cost while maintaining a good margin for the company. Scheduled deliveries to coordinate the times needed for the contractors. Brought new business in to the company by visiting and calling them. Worked well with the pro service team. The hardest part of the job was not always having enough time in one day. The most enjoyable part of my job was increasing sales and exceeding my goals.
good,I enjoyed working for Lowe's. The benefits were great and the management was very understanding and caring to all of the employees. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the associates that I managed.
good,"A typical day at work consist of locating any merchandise that may not be able to be found in Store Inventory. It also includes addressing any Safety Issues that may arise in order to make Lowe's a safe place for Customers as well as Associates. Management is there if you need them and if they are not then it's easy to contact them. The most enjoyable part of this job is protecting the Company's assets, assisting customers and making sure that Employees and Customers return home the way they entered our Stores."
good,I've only been here a few months as a cashier and I like it. At first it was hard learning everything but I'm not afraid to ask questions. The head cashiers are very helpful and so are the department managers. They pay is great and I can see myself advancing with this company. After a talk with HR I was able to get full time hours.
good,"Lowes has been a great stepping stone for me. Not only did they work around my basketball schedule when I was playing collegiately, the scheduling allowed me to finish my bachelors degree. If my availability opened up and the weekly payroll allowed it, I picked up whatever extra shifts I could get. I have learned how communication is critical in a location that typically has 120+ employees. That planning and execution are critical to completed tasks in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of my job is assisting customer with a purchase or planning of a future project. Lowe's offers many great services from installation to financing options."
good,"I started off as a cashier and when I started 9 years ago the training was minimal but now 2014 it is almost no training for new employees coming on I feel really bad for people starting and just being thrown in to their position. I have such a great relationship with my fellow employees and my customers thats what makes me want to go to work everyday. Also, it is a secure and steady job and they are good to you when you show you are dedicated to their company."
good,"It was a generally rewarding job experience. There was very little outside assistance at the lowes distribution center. I worked very independently, completing most tasks related to the maintenance program of the facility. I did everything from diagnostics and repair of computer control forklifts, yard spotter, and sweeping equipment. To installation and redesign of an electric flat bed tarp lifting hoist, welding and fabricating various tools , racks , ect, to the sale of used decommissioned forklifts, corporate hazmat reports, parts management, contractor management. I worked alone in the maintenance department with the general manager as my supervisor / manager and a corporate regional maintenance manager also. My only general deviations requiring manager approvals and consulting   were  based on budget and spending for contractor or above average parts costs and needs. As well as sporadic special projects and tasks management needed. Management assisted with concerns as best he could without any mechanic or maintenance experience or knowledge.  I was allowed to work independently with very little intervention and make my own task completion schedule. One issue with management was lack of knowledge in maintenance or mechanics. Anything i wasn't able to get completed had to be put on a waiting list and completed as time allows and had little control over enlisting contractor help when needed. My long term co workers worked very well with me and understood my large work load and were understanding of my immense work load. The most difficult part of my job was the immense work"
good,"great job, overnights with ab wonderful team, stocked shelves and unloaded trucks, learned how to manage my time well to meet everyday requirments"
good,Overall great place to work. Customers are typically great management team is good.
good,I enjoyed working at Lowe's because of the friends I made over the years that I have been there it was like a family. The benefits was great and the pay was good to me.
good,"Once you have clocked in, the fun begins. I'm constantly dealing with customers that are returning items, picking items up, paying credit card bills, applying for credit cards, while transferring phone calls. Its a fast paced environment."
good,The people I work with are fun to be around and make the harder days easier to deal with. The work is steady and there is always something to do to make the time pass faster. The management is always there to help lead you in the right direction and help you learn more to be there to help the customers.
good,"Being a Lowes Dispatcher, is a job that requires, you to communicate with the Delivery drivers, the store associates, and customers.  It is position, that requires you to have a knowledge of store procedures concerning customer deliveries.   It requires attention to detail, and providing superior customer service to all.  The management team at Lowes are on top of things, and care  about their employees.  My co-workers are a great group of people to be around."
good,"typical day at work, punch in early head straight to the sales floor. "
good,"Such a great company to work for, worked around schedules when you have young kids and also if you are in college they work with your school schedule."
good,"The store manager has definitely found a way to create and great culture within every department. The cooperation between departments was also very well.  This particular store has made a turn around in customer satisfaction for the better actively competing with other stores in our region for sales and customer satisfaction. Overall, great store and great employees who take interest and provide positive reinforcement in work and personal lives."
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for. I was a cashier and was paid $10.25 an hour when I started. I got all the hours I wanted and loved working with all the people. I have no complaints about working here! management was great, the hardest thing about the job was going home i loved that place. i loved all my customers."
good,"I learned how to become a more effective manager through communication, weekly meetings, and being open and friendly with my fellow co-workers."
good,I work as a cashier for about two months before I was offered a different position. My supervisor bragged on my customer service stills that he offered me the customer service position. I know how to deal with customers in risky situations.
good,"Lowe's is more than just a work place, it's another home! I don't mean this in the literal sense, I mean that when I go there I know i'm around good company just like being around family. I feel like the core values are all the same in all employees so naturally we all get along better. "

good,"While alternating between being a cashier, customer service associate, and being a weekend sales team member, I learn about new products, current sales, and techniques to improve credit application rates. As a weekend sales team member, I work with management regarding what needs to be done that particular day and take critique on improving customers' shopping experience. As a cashier, I interacted with co-workers to quickly and efficiently check out customers while avoiding lines exceeding three customers. As a cashier the hardest part is when work is slow and there is not much to do, but when I am on the weekend sales team the hardest thing I encounter is trying to locate uncommon merchandise. The most enjoyable part of my cashier, customer service associate, and weekend sales team member duties is the fact that I improved someone's day whether it is answering one simple question, assisting a decision, or even just by greeting them and asking them how their day is going and asking them if they need any help - letting them know I genuinely care about their shopping experience."
good,"Great place to work with senior management, benefits and flexability"
good,Good benefits-Management structure is a little strange but you can move up in the company
good,"A typical day at Lowes was steady or slow. I've learned how to handle cash and count the draw at the end of my shift. Management was always friendly, understanding and easy to work with. My co-workers were always nice, fun and helpful. The hardest part of my job was getting use to were everything in the store was located therefore I myself never would go to lowes to for anything before I started working there. The most enjoyable part was always getting friendly customers and working in a friendly environment all around."
good,"I worked in Lawn and Garden, and it was great! My co-workers were so much fun to work with, and the customers were almost always polite and considerate. However, in the summer time when it would be 70 degrees outside; it was almost 110 inside the L&G center."
good,"just a great place to gain experience, enjoy the environment and the coworkers/managers are awesome!"
good,I worked in the Outdoor lawn & Garden Center. I learned alot more plant material and add on's that I knew previosly. The most enjoyable thing was dealing with the public and working with plants.
good,iv only worked here for a few days as i just moved to knoxville from athens. the managers were really friendly and helpful in the hiring process. my co workers seem to be teem oriented and helpful as well.
good,I had to a very enjoyable time working at lowes until i was hurt while working.
good,A typical day consist of greeting costumers and making sure the parking lot is clean. Also by helping costumers with their merchandise. My learning experience is about training me how to work around costumers and co workers in a business place. To make sure I'm quick and effective in the working environment. Management consist of the head manager watching over me as I perform my daily task throughout the work day. My co-workers were helpful in showing me how to perform my work load and also assisting me when I was on break or during a busy period. The Hardest part would be catching up with my work load when coming to work on a busy day. The Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the different amount of people through the days.
good,Enjoyed the co-workers. Also the inmates some was a pleasure to meet. Supervisor was one of her favorites .
good,"Its a very nice place to work at if you like to help customers. The store I worked at was a brand new opening store so it was a very nice experience to help the organization to build up the place, it made it feel like it was your own store. "
good,"I have learned a lot about flowers and other garden knowledge over the years, I have met a lot of customers that i enjoy seeing on a daily basis.I have worked with many of my co-workers for as long as 8 or 9 years we have a really good working environment . The hardest part of my job is coming in contact with customers that are impossible to make happy, I am known as having a very bubbly personality and I hate when there is that one customer you just can 't please. I love spring because all the flowers start to come in and i began to see all of my regular customers on a daily basis shopping to freshen up their landscapes"
good,It was a very enjoyable company to work for.There was great chances for advancement. Climb as high up the ladder you anted to.
good,"I'd work for them again anytime,... and they pay well.. great benefits too!"
good,"Customer service is the main focus. All co-workers are very friendly and helpful. Management staff is very friendly, approachable, and cooperative."
good,"a day at work i start off with whats first to do in the calendar, and make sure everything is running right and in order"
good,Spend days helping customers find items and ensure a safe work place
good,"Fast pace retail floor. A company with a sloution to it customer base. Great stock levels, product availablity and a customer satisfaction base made this a great place to be to apply my retail craft."
good,"MY store,Lowes has re.spect for all employees. we have a friendly feeling for the most part. ""Pros"" are respected by the company and a go to employee for other employees."
good,"I enjoy going to work but I do not have that job security. I am a Peak associate therefore i have no benefits, overall I am ha hard and consistent worker. Punctual and reliable. A typical work day for me would be on a fast yet steady pace. I am always full of smiles and the customers that comes in and out of our store always return with a smile from remembering the service they received when they last visited us. Every now and then you will find a customer that is not satisfied for whatever the reason may be. My duty is to make sure that that customer leaves our store being satisfied. The hardest part of my job is not being able to spend extended time with our customers as everyone of them deserves to be treated with likeness and respect, and I am only allowed to work 8 hours for the most. I enjoy being able to serve and have conversations with customers on a daily basis."
good,I've Learned alot working at Lowes.
good,"I enjoy working with Lowe's for several reasons. This business gave me the initiative to increase my work ethic more than I already have. A normal day at work was busy and focused. I was offered a head cashier position and I have been working on finalizing this goal. You learn good customer service skills as well as being motivated to move up in this corporation. The hardest part of my job was trying to find where everything belongs because of the size, although I am willing to learn and I enjoy using repetition. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work as a team. As a cashier you also move around at the customer service desk and complete other tasks at closing time that really focuses on working hard and as a team member."
good,Normal 8 hr day
good,The facilities were nice. The break room was kept neat and clean and provided a good sense of relaxation for your time on break. Lunch hours were good and the work environment was very friendly.
good,"A typical day at Lowes involves dealing with customers, front end employees. Days can be fun, stressful, busy, slow on a day to day basis. Like most positions, management is necessary and I try to always present myself as a conscientious and dependable employee each shift. Most of my co-workers are friends, some more than others; but that is true I believe for all positions. If I have to choose the hardest part of my job it would be the constantly changing shifts. More set hours would help me with childcare and spending time with my children. I enjoy being around people and working with the public and would say this is the most enjoyable part of my position."
good,"Loved the place great benefits, great customers, and employees longivity you will have a job for years."
good,Very fast paced and days are spent stocking and helping customers. managment is great and co-works are fun.
good,"I have learned alot working for Lowes, I have learned that if i put my mond to something I can do it, and I do a great job. It has many challenges I had to over come, like running equipment, and machines that used to terrify me, but they weren't that bad once I used them the first time. Also learning about so many different departments, it was a lil difficult at first, but after a week or two I got all the departments down."
good,"I was prepared with awareness and communication skills while starting my job at Lowe’s; however, working at Lowe’s showed me that there is always room for improvement and progress. I started as a cashier and was given the opportunity on many occasions to become part of management because I was eager to learn, and I received customer commendations. I refused the promotion because the hours of management will conflict with my school schedule. Instead of management, I accepted a promotion as part of the “WE-Team”. There are only four people in the store that are part of this team. I am the youngest of the team and I am one of the most knowledgeable. As part of this team, learning every department in the store is a requirement. I handle many different customers’ issues and complaints. Being an associate for Lowes assembled my character. I attained management skills, training skills, and improved my communication and awareness skills."
good,"I got to talk to alot of people working as a cashier, I enjoyed getting to know not just my coworkers but I loved getting to know the customers. I learned alot about working with the cash register, and the other small tasks I may had to do while working there. I made alot of friends with my coworkers and it was really tough to see them go, they taught me many things that helped me get the job done and I am very thankful for them and my supervisor for giving me the chance to work there with them. The hardest part of the job is when you have difficult customers, but everyone has them and all we can do is do our job and have an upbeat happy attitude around them. My favorite part of the job was just meeting everybody, having just the smallest conversations with a customer and feeling like you've known them your whole life."
good,"Lowes is a very fun work[place. Employees and management are wonderful, and benefits are a plus."
good,I built or dismantled product displays per specific instructions provided for project.

good,"Lowes was a great place to work and really helped me build my professional life. Working at Lowes Home Improvement, I learned about a variety of home repair and remodeling, customer service, how to do cold calls, and how to grow a business. The hardest part of my job were cold calls, and getting customer to sign up for Lowes credit. What I enjoyed the most about my job was helping people love where they live and helping make there life easier when shopping at Lowes. The people who work at Lowes are very knowledgeable and professional which was motivating to me."
good,"I enjoyed my time here, and I don’t want to leave. The only problem I have with Lowes is they butter you up for your first year then start cutting hours while the new recruits are living life with the better hours instead of the trained and seasoned employees."
good,The job was perfect for me as a mother with a flexible schedule they work around your availability and everyone is very friendly. The departments are almost always covered so someone is always there to help customers.
good,Lowe’s was a really good experience for me as I learned so much about the lumber yard. It was satisfying knowing I helped customers find their materials for their dream homes.
good,"""What can I help you find?"""
good,"A typical day at work would be answering incoming phone calls from customer's around the country and process orders. Plus resolve any issues or concerns a customer has. I learned a lot about phone ettiquite and becoming an excellent sales agent. The management at Lowe's is professional, timely, and understandable. The hardest part on my part is being some knowledge on all of the products and services Lowe's provides to their customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is making a positive impact in customers lives. The coworkers are very friendly and helpful as well."
good,Lowe's is the best retailer I have worked for. They pay better than most retail and the situational circumstances are far nicer than most retail. Everyday is a different task and there is always something to do.
good,Great Platform for my Career and gave me a lot of opportunities to grow as a leader and I developed a ton of key skills I have taken far into the later years of my career
good,"I was only there for a short time, but during my time there were many incentives that would allow someone to like working there for a long period of time."
good,"As a customer service associate, I was responsible for stocking, cleaning the department and taking care of customers but was not to spend too much time speaking with them. "
good,i worked at lowes for around 11 months it was a great place to work with staff discounts and great people to work with i had the same manager for most of the employment and had no problems until we had a change the new manager was hard to get along with and i had no end of personal problems at the time we clashed heads and i parted ways not long after this was more a personal choice i was not fired and a believe if i had stayed i would still be happily working there today.
good,"I enjoyed the work experience and fellow coworkers, including my managers. They provide help along the way and advice to further myself if I wanted to make a career with Lowe’s."
good,I enjoyed working for Lowe's.  Was a great place to start my life over. With lots of training and support. Equal rights for everyone. Glad I was given opportunity to work for them.
good,"Good workplace, all employees are very nice and very helpful. You get plenty of chances to prove your work ethics. The harder you work, and the more you care, the more you'll be recognized. Management is good at recognizing hard work and dedication."
good,"Good place overall to work at, definitley care about customer satisfaction, great customer service, products, employees are knowledgable in their respective areas, benefits are awesome"
good,"Working at Lowes has been developing my skills. I know how to handle payments in different ways, manage cashiers' break and lunch in an organized way, provide the best customer service. Also, i learned how to patiently deal with tough clients in a good manner in order to ensure excellent customer's service."
good,"Love it so far, just needing to pick up a second job since I am only part time. It’s challenging at times but I love all of the new skills I am learning everyday and the new responsibilities I have."

good,"Lowes is a great work place to start your customer service experience, the environment is fast pace  and welcoming and you learn a lot about the company and their daily goals."
good,"Loved the pay , great hours. Great people the environment was very calm you were given an assignment at the beginning of the shift per day  . Your on your own. They got a training system down for new bees. And they make everyone feel like family."
good,"The only reason I give this 4 stars is due to a harassment  issue with another coworker and myself that was NOT handled properly AT ALL. Other than that, this was a pretty great place to work. They paid really well, management was excellent, they have great benefits and vacation benefits, and I just really enjoyed my time there."
good,"This is a pretty good job for little to no experience. It's easy to move up a level but not much moving after that. The yearly raise isn't much and the managers show favoritism. The job itself isn't hard if you enjoy talking to customers. The yearly bonus isn't much, but you do get a certain amount of vacation time."
good,Lowes was a great place to work.  The management at Dickson really cared about employees.  My typical day at work was out of the store visiting potential customers about home improvement projects.  The hardest part of my job was the paperwork.  the best part of my job was meeting and interacting with new people everyday
good,"You turn on the belts. Have forklifts bring pallets to you. Break pallets down and put them on conveyer belts. You can also empty out trailers yourself and put them on conveyer belts, wrap pallets in shrink wrap, print and apply. What I learned there was quite a bit. They cross trained me through 5 different departments. With those 5 different departments I've learned to hold boxes correctly, perfect shrink wrapping, print and apply labels, scan labels, put bubble wrap on boxes, break and build pallets, safety stuff around the area. The management was well. Their big thing was safety. Which they did keep a very close eye on. The culture was very fast pace, very laborious. The hardest part of the job honestly slowing down. What I enjoyed is the multiple departments I was sent to and I learned so much from each department."
good,This can be a fast pace job at times but it was a fun place to work.  I enjoyed the everyday interaction with customers and team members (and there were a lot).  The company allows you to move about to different departments and advance if you choose to.  I enjoyed working at customer service and sometimes the garden area.  It was always a pleasure to interact with customers and help them in finding products or solutions.  The Lowe's in Colorado had a great team of leaders and staff which made my time there enjoyable.
good,Lowe's is by far one of the greatest work places someone could ever work. The management is awesome at their jobs and everyone is friendly. It pays well and they work with your schedule.
good,"I loved working for Lowes for the 3+ years I was with them. The managers were hands on and helpful and the other employees were easy to get along with. I felt motivated and happy with my position as a cashier. My only minor gripe was a lack of cross-training or opportunities outside of the front end work, getting out of one position and into another was at times impossible for people."
good,"I worked in many different sections of Lowe's as a Cashier. I worked mostly in Returns. I was the person that pretty much over saw what came back to the store and what did not. If I had questions about a product, I called that department and sought out their opinions. The hardest part about the job was not being able to really stop the people that you know were shop lifting. In todays world, you have to be ""nice"" and I couldn't go after them and retrieve the products. "
good,"Loved my job with Lowe's and all my other positions. I don't believe I was dissatisfied with any position I held.  i have been in tools, woods, lawn and garden, electrical, hardward, almost every department in the store."
good,Lowe's was fun place but they cut the so that we could not help the customers in joy help customers.there some good they in Lowe's that we help but ot.wad hard to move ☝
good,As long as no injuries within a certain amount of days they will throw a Cook-Out even for big sales  once had another store come to our store so we could all enjoy a big party and games.   That one was because we had received store of the year in the district.
good,"worked lawn and garden my favorite department. loved helping customers plan and design landscapes, choose the plants they would enjoy and advised on how best to care for them."
good,Fun place to work in my opinion. Its a hard working process and I like it. The managers are really nice people including my boss. Also the employees..
good,"A typical day at work involves customer service, guiding customers to fit their needs on all their home projects inside and outside.  You learn how to manage customer clients, store operations, daily managements, zoning your departments and gathering information from your peers and becoming an expert in home improvements which can help you when you yourself become a home owner.  The job is only hard if you do not do what is expected of you.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers complete their projects and viewing photos of what you helped create in someone else's visions as well as inspiring customers.  '"
good,"Communication with customer is always a joy, enjoy the work I've leaned so much working with the company.the work schedule was always very convenient and the was will to work with the day you needed off"
good,It was really a good job because the timing was prefect. I was going to school and working part-time at the same time. Which was awesome. I have learned how to work as team and finish task faster.
good,"Physically demanding for the small stint that I worked there, but my coworkers were all loving people and cared about your well being. The hardest part about the job was the physicality and working through nights, but the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to learn new skills faster and move up the ladder quickly. Management was a little iffy at times, but it depended on who your manager was in your department."
good,Stocked overnight for the morning shift great work place management was great also love the opportunity to respond to the needs of the customers that needed help with what they was actually looking for.
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work, and one big happy family "
good,"Employee focused organization, great place to work."
good,"I liked working for Lowe's simply because the hours, the shifts, and the point system they have were great. It is a productive company that is big on safety."
good,"Id say the most enjoyable thing to do at a job is interacting with new customers, new management, new enviorment as well."
good,Lowe's is a great place to work. It is very productive it also teaches good life skills. I am very proud to say that I work for Lowe's an that I have enjoyed my time working for Lowe's.
good,"I loved them! The culture at this place, from the coworkers to the management team was fantastic. They were always friendly, helpful and willing to get you to the next step in your career."
good,"My typical day consist of counting money, reconciling the store and working to satisfy guest. We are very friendly at my store, speak to everyone, welcoming them and asking them if they need any help out to there car. What I learned from management is how to be an effective leader and not to let friendships come in the way of you working. As far as my co-workers, we are a relatively close group, so with them I have to remember to always keep it professional. This means that sometimes I have to be rough with them to make sure they do their job correctly or f incorrect, I have to fix the issue."
good,Great work atmosphere to be in. All team leads and management were great. They always worked with the schedule we needed
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for. You will see when you are out in the field why people love the Lowe's environment as a hardware retail chain. People appreciate a company who will not only take care of their customers, but takes good care of their employees as well. No, I was not paid to tell you this. And yes, I am truly a Lowe's employee. My job is working at the CDT terminal in Charlotte, NC. This job would not be for just anyone. There are long hours of the day which is worked, great schedule to have more time to get things done at home or spending more time with family and kids. CDT is a tough job. Handling and installing all appliances to residences and businesses under easy or extreme could be dangerous situations at times. If dangerous, you will always get the support from the team coaches and other upper management as well. They will send out other drivers and riders to help you where the needs would be. You would be helping out other stores, delivery of other products to customer's homes. Managing your time, your rest, your energy and maintaining a work safety attitude is the key for success working at the CDT. I rated Compensation a (4) only because I truly believe that the good drivers who exceed greater with their efforts than most other drivers or riders, will be hopefully recognized and compensated more per their hourly salary. In true reality, this job is a very tough job and can be a lot more tough at times. Weather conditions, work conditions can be a real high risk for injury if a person does not have  safety savvy."
good,"We are like a huge family, taking care of each other. Making sure no one over heats in the summer, and freezes in the winter....."
good,as a cashier clocking in and figuring out which cash regrister i was assigned to for the day. for the most part the whole day was mainly checking customers out and showing them where things were. if not at the returns desk very few were done. around closing time all left over items were gathered and were taken back to departments. at closing time cash registers were pulled and trash thrown out .
good,"Learned a lot of new thing's on the computer, and other power equipment.  It's a corp. enviorment, but once you get past all that it's a good place to work,  I wait on cust, stock shelves, run the power equipment, order things for cust., and keep our dept. in order."
good,"Fun place to work. Efficiency and a team atmosphere. Fast pace and responsible, being organized. Interacting with customer and being self reliant. The company did multiple incentives to keep everyone motivated."
good,"Despite being a driven retail environment, Lowe's is a really good place to work. Many of the employees are easy to get along with, sociable, and are very helpful. The Management runs along those same lines. The hardest part of the job was the job itself. It seems that Lowe's has it set as several smaller jobs rolled into one. The best part was the people and atmosphere."
good,"I work for a Major Home improvement Company.My work day is very business and fast pace.  Things manage to go very well with supportive co workers.  I am main responsible for answering multi phones lines transferring calls to the right departments.  The customers are fairly nice and patient.  Sometimes they are transferred several times before reaching the department associates.  Due to the fast pace and the number of customers served each day, I believe that we excel in excellence. I enjoy meeting and working with people."
good,I learned all kinds of different products and materials. And my management and co-workers were always there and willing to help me with any problems that I may have had. The most enjoyable part of my job was I always stayed busy. The hardest part was moving lumber and things over 50lbs.
good,You quickly get used to the teamwork and it becomes your second family. The Head Cashiers are great and keep work fun. A typical day consists mostly of help customers and you learn how to read the customer.
good,"Out of most of the retail companies I have either worked for or have other worked for them, Lowe's is probably the best in Midland, TX because of their focus to have great customer service and to treat their associates the best they can."
good,"I started as a part time cashier and had advancement opportunities often. By the end of my time at Lowe's I was an Installed Sales Coordinator. In between, I had opportunities to learn so much from my coworkers that guided me through mixing paint, making keys, cutting glass and lots of other specific department learning opportunities. I also gained experience with inventory management and replenishment and stocking items. The hardest and most enjoyable part of any of my positions would definitely be the customers. Every once in a while customers had the tendency to be very rude and treated me like I could not know what I was talking about because either I was a girl or not a manager. On the other hand, the majority of customers were happy to have their questions answered and guided down the right path to acquire knowledge, materials and a smile. The management team was very supportive and offered continued learning opportunities to those that wanted them."
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for. There's plenty of advancement opportunities, you just have to work hard."

good,This place is such a great place to work for they are so flexible with your schedule they pay really good the benefits are great you get bonuses every quarter even if your part-time and your always busy so time goes fast. Hardest part about my job was having to get carts outside during the winter because they were hard to push. But other that that my most enjoyable part about this job was the people I worked with and that they let me take paid vacations even tho I was only part-time.
good,"Help with home store remodel by rebuilding and painting new department desks"

good,Easy working environment and nice customer service and somewhat fast pasted when time is needed. Short handed alot but pushed through everything that was needed to be done.
good,"It's a nice place to work, I would recommend getting full time, with part time, your hours can fluctuate. The work isn't hard in certain areas, but you do have to lift quite a bit at times, and you have to go up and down a ladder or on machinery"

good,You are interactive with customers. You place orders of product customer wants. Need to know products to talk and sell. Also need to know where product is located in store.
good,"The work environment is wonderful and the people and management as well, depending on your location the customers can be nice or rude but over all it’s not terrible at all"
good,"Unload and place product as fast as possible. Time was a big deal, all product had to be out  and in place before open. Used a pallet jack and electric pallet jack to utilize time and ease of moving product safely."
good,"I was very thankful for the opportunity to work for the Home Improvement store in both Sherman Texas and Flint Mich...I made a difficult decision to quit in 2011....I was newly married and thought we needed some time to adjust to each other...and I also had bad knees that needed to be replaced...and was afraid to have the surgery...But, now I can tell you that it is the best thing I have had done..."

good,working here is a good experience especially if you are new and want some job experience. Lowes is flexible with your school schedule and personal life.
good,Good workplace with fair pay and has a good work atmosphere. It was a nice company to work for. I only left for a job that I would make more money at.

Usually start the day by checking emails, and preparing my work for the day. I work with 3 other great guys when together we accomplish tons. We reset and re-merch the entire store. Management here is wonderful I cannot say enough good about them, they always try to keep the employees motivated."
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work. The management is knowledgeable and friendly and the compensation is fair. It is pretty laid back as long as you are working and being productive. Overall, I enjoy it."

good,"Work Experience: "
good,This is  great place to work for and take care of customer. This company you get to train in different departments.
good,"Good job, get along with workers, good hours just want more than part time."
good,"A typical day at work is gathering to team together to hand out tasks that need to be done daily. When one member of the team is finished, send them to help another teammate. I ordered and stocked product to make it ready for sale on the business floor. I learned that you need to trust your teams skills in order to take care of customer needs better and in a timely manner. The co- workers are quite friendly and are willing to help when needed. The hardest part of my job is trying to calm and irate customer down in front of other customers as the will effect their shopping experience in a negative light. The most enjoyable part of my job is the company recognition received when you have done a tremendous job on tasks."
good,"A day at Lowes consists of taking care of customer issues such as internet orders, phone orders, paper work and ringing people up."
good,"Lowe's pays very well, even for a starting salary. The job is rewarding in that you can assist the customer in every aspect of home improvements that they are needing to work on. There is always someone that can assist the customers with any questions that they might have."
good,"Easy days, time flew by and loved interacting with the customers."
good,I learn how  to be dependable and respondsible.and also learn how to fix all types of things.i love the work I do at lowes and the people with.only thing I'm missing is to find another job like lowes.thank you.
good,avancement opportunities were great and had a great training/mentoring staff.
good,"managing the entire front end, scheduling lunches, managing the cash drawers"
good,it's an all around good place management and co-workers.you learn alot cause u always helping customers and learning new things
good,I enjoy working at lowes because I meet new people. I get the satisfaction of learning things about my regular customers and I have made it my goal to learn about them so that they feel like they are among great freinds at Lowes.
good,I like helping people and trying to help them to get what they need and to be a happy customer..
good,Lowes is a fantastic company to work for with many opportunties for advancement and an excellent salary
good,"i learned three departments in very short amount for time, very fast promotion. good pay, great company"
good,"I absolutely loved working here! Great management, co-workers, and the work was fun too! I wish I could have stayed longer, but was only a temporary job. Would work here again!"
good,stocking and recieving monday through friday sometimes weekends.
good,Loved working for Lowe's.just wasn't making the money i needed to meet my bills.
good,I would not make this my lifetime career.  They expect you to know everything with little training.  I started having heart problems and they permanently laid me off.
good,"Started out as a weekend team member, then after a month I was chosen to work in windows and walls cutting and measuring blinds and shades. Placed orders for home owners and the best part of placing orders was we received spiffs off the order."
good,"A typical day a work consist of constant movement for 5 hours straight no breaks, work the full 5-6 hours until work is complete, clock out go home. "
good,My experience with this job here at Lowe’s is good and bad it’s good because the people I work with outside are great and good to get along with but it’s also hand cause I don’t get enough hours nor enough money to make a living
good,The management at this store was horrible. They choose who to be friends with and who to not be friends with so that in the long run they can easily pick who to fire with unknown reasons
good,"Loved helping all the different customers. Loved assisting my co-workers as well. The pay wasn't good, and I was always overlooked for raises, but always had to train new employees"
good,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits. Issue receipts, refunds, credits, or change due to customers. Maintain clean and orderly checkout area. Establish or identify prices of goods, services or admission, and tabulate bills using cash registers and price scanners. All while providing excellent customer service"
good,"I'm sure that the company has stores that are well balanced, though mine was not. The store had a lot of management changes and there was no stability for the employees there."
good,"A typical Day work 10 hours a week. go in for 2 hrs sometime 4 hrs. and being sent home. Learned not to trust ones word unless it is in writing. Ex: I need to make you F/T you have skills & potential need to move you up in the chain and workforce. In the end no deal. Workers are great always smiling, hardest part of the job not enough hours in the day to provide for family. Enjoyed while it lasted."
good,"I loved working at LOWES because I could learn so much about home improvement, building materials, and everything else that came with a home. I did not like the way they scheduled the hours or days. Rather inflexible. Management was hostile (Everett store), manager and lead bullying and falsifying reports and accusations. Mill Creek was a much better place to work. Much more friendly."
good,"I honestly felt like I was i prison working there. The management was rude, and socially unacceptable."
good,Lowe’s used to be a great place to work 10 years ago I don’t recommend this employer my last go round with Lowe’s was a very rough one I was part time so I didn’t work much and was told they did not have to schedule me they had enough full time associates but the store would be empty because we had no one on the schedule
good,"people all struggled with the retail environment, there was no advancement really made from within the store, raises were once a year, and mostly very small, with their sales programs dictating the total outcome of your bonus, a few good sales men and women were held down because of many poor sales man"
good,I was able to adjust my schedule in my position to help me work our school schedules with kids.  They were flexible and some managers would let you try to figure out a situation and guide you if needed
good,I enjoyed working there. I knew all customers and gave great customer service. Management is bad. My arrangement was to work 5 days Monday thru Friday 10am to 2pm.. The cut hours Tuesdays 10-2 and Fridays 10-2. It was not worth driving to the store for 8 hours a week. I explained that to them with no response so I gave my notice. Customers were very upset because no one gave as good service than I did. When some would call out I would go in and run that Department.
good,Left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. I really don't have anything else to say about this company except i would not recommend working here
good,"Management could be better."
good,Stressful work place after all the cuts too place. Other wise was a very fun place to work. Most people were like family there. Store manager could have been more hands on
good,If you were friends with the right people you could advance to management.  The pay was not fair to women vs men. I learned that some management thought they could treat and talk to the employees anyway they chose. Whole lot different this day and time.
good,"Not only is this a blatant disregard in a hiring practice, but a total disregard for individual rights and privacy. While I attempted to complete an application for employment, I am not willing to submit my social security number and birthdate to fulfill Lowes application. Shame on you Lowes, disgraceful!"
good,"I enjoyed every second helping customers on a daily basis. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful as well. Never a dull moment. "
good,easy busy not really a team player kind of place everyone is out to get everyone instead pulling together as a team but good to employess the company itself
good,Good place to work! But management could use some further training.  30 min break for 6 or more hours of work. - sales position- customer service
good,I drove a huge very dangerous forklift in which I always felt unsafe in. I delivered merchandize from one end of a 10 acres warehouse to the other end for shipping to stores.
good,The job was fun because you work with a lot of really nice people. When I worked the returns desk it was easy and I didn't have any problems with customers. I would always go out of my way to help the customers so they always come back. We would have credit card specials and I would make up scripts to say over the intercom.
good,It was a great place and very good atmosphere to be In the only thing I did not like was not enough hours to compensate for my travel to get to work so job ended up not working out
good,Lots of confusion about work schedules. Lack of communication between Human Resources and other office employees. Schedules were not always given as promised during job offer interview. Scheduling conflicts remained during employment until it was finally left blank. Every manager I spoke with was going to fix the problem. We worked on the issue for several weeks.
good,pretty easy going place to work for. i learned a lot from the management  team.the hardest part of the job was dealing with other employee with nasty attitudes. the best part about Lowes is i love making customers happy.
good,The management is to strict and make people feel smaller than they really are the hours get cut down all the time I went from 40 plus hours to not even 20 hours in two weeks
good,There were a lot of strong personalities who would take their frustration out on you if you angered them in any way. Some people were also very inconsiderate of feelings and life experiences. There were also transphobic managers.
good,its a ok company in the middle of changing things and they are not working. this is causing a lot of issues in all the stores. the company needs to fix this as soon as possible.
good,People were very closed off and to themselves. Was hard to make a suggestion to my team without someone being negative. Managers had a not caring attitude.
good,"Lowes is a great place to work.  I really like the store and thoroughly enjoy dealing with customers and other staff."
good,loved my workplace but had to move due to family emergencies
good,lowes was a good job but that doesn't mean its a job to keep the pay is not very good and the stuff you have to put up with aint worth it the management just walks around on there personal phones all day and the work ethic with those people were not even considered good
good,"Typical work day starts off with Bringing Merchandise down from the Top Stock, Once that is completed you are Busy Helping customers the rest of the day. Some days are easier than others. Sometimes you have customer issues that you need to attend to that require you to call different vendors in order to resolve. Could take 5 min, could take a few hours. Our Mission Statement and what the Current CEO screams is taking care of our customers. Management wants you to continue tasking and completing projects that they either provides,  or someone in senior management has. Usually if we are slow, completing those tasks are pretty simple. The problem that occurs is that you are expected to complete the task, even if that means that you ignore the customer. The hardest part of the Job, is Time Management. You need to be able to complete tasks at hand while selling products and services to the customer. Some customer are quick,"" where is this product located"" some are i need help to install a water heater, or how come my pipes are making this kind of noise, or why is my water smelly. The most enjoyable part of the job, is helping customers love where they live. In short, seeing the light bulb go off in their head after you explain how to do something. Also the people that you work with really become like Family."
good,"Retail is very cutthroat. It can chew you up and spit you out, that said it can be very rewarding. Learn to set boundaries for yourself and your family. Don't bring your work home with you. Clock out and check out. Pick it up tomorrow. It's a fun, fast paced way of life but you have to take care of yourself before you can help anyone else."
good,"I liked the job at Lowe’s, work responsibilities were typical high and a lot of movement and added difficulty to job tasks at times, I think there could have been more teamwork and assistance from supervisors"
good,Great job just cant work nights and the management was a little poor but the job in all was great. I made friends and they were great. It was hard work but I got the job done.
good,"Poor leadership as major reasons for people leaving the Store. Okay, Lowe's it's a great company to work for. Create a healthy competition:"
good,"Decent place to work, managers were sometimes uncooperative. Great employees, good attitude in the work place. Everyone greeted each other with smiles. While managers were sometimes uncooperative they gave time off for sickness or personal reasons when needed."
good,"a typical day is: you come in go clock in, find out where you will be assigned, go to your station register or what have you I learned the various ways of dealing with customers, and the products they come for. management were awesome. the work place culture is kool, it is diversified "
good,Great company to work for. Some managers and associates need a refresher on what communication and teamwork means. I had a target on my back since day one from the co-workers in my department all due to my set schedule they didn't have along with me not having a full open availability.
good,"Keep area clean, help customers, cash out customers, most of the  co-workers were great to work with. Some managers were rude and extended their reach way beyond their responsibility."
good,The rotating head cashier shifts were horrible. You'd start one week at 5am and then close the next week til midnight. You never knew which end was up.
good,I loved working there. The only reason that I left is because I was given a better opportunity doing something that I had always wanted to do. I regret leaving.
good,I absolutely loved working here. I learned how to do money orders and Western Union. I got to talk to a lot of people and I was always busy. Best job I've had so far
good,during my 16 years at lowe's i have seen them come and go but due to the current restructuring it has made me feel like it is my time to start looking at other options.
good,the ceo of lowes just masss fired 2400 assistant store managers with no warning. not a company i want to continue working for
good,Lowe's was a good place to work at and was one of the main reasons i left my past company to take on a bigger and more important role in management. Overall the work environment was fun and i loved my position. Senior managers need a lot of work in how they talk and approach there customers and employees. Overall the biggest reason i stayed here for as long as i did was because of my store manager and how good he was to me
good,"above average. "
good,"On a typical day at Lowe's I met many different kinds of people from many different areas of the world. I learned many useful home improvement techniques from all of the departments. Our managers were fun and friendly but sometimes lacked knowledge in basic management skills. The co-workers accepted me quickly into their ""family"". I felt like a part of the team from my first day there. The hardest part of the job was the lack of reliable employees. A few would take advantage of the kindness of others and I would be stuck with a majority of their work. The best part of the job was meeting so many new and interesting people."
good,great place to work working with customers was the best thing about this job
good,"Pay was good but hours kept short. Therefore, no benefits. Fellow co-workers were extremely congenial."
good,"Learning Different tools and house supplies and helping customers, knowing  my strenght. Showing leadership when we don't have enough help assisting the manager by staying focus and clam."
good,I was hired as a Customer Service Associate- Building Materials. It is the WORST job in the store. Youre costantly lifting very heavy stuff that weighs from 50lbs-300lbs with a forklift jack. The pay really sucked for working harder than a Hebrew slave. Never again and neither should you!
good,"I was a cashier, it was a very easy job. Very friendly people I worked with. Customers were friendly, you get used to the regulars that come in. Overall very good place to work."
good,Typical day standing nothing too exhausting. Management was ok. Nothing more to say easy access to finding if something is in stock or not and which location
good,"Learning,"
good,The company in whole is amazing. The leadership team in our area is very lopsided and it causes frustrations every week. The company needs to evaluate the situation.
good,The management for the Middleburg store has gone down hill.  Not wanting to help with customers or help the employees.  Not wanting to staff for the whole day or week.  Making everyone part time help and no one full time. Not having enough staff for the day.
good,The people you work with are fun and caring there was no animosity or ill will feelings when you worked. Everyone got along. Management jumped in and helped when needed
good,"No matter where you go you will run into members of management that do not know how to be effective. I had no support in my role to move forward or up. The store manager is removed and aloof from the goings on of anyone below his assistant managers. There is also not nearly enough people for the amount of work needed to be done, instead they over burden you with the work of 5 people and expect you to not get stressed all the while letting some people get away with the bare minimum."
good,"I got sick after a had a car wreck and had to be admitted to the hospital. My mom called and spoke with several managers and they all said the dame thing. Just make sure you have all your paperwork and I could come back. Well they gave me the run around and I never got my job pack. I really liked my job,"
good,"This store had a good work environment. Most all the employees were friendly to one another an did a good job that they ere assigned and created a very good atmosphere for the customers. "
good,Great company to work for. Very good training before hitting the floor. Learned That I wanted to advance into management roles to grow and learn how to help other succeed.
good,I had a blast working there and like most of the employees I worked with on a daily basis and I developed my favorite department as well much more knowledge about power tools and lumber.
good,"lowes was very laid back, easy going coworkers and managers the hardest part was staying busy when the store was at its slow peak of the day"
good,"Management is friendly and helpful. Lots of new things to learn. Very busy work pace and the hours fly by."
good,I enjoyed helping people solve their problems and meeting new people on a daily basis.  I also enjoyed learning new things about the different departments.
good,Mission there is unclear and can be personal. Which can be uncomfortable to seek job security and advancement from w/in. Great customers w/challenging and engaging questions and experiences. I do miss that the most. Love to assistance and help.
good,"which they would hire Full time people, was the reason I left never got anymore then 25 hr per week..Were made to do a lot of compatinon games on line & clean a lot"
good,"Worked opening at 6:00 AM or closing until 10:00 PM."
good,dont work there if your part time u have to haveto be open to any shift meaning u cant go to school or have a second job
good,"It was a enjoyable experience to work there, I really did learn much as I could learn a much about safety rules and procedures."
good,"ok no chance for advancement , delegation at its finest. if you are looking to get into upper management or make competitive pay don't start from the bottom.."
good,Assist customer with there garden and plant purchases. Hardest part of the job would be the heat in working outside and not getting enough cool air.
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's for the most part. I just had problems with being able to take days off when I needed them. Other than that, my experience was great."
good,"I was never bothered by management unless needed to clean certain areas, went beyond cleaning by mop or machine...Worked Monday Thru Friday and when needed cleaned restrooms when maintenance person was gone..."
good,Everyone below store manager was just terrible at my store! Never cared for the overnight crew and threw everything on us if something was wrong even if it was something that had nothing to do with us
good,"Having worked at 3 locations I can tell you it all depends on the management team. The Sulphur, Louisiana store treated me like gold and I wish I had never left. The Fayetteville, Arkansas store was awful due to the management team. They were predatory and purposefully worked against certain employees. Over all, the company is good and I would work there again, though not in Fayetteville"
good,"I am at customer service and working with the public. I learned a lot about how the back end works and all of the reports that go with it. Management, Not great. Dealing with vendors when they do not send product to us when it is schedule to arrive at the store. My co-workers are the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"I worked for Lowes  almost 3 years I loved working for but didn't agree with the way I was done there. The Manger was very rude and unfair to me I feel , I put in my 2 weeks and he would not except it he let me go the day I turned it in. So unfair of him to treat me like that he had no reason to do me like that. I know of people that was working there when I was there that would be late all the time or be a no call no show and he still let them come back or come in late never got written up.."
good,"Challenging, overwhelming at times, "
good,"Very moving job. Great if you like to work out . learn different stuff all the time. Learn to drive equipment. sometimes you get to learn other departments."
good,very productive and amazing training
good,Definitely a great place to get started in. A lot of my growth came from Lowe's pleased to have called this my home before. No regrets. Now its time to move on a create a new Journey
good,balanced work flow for employees..good co workers very friendly enviorment amongst co workers..very nice people and no pressure from lead supervisor..the overnight superviser made the work exciting and peaceful with no stress and worries and the work still got done with six people throughout the whole store
good,"start in one area finish in another"
good,Lowe’s is a great company to work for however it’s only a great Environment base on management. Employees are great to work with makes it a enjoyable place to work.
good,Lowe's is a great company who lost there way. Lowe's has a new CEO and looks like the company will be focusing on the customer and employee more in the near future.
good,Some of the girls just don't really want to train you. You seem you have asked stupid question and should of got it the first time. But when you ask and they just take over what your asking and not telling you as they are doing it I just think it's not right. You also know the ones that just want a paycheck not to really be there to work.
good,"My time at Lowes was too relaxed, I would like to have experienced more responsibilities besides greeting people. Although the job was quite easy, i would like to have had some experience in the departments."
good,"Had only one weekend a month off; work day began anywhere from 7 am to 1 pm to 3 pm to 10 pm.  Personnel manager refused to discipline one of my employees who consistently refused to perform tasks assigned, and sabotaged work tasks.  She had wanted the position to which I was promoted, but did not take any of the classes necessary to qualify for it.  She was the greatest pain in the rear end, combined with being chronically short staffed personnel necessary to satisfy minimum census necessary to satisfy corporate staff policies.  Most enjoyable were my immediate managers who worked collaboratively with me to improve customer service and grow sales."
good,"The Lowes organization is a wonderful organization on the corporate level that truly looks to provide top quality products and services to their customers.  They try to take care of their employees and claim to have an open door policy where employees can share concerns with their managers, however they do not seem to be able to successfully protect employees from lower level management (such as local assistant managers) from abusing employees for their own personal gain or protection."
good,"Loved working here especially because of my co workers, everyone pitched in equal effort to make sure the job got done without anyone slacking or doing less than their share of work."
good,"Good people, Terrible medical benefits. Need some upgrading on accountability, scheduling, and communication between departments. Management needs to manage from the floor not the desk."
good,The company itself is great but poor management at belle Vernon Lowe's. Managers lied to many of us telling us theyll put us on full time instead of seasonal then never did
good,"Customer Sales Associate/Hardware Department, (2013-2014)"
good,Job can be fastest pace at times but relatively easy. Lots of work to do but not to demanding other then the  product you have to lift. The managers are friendly.
good,Most superiors thought they were better then regular team members...Looked down on us. Would always advertise to call them for any questions but would never answer there phone when needed. I never recieved any compliments when i worked hard everyday at the end on my shift i would be dirty and drenched in sweat. Only time a lead would approach me is to complain about something.
good,"would only go back to this location if the str mgr is removed, the last two str mgr have been let go and a new one installed, I hear the store is coming back to life, but is to late for those let go for no other reason then the str mgr can & did"
good,full time staff they wont fire or cut hours but if sales are low part time employees are the first to get their hours cut and the first to lose their jobs.
good,Lowes is a good place to work for if your that individual that dosnt like change or that dosnt put time in to caring about making a career. I couldn't see my self working for them again.
good,"Worked as a customer service advisor."
good,I've been with Lowe's for a little over two years and I love my job there.  They are downsizing and doing away with my department.
good,Everything about this place was good. Exept the Managers they like to be friends one minute and then really horrible bosses next.
good,"Does lack the better side of management like if you have days off and they change your schedule you are supposed to be there, and their scheduling is done on line which makes it irritating to quadruple check"
good,Awesome place for students to make more than enough to get by and works around your school schedule. Fun active coworkers.
good,"5 years with company, and only reached $1.50 more than when I was hired. Management did not properly educate and inform employees of changes within bakery department without notice. This made it hard to do the best job possible for the customer and the business. On a typical day manager will say stock product on sales floor to the desired levels which varies based on sales and customer demand. The frustrating part is when you fill it according to the demand it still does not meet requirements due to customer surges on product. This makes it impossible for an employee to predict what will happen when, at any given moment, will be either too much or to little. This could be corrected if management would set up a way for better monitoring without reprimand if job is completed correctly."
good,Productive and fun workplace great managers..hands on learning the machine and more about the company.They have help if you want to go back to college or starting. My co workers were great an older crew is fun to be around.The hardest part will have to be staying up overnight.
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowes, it may have been some years ago but the company environment and the positive attitudes of the managers still have me smiling and reminiscing. I was a cashier so the job was very easy, occasionally I would stock shelves and clean the bathrooms. Overall the job was great"
good,"It was exciting to see so many faces everyday because Lowes stays so busy, and then it just wasn't anymore. People stop doing outside things around July and that's why this job was just seasonal/temp."
good,Lowes offers a very diverse work group and plenty of opportunity for advancement.  I enjoyed my time there as it prepared me to deal with all types of people.
good,"I liked this job, but the pay wasn't enough for the type of people that i had to work with. The people that i worked with were suppose to do the same thing as me but they never did. They would talk/text on their cell phones right in front of the cameras and never be punished and they were payed the same amount of money that I was being paid for doing at least 50% less labor then myself and 2 other co-workers. Management never did anything about this and that is why i ultimately quit."
good,"loved the conversations with the customers and finding out what tactic to help resolve their situation. The hardest part of the job, the heat! it got to over 114* under the greenhouse with out a breeze!"
good,this is a good job for starting off your career great work space environment and that's all of that they they they they they they they they
good,your start pay is good but you rarely get a raise. I loved working for Lowes it jump started my career path into a great position in a bigger city. The job teaches you The basics you need to know for a more rewarding position.
good,The only reasons for leaving this job was the hours conflicted too much with school. The learning from this job was great though and if I could I would go back to doing so.
good,This grocery store was a good experience but at the end it wasn't bringing good income to my household. The managers were very helpful and treated you like a person and not just an employee.
good,If it was not for the HR manager at Lowes this job would be unbearable. She works with you and if you have any problems she always has an answer. The PAY IS GREAT FOR a part time good as well as a the benefits they offer. Typical days are really unorganized and chaotic.
good,Receive my training in pallet jack. Worked well with others.
good,the company provides amazing benefits for their employees but depending on your store policy is just a guideline. seniority is a joke and if you work hard the will take advantage of you. do less it pays off in the end a cashier part time can become a manager in less than three months depending on how much senior staff you kiss up to. all in all you get benefits for your family and can plan for the future don't get to involved with your fellow employees it will go down hill from there.
good,"I enjoyed having this job, but I wanted a job that I was going to enjoy going to everyday."
good,"work,work,work. sometimes fun some times not, often very understaffed and often supervised by inexperienced leaders"
good,"My typical day at work was keeping very interesting when working with my customer. I handled my customers with respected and dignity. Working as a front-end cashier I've learned to keep calm when a customer is upset and talking to them with a calm tone and acknowledge their  upset with trying to resolve the matter before they leave my register  and the store. My co-worker can be a little helpful but at times difficulty as well. The hardest time was not be able to provide a customer with a certain product she want, so that was a big challenge for me so I had to think fast. Next, thing I knew I was looking through the store with her and provided her with another and better product and she left satisfied. I considered that the be my enjoyable moment at work."
good,It was a great working enviroment. Great pay great benefits. The only complaint i have is about the lack of management.
good,helping customers
good,Great company to work for.....I learned customer service skill!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,"too much labor work ,,, there was no structure in there and the hours were too long the pay was not worth the sweat and sacrafise"
good,My experience at Lowes was great. I enjoyed working in customer service with the public. Would have liked to have been on the sales floor more.
good,"The job pays good but the way the cashiers are treated is in my opinion not so good. If you have been there longer, you get treated better. They change your scheduale without letting you know or asking if its alright if you work this day. I just like the rate of pay. They skipped my lunches and breaks before."
good,It was a great experience to work with others who understand that your new to something. They where careful & patient as I learned the how to do certain tasks the right way.
good,Overall my time spent working with Lowes was enjoyable. The only issues that I had was my manager having me lift a 2 person lift object without an additional person.
good,"It’s Hard when you first get started but once you get the hang of things it’s easy. The employees are awesome there, great atmosphere. Management could use some help."
good,Managers work with you and help fit your needs some co-workers have that high School drama vibe about them but  that's any job customers not always in the best mood but they are shopping for something they have to get not always something they just want but good job over all
good,"Management tries really hard to make it a fun place to work but they are very stressed by meeting numbers. Management has your back if you are a good honest employee. Benefits were good as was pay; however, the rotating schedule for full time employees made home life difficult."
good,"Good company to work for. Pay is ok, but should be more for certain jobs. They need more associates in every department to help with customer service."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Lowe's, the management was very helpful and supportive.. I also extremely enjoyed customer service as a cashier... I would recommend Lowe's as an employer .."
good,"Was a good place to work as a college student. At the time were very flexiable and accomadating. Was excited to go work, very good work culture. Had a great time, but I heard its  different now and they seem to be changing stuff."
good,"Working at Lowe's during 2019 was really troublesome because management is really poor, and all of the associates are really underappreciated for their hardwork, the associates are wonderful people. And, the store manager isn't that great, and rarely acknowledges the hardwork the associates put into his store."
good,"Typical day at work included collecting carts, lifting heavy and light loads, working alongside powered equipment, dealing with customers, while working alongside a nice staff"
good,"A typical day at my job was stressful. I answered phones while taking care of customers in the store. Management positions changed from having department managers to having ""supervisors"" and ASMs along with one store manager. The store moral is super low because they can never get anyone hired there."
good,I love my job at lowes simply because of my manager and the employees.  I feel I fit right in with the Lincolnwood family.  There is never a dull moment.  My store manager is all about helping his associates succed in there roles.
good,"Slow at times but something different i was learning. "
good,"I worked for Lowe's for 18 years and was released from employment shortly after returning to work dealing with family health issues."
good,"great job for college students, high school graduates, people that have retired and need something to do, and also people with a fulltime job and looking for a part-time job"
good,"You have to work."
good,"I always had something to do. Never just stood around. Store #2215 will always be the best store. They run a tight ship, but for the right reasons. The only problem I had was with some of the co workers (High school mentality). Overall great company, great store, & awesome managers."
good,"Ok job for someone young without many bills. Busy at times, cold and very hot inside of warehouse. Very slow towards the end of the year and there's a cut of hours."
good,I would recommend job placement here. The customers were always great. The management would work around my schedule even at times of little to to notice that i was unable to be there.
good,This place was decent. I honestly like working here. It was just management. That made me leave. Poor management. I had a manager that berated me in front of a customer trying to make the customer seem right when he was wrong. The manager was also wrong but never apologized or anything. It was also alot of favoritism.
good,"I experienced Kidney stones while I was a customer service representative, I had difficulty speaking with a manager to ask for time off.  Subsequently, I resigned"
good,"Corporate philosophy is very good. Locally, management is challenged and distant from the rank and file. Work hours are changing every week and senior employees get no preferences over new or short term employees. "
good,"You needed to be able to talk to many different people from the public, be prepared to deal with bad and good people. You must be very talkative and helpful to assist customers."
good,Fun place to work and meet new people everyday was exciting and different. People there act just like family and everyone had each other's back. Only prob was it was hard top get full time
good,"It can be difficult to be middle management. I've learned so many life and industry talents in my time with the company. I've made friends that have lasted through the test of time. I've seen management change continuously. "
good,"good, exciting, fair,happy, good environment. I like working here. advancement, benefits, cool and fun. rapid hire, drug testing, limited waiting, great"
good,"I really enjoyed my  three years with the company. I went from the garden center to appliance specialist to flooring specialist, the jump in pay was incredible. Management needs to be looked at, They have a lot of communication issues between them, which causes the employees to get caught in the middle."
good,Really enjoyed this job although it was a temporary job. The pay is ok above minimum wage although it does depend on experience too. As a cashier you can work in outside garden area or in lumber so it is nice to not be in the same area all the time.
good,"I enjoy working at Lowes but, my position is only seasonal starting to cut hours and I don't know if I will stay with the company yet as a part timer."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is learning critical technical functionalities."
good,"A typical day of evening receiving is starting work on unloading a truck 45 to an hour after clocking in because of morning shift not staging unloaded appliances or pallets to leave space for evening receiving. Afterwards, unloading freight onto pallets and staging for nightstock crew. Top stocking freezers, ranges, refrigerators dryers and washers. Unloading the cardboard bale and throwing trash into compactor after finishing work."
good,A good company and if you have the drive other options available for moving up and into other departments. Must be motivated to prove yourself and be a team player
good,This is an entry level position that offers a rewarding place to work where advancement is possible.  Local company provides a sense of security in the workplace.
good,"Lowe's talks the talk in regards to training and opportunities, however, training is lacking, management is sub standard, and bonuses are rarely given."
good,"Great company to work for, The management is nice, and they care about their employees. Coworkers are supportive and enjoyable to work with."
good,The work enviroment was always nice and organized. The systems used to check customers out was out dated. The hardest part was trying to search for something in the catalog on the computer. The most enjoyable part was my helpful and friendly co-workers.
good,Very demanding job. Fast pace environment to be in. Always have to keep to the point and stay on task. Typical day consisted of making sure all orders were corrected for the day before and to focus on programming for that day.
good,"Working for Lowe's is great, because you get to work with co-workers who are generally nice and helpful. Yo get the opportunity to be a part of people's projects and learn a little bit about everything. The only draw back is it seems really difficult to move up in the company."
good,"Great place to learn, many employees with exceptional experience to teach other employees. Management was not as great as anticipated. I learned many different trades within the company."
good,Lowe's Home Centers is a great company to work for. I have been afforded many opportunities to advance through the company.
good,Typical day at lowes is helping our customer with houseware and learning new things as the day go by. With great assitance from management when needed.
good,You are provided with minimum hours.  Work is not hard must concentrate on customer service and learn computer system.  Only con not enough hours
good,"great people to work with, they train you on all the things you need to know. safety is gone over every morning before work and they even stretch with you."
good,Unload freight trailers and schedule deliveries. Restock shelves during down time or when other assigned work is completed.
good,Lots of lifting and set up...lots of driving and high expectations at customers homes
good,"On a typical day there is usually one cashier on the front end of the store and only one cashier on each end of the store. Most managers are easy to work with, with the exception of the few that won't help out when things are really busy. I would say the hardest part of the job is when you're the only cashier and you get behind due to a item number missing, or a order not being put in the system correctly, and  no one will get on a register to help get the rest of the customers through, leaving you with frustrated customers that are in a hurry. The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting new people."
good,"I dealt with money and people all day. I stood for hours on end, sometimes picking up another's shift. It was easy work. Repetitive. The best part was the customers, the worse the management. Management had no training, as a worker, I often had no help and had solve everything on my own, and being new to the environment wasn't easy but I did it.  "
good,"Love my contractors, love the asst. managers, store manager needs to go. Learned alot about contracting jobs. Co workers are ok."
good,i loved my co workers . I learned alot of customer service. i loved helping the customers
good,"The thing I like most about the job is the diversity, no micro management and everyone makes you feel like family. My job is different from day to day so I am learning while working."
good,"I loved working at Lowe's. I enjoyed working conditions and the location where I was working, I had best colleagues. If I get a chance to work with the company again I would happily go back and serve. The best part everyone is treated equally in the company."
good,very accommodating and understanding in regards to life outside of work. very good relationship with mangers. decent amount of hours. good training and no judgement
good,The client experience goes beyond any task and engagement is key when transaction count overcomes the workplace. Place provides a great learning experience.
good,"Overall good place to work very flexible hours.  benefits include health insurance, 401k, vacation time after 6 months, opportunities to advance into more senior rolls and a great supporting team."
good,"I have worked at two Lowe's stores and enjoyed it. I only worked there for seasonal help, but it was a good experience. The staff was always very team oriented and willing to help when needed."
good,"Great place to work and meet new people, also learned a lot about reconstructing parts of houses and using the best tools for the project. It felt good being able to give that customer exactly what they wanted."
good,"Able to work hard and move up in company. Employee training, full support of management. Great benefits. Very stable company with great availability to have long career."
good,I had a great experience at this job. They treat everyone fairly and I would highly recommend this place. If I see an opening I would definitely attempt to get rehired
good,"good job to work at , good job to grow at ,flexible hours , great people to depend on a lot of opportunities in job where you can grow. Stocking is easy to do"
good,"A typical day at work for me personally is busy from start to finish. I work from 2-11 as the only closer. I learned more here than I had at any other job so far and I think that's why I have stayed for so long. I am very happy with my direct management. The workplace moral is lower than it has ever been but overall better than a lot of jobs out there. The hardest part is being stretched so thin and being one of the bigger stores in the area but it's not unmanageable. The best part about it is the people you meet, both customers and coworkers alike, and like I mentioned earlier how many things you can learn all in one place."
good,When I work at Lowes  its was great place  to work  most of the coworker  got a along with everyone. The managers were great. They is opportunity to move up with the company.
good,"Great Company, always a learning experience while giving customer satisfaction. Giving idea's to customers to make job's easier with best prices possible. Customers always came first."
good,I had a great time working at Lowe’s as a inside and outside garden associate. I was able to meet a lot of new people and create great relationships with my employees.
good,"The good about this job is the pay , and the hours you are allowed to make . along with the coworkers being a second family . The bad about this job is the way the shifts are set up when you have kids and sometimes having to choose between your kids and the job . management is ok they could be better but the managment team have to work on commucation ."
good,Lowe's is a ok place to work with good hours and good pay and the management was ok. I would recommend this place to work at. They treat their employees good.
good,"I loved working for lowes, supervisors and co workers where great, some customers weren't so friendly but most were, you get to meet so many new people"
good,Working here was the best experience for me it taught me alot. You get treated like family and is always respected from everyone no matter what. Would recommend
good,Had to work very fast paced and learn quickly you have a to know a good amount of things to be able to work at customer service and you’ll always be learning new things
good,It was my dream job. This job was the most rewarding experience of my life.  Have great management for the most part and is very safety oriented. It was a disappointment to no longer be a part of this organization. Pride is the keyword
good,"Great company to work for always something new from delivery to assembly, help customers plus great benefits and they treat there employees good  would go back myself I relocated and theres no lowes here were I'm at."
good,Team members work with you very well. Very family oriented. Very steady hours and consistent hours every week. Schedule stays the same and rarely changes other than for holidays
good,Looking for new skills and knowledge to be able to apply to a job with better benefits and pay. I am a hard worker and looking for full-time work. This job was good for a temporary setting but I would like to find a permanent job for the future.
good,"I definitely would recommend working for this wonderful company. I miss it here because I move to another city and each time did I think about it, it makes me want to go back and work for them once again. I do miss everyone there and the company of course so I definitely recommend this for sure."
good,"I love working in retail, especially Lowe's as I have a passion for helping people, creating great relationships with customers and employees and challenging myself and others to give there best."
good,Great place to work. Management is always willing to help lend a hand when needed and willing to work with scheduling around my requests for time off.
good,"Working at Lowe’s taught me to always be  courteous and kind to my co workers and customers, I gained a lot of experience in customer service working at Lowe’s and I know for an fact it will help me in the future with more jobs like it."
good,"Lowes is a great workplace to work, people are friendly, great customer service, always busy, i enjoying working at lowes. The boss are nice most of the time."
good,Helping people love where they live! Its awesome giving people the information and inspiration to renew or remodel their homes. Truly great being a part of Lowes.
good,"Fun and easy. Needed a job for after college and this worked out for awhile, but couldn't just to the midnights as well and chose to move on for a better career choice."
good,"I enjoyed my time spent at Lowes working with the customers that frequently shopped at the West Mobile location. I learned many new skills for example, I became certified in Fork lift training in order to fulfill my daily job duties in the lumber department."

good,"My job was great and I also worked with great people, our manager was also great he was very professional and a good team leader he taught all about my job as an overnight stocker"
good,As a PSE you'll spend a lot of time in your car going to and from appointments.  You do have some freedom to create a schedule that works for you as long as you're putting the hours in.  Good money if you're good at it.
good,I had an awesome time nd experience while I was working there the co workers were great to talk to also helpful when situations occurred great company to work for
good,"learned lot of things like GCP,happy framework,they have scaffold,they are using docker,new tech introducing,,.they are migrating wcs to microservice and nodejs to reactjs"
good,Enjoyed working for this company. Great people and environment. Pay was excellent and with benefits. Provided work shirts to wear on the job. Would go back if offered an opportunity.
good,"Typically, a shift at lowe's customer service is busy. Every customer is greeted and dealt with as efficiently and effectively as possible.  Answering questions, the phone and queries from associates as well as the management team can at times get chaotic.  "
good,Good company to work for. Great management team. Good pay structure. Many different roles available for various types of work experience. Team culture.
good,"I love my nob, but I'd rather be working where I'm much needed and helping others, and they work me so much I dont have time with my son "
good,Great place to work at.  Friendly environment.  I love the staff. They love their employees and their guest.  I would work for them again.  And their rooms are clean.
good,"1 year retail experience providing customer service, including identifying and resolving customer issues, assisting customers in locating product, greeting customers, answering phones, building relationships with customers, and thanking customers for their business"
good,The job was great to me. We had a lot of people come and go but it was the perfect job for me. The only reason I left Ieft is because my fiancé got a job in San Marcos.
good,"It was a great place to work. Such amazing people there. I'm friendly outgoing, love meeting new people. I get along with everyone. I have served, tables I have worked in retail, I have worked in a casino. About all the jobs I've worked at I can honestly say it's the great people that keep me in the business. I absolutely love people and talking with them!"
good,"they wouldn't switch me in the department at all of they think i was not good enough for it of they had me doing 3 loading spot front end,lumber,garden center"
good,I think overall good experience now I’m looking forward to school and by starting school I can have extra work experience while I get a chance to earn a certificate.

good,"For most of my working experience it's always a pleasure for me to work and start making new friends and learn new stuff."

good,"Love meeting new people and engaging in a multitude of different environments. There is never a dull moment. I get to absorb and utilize knowledge in appliance, Millwork, home decor, install sales, delivery, and flooring on a daily basis. Not to mention all that customer service has to offer. Letting people know just how to make the best of living where they live."
good,The people I worked with were fun to be around.  The management left you alone if you did your job.  The hours were flexible.   The customers were nice and I actually came across one of my favorite customers at another job.
good,I loved working at lowes the staff was great and meeting new people was the best thing and to help find what they came if for and make sure they get the right stuff.

good,"This company was great when i first started, but after being there for a few months been management came in and the store went kind of down hill. The turnover rate was so fast, it was unbelievable."
good,"I am a hard worker and I enjoy knowing I'm getting stuff done, you never have to worry about me being late because I always make sure I'm on time. I will do my best to make sure the job is done correctly and done without any conflict. I will surely be excited to work with you and I hope to get a call back or even an interview. Thank you."

good,Bosses and co-workers were great and always easy to talk to. Everyone was always willing to help out. Very friendly and easy-going work environment. Had fun while working.
good,"Great environment but poor management. Working at Lowe's was an excellent college job. I built a strong 401K and there was support for growth. However,  management held absurd expectations that could only be meet by staying.much longer than scheduled."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, Prestaciones buenas, jefes y compañeros propositivos"
good,"It is a customer service driven environment and everyone was helpful, innovative, and happy to help everyone that walked through the door.  There were so many ways to be creative and still stay within company standards.  Independent thinking is encouraged."
good,i worked as a cashier and it was fun talking to alot of people and helping them out. although they paid 10$/hr wich isnt what i was looking for. nonetheless its a fun workplace.
good,The job was perfect for me..I just needed day hours as I was the only F T cashier outside..7 til 4. MONDAY TO FRIDAY... and I would have retired from there..The Management really sucked.  Too many Managers No Workers.Some men would fuss and cuss when they were ask to help a customer..I was Retaliated against after I ask upper management to help a customer. TRUE. I have. Proof
good,"Very customer-focused atmosphere, sometimes to a fault.  The customers come for DIY's and want you to do the work for them.  Always something to do.  More of a relaxed atmosphere than some of my other positions, other than certain customers needing things done ASAP."
good,"Opportunity for lateral movement, not so much for advancement. But a fun and relaxed work environment nevertheless, Days vary from fast paced and stressful to having absolutely nothing to do. Typical retail experience. Enjoyment all depends on management and coworkers."
good,"Working at Lowe's was a very interesting time for me. It was my first paying job and it was awesome to make money. I worked as a loader in the Outside Lawn and Garden center so it was a lot of manual labor. Although it was hard, it was very fulfilling to work hard and meet new people."
good,loved the job and benefits. Also very flexible with working with you as well as your schedule. Busy retail environment but help was always a call away
good,"tools or hand-held power tools to cut and trim a variety of manufactured items, such as carpet, fabric, made airbags.Trained employee to become weavers"
good,"Working for a big corporation can be tough due to regulations and corporate rules, but room for promotion and a large staff makes working as a team easy to tackle large jobs."
good,"No Advancement Opportunities, seem to be held back if you are doing a good job in your current position. Don't look for career growth here, it is impossible."
good,Lowe's is an amazing place to work! The workers are almost always willing to help each other a task and genuinely care about the customers and their needs.
good,"Helpful management "
good,It was a very good place to work and the people there took care of you when you needed something. Training was provided and encouraged and the staff was amazing
good,Stocking supplies on shelves in the back and loading boxes I can easily work good by myself and I don't mind working with people I'm a hard worker and good a finishing the job
good,"Great place to work, promotions generaly from within the company. Store quite a bit of employee fun activities to help drive morale in stores. Management has lots of oppurtunity to coach and develop employees."
good,A great place to work while also learning about construction concepts. Various department allow for a wide range of experience for people to be hired in and learn about.
good,"Good job really enjoyed working there "
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for. The company is changing and there ate not many opportunities for growth in the company. But, they love their employees."
good,Overall Lowe’s was a great place to work. It allowed you to step outside of your box to learn new things and also how to renovate your home if need be.
good,When I first started working here at Lowes it was really enjoyable. All my coworkers were nice as was the management staff as well. The environment at Lowes makes you feel welcomed and comfortable.
good,"great company to work for, their store systems are very outdated , overall great people , great discounts, good hours. Pay is decent but not for a long term career. There is room to grow."
good,I loved working at Lowe's. It was fun and quick paced most days. I got new experiences that I had never had. I would definitely recommend working at Lowe's.
good,Great job if you’re athletic and a hard worker it shouldn’t be hard. Get to learn how to use a lot of power equipment which is a plus for future careers
good,"Great place to work, need to be willing to work hard. Always make sure to give it your all and you will succeed. Also if you don’t know an answer or what to do with certain things, never be afraid to ask everyone is super helpful."
good,"Being employed at Lowes Home Improvement will teach one a new experience everyday! Customers who enjoy doing home improvement projects themselves happily share their experiences with the employees.Consequently, the employees share those experiences with each other and with other customers.This makes for a rewarding employee experience. But, that is only for those associates who have or are interested in the construction industry. This store is not for those who do not have a good working ethic. Basically, you get out more than what you give out!"
good,If higher pay I wouldve stayed longer. I ended up moving and the commute wasnt worth it for the pay I was getting an hour. Management is very nice and understanding.
good,"Just a little job I picked up in retirement for some pocket change. I was able to be busy my entire shift, which is important to me. The friendly helpful atmosphere nailed though."
good,I really like working for Lowes they took care of you like you were family. They helped in any way possible if you were sick. Miss working for lowes. The management was the best.
good,This business was fair and fast paced. The management and co workers were willing to help with anything the employee needed and also would train you if you wanted.
good,Lowe’s was a great experience. It was what i likes to call my first actual real job because i got to to work with adults and the pay was outstanding. I wouldn’t think twice to apply again
good,"I enjoyed the people, especially the people in management including the store manager. They were generous and helpful and provided lots of training. My job including working all throughout the building and along with other associates. It was a great job!"
good,"I started with the company as an Asst. Dept. Manager and within 2 years I was a Store Manager. This type of movement is still there and up to you.. Worked across the country in several states, Lowe’s takes care of its’ employees as long as you work hard and take care of customers. As with any job, just do your job, show up on time and limit the drama..20 great years and I would do it all over again.. thank you Lowe’s"
good,"Its a good place to work. The co-workers are nice, funny and good energy to be around. There are lots of good opportunities and everyone likes to help."
good,"Good management, great wages, nice environment to work in. If i wanted to stay in retail i would recommend Lowes. My managers were awesome fun people."
good,"Great place to work, fast pace environment, lots of great leaders who want you to succeed and further your career if that is what you choose to do. Lots of areas to grow and develop your talents."
good,It is a very family friendly place to work.  very competitive and you learn everyday if you are willing.  takes a while to receive full time. pleasent atmosphere
good,"I advanced quickly at Lowe’s, starting as an electrical department manager and within 80 days was promoted to Human Resources Manager. This was the best 5+ years of my management career. Unfortunately the position of Human Resources Manager was eliminated. I would have stayed forever."
good,"I really love this job and would love to continue to work with them.  The customers here for the most part are very friendly and down to earth. The employees that I work with are super nice and just good people. The hardest part of this job has got to be the work schedules. You may work  6-3 one day and 1-1030 the next and so on. It really takes some getting use to. Management is decent as far as I'm concerned, I get along with everyone. Unfortunately there is an extreme number of call outs everyday and it seems that we are understaffed constantly. So, that adds to the stress of the employees that are over worked!"
good,"Lowe's was the first job that really exposed me to learning how to work as a team. I drove my first forklift and narrow aisle reach truck here. Building Materials is a consistent department and it was always crucial to alert at all times to not fall behind on the workload. I'd say my favorite part of the job was keeping the department organized simply because I've got OCD, but that's irrelevant."
good,"During my time at Lowe's the company was expanding to the West Coast.  My department was very fast paced, with a ""family-like"" team of office members.  Everyone had specific tasks, but were willing to help others when one portion was overloaded."
good,Working in at the DC was really great! lot of friendly and helpful people as well as the supervisors always checking up on you. Quick pace job always busy. Very hot and cold depending on the time of year.
good,Lowe's consisted of a fast-paced and competitive environment and all employees strive to be their absolute best in their roles so that the company could be successful.
good,"employees became family,great workplace culture the employees really know product,i learned alot from working at lowes ,otherwise I probably wouldnt know."
good,Great place I just have different needs on work hours that are not available there due to possible school admittance in another area of expertise that I have been wanting to do for a long time.
good,"A typical day at work varied depending on company and customer needs. I learned a great deal about customer service. Great management team, terrific co-workers. Enjoyed every aspect with the exception of the random schedule. The hardest part of the job was the work schedule. the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers resolve their problems."
good,I loved my job as a project coordinator. I helped customers who called in requesting information regarding their projects purchased for install at Lowes. I loved getting derailed trains back on track and moving across the finish line.
good,"once commission and spiffs got removed, now there was no interest to sell more than the required amount and no reason to upsell. There was no need to increase upsale value. Customers want most inexpensive and don't care about better features and benefits which result in a more expensive product which in result better commission and or spiffs."
good,"I enjoyed working here, good supervisor, good team leads, and good co workers."
good,"my role in HR is very rewarding and enables me to use my masters degree in human resources management.  Employee engagement is my strength, happy to be apart of the team."
good,The staff is awesome and the pay can be fair but not always. Great benefit's but you will work your butt off. Staffing is always an issue and you must be good at multi tasking and dealing with a lot of random home improvement questions from all levels of experience.
good,as a we team member you were responsible for filling in the gaps. if someone didn't show for work that was your job for the day so it created the ability to learn the store and be more valuable to the customers the pay was good and the people were helpful in management .
good,Lowes was a great job for me. I gained an advance work experience at a young age. They are very flexible for students and parents; and also have regular opportunities to advance in the company.
good,I enjoyed my job at Lowes. It was always challenging and it changed day to day. I enjoyed working with co-workers and the management was always helpful.
good,"Working for Lowes is truly a pleasure, but it does not come close to paying for my bills at minimum wage as a seasonal garden sales and heavy equipment operator."
good,i loved loading and unloading. it was definitely a new experience for me. one thing I loved about it was being a team player and I had to stay organized and work at a fast pace.
good,"Working at this company was the most fun I have ever had.  I was always treated with respect from my management.  I was entrusted with helping customers daily, and was very fulfilled by this experience."
good,"I worked in millwork, building materials, & hardware &  sometimes as a part time driver. I.started work 2/1/2001 - 2/27/2003'"
good,"I was hired as a seasonal employee at Customer Service and the front end.  We are required to have various availability of 40 hours per week.  But, there is no job certainty after the summer."
good,"would recommend to anyone, Great managers and employee willing to train and build others up in order to make the work place a success. on hands training and coaching to improve performance. easy to move up."
good,"Great job, great coworkers and management. My position could be high stress sometimes but for the most part it was pretty moderate. Required focus and high energy to get things done."
good,very very nice nfriendly people great atmosphere I loved this job it has decent benefits great place ove4rall makes it nice to come to work and have a good time
good,Lowes is a good company to work for.  The wages are not very high for the cost of living in my area.  This makes it tough to work here as a life long career.
good,"Lowe’s is a great work work place. You have the option of meeting some really cool people, and actually enjoying your work environment. Lowe’s has a lot to offer."
good,"Hard to advance, but they pay well. Repetitive job. Nice to work outside. They offer a discount card, and they are very employee friendly.  They try to get employees involved as a community."
good,"I enjoyed the work at lowe’s. "
good,"Dealing with customers aren't all that easy.. but most of them make it worth it. A typical day at work starts with greeting customers as soon as they walk in, help them find what they're looking for, and make sure they leave satisfied. Hardest part of the job is when a customer is having a bad day and they take it out on you, but you shrug it off and tell them ""thank you, have a nice day""."
good,im being forced to write this review and its driving me crazy. indeed.com needs the option to skip these things because this is not it. working at lowes was great but it would be better if I had the opportunity to come back and write this review later
good,"I enjoyed working overnight however, it does make your body change and can really mess with getting things done since your body is always attempting to catch up on sleep since you really don't get the proper amount of sleep before returning back to work."
good,I enjoyed working at lowes due to the family oriented workplace environment every one was always friendly and kind. The job was not hard at all. I enjoyed the job alot
good,"this job was good for any college student or person in-between jobs.  if you love to work with the public and helping people realize their dream home projects, Lowe's is the best place for you to be working."
good,highly reccomend lowes as a place of employment. coworkers are like family & everyone helps each other. I do not regret working there one bit. just wish I could’ve made a little more money.
good,"On a typical day i would be outside lifting and moving anything customers needed, preparing orders for pickup or delivery, setting up displays, and restocking. Due to being outside the job can be rather unpleasant if the weather is bad but it's enjoyable on a nice day. Other staff were very kind and management was fair."
good,Working at Lowe's is a wonderful experience. There are many great changes coming and I hope that the company does well financially in the upcoming years.
good,"With Lowe's having such a large customer base, there are always tasks to keep you busy and involved with other employees and of course customers. The work environment is upbeat and positive."
good,Great fast place work enviroment in spring time loved working there. Will get high performers a chance for advancement if you want it. Cannot be afraid of getting your hands dirty to promote.
good,"Associates all work together to help each other making the work environment pleasant. Training is on going from safety, to each department within Lowe's. Benefits are available. Hours are flexible."
good,I enjoyed working for Lowe's every year I was there. Creates the ability to earn a lot of knowledge if you take the job seriously. I would recommend this type of job to anyone who is in current need.
good,"Lowe's itself is a wonderful company to work for.  Unfortunately, Store Managers are lead to believe that they don't have to adhere to basic workplace principles."
good,"This was supposed to be for Lowes Foods and not Lowe's the hardware store. Lowes Foods was stressful and frustrating while dealing with customers and even fellow employees. I was a cash office clerk/supervisor/cashier. I enjoyed being the cash office clerk because I was the only one who would count the money and fill out all accounts receivable and payable to perfection. Supervising teenagers was challenging and frustrating, but some challenges behind the counter are fun. I really disliked being a cashier. I had a manager above me and he was pretty nice and the workplace culture was laid back. The constant standing and hours were not enjoyable. Even though I was part-time Lowes Foods still offered insurance."
good,A typical day working at Lowe’s was nice and quiet. The hardest part was standing for long periods of time but I enjoyed working there more than any other job I’ve ever had. I would definitely recommend anyone to work at Lowe’s who has a desire for helping customers or using a register. Definitely was a pleasure being there.
good,Some of the people are hard to get to know but once you do there a joy to work with everyone is really nice and wants to make sure your okay overall its great to work there
good,Customer service was always fun.  I enjoy interacting with customers that I would have seen on a daily basis.  And with RTM I enjoyed the relationships with the vendors that I would see weekly/monthly.
good,Like it because of the interactive place where you help customers and try your best to satisfy them with your work. Working  environment is also good.
good,The company needs to further develop is infrasturcture to be able to move forward with technology. they are constantly chasing their tails when it comes to this component
good,"great building block for other jobs, allows hands on customer service experience in a a fast place environment. Enjoyed the customer service aspect of the job."
good,It was a good place to work because everybody looked out for each other. Made sure everything was good. I really enjoyed the customer and workers there.
good,"Great houra, Management is well organized and Intelligent, Nice clean place of work and Great bonuses for Full and part time employees, Great customers"
good,"Lowe’s was an amazing work experience. Everyone was friendly. Everyone really helped each other out, it was like a big work family. I would definitely recommend Lowe’s."
good,"Everyone has a quota to fulfill and safety rules and regulations were overlooked and comprised to fulfill individual quotas. Different managers or shift leads would teach different techniques, nothing was consistent."
good,I really loved working with Lowe's management was great the on my shift worked great togrther.we all commucated very well in other words we got the job done.
good,"Working at Lowes made you appreciate life more. It was manual labor that stretched you and took you past your limits for someone else. The customer. That was fun, but sometimes it was a bit stressful making sure that all the customers had what they needed and wanted. That part in particular I enjoyed."
good,I was able to learn about the building materials industry. Working with contractors. pulling and staging product for installs. Going to job sites to inspect the contractors work.
good,Fantastic company and staff.  Friendly co workers and bosses.  The hours were set and the pay was comparable for the job that i was expected to preform.
good,"Temporary, sales drive position. The managers were nice and professional. Lots of 9 hour shifts. "
good,I was doing my resume on here and i filled out that i worked at lowes foods but i guess its a small company cause it just said lowes like the hardware store. I worked at lowes foods grocery store.
good,"Good people to work with. Customers are exciting to work with. Have a great break room with TV. Have store meeting with refreshments. You will learn about tools, electrical supplies and hardware."
good,It was very joyable to work for you meet a lot of fun people and customers..and you the customer always tip you if you did a good job.. You were really your own boss on the road.
good,Iv had worse jobs than working at lowes i worked in the garden and i enjoyed it because it was at times fast paced and involved a lot of forklift driving
good,"They gave me a lot of on the job training, with promotions and raises. I started as a cashier, then started helping with stocking groceries, then went into customer service, then went to the cash office to count money, then became the manager of the front end of the store."
good,Being in the outside lawn and garden you will find yourself sweating a lot but the people you work with always keep a good mind and work hard and the provide you with plenty of water which is a big plus.
good,"Working as a sales associate in the lumber department, it was both physically and mentally demanding. The hours were good, and the staff was friendly and welcoming. At times the work can be tedious, but it is rewarding."
good,"Liked working there the company seems to becoming greater and finding more"
good,Retail is a very dynamic environment.  This store has a stable management group.  Many of the employees are more mature and has a great work ethic.  However all retail has young people that need a lot of guidance.
good,I love the work space and how enthused everyone is and the progress we made everyday lowes has a excellent staff coaches are great its just a all around excellent place to work
good,"Very productive days while working, everyone is nice snd friendly there. Never worried about stressing out, everyone is easy to get along and talk with."
good,"Great! Kicked Back environment. May get busy. No structure. kind of do what you want work place. But has great benefits, 401k and tuition reimbursement."
good,"store #2583, has been a great place to work. the staff are friendly and care alot about their employees, there is always some sort of employee appreciation luncheon, snacks, ice cream etc. flexible hours and benifits."
good,"honestly, I loved working for Lowes. I think everyone has some complaints about where they work but overall. I had many friends there and it was nice to deal with pleasant regular customers. it is a retail company. so if you don't like working retail don't apply."
good,"Fast paced, great staff. Not too good of pay and unorganized management at times. Days drag on. All in all a good place to work if you work fast. thumbs up."
good,I like working at Lowe's. If you like people this would be the place for you. Downfall is having to stand for long periods of time. Could use more job oriented co workers.
good,"check out customers, process returns, gather shopping carts, assist with inventory. "
good,Is a good place to work need to have better benefits. Work life balance is a must in families of four now a days. This is a review and I would still and always rate them a great place to work to everyone who wants a great company with fair pay and benefits.
good,Lowes has taught me how to show good customer serivce. I have learned a lot about working in a retail environment. I now know how to service customers and make them happy.
good,"Very busy environment from the time you come in for your shift to the end of your shift.  If you enjoy helping customers, completing tasks in your department, learning about home improvement, and being part of a team, this is the place for you.  There are opportunities to move to other departments and positions if you are reliable, and don't mind a little hard work.  You will make good friends here - everyone is welcomed, and everyone will be happy to help you with any questions you may have."
good,I loved working for Lowe's.  This company supports their employees and family.  There is always an opportunity for growth within the company expansion line.  I highly recommend this company.
good,Great place to work. Advancement opportunities. Show up and stay busy to move up. Pay is great. Store management is very caring and professional. Market management is not.
good,a wonderful place to work especially with the people and how they act with everyone including the guest. Management could've been better and same with communication throughout as a whole
good,Friendly but felt i wasnt told enough imformation on my security for my job... being a sesonal employee was great but i just felt like i never got enough imformation about sales or job openings for full time
good,Working for Lowe's is a great opportunity but have a family and seems like I have to always work mid shifts. My store manager is awesome to. Hate that we have to work every weekend. Seems like they could rotate at least one weekend off a month.
good,"A typical day at Lowe's can start at 6 a.m. and end at 11 p.m. So be prepared to be flexible and work shift work. Don't expect to get your break on time due to the fact that it is on a schedule and is followed by the head cashier. Only, this person can allow you to go on breaks. "
good,"The environment at Lowe's wasn't always the best. The schedules weren't consistent, and neither were the hours. I learned basics of retail, and I had training at the register."
good,"The employees were great and some were knowledgeable about the products , the Flooring department was very helpful and the manager always just a phone call away"
good,Current store got bad management and cleaned house. It is stressful at times to work yet pleasant at other times. Fulltime employees did have rotating schedule so easier to plan things.
good,The overall work at the Lowe's Call center is enjoyable. You learn allot about helping customers with many different types of issues. Most of the supervisors are very awesome people.
good,"Smooth easy shifts, good and loving coworkers...helpful team to work with flexible schedules and departments are very easy to handle...customers are friendly and well understandable"
good,Awesome company with great management and learning expierences regarding departments.  Gave me opportunity to work with customers and educate how to shop on line.
good,Again this should not be a requirement as it can be mistaken and harmful actions taken against the company. I do not wish to share my experience with Lowes.
good,"Routinely awarded top employee honors from store managers each year and recognized for selling the highest amount of credit cards and warranties in the entire store; to date, have successfully marketed credit card accounts to almost 2,000 customers. Nice company culture."
good,Typical days at work consisted of assisting customers to the merchandise they are looking for. I learned customer service skills along with interactions with co workers. I enjoyed working in a business environment and helping others.
good,"Great place to work if you enjoy manual labor and hands on activities. This place requires team work but also that an individual is capable of taking charge and doing things by themselves. During the summer months; everyone makes sure to take care of everyone such as staying hydrated, taking enough breaks, and taking a lunch when needed."
good,"I worked for Lowe's starting @ another location in Charleston, SC. The previous location has the busiest clientele atmosphere in America. I left @ the end of 2012 attempting to relocate back to NC to be near my children."
good,It was a good job just not as organized as I would have liked. There were good workers but most of the time it seemed like all the workload was getting put a few people
good,"Lowes was a great company to work for. Some part of management were unorganized and lie, but overall was worth it. I would say just always follow-up a conversation with management with an email so your words do not get twisted to make the manager look in the positive."
good,"Love the people I work with, however in my experience I have had a hard time moving up in the company. They just have limited management positions. The company as a whole has a great presence in the community and is always willing to help out."
good,This was a great company to work for. At a very young age I was given the opportunity to prove myself not only to my store but to cooperate as well. Management is very involved in the work that is performed in each department. Great place to work.
good,"Great team members lack of leadership. Managers are to buddy buddy  with employees. Managers walk around and talk about everything but work, every one on cell phones and ignor the customers that create the pay check."
good,"I started at Lowes when  was very young and had little to no work experience at all. throughout the years I was given countless opportunities and amazing mentors to help me excel and achieve goals I never thought would be possible. Which is what I am looking for in a company, I encountered many challenges and obstacles but was given the knowledge and proper training to deal with any situation that may occur. I enjoyed problem solving from financial issues to customer satisfaction issues. I loved being given the opportunity to manage and lead a team to help customers."
good,I would come in every morning and ensure my area was ready to be open. I would ensure there was no safety hazards for the customers and ensure everything was neat and presentable for the store standards. I would water the plants and be in charge of the register and customer care.
good,"Great company to work for . Management is great , hours are iffy if you’re part time. They work really well with your schedule sometimes ,great working environment"
good,every day is different if you like variety in your job.  lack of accountability for not so great employees is high on the need to do list.  overall satisfied
good,"1.Welcome customers professionally and efficiently"
good,The managers at my Lowe's are fun  to be around. Typically I spend all day at the register checking customers out or at the service desk performing returns.
good,I enjoyed working here. The environment was very nice. The pay and hours were generally fair and the work was enjoyable. The other employees were easy going and I had no trouble working with them
good,serving the customer first is always important in retail making sure they have everything they needed once they walk inside of the store always greet the customers
good,"good job i enjoyed working at the location in lousiana, i was a part time worker and worked about 20 hours a week earning about 9.00 an hour. i would definitely refer this job to a friend"
good,There are several reasons why Its a good place to work at. There were friendly customers and employees that I got know. It had great hours and the pay was good.
good,It was a fast paced environment that i enjoyed very much.  The environment made me feel like home.  The employees all looked out for each other and helped each other out a lot
good,"Great people, good pay and awesome hours. The environment they provide for their employees is excellent. It’s a very clean healthy work place. I had an amazing work experience with Lowe’s."
good,"It’s what you make of it. If you come to work w/positive great attitude,you will have the same given back to you.Before coming here,I was in a better paying job,very stressful & in a place of toxic drama.Since working for Lowe’s, I’ve been more happy & relaxed.Yes,am working for way less $,but happier.Lots of younger ppl w/attitude and protest over cut hrs, these are same ppl who continually call in and are no shows, yet they want more hours to work. These are same ppl that vent their negativity of the store,in front of the customers. If you’re so darn unhappy then move on. Nobody is keeping you there. Simple solution"
good,Lowes will keep you busy and it your work goes by production so if you stay consistent then your pay goes up. I enjoyed my time there with everybody. Hard work and fun.
good,I only worked here for 6 months. I was working there to provide for my family while attempting to find a Fire/ EMS job. I got the job I was looking for and left. Good place to work though.
good,"As an employee in the pain department/windows&walls I found myself doing a great deal of work which I enjoyed. This work kept me busy and allowed for the shift to go by quickly. This work though was only due to me always covering others' departments since we were always understaffed. Even when the staffing was adequate many of the employees cared little about the job, leaving much of the work up to me. Great place to work if you enjoy the job but expect to be doing far more than you should be expected to based on your employment. This all also goes for my time spent in hardware&tools."
good,"Friendly environment, ample training and support. I have learn much in my two season's at Lowe's and hope to return for a third if given the opportunity. The management often had employee appreciation events with activities and food. This was very good for morale and pride in employee's work."
good,i worked with a range of different people from all walks of life. Management was ok but the pay was good. I miss seeing all the home improvement things.
good,"helping customers find what they are looking for, answering calls/ transferring calls to the correct department,calling for help over the loud speaker, ringing up all transactions, training new employees"
good,Outside lawn and garden is so much fun! Great opportunity to meet people and learn new things. They will train you if you don't have any skills and the people there were really nice.
good,Have to be at work early to get your vest on and clock in. Hardest part of the job is being on your feet throughout the whole work shift. The most enjoyable part is getting to help customers reach their project goals.
good,you pretty much get what you sign up for. The community within this lowes is very sociable like a family. they regularly remind you that you are treated as family. they worked with my changing school schedule and allowed me to work in different departments to make time for my schedule.
good,"I first started as a customer service associate, but I didn't like to stay in one spot and later got transferred to the lumber department. It was easy work but it was physically taxing depending on the days, but it defiantly kept you in shape always moving and lifting things all the time."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Lowe's, my co-workers made the day go by quickly. Working black friday is mandatory, but there isn't a large crowd of customers usually."
good,This job was my first job and it was amazing. I had a great experience working here and I learned a lot that carried on to my future jobs. It's currently owned and ran by Cape Leisure.
good,"I have worked in a management positions for over 10 years. Also I have lots of experience in client management. I am seeking an exciting new job to show my experience as well as to learn other skills and challenges.  "
good,"Albeit getting to the store I worked at took a 1.5 hour transit, it was enjoyable. The work was a little difficult (finding parts in the barcode book when they weren't listed on the bag), but now, since I've been gone for the longest time, I miss it."
good,The staff and environment at Lowe's makes it a great place to work. Along with  being able to assist customers and contractors Lowe's  provides a wide range of products at competitive prices
good,"nice place to work for a starter job, employer showed great appreciation for my hard work by giving me an increase in pay in addition to my annual increase."
good,Managed many different departments. moved between different departments to help other employees complete their work that were assigned. had to know a little on every department.
good,"Lowe's focus is on providing great customer service. In addition, the store seeks the customers needs in all home improvement and repairs.The FIT system helped to educate employees in product knowledge in turn this enabled employees to better assist customers"
good,Good place to work but not really a great full time job it’s more of a weekend or a part time job they follow all guidelines and pay is really low so for basically someone just starting off
good,There was always so much to do because of organizing and also customers and co-workers needing help. Everyone was friendly so made the job feel less like a job and more of a friend meet-up.
good,Lowe's is a great place to work. The staff are very generous and respectful. A typical work day was very relaxing and steady paced. There are opportunities for advancement there. It's an all around great workplace.
good,"The company as a whole is great.  They have great benefits, paid vacation, good 401k plans, competitive pay rates.  The only real down fall is the random schedule. Sometimes I have to miss family events that I would like to go to, so that I can preserve vacation for other days. The rotating days off gives you one weekend off a month. The rest are on weekdays."
good,Great work environment. Even if you aren't familiar with the products they have the tools and the expertise to help you succeed. Hours are there for you if you want them.
good,Busy place to work - always on the go.  Seldom have a minute to waste.  Good people.  Difficult getting enough work hours.  Some coworkers young and really don't want to work.
good,I enjoyed my temporary position at Lowe's.  All of my co-workers and supervisors were friendly as well.  This was a temporary work position and it was a great experience.
good,all around a great place to work i loved working there great company awesome service the people their have the right attitude in the work environment we have some of the best costumiers
good,This is a very good company to work for. The atmosphere is pleasant. The management know what they are doing. The company is flexible with scheduling and the benefits are pretty good as well
good,If your great at customer service and household projects then this is the place to work. Great pay and wonderful people to work with. Try this employer.
good,"I have no complaints about working at Lowes. It was not my choice to leave, and I wouldn't have left if given the opportunity to stay. The pay is decent and the benefits are very good."
good,working here is fun and fast paced and you learn a lot about your store and the services you can provide to each and every customer. the environment is very relaxed and inviting
good,"Lowes is a unique warehouse-type environment to work in. People get along fine, management is micro-managing at times. Management does not view everyone the same, if they do not like you, you know it."
good,There is no such thing as a typical work day. Every day is very different. There are several managers so it's a hit or miss with how well management will be that day. Some managers are very strict on policy while others are more flexible. Employees can learn how to work several different types of power equipment. Moral tends to be low because many people feel like they don't get paid enough for what they do however benefits are great. The hardest part of the job is not knowing what to expect on a daily basis. Interacting with several different types of people would have to be the most enjoyable part of this job.
good,Instructed my management to work with every customer to deliver them to the right department and get the best quality answers to there questions. very friendly working environment.
good,I found working at Lowe's to be a very nice job other then the fact that I was never hired on as a full-time employee and that  there were a lack of benefits and no overtime.
good,Lowes was a great place to work. It was fast paced and I loved it. The staff was great and they worked with you if something came up. I learnt so much by working there and it will last a lifetime by moving on to the next job I go to.
good,"Fast paced, helpful with customers project planning and questions. Family oriented I had an amazing time being part of a team that exhausted all efforts to bringing a customers dream come true."
good,i loved going to work everyday and working with my fellow co workers and meeting new people everyday. The hardest part of that job was waiting on other delivery trucks to move from the bay so we could load up and leave for the day.
good,"It's a loving place. Everybody is fun of life and laughs but, it's also productive and keep you on your feet. I love the discounts, the upper management are always on time when you need them."
good,I enjoyed working at Lowe’s  to the fullest. I love customer service and the other associates did as well. Will always love working with the Lowe’s family.

good,"Fast paced day, the hardest part for me was when I was scheduled to work on high levels where there was no air circulation (fans running in certain spots). Got to work on own mostly, when I needed assistance with a product to get onto the belt to send to receiving I was met with opposition from my supervisor (we were told if an item weighed a certain amount we were to ask for assistance). I liked the diversity of the position, never doing the same thing repeatedly, always moving around."

good,"A typical day at work would begin with keeping the area clean before the customers arrived. Once the customers arrived, the customers arrived, customers were number one. I learned how to cut lumber, stock lumber products, find merchandise for customers, and I learned that I really enjoyed working at Lowe's. The managers were really easy to speak to and very understanding. My co-workers were the best people I have ever worked with on any job, and I am not just saying this. The hardest part of my job was my fear of learning how to work the forklift. I wanted to but fear kept me from learning.

The hardest part was having to leave the job because of personal reasons, the most enjoyable part was I got to learn many aspects of a home improvement store."
good,"Lots of information to process and remember. Not only the customers,but where the information was in our computer at each register or department desk."

I would make sure the cash office and cashier where up and running, that delivery was loading and contacting customers that the associates had the information for the day such as the expected sales for the day , addition projects that needed completed, any accomplishment and wins from the day before. I ran all the necessary reports and ready the store for our 1st customers of the day. Every day is a learning experience in the retail world.

My coworkers and i get along perfectly, never a dull moment. I would say the hardest part of my job was when the store would be busy i would have to get someone over in my section to help out, but i wouldnt say to much that was hard there it was pretty easy going, i enjoyed my bosses and employees the most everybody helped everybody out as much as they could so teamwork was really popular in my store."

Management was generally supportive and cooworkers wer eager to help as needed. The hardest part was the non-productive ""busy-work"". I enjoyed seeing the lastest products as soon as they came out."
good,a typical work day for me is first greeting customers making sure their needs and wants are taken care of putting a smile on their face knowing you were there for them i learn everything i can the people i work for and work with are great the hardest part of the job is none i want to learn and do my best the most enjoyable part of the job is the customers talking and learning from them i am a people person no activities

Also, perform excellent customer service when needed by the consumer. The company has an open door policy where you can explain your concerns to your superior/manager. I get along with my co-workers pretty well, we work as a team and always help each other. The hardest part of the job is the physical work that some of these projects involve, moving beams, lifting heavy items around, etc. I will have to say that the most enjoyable part of my job is to create the new set, see the before and after."
good,I LOVED working at Lowe's. My supervisors were fun and I became good friends with my coworkers.

good,A typical day would be clocking in and heading over to the customer service desk to see where you will be at for the day. I learned how to use so many diffrent machines and diffrent ways to talk to customers and respond to customers not satisfied with our services. One of the best managements i have ever seen. My co-workers were great and very helpful. One of the hardest things of that job is unsatisfied customers. The best part of the job is turning a frowning face into a smile. Making a customer thats unsatisfied and changing it to satisfied.
good,"i worked in many areas of the store, my favorite being Paint. I was able to learn a variety of skills and work with coworkers and customers to share my knowledge.

Collect route from the office, follwed their mapped out routes according to the time frames given and deliver appliances to the customers giving them brief instructions on how to operate their new appliances and answer any questions they might have. get back to the dock and offload the old pieces and then park the truck. I learned that Doing the job right the first time is very important. Management was very understanding and treated us like the professional contractors we were. They were very intuitive and ensured that we had everything in order to complete the job correctly. My co-workers were ok, it was really every team for themselves but that was ok when you take into consideration that they pave the way, all you have to do is get the job done. We all had a part to play and we played it. The hardest part of the job was finishing the job out of state and driving back to the dock to offload and then go home. it was very late at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was that we rarely repeated locations."

good,My day begins right away with customer service. We deal a lot with customers in their homes. We get a lot of one on one time. Being there I have learned a lot especially when it comes to appliances. I feel the job overall is not hard unless you think lifting up 300 pound refrigeraters is hard. Overall it is fairly good place to work
good,Lowe's is a very busy and fun environment to work in. The people are great and the departments all tend to work together to get any job accomplished.
good,Great place to work with many benefits that I was able to take advantage of during my career. There is a lot of room for advancement which I have taken advantage of. While it is a fast paced demanding job it is can also be quite enjoyable.

good,Company does the best to operate a great program.. Sometimes think need to interact more with the small people on the labor force ...would go back... Managers need more training

good,i had a good time working here but long hours working nights. First month is hard on anybody but you get used to lifting things throughout the night fast
good,"I worked for a company outside of lowes. We worked at night after hours doing resets.  although, lowes managers worked throughout the night also. I lowes employees were all fantastic"
good,"Very fair and was allowed to handle customers at my pace and consideration, not at any time did management ever pressure me to make a sale, I believe this created a great shopping experience for the customer"
good,Keep up company clean and safety for employees and customers.  Attending early morning 5 am. Managements is great and kindly. Managements and an employees are great cooperation as team player.
good,"lowes is place where if you have the drive , you can work your way up "
good,"You are always on your toes at lowes, working in the lumber department was always quite busy working with contractors and helping them gather the items they needed"
good,Alot of upstocing and downstocking between customers. Always busy. They screwed up the management. It really depends who you know to get promoted.  Lots of back stabbing. But if you have other employees that all get along in your dept. You'll be fine.
good,"Lowe's used to be a really fun place to work, but the bigger it got the less fun it became. I do understand the dynamics of business and what it took to become successful, but there are more to life and business than numbers. We used to say, happy employees, happy customers, bigger numbers. Before leaving it was reversed. All about the numbers. Again, I will recommend family and friends to work there, but understand the expectations. Businesses have definitely changed throughout my work experiences. I really enjoyed helping my customers. I call them mine because they would come in looking for me.  The longer I stayed, of course, the more knowledgeable I became. I treated people fairly as I would've wanted to be treated. I would say the hardest part about that job was not being able to spend time with my family as much, other than that, I loved it."
good,"I worked at a warehouse for Lowe's . Great place to work had 12hr shifts. Off every other weekend . But this is all over with Lowe's they have went third party no more lowes employees. So the warehouse employees are over as far as Lowe's running it..They have warehouses and are building them all over the country for appliances delivery. Lowe's isn't doing the delivery anymore.Third party has taken over no more risk on lowes, no more red vest service."
good,Great company to work for. They work well with college student on there work schedule. They offer different areas to work within the store. You can have days where your extremely busy or extremely slow. Theft is a major thing that happens so you need to pay attention to anything you return or ring up.
good,I enjoyed selling flooring but I didnt like managing the front end very much. Sales floor was alot more flexible. Customers were nice. Management expected more than what could be accomplished.
good,Excellent place to work. I enjoyed working in a retail environment. I enjoyed the schedule and working in customer service. The management team was fun to work with.
good,Lowes is a place of employment where you will be able to learn different skills. I took home new knowledge that I still am able to use in day to day life.

good,"I enjoyed my time at Lowe's. The work was engaging and challenging. I handled customer service, processing orders and fulfilling them. I organized the delivery of customer ordered products"
good,"Retail being as it is you must have open availability. I have worked for two different stores and the culture was a little different in each. But I love the fact that they hire a very diverse group of people."
good,Lowes is a good place to work as a temp or as part time.  I would not recommend a full time position unless you want to only work and not have much of a life outside of work (this is based off of my full time friends opinions).  The hours are decently flexible and most of the people who work there a really nice.
good,it was a good place for me to meet different kind people with different needs and satisfaction on my part to assist them in any ways possible.being so busy most of the time you wont notice how time passed.management is supportive and boost you to excel on the position you have.it is just hard when it is hard to get other departments to help assisting customer inquiry when needed.there are times one of your senior will say different opinion from the other about an issue.
good,Great company to work for provides hot lunch great benefits ect just not enough overtime when i work i work hard very loyal to my company when it comes to team work
good,"Constant working to enhance customer expierence, ability to move up with the company, pilot program capabilities in certain markets. Ability to input ideas and suggestions and reviewed with senior management"
good,Lowes is a great place to work they really spend time on developing your skills. The company also allowed me to have a healthy work life balance. The hourly salary was less competitive during my hiring period and the company had no structure for evaluations and pay raises
good,"Great place to work, plenty of room to move up in management, and you can turn your position into a career. Good insurance for full time position. Fun and friendly staff."
good,"i did not work for Lowe's hardware i worked for Lowes Grocery Store. Sorry for the confusion. But i did like working for Lowes Grocery store. I was always busy, the time flew by there. The only reason i left was because i got a job at Wells Fargo Bank and it was better paying."
good,i enjoyed working at lowes it was fun and i liked all of my managers and coworkers they were great. i would tell people to work there if they asked how it was.
good,I loved working at Lowes. The hours were great and the opportunity to learn new things was all around. The hours are great and the pay is fair in my opinion but if you are not willing to work hard and be dependable when it comes to scheduling...dont waste your time or the companies. Hours are a hot commodity and if you cant come to your shifts dont complain when you're schedule starts to slim down. The store I worked at really functioned as a family which made coming to work and spending 9 hours there 6 days in a row a lot easier. I love Lowes as a company and would recommend it to any hard worker who wants a good job!
good,"Always ensuring customers needs . With returns , direction with in the store. If needing help management was always there. The jobs was only hard when you couldn't take care of what the customer wanted."
good,"I was promoted to manager over several departments and paid less than other managers. A manager that didn't last very long fired me because I was required to ensure the closing procedures without hiring more employees. This brought about driving the forklift with no one allowed to leave their departments to help.  Subsequently, I was relieved of my position after two years. A week later he quit and he was the only manager I ever had an issue with.  I enjoyed the job very much and the culture has since appeared to have changed.  Employees at that time were hard to keep in lumber and building materials. Other than that I would certainly recommend the company to anyone liking a hardware environment in which to work.  "
good,Mixing paint and talking to customers about their projects.. The hardest part of my job is the lazy coworkers that I have to work with. The best part of my job is meeting the different characters at work and customers too.
good,Lowes offered a nice environment to work along with great managers. The workplace was safe and clean.  The hardest part of the job was working on the weekends.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers.
good,"A typical day at Lowe's was pretty stressful, being yelled at by managers, running around helping guest, washing dishes, refilling salad bar and panini cases, cleaning, sweeping, refilling things."
good,I learned how to interact with customer and guide them to what they were looking for and seeing the smiles on their faces. I learned balance in my job.
good,Fairly physically demanding job for the past. Benefits are not great. Flexible with time off. Good Co workers for the most part. Work is hard on the body.
good,"Ii started my day by putting monies in every till, scheduling everyone's lunches and breaks. making sure cashiers had change in drawers at all times, picking up cash from registers with over an amount."
good,"Great place to work if you can deal with dust. Management is well taken care of, shelving and finding something where it belongs could be a little better."
good,"Lowes prides themselves in their customer service.  Helping the customer to ""Love where they live""."
good,It eas a fun company that gave you a lot to do!  The guidelines to the company were laid out during the hiring process. The individual managers were very helpful throughout the adaptation and training process
good,Lowe's is a great place to work but I did not appreciate how the manager was handling things and how they had their favorite people and didn't know how to manage the time or people.
good,"A typical day at work was greeting and checking out customers."
good,I have been working Lowe's for almost 2 years and its always a fun and active environment. Everyone is willing and able to help you develop in your role. Customer Service is a key to succeeding in this role.
good,"I enjoy my time working at Lowes! Although the pay wasn't that great, I had awesome co workers and my all my manager were cool. I would have srill worked there if the schedule wasbt so flexible."
good,I worked in many areas if distribution centers in Wilkes & Olin.  Most of my experience was this on this area.  Transferred to Corporate Office to expand my knowledge of company and advancement opportunities.
good,Work a lot of hours was a dept manager at the time job was a little stressful at times but you had to be an expert at time management along with management duties you were also to keep up with the maintaining of your dept.
good,This store was always doing things with its employees. Its a very fun company to work for with tons of incentives. The only down fall I would say would be that they pick favorites.
good,"Began as a great job. Steady wage raises, and a fun work environment. Management stayed consistent, but after years they seemed to get a little complacent and comfortable with people in certain positions. I remained in the same position for nine years after a few attempts to transfer laterally and even out of the store I was in."
good,great place to work wish i could have stayed on longer but once the season changed hours got cut so it was no longer an option for my position but overall had a great experience working here
good,This job taught me alot about self-respect & true meaning of hard work depends which department you're working in. Management is always changing & training someone new every 6 months. Very hard now to get a hold of the human resources. Great company just wish they would stick with the loyal employees instead of trying to change the scenery of the environment every half of the year.
good,"it was a good place for me to work during the summer fresh out of high school. flexible hours, you still had the opportunity to have a life outside of work which was great"
good,Lowe's was a great place to work but recent changes in culture have changed that. Their turnover ratio has become very large and as a result the skill sets of the associates has diminished.
good,Great place to work just does not offer a lot of hours and pay is average. The management seems to truly listen to what you have to say. Company is very safety orientated.
good,bien aperçu  donne de la chance pour bien exprimer  ou gens sans  emploi     dans n import quelle endroit dans le monde
good,"I learned a lot about customers who come in because what lowes sell, and you leanrn more about our products such as the types of wood we sell that people use for building houses."
good,Only have to work 3 days a week and I get a 4 day vacation every week. Personally I love this setup and enjoy lots of time out of work with my family.
good,My day consisted of getting to my work area checking to make sure everything's owned then also doing a little bit of stock then just spending my day helping the customers helping with what they need or what they need to find or anything else they can need in the store
good,"busy place to work, caring management. I enjoyed working with the customers. The hardest part of the job was working outside in the summer time. Other employees were willing to share their knowledge of the products."
good,"Lowes was a good company to work for especially when I was part time. They treated me fairly.  As in all retail establishments, it was hard to have a work/home balance due to being open on Sundays and all holidays."
good,Company was managed well and the workers for the company were friendly and worked hard. The company owner did a good job of teaching us how to do are jobs and was doing a good job of encouraging us.
good,"Arriving to work each morning working as a cashier, I learned how to up sale. The hardest part was just standing for long hours. I enjoyed customer service."
good,"I work in customer ser ice, fast pace environment, I ve learn a lot, you have to be a people person, remember customer service is vital important, ..."
good,Good place to work pay is pretty good break are cool easy to move up if you show your willing to learn other departments and get leads it's all about sales
good,"This company offers many avenues for advancement for new managers. Retail is never easy work, but results are rewarded for those that continue to stand out."
good,Lowes was a good Company to work for. They offer a good service to the community. You could move around to different departments within the Store. I liked providing a good Customer Service.
good,"Greet customers, find out there needs and figure out solutions, stocking and front facing items. Clean and help customers take there items to there cars."
good,Was a good working environment had alot of different managers and they kept changing rules which made it a little difficult at times but over good place to work
good,I overall enjoy working for Lowe's. Management could definitely be improved. I have learned a lot about trades and home improvement by working here.
good,Needs some work with asm in the store. Needs more communication as well as follow up on what has been discussed as issues that need to be fixed. Lack of communication from employees and managers
good,"Lowe's truly is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. Company at corporate level has the customer and their associates as top priority. However, it is a shame that at store level these are often ignored completely."
good,"Corporate vision very admirable,  mid level management needs complete improvement.  Big disconnect between corporate to hands on store level management and associates."
good,Overall is a great company to work for. You work with some amazing people and customers. You will get experience some good and bad days. We saw people walking out and purchasing items and people making very large purchases.
good,"Compassion ! Most of our client's are getting off heroin and other drugs. I am humbled to be around these amazing people"
good,"A good employer. However, they are ""youth"" oriented. Cleaned out the appliance dept. in a matter of 90 days. Replaced with people not near the experience of the manager and sales associates."
good,"very fun company to work for"
good,"You work safe at all times. Management interacts well with team members.  If you make over 120 every night , you receive bonus money on you paycheck once every month"
good,we worked hard and had to learn may different skills aroud the store. I loved driving the power equipment. everyday brought new challenges. hard work pays off!
good,"Delivered appliances to customers across the permian basin, enjoyed seeing beautiful houses,solid co-workers, great incentives, and sponsored activities for the employees"
good,Enjoyed working with the customers as well as most of the employees. Love helping customers in any way that I can. Management needed improvement.
good,"Very busy day. it never stops, there is never any down time you are constantly moving from one end of the garden center to the other,  The most enjoyable part of my day is helping customers.  The hardest part is moving the plant carts around."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the challenge that you have each day to get your work completed.  There are reports and papers that you have to review to ensure the audits pass.  However when you come into work you may have a employee call out in a department, and you have to notify the employees in that department and the other management staff.  Look at the schedule to see if you have coverage for that department if you could move other employees around to help or call another employee in to work for the day.  There are times when phone will ring and customer needs to talk to a Manager while you are trying to get coverage for the call out.  You have to prioritize your task to take care of the most important issue at the time.  However at the end you have to complete all of the issues to be successful.  I believe customer's come first, and always make sure they are taken care of.  "
good,"Overall the job is ok, Management of the cashiers can be absolutely terrible but it pays well enough that anyone who had a job with lowes wouldn't quit unless they got a job that was superior to $12.45 an hour."
good,By being a fast learner I was able to experience many job titles.  I really enjoyed my co works to the customers. Each day was different and didn't know which department I would be in but It made the day go by fast and enjoyable
good,Your schedule varies here so you have to have open availability. The pay was bad for a customer service rep because we did most of the paper work for lowes. Easy to move up.
good,"learn more communication skills "
good,"fast paced and busy, answering phones while serving customers paging and working on computers all at the same time. Challenging at times but relying on coworkers was essential to keep things running smooth"
good,"On a typical day I helped customers find products, answered any questions they may have, put in special orders, ran cash register, helped in other departments, and worked in returns. I learned to multi-task better. Management was great. My co-workers were very helpful with answering any questions I had. The hardest part of the job was getting off of work so late. The enjoyable part was helping the customers and satisfying all needs."
good,"Love working for this company. Great co workers and great sense of teamwork. Real family feel. Learned so many new things every day. Always something to do, always great customers."
good,"Decent management that makes a fun place to work. Customers are generally awesome, but when they aren't....they really aren't. Managers are more than willing to step in and help when and if needed"
good,I worked in the mount pleasant store. Was one of the best Lowes I have ever worked at. The management was amazing. The store manager goes above and beyond for all his employees.
good,"My position is uncomplicated but has some challenges. My co workers are pleasant and enjoy their jobs. The management team is friendly and support family. Helping customers love where they live is the best part of any day,"
good,Great place to work. I enjoyed working for Lowe's. It is a great company that offers opportunity for growth. The culture is hard work but a fun environment. Management is overall understanding and willing to address any issues that arises.
good,"It was a fun place to work. Enjoyed interacting and helping with customers, enjoyed working management, and other employees. I like staying busy and be challenged at and on my job and this was the place for it,"
good,Its was okay working here I liked the environmentthe people were friendly everytime they came to the store the managers were nice
good,"A typical day at work was always fun and everybody was always joking and laughing, Every one worked together to make sure all tasks got done. Hardest part of the job was doing the returns for sure."
good,"Was knowledgeable on lawn and garden inventory and area, assisted customers with shopping needs; Handled cash and credit transactions; Possessed a friendly attitude for all guest, customers, and other employees."
good,"As a cashier,a customer service associate, and a overnight down stocking for Lowes I worked with freight, cash registers, answering phones, and served customers . I learned how to serve customers better and focus on what they come in the store for, I also learned everything there is to know about paint and stains along with the items needed to make all of your house projects go smoothly. The managers were good some were nice others weren't. All of my co-workers were awesome, very helpful and very kind. The hardest part of the job was doing IRP's while still trying to help customers , and the most enjoyable part was getting to work with a great team of people."
good,I worked in building materials. I had a lot of fun learning how to help customers find what they needed to complete a project
good,"To provide customer service. "
good,"Maintained inventory levels for all custodial needs."
good,Good place to work if your starting out or retired. Management is screwy. The supervising manager is a feared beast.
good,I learned a lot working at Lowes.  They gave me the supervisor experience that was needed for me to excel in my other jobs
good,My work load was very high. Not only did I have to do my job also had to do the job of my department manager. I did go to my HR and upper management and nothing was done about her. This made my day very stressful. I feel that if the problems would have been taken care of when I addressed them I would still be working for Lowe's. I feel I wasted 8 years of my life trying to build a life with them.
good,Very hard place to work at if you are trying to support a family. Very hard to take off on holidays and have time wiith family
good,Lowes has definitively taught me allot I've learned that providing excellent customer service can definitely take you a long way  just by reassuring a customer that you can help them with anything helps them feel more comfortable. My favorite part of working here is the people I work with they are amazing and definitely make my day go faster.
good,Lowe's is a good place to work.  It provides training for you to get a good start of your position. Lowe's offers a good pay and benefits.  Training is always offered.
good,"I was the gate keeper. I worked the customer service desk. Handled all incoming calls for all departments. Instructed customers or showed them to the departments desired. Handled all returned merchandise, handled all internet orders, handled all faxes throughout the store. Cashier duties, Data Entry. I learned alot about customer service and the demands of working with the public. I loved my coworkers, they being much younger then I, were great teachers when I came aboard. The hardest part of the job was co workers not following through and keeping notes and everything up to date. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping my customers....They brought joy to my life. If I can leave them satisfied then I did my job. I really enjoyed working for that company."
good,I love it. Except the hours are not stable. I do not like the hours they give us sometimes we open and sometimes we close other than that all the people in there are very nice and help you out so much once you become part of them.
good,"Helped customers load purchases into vehicles, retrieved orders from around the store"
good,I liked this job but its a small town that I worked in and I couldn't get enough  hours to make it.
good,mostly helping customers and make shore the sore is stocked with inventory. Good co-workers leaned about a lot of different home improvement products.
good,"Lowe's is a good place to work, did not like the commute nor late hours"
good,"Worked in summer 2013.There's was not much work as the store is busy on weekends only.For transit users, it's a little hard to commute  as there is not a good bus service available by the store."
good,"Great staff. Excellent place to work. Always guaranteed hours. "
good,Busy days of work .I learn to operate 5 diffrent equipment. Great co-workers . gud teem work. hard to impress your managers .I enjoy working hard to have a beter score then others.
good,"Working at this job made me happy. I enjoyed working in different departments, learning new trades, and engaging customers. I am a people person. I learned how to multi-task. I also learned how to mix paint, cut keys, cut blinds, cut tile, differentiate from different types of flowers, learned about appliances and how to close big deals with contractors; all as a cashier. I always no matter what job I have seek to learn as much as I can in a company. I even operated a forklift and a powered pallet jack."
good,"Lowe's is a fantastic company that has a good vision of the future.  A typical day for me consist of 100 different fires to put out, planning 1-2 quarters in advance and recaping my events at the end of everyday.  The LP world at Lowe's handles any and every concevable aspect of Loss Prevention on a daily basis.  My particular job is handled by 3 individuals in any other company."
good,over all good job easy laid back spend alot of time driving whitch gets old after awhile. managers there are all pretty good treat you like a person rather than a little minyan some days are pretty hard especially when you have 5 big fridges on one truck that weigh 500lbs a piece but all in all a good job to have the pay kinda sucks though
good,"would still be there if the position was a permanent one.  Overall, i liked working there."
good,"Decent pay depending on what store you work at, there could be a great staff that you work with or a more challenging management staff that makes work little more challenging."
good,"Worked there for almost year, Great employees but management at the store i worked had there heads up there butts. Gets a little old with all the short staffing that happened. Over besides that it was a fun good place to work."
good,"SOLD APPLIANCES, OFTEN TOP-SELLING ASSOCIATE, AT TOP-SELLING STORE IN THE CHAIN."
good,"I learned a lot about being a supervisor, My day can get hectic, I manage a large group of cashiers all with different needs at any given point and time. I really like what I do, i get to move around. My managers are supportive of me and take my opinion seriously.The hardest part of my job is when there is not enough coverage to service the customers."
good,"I enjoyed customers, all co-workers in store and recieved many awards and friends. I knew my job and enjoyed sharing my knowledge."
good,"too many politics, some weeks I would get good hours, other weeks not enough."
good,"I worked as hard as I could, I wanted to get the managers to notice me. The only problem was that there was no where for me to transfer in the store so I was hot in the summer and cold in the winter. There was no camaraderie or unity. Everyone was out to slit the other's throat."
good,"Great company to work for, and learned a lot on what good customer service is. Management is good just depends on who is your store manager. Co-workers were great and we always helped each other out. The hardest part of the job was finding coverage for breaks. The enjoyable was being in a fast pace environment that made the day go by fast. "
good,"Show up on time, clock in, find out where head cashier wants you working. Engage customers as they check out, and thank them for their patronage. The job was very laid back, and the staff is friendly. There's almost no room for advancement in this company unless someone quits, which was rare, or you gained experience to work in other departments. "
good,"Great company, customer service oriented, excellent benefits, but no place to grow or move up."
good,"Lowes is a nice working place, enjoy working here but looking for something better, office job."
good,I liked working for lowe's my coworker were easy to work with but the hours they gave me to work were not great.The reason I left is because I was offered a full time job else where.
good,Lowes is a great company and so much room for advancement. I learned so much as far as customer service and their duties. I love working with people that is the most enjoyable
good,"very productive, I've learned how to cut tile, wood, glass, keys, rope, and how to care for plants and landscaping skills"
good,"I learned alot about the receiving process, keeping track of inventory levels so as not to be overstocked on items or out of stock on other items."
good,Pretty good company to work for. Good pay and you get benefits even at part-time. Hardest part of the job is trying to make sure you please customers that have complaints. Most enjoyable is able to have that good feeling knowing you did a great job in completing the customers project.
good,Loved working for the company just needed more money. The people that run this store are really good people.
good,well to be perfectly honest i really loved going to work i didnt see as work i looked st as helping people out in need and i like to help and im very knowledgeable of the prouducts that we had in the store i also learned a great deal of things while i worked there i guess one could say that one never stops learning ... we all learn something new every day
good,Want full time work and not many positions available. It is a laid back and fun. You get to meet people and get to know them. Employees are helpful and great to work with. Management is unstanding and will work with you in all areas weather with work or home life if needed.
good,"I liked working at the Lowes Hardware store because it was always constant, days dont drag and there is always plenty to do."
good,"Lack of communication between people at times but overall, fine!!!"
good,Would go in and help people pick out paint and other things for their houses. That their are so many different kinds of styles when it come to decorating your home. I always felt like we were a time team and not just co-workers. I don't feel like their was I hard part. When customers would bring pictures back of there home where I helped them.
good,fun place to work but the management was very poor. it is a very faced pace work environment.
good,"Interview experience was good, relaxed.  Interview was with multiple managers.  Job responsibilities were explained and a tour of the facility was given."
good,My position was receiving and stock. The tasks are simple and easy to complete with little guidence and coworkers were fun helpful and a pleasure to work with.
good,Offer a lot of great benefits. But do not pay fair wages for the work expected of employees. Most employees that did a lot of physically demanding work made less than cashiers.
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe’s, I was a cashier that performed & grown so fast through out my days working at Lowe’s. I grew as a cashier into being a sales associate."
good,"For me Lowe's was one of the greatest jobs of my life. This isn't to say it wasn't difficult a lot of the time and frustrating. I want to say my attitude got myself through but it's important to recognize that the systems in place for this company are a little bit messy and frustrating for the employee. Bear that in mind. If you work hard and keep a positive mindset, there's plenty of room for advancement and that will reward you with this company."
good,"I enjoyed the job somehow lay off , i would return Lowe’s if available the position FSA or different  for part time job .. I was work for 17 years  "
good,"Lowe's has been a great place to work at. Each store has its' own personality. The store i work at is a little rougher around the edges with it being the smallest store in the market. The employess are some of the  most knowlegdeable and friendly. The managers on the other hand, are very inexperienced and very overbearing. They all run over top of each other, pulling the associates in every direction and then repremands us for not following their instrutions when we are being told 4 to 5 different things from everyone. None of the managers seem to be on the same page and while some have good intentions, others hold biases against some of the employers, from gender to generation. These arent how you create a cohesive work enviroment and if it wasn't for the actual employees there, i personally don't think the store would be still there."
good,You advance based on your performance. Store level management will work with your life. My position is both physical and mentally challenging. They enforce training and education. If you like to problem-solving and want to service customers you will find it there.
good,Lowes is a great place for teens and adults to find a great job or learning experience. This job tought me the value of respecting all customers and employees.
good,It is difficult to present new ideas to the management. Many days they simply do as they are told. I loved each and every day and was paid well. Benefits were out standing.
good,I like to work there because of the overall environment. The managers and ASM help u all the time. There is no pressure while working there. Respect is what you want and in Lowe's we get it.
good,Just apply that's it everyone is super friendly work is very easy an they help with whatever u need an have u do a job according to ur abilities very fun an amazing job
good,"I loved working here however, once they did a background check 2 months after working there they let me go and told me to dispute with background company. Gave me nothing as to what was on my background that they didn't like."
good,"a good place to work with nice people much movement at the job, theirs always something to do otherwise you just walking down the aisle organizing pretty much its is a job kinda like a workout."
good,I was encouraged and provided the tools I needed to suceed in my profession.I was given the flexibility to have a home and work life balance. There network of support was strong.
good,"Working at Lowes was overall a good job. It still stands as my favorite job today. I mostly just enjoyed the work and labor more than anything else. Management was fine, and so was the culture."
good,Lowe's is a great place to work! The managers are supportive and the employees are fun to work with. It's a very upbeat work environment and there is always something new to learn everyday.
good,Everyday was a new experience with helping customers and solving their problems. I had a lot of fun with my coworkers. The job was great while I was finishing my education.
good,depending on your teammates and manager. it can be a good or bad experience. its super easy and all you do is put boxes on shelves and help other sections when needed.
good,"When I started working for Lowe’s in 2014 I thought I was living the dream. At first it was easy to work for this company, and then everything changed. There seemed to not be enough help anywhere in the company. The customers were always rude and entitled, they didn’t care that you were trying your best to help them. All they wanted was a handout because they knew the company would give it to them. The benefits are great but the management teams has no idea what they are doing at times."
good,"Great place to work, amazing people and great work life. Would definitely recommend working there. You will absolutely love it. Great pay and you get to meet some wonderful people."
good,Great place to work. Wonderful environment. Great coworkers. Everyone was always ready to help. Had personal reasons of leaving. But was a great place. I miss it.
good,"Lowe’s is a great place to work, a fast paced environment with great people and good management. It just wasn’t for me. But overall a great company with good people"
good,"nothing nothing nothing nothing"
good,I was 18 just got out of high school and wanted to get a job I got on with them at 9.50 an hour to then 10.50 when they took me on part time then when I left I was making 11.00 but I had another job willing to pay more
good,"Lowe's used to be a wonderful company to work for. In the past five years, the reign of the last two CEOs, job security is non-existent. They are finding all kinds of different ways and reasons to fire employees or cause employees to leave, especially long-term faithful employees. It is a shame to see this done in the name of making the shareholders happy."
good,I truly enjoyed working at Lowe's for the 8 years I was there. I met a lot of good people both coworkers and customer over the years. If you are a dedicated and hardworking employee Lowe's is a perfect fit for you.
good,"Love my job to death but managers on the floor were shady and this made upper management virtually impossible to engage with as they felt they were there to clean up their predescessors messes, not nurture growth and teamwork or be customer focused which is boggling but a lot of top notch associates work there buts off"
good,It's your basic retail business. It's used for a lot of first time workers so dont expect it to pay all your bills and costs for living. Nice management that want you to succeed.
good,Was a great company to work for. Was let go because company was outsourcing my job to third party. The lay-off package could have been a little better 2 weeks for 14 years wasn’t a whole lot.
good,"I loved the environment, my coworkers, and I was paid well. I left because I needed to attend school. I was a cashier and felt no job satisfaction because I'm the type of person who likes to keep busy at a steady pace. But for what it was I would say it was a pretty good job and I honestly would go back if I needed to or could find another position with more responsibility."
good,"Always improving the store, the merchandise. Staff is collaborative and easy to work with. Learn new things from each department. Customers were always satisfied."
good,"Working at lowes was a great 1st time job. However, now that I have experience in the field, I found I have much more potential.  Management could have been more organized with their leadership skills or the lack thereof."
good,Lowe's is a good company to work with and strives to up date employees on training. All the employees work together to help provide excellent customer service.
good,Lowes Brighton was a great place to work. As a manager her it was fast paced and fun to work there. Being there really helped me learn all about managing people and controlling inventory.
good,"I was to have been made full time but after 6 years never received full time work so I left even though I loved the job for a full time hours."
good,"Great place to work and the staffing was incredible. However, their schedule and how they work you is a different story. I sometimes ended up work 8 to 9 days in a row and they were finding ways to do this legally and within the system. No family time and they limit your ability to do things on your off days."
good,Lowe's has been a great place to work. They have supported me and my family for years. I have learned a lot while working at Lowe's. Lowe's has had many culture changes thru the years.
good,I learned on how to work in a fast pace since I was one of the head cashiers and also helpful with my bilingual skills. I also loved the customers since I built a relationship with all of them.
good,"Working at Lowe's was like working with family! Everyone has your back and are willing to help when you need it! I truly miss my Lowe's family, but needed career advancement opportunities, and a career that would utilize my bachelors degree. I 100% recommend working at Lowe's!"
good,"The location I worked at had a problem with inconsistency with the rules between management, anytime a customer would be upset at the rules they would automatically let me return their item or replace it for them"
good,"Working part time as a student makes this job great for high school/college students. Hours were very flexible and got off whenever I asked. Management had it's issues with firing other managers for no real reason but company changes. Very nice co-workers and easy to make friends here. Depending on the time of the year there may not be very many opportunities to move up. Ultimately, this is why I left but I would gladly return given a better job."
good,Lowes is a wonderful place to work with great co-workers but the recent management has been taking away from the great work experience. Although lowes is still a great place to work and would recommend it to everyone!
good,"Great place to work I learned something new every day."
good,It’s a great place for a starter job. I don’t see it fitting my personal need in the long term and there’s not a quick advancement rate. Pay is good .
good,"sign in check for shipments, set up new  displays rearrange shelves, management was great and would help if we were short handed. check plantograms and rearrange as stated on plantograms"
good,"I first started at Lowe's, it was just a standard store. Management changed overtime, and it became a goal driven community with a lot of changes. I love it!"
good,I enjoyed my job.  I worked in the garden department and helped customers with choices of plants.  loved being outdoors and the employee's were a lot of fun to be around.  Would love to work there again.
good,"Good paced, good atmosphere, I enjoyed my time there. The staff I worked with were helpful and patient as I was learning the ropes of my position. The managers and others above me were kind and understanding."
good,Its a job where you can move up in if your willing to. the pay was not the greatest when I worked there but it was not bad if your married and your spouse has a job. Unless you are management then you make a good living.
good,Mainly catering to customers wants and needs.  Have to know how to walk them through the steps and products needed for their project if they don't already know.  Have an opened mind and be willing to help customers match and coordinate different styles for their home.
good,You meet a variety of customers all with different needs.Your fellow employees are like family and look out for each other. Management is very efficient and personally responsible.
good,"Buenas instalaciones, pesimo personal administrativo en CEDIS cienega de flores y corpoorativo, la mayoria del personal, no todas las personas pero si la mayoria."
good,"My typical day is to first check on my leads. I learned that the more you have leads, the more you can achieve your sales goal. The management is good in helping us follow up our leads and projects. They are very supportive in every way to make things happen. The workplace culture is good because everyone in the team are very cooperative and hard working. Time is the hardest part of my job, it seems that time is not enough to accomplish more task during the day. The most enjoyable part of the job, you learn new things everyday, you solve problems with the team and customer service is always  priority."
good,I like working for Lowe’s because I love the customer service area I love taking care of customers making sure that they finally get what they need so they leave with smiles on their faces I love to see my employees working hard to please our customers and make sure that they greet them and help them to find what they need I just love working at Lowe’s is a place away from home  everybody in their work and seems like family
good,"a typical day at work is very crazy or it could also be very slow "
good,"As with any retail work, there will be ups and downs. It all boils down to attitude. I was fortunate enough to gave an excellent team with me at my store. They were supportive and easy to collaborate with on sales and other tasks. The life/work balance does require addressing as it was extremely difficult to plan anything more than two weeks in advance. Overall, the experience is what you make of it."
good,typical day at work you never know when they gone send you home when work are slow. i learned how to work well with others in a group. management where excellent
good,I worked at Lowes all through high school and college. I gained a lot experience and skills that I have used in my current job. I would recommend this job.
good,"I enjoy working with knowledgeable and friendly people.  The management structure keeps changing. Too many outside hires.  "
good,A really great place to work. I been Lowe's for 11 years. I can not express how great the place is.  They really know how to mold a person into a great employees.
good,"It seems like the management is not really there to help the employees. It's hard to find/contact a manager if needed. Other than having issues with management, it's a pretty nice place to work. They have good benefits (if you can afford them), they acknowledge their military veterans, and the employees are usually pretty friendly and helpful."
good,If written up or counceled they will not give you a copy but let write ups build up and then fire you.  Discriminate as well with people with disabilities..
good,good training materials. Flexible with look for others to replace your hours or switch if  you need time off certain days. Also mature workers and management.
good,Productive and fun to work for with a cheer for everyday. Great Nascar team and promotions for the Nascar team.  Enjoyed the experience to travel and open new stores for Lowes
good,Liked the people who work there. good environment to grow as an individual.they make it feel like a place to be. continue to look for any opportunities that may come.
good,"Not going to Razzle-Daz you into believing it is different than other retail professions, it is not. Difference comes into play with decent benefits and lots of opportunities for advancement."
good,"My typical day was either 6:30 to 2:30 or 2 til 11 pm.  I started in the store when it was a new build and the teamwork was fantastic. Most people worked very hard to do their best, and our department managers were exceptional people.  The hardest part of the job was the concrete floors! Also breaks could get lost as it is difficult to walk away from a customer."
good,Good place to work if you are patient. Great employees decent management. Some workers get lazy but who doesn’t like to hang around from time to time.
good,Work friendly place customer service excellant   day to day duties to help customer with there needs Store is clean and well kept items down stock  employees available to help locate items
good,"Worked Friday, Saturday, and Sunday every week."
good,"Overall, Lowes is a very good company to work for. I am only part time, but still received benefits at 6 months. The benefits are good. The pay isn't the best, and I feel like they need to recognize just how much their employees do during a shift. But we do over great customer service."
good,"Trabajo en equipo y seguridad, el ambiente es agradable y siempre se tiene alguna actividad a realizar."
good,"Fun to work but bad managers easy going and you have unlimited call in sick days they cant fire you for that, the only reason they'd fire you if you are stupid"
good,I have worked at Lowes for 15 yrs.  It has been a great company to work for.  I have worked in many different positions as well and in different roles.
good,"Overall a good company to work for. "
good,"I worked the lumber department and had a lot of fun working there.  Met great people and helped a lot with their projects and selection of materials.  The work was very hard but I enjoy working hard.  To many times I watched people sent home because they weren't making as much as the year before.  Not a job, as seasonal, that you are going to pay the bills with."
good,"I loved working at lowes, some people a cool and some are jealous. It just depends who you want in your circle. I chose the wrong circle. But oh well life goes on."
good,"Started in March of 16, right before the hundred days of ""hail"" Started out as cashier, and eventually moved to customer service. Management doesn't really care about the staffs issues and normally they don't follow the policies with returns and complaints so they make the CSA's look stupid in front of customers. The scheduling is terrible, never enough people staffed, and you never really have a consistent schedule which is annoying. They swear the people that work there don't have lives ."
good,Really it was all around alright. Just was nice and the people were nice for the most part. Management could definitely be worked on since sometimes you just don't know what your doing.
good,Lowe’s was a great  experience. I learned a lot at Lowe’s. I would recommend the job for anybody.The managers is very fair and understanding. Everybody works as a team
good,"answer customers questions, assist customers in returns and purchases, cleaned the front area, decent management, great employees that make you feel like family"
good,"My review summary takes away from some of the more menial tasks that upset management when I don't get to do all the things need to be done (e.g., making sure that layout of the product aligns with the department plan-o-grams, all product is blocked and clearly on display, signage, pricing, and sales are clear to the customer, etc.) I try to keep up with most of these things, but servicing customers interferes most of the time."
good,"I loved working here, it got stressful at times when dealing with customers, but overall it was a nice place to work, pay was good and so were the associates."
good,helping customers everyday-some good some hard but stocking and driving machines
good,i love Lowe The hour are just too crazy  and the shifts can take a toll. feel i miss out on alot having children. If i could have a steady shift i would not consider seeking employment elsewhere
good,An average day at Lowe's consisted of going in at 7am and to water plants and stock products on the shelf. The culture of the workplace was very welcoming and positive most of the time. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor of lifting bags of soil into trucks everyday.
good,"Its okay, never been in this type of work field so i hate it,too slow for me, but other than that, its easy money. The management at my store is really down to earth and work with you to accomplish a certain task."
good,"over all it was a good place to work. good training, everyone is every helpful and there is a good work flow. its a great first job or carer. and pays very well"
good,I enjoyed my work at Lowe’s it was challenging but the company change his directions about every 3 to 4 months which made it hard to  Focus on sales and profit.  You never knew when they’re going to restructure  wich they did two times   in my  twelve years I was in there.  No job security
good,"They were really concerned with safety culture, to the point where I felt safe there. A typical day was moving product with a center rider and or by hand to be shipped off and sold at local or other stores."
good,"It is a nice place to work, it's social and it has a lot of variety. I like that I get to meet new people and help people every day.  I have been there for 8 years and our management pretty much leaves us to do what we know how to do which is great.  We have a good team that is helpful, and there is always something to do."
good,"unloading struck using equipment like a forklift and pallet jack, putting away stock and helping customers find what they need, pulling order with an order picker"
good,A typical retail job with some really great co-workers that make good friendships. One stock shelves with product and attends to customers question and what not.
good,"I loved what I did.  Started in Commercial Sales, worked there for 6 years.  Had difficult time with the younger generation not wanting to work.  After no help from management left there and went to Kitchen Design.  Worked there for 1.5 years.  Started to see management fall apart.  No assemblence what so ever.  No communication to employees on the floor.  I was the 23rd full time employee to leave in about a 3month period and management didnt care to ask anyone WHY!  Employees that had been there from the opening of the store working for up to ten years.  After giving my notice most management stayed away.  Got that feeling of only being a number.  I still miss it after being gone 5months but am happy I don't have to deal with the store management."
good,I really have enjoyed my time working at Lowes for 18 1/2 years as a customer service associate. I have learned a lot working at Lowes such as cutting keys and mixing paint. The management there is pretty good to work with. The hardest part of my job is maybe whenn i get the customers what they need. The most enjoyable part of my day is when i can make the customer happy at  the end of my shift.
good,Learned about the government purchasing stances and how to negotiate through the bid system. working in the retail space was a good experience just not for me.
good,Nice working atmosphere with good and educated people to work with.The customers are good. The environment is clean. the store is organized and team work is the culture of this organization. Morning meetings connect us together.
good,typical retail environment.  schedule with a 4 week rotation.  2 days off each saturday to friday. one weekend off per 4 weeks of rotation.  good people.
good,The tasks are simple. Tends to be quite a bit of downtime and busywork. Lack of management communication and difficult for job advancement. Little to no challenge.
good,"I enjoyed working for the time that i did. i feel like alot of the employees are petty and childish but management did their job. I wish that i could keep working there, but i had to move out of that area"
good,"It was an okay place to work at. like every job it has its ups and downs. Fast paced always busy.customers can be rude at times, staff shortage. some management does not do their job"
good,I loved being a cashier at Lowes.  I really enjoyed interacting with the public and found them all to be easy to deal with.  The atmosphere at Lowes was all upbeat.  I enjoyed being around the other employees.  The pay at Lowes was good.  The management was excellent and easy to talk to.  I worked different shifts and usually 32 hours a week.  I was sad when seasonal ended.  I got pneumonia and had to leave early.
good,I loved my job as I was sales specialist and dealt with all kinds of people on a daily basis. The company decided to do some restructuring and my position was one that was eliminated.
good,Great place to get started on a sales career. Great management and helpful associates help you succeed in every way possible. Everyones there to help you succeed.
good,I love working with my fellow co-workers. I also love helping the public find what they need. Retail is not for everyone and is quite challenging at times. I am looking for something full time that has more flexibility with my schedule.
good,"Felt like home, wish I would have never left"
good,"Great company to work for, great opportunities for advancements. The associates makes it feel like family, and very cultured and diverse. I would recommend this company"
good,It was a great job if you do not need benefits.  The management was always supportive.  I enjoyed the time I spent there. I would tell friends that may need a part time job.
good,i was a forklift driver so not much doing anything just load the forklift and drop it off at the right door pretty simple. i just had to get out of the house i was in. so i moved to texas
good,Management is terrible hard to get help and all they care about is themselves. But working Co workers make it okay have people to talk too and become really great friends while at the same time helping customers and stocking.
good,It was a fun work environment. dealing with the public always makes days less boring. Giving advice and sharing knowledge with people who have little to no knowledge on the subject matter was exciting and really rewarding. not all stores are the same and not everyone would agree with my review.
good,"Lowe's is a place to work if your out of high school because they will give you full time hours that is not guaranteed though but, if your still in school you will only work around 20 hours or less a week and the pay isn't to bad for what they do."
good,"I learned how to clean a store room and dressing stock in the shop, put everything in order. Pushing roller Cages while taking stock in the store room"
good,Great place to work. That fact that you sometimes work outside it can get pretty hot. They do give out water and management was awesome. All my coworkers were friendly.
good,I was only working there part time while I was in Glasgow Kentucky working on my parents houseboat. It was seasonal and I was wanting something to do in my spare time while fixing the houseboat up to sale.
good,I would get to work 20 minutes early and check out the department that i would be working in and check out the situation for the day and my duties that i would be doing and how clean my area was
good,Lowes is a big box retailer and each store has its own culture and struggles that change frequently. They pay as you would expect in a retail job but the benefits are decent.  The most difficult part at my location is staffing or lack there of and the lack of committed associates or people who do the minimum each day.  Over all I like it and every store is different.
good,was there for 9 months. hired as cashier and moved up to manager position within a month. managers were very self centered and didn't help. played favoritism and watched their own butts. would write you up for a drink machine missing one drink bc the last customer of the night took one out without us knowing. was written up for calling out during funeral.
good,"loved working there. seasonal during summer. Great people to work with, loved helping customers in the garden area. Very laid back. Wouldn't mind working seasonal there again"
good,Lowe's has great health benefits as well as paid time off for vacation and sick time. The work enviroment can be very stressful. Dislike the work schedule.
good,"Having to deal with unhappy customers on a day to day basis. "
good,"A lot of work, going full charge all day long.   I learned a lot about safety in the workplace, and respect.  Lowes promotes employees to refrain from gossip. Manual labor, heavy lifting, dirty.  Customers and their dogs are the most enjoyable."
good,"The majority of the customers were elderly and it was fun assisting them with there shopping needs."
good,"Love the coworkers, great at customer service, talking with customers, figuring out a problem together and not alone, must have great multi tasking skills."
good,Great company focused on Customer and Associate satisfaction.  Lot's of opportunity for advancement.  Fast paced and must be able to handle constant change and reinventing of the business model.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers.   I learned a lot about the products, cashiering, and became much more physically fit by the amount of walking that was required to perform the various, tasks.   Most of the management team were very capable with a good grasp of how to run the store, resolve issues, and treat the employees.  The hardest part of the job was making sure the customers weren't trying to steal, in all of its various forms!"
good,"Great place to work easy money fast pace benefits hour lunches always busy friendly crew, management could use brushing up though. Other than that great first job lots to learn"
good,Good first job workplace. Management is pretty relaxed as long as you are doing your job. Friendly coworkers. Can always something to do. Managers are approachable.
good,"No room for growth since restructuring, love this business and great employees. Love to educate and help customers. Not as advanced as a company this size should be. Old computer systems and processes to work efficiently are not executed well.  Can do better in my opinion."
good,Each day was different with the interchange with customers and doing the schedule assigned that day. Learned alot about new products.Different hours every week difficult . Best part of job was learning something new and being out side
good,"A lot has changed since I worked here, but there was room for growth and a team spirit. I loved working for Lowe's, but the retail life is tough. The staff has been through so much and now they need more security to perform well."
good,"when I started there it was ok, a year went by and it was really good, but like any job the money just wasn't there, there was hours to work all the time but very little raises were given"
good,"Within Lowe's I have learned a lot over the 9+ years I have been employed with them. I love helping, and leading people. The hardest part of my job is not being able to help everyone the way I would like to. The most enjoyable part was helping my associates and the customers."
good,it was a good place to work great people a lot of work always new place new customers sometimes is stressful do to the work load I love to work work dosent bother me ..
good,"Very fast paced, good work culture.  I have learned in a little over 12 years how to lead a group of 120 people to a common goal.  Sales goals were consistently met."
good,"Well I feel that they did no hire enough in employees to provide not only to help keep our department in tack but to assist customers, but working with Lowes I did learn a lot I was a head cashier for the first 2 1/2 years and I management 20 to 25 employees making sure and my team kept the front end clean from clutter and also nice and stocked. After moving to  a department which was paint I learn how to be a sales associate maintaining the department and doing monthly price audits and working on freight in a timely manner ,and assisting customers with any questions and concerns about products."
good,Great upbeat work environment. Not a lot of work/home balance in management. Hardest part of the job was separating home and work.I learned patience and leadership qualities.
good,Its a very fast paced work environment.  You must be available to work any time any day.  You are required to work in a specific area but will be relocated to any other area if management deems it best for the business.  Its a good company to work for.
good,"Good place to work. Great benefits. I enjoy working there, great people. Retail can be stressful environment is why working with great associates with sense of humor necessary."
good,"Recent changes in the workplace and overall company culture has really burnt me out on the job as a whole. After cutting large amounts of management, it has become a place that is disorganized."
good,I would love to say with the company but they weren't willing to work with my work schedule and I had to leave bacuse it started to cost too much to get to work at 4am.
good,Got a chance to work with a good group of people and different people everyday. I loved it!! I got a chance to work in different departments and I love that.
good,"There is really nothing i can or want to say about this place, Its a very basic job.I unloaded a truck all day. That is just about all I did for 6 Hours a day."
good,I was a seasonal employee until I transferred colleges. While there I worked in the garden center. I was trained to operate certain power equipment and thoroughly enjoyed the physical aspect of the job.
good,I enjoyed working for Lowes. I always felt like I had the support of my manager whenever I brought up suggestions to improve the department. The customer were also great. It was awesome to be able to help people with their DIY projects.
good,Enjoyed working there its great job great people and enjoyed working with the customers enjoyed every minute until I got sick and could no longer work
good,The company if very great to work for as far as benefits and salary is concerned but you do A LOT of work. The company recently changed it management titles which was very disappointing as a now former department manager but I hope that it works out as planned to help the company.
good,Decent benefits but with long hours on floor.  I have improved my management skills and have had some good ASM's. The hardest part of working retail is the odd schedule you have to work.  The best part of the job was the people I had to work with.
good,"A retail hardware store with excellent customer service , Cashier is to provide excellent customer service because it is the last contact with the customer for a lasting impression of the customers experience with Lowe's . Management and coworkers are very supportive and helpful in every way. The most enjoyable part of the job is to know you gave the best customer service to every customer."
good,My typical work day is always busy and provide excellent customer service. Since I started at Lowes I learned lots of new information about products. Good experience
good,"Fine products and the personal help of each customer as needed and wanted makes Lowe's a home and business store which is appealing to not only to the indevidual but, working businesses."
good,I would walk in great all the mangers and clock in and great everyone I meet and just look at the file report of things that need to be done.
good,The people that you work with and that you get to meet are some of the best people ever. You must be outgoing and not very shy or you will not thrive here.  Management is poor and needs lots of adjustment but other than that this is a great place to work.
good,"A typical day is helping the customers. The fact as the customer is "
good,"Decent pay, benefits, 401K, paid vacation, sick time and very limited OT.  Some advancement opportunity available.  Good place, good people, good company."
good,Working in any retail environment it can becoming very stressful but the challenge keeps you on your toes and always busy which is also rewarding. Great company to work for.
good,"A Typical day at work would be walking in the door and getting a good greeting thru the store and it stays that way all day. I learned a lot working with Lowe's I started off learning how to be a stock worker, and using the computer for customer assistance, to learning how to mix paint and service customers the right information they need. The hardest part of the job was when there was a holiday the store would be packed with customers and less work being done. The most enjoyable Part of the job was after a hard days work they would have like food or a little treat to give to the workers. The management there was very good, hard working managers keeping the company in order. My co-workers were amazing people, filled with positive and explosive energy."
good,"Id do it again. I only wish we didnt get seasonal lay offs, id work year round."
good,I worked for Lowe's for 2 seasons and had a good experience there. Everyone was easy to work with and it really taught me a lot about interacting with people.
good,"preparing truck for delivery, loading truck, printing tickets for delivery and getting signed off for route. strong customer service needed. team work a must. heavy lifting along with long hours."
good,Very fast paced in the delivery department. The harder I worked the less help I seemed to be afforded. I ran delivery of entire the store from building material to appliances alone for close to 1 year. Most manual labor done in first 2-3 hours. The rest of the day was bieng proactive about upcomming customers and making sure they were going to have a seamless experience. The cohesion seemed to be lacking at my location.
good,"Overall Lowes is a very family orientated place to work. Caring for each employee, during any part of their lives. Treating each person with respect. I've learned to take the initiative when projects need to get done. Hardest part of the job in the cement floors on a persons body. Management I think could do better by their staff and get more involved on the floor. I do enjoy the people I work with and the customers"
good,"the environment is very conducive for work because I work outside lawns and garden."
good,"I have worked for lowes for 10years. I have worked in several departments, cashier, customer service, sales specialist, install coordinator."
good,"It is a great place for young adults to gain experience in dealing with customers and business partners. The different types of customers they must deal with keep the employees on their toes. From the Do-It-Yourself-er to the Professional Contractor, employees will soon be able to work with all levels of customers."
good,The store was always neat and clean.  Your were taught to value your customer and their time.  Management was always present and available to the employees.  Friendly atmosphere. Always enjoyed working the register and helping customers.
good,"steady work,where you can move from department to department,doors and windows,plumbing and heating,lawn and garden no job to hard to handle with good co-workers"
good,I have always enjoyed working with the public. The best part of this job was to see employees that worked for me get promoted to the next position. Having the respect of your workforce is very important to me. The hardest part of this job was politics because a lot of time favorites got ahead when some times it was not deserved.
good,"I love working at Lowe's its great, although need's more advancement opportunity's. Such as full time opportunity's, and promotions. The most difficult part of my job is standing for long periods of time.."
good,"I loved Lowes and do not have a single negative thing to say about my time working for the company.  If it wasn't for the elimination of the commission program in March of 2012 I would still be working for Lowes.  "
good,Enjoy working with many of the coworkers I work with.  Many good customers that  got to work with directly and inderectly.
good,"The benefits for this company are excellent. The ability to advance is a challenge. A lot of playing favorites, with little training. They throw you to the wolves to learn. Moral it the stores I worked in were terrible. With the last store having the lowest employee opinion survey results in the market."
good,"Day starts at 5;30 am.Set up registers. Sign on to computer system, and print out any internet orders ready for picking. Assign orders to individuals in proper departments. Process orders, process returns,. Keep area clean and orderly."
good,Help customer locate items they need. Explain what tools customers may need based on their projects. Cash out customers.
good,Lowes has a strict safety policy that I greatly respect. The culture there is that everyone looks out for one another. they are the ideal place for family oriented environment.
good,"nice place to work, all employees are close, management is understanding, hours are good at time, enjoyable place to work"
good,"Great people, great pay.  Willing to work around your schedule and the benefits are fantastic. They are like one big happy family"
good,"Not a bad company ,doesn't really appeal to Single parents trying to make a living with absolutley no overtime allowed Management understanding and loyal to Lowes (not Drivers)"
good,"Good place to work, organized and fair. Seasonal employee only so I did not get a full experience of working as a employee."
good,"Working at Lowe's I had chance to learn how to provide exceptional customer service to customers. I enjoyed listening and learning about projects shoppers were completing. Management was awesome, dealt with a few cranky customers but Lowes does everything they can to make them happy. Room for advancement are not as frequent as promised during hiring process. Great 401k and health plans for employee and families."
good,"I have been working with the company for sometime now, and since I've been here it has been fun, they are very willing to work with your needs as far as your schedule is concerned. They are willing to help you learn different parts of the store. They encourage you to apply to different positions through out Lowe's ."
good,The planning internship at the city of Chesterfield was probably my favorite position I have ever held.  I learned a lot about how city planning and government worked and am currently expanding on that experience to hopefully be a planner myself.
good,"I worked for Lowe's in Hopkinsville, KY and I expected that the Lowes in Albuquerque, NM to be the same and it was not.  Training is minimal, employees not as willing to assist at this store, and most of the higher ups tend to have a condescending attitude towards others.  If you mind your own business, do not socialize and just do the job and go home, well, you are better off.  Having an opinion is not so acceptable at this store."
good,This was a part time job while I was in college.  They worked around my school schedule.  Enjoyed the people I worked with.  A real team effort at Lowes.
good,A typical day at work for me consists of greeting everyone I make eye contact with as I walk into the store on the way to my department . The next task at hand is to see what condition or shape my department is in.  I make an assessment of what needs to be done right away to insure things can run smoothly for the staff & customers. Throughout my day I down stock items that need to be replaced and pull items from storage that need to be put in top stock. All these things take place throughout the day while still providing customer assistance to all who require it.
good,"A typical day at work was checking out customers and making sure they found everything or had all their questions answered before they left the store. In customer service it was answering phones, internet orders, returns, and exchanges. Basically I did what it took to make the customer satisfied. I learned a lot of computer stuff and how to deal with customers, especially those very angry and rude customers. My co-workers were fun and included everyone in activities, however if you got asked to participate outside of work and politely denied they would go to management and management would approach you and say you are not being a team player, I find that very unprofessional. What I do on my own time is my time, not Lowes' time when I am off the clock. The hardest part is immature management and the occasional extremely rude customer. The store was very enjoyable because there was always something to laugh about because your co-workers were that amazing."
good,"As long as you learn the products the job is easy and fun."
good,"What I do enjoy most about working at Lowe's is the unity that is developed with other colleagues even if you know nothing of what they do in the store. I myself work in delivery/shipping/receiving so I have dealt with pretty much everybody at some point. Like I stated however, it is still a retail environment and thus if work needs to be done, overtime is rarely an option, even if it is necessary to properly serve customers and some levels of management are unwilling to assist when needed at times. Overall, I would recommend somebody close to me to work at Lowes."
good,"Lowe's was an awesome place to work- except when it came down to open positions. They always picked their favorites for the positions. Other than that, great place!"
good,"A good environment to work in. The employees are good and willing to cooperate, but some of the management team were resentful of taking advice or guidance from an employee who made less that they did. That being said, I would go back and work for Lowe's as a Loss Prevention Specialist."
good,"A typical work day starts at 4 am. I scan the the empty holes in every department so the departments know what is in stock or what needs to be ordered. I also work in the Cash office. I fill the tills,fill the emergency tills, count the safe, make deposits,file return slips, and give loans. I also work at the customer service desk.  And when a cashier calls in, I cashier. I did pricing back up for two years as well."
good,i would check my dropbox in the morning and go to each address assigned for install . I would call customer with eta and arrive at their residents and install the items purchased from lowes .Then i would have them sign off and send the document to lowes . I would then proceed to next appointment until i completed all scheduled tasks.
good,I haven't been here long yet but I always do projects that need to be done. I check to make sure everything is safe. I'm still learning. Management is very helpful in teaching you with what you need to know. The hardest part of the job is lifting heavy items.
good,"great place to work, have option to grow in the company, they care about family values and community.  I handle money in registers, stock, inventory, clean, credit card applications, handle customer service."
good,Productive and friendly environment very customer focused.

Had a chance to see the company grow and expand and training others to exceed in their job . Enjoyed watching those that I trained excel in the company."
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Lowe's but it would not be a career for me.  Right now, it is more of a job."
good,they make it sound as if getting into different positions and departments is easy that all you need is some training. but they always end up hiring a new employees for the position.
good,Working Lowe's was a great experience. I love working with people and felt accomplished helping each and every one of them. All the coworkers were wonderful to work with. There was no hard parts about this job if you are a people person. My job was about my customers and they knew that. I was there for them and they made my day!
good,"Great place to work, employees are great. Get to work in different departments"
good,"This was an ideal job to get me through college."
good,"Working with the customers was always fun and co-workers were great, but management left little to be desired. I ended up being forced to quit because I had broken my knee and was told I could not work while on crutches (which was going to be for two months)."
good,its was fun to work there but boring with no one out with me had a great time with costomers and all
good,a typical work day consist of a lot of movement and a lot of duties to perform by the end of the shift. I learned how to learn so many jobs within this place. The management staff was unstable but they got the job done. My coworkers was cool. The hardest is balancing work and your duties outside of work. working for four days and off three.
good,i enjoyed helping customers find items to accomplish project needs. most coworkers were pleasant to work with and management was very organized. it was a challenge handeling difficult customers at times but i am good with people skills.
good,"A typical day was come into work, have morning or afternoon meetings. Go to your departments and help customers to get product they needed. Stock shelves, CLEAN, and customer service. The hardest part of any day is restocking around customers.The fork lifts and customers wanted the same isles at the same time."

good,"Meeting new people and creating relationships with co-workers and clients, and providing great customer service with product knowledge of the area you work."
good,"As a Stocker for Lowe's, my responsibility is to put product on the shelves in the correct location.

I learned alot about managing people during my time at lowes. I became friends with my coworkers but also maintained a professional relationship with them.  The hardest part of my job was managing the breaks and lunches when there were not enough staff to cover them.  The most enjoyable and fullfilling part of my job was troubleshooting and being able to resolve issues for employees as well as customers."
good,"very busy, always changing, which is good just poor daily direction, employees change a lot, sales up and down, love the challenge, not getting compensated for the work done"
good,My co-workers and environment made it a nice place to work. The management was not the greatest because most of the staff was college kids that were there to earn a paycheck and did not care about the company. The company overall is great and offers a lot of advancement within.
good,A typical day at work would be standing at the registers ringing people up and making sure they leave with all they came for. I've learned how to do returns at this job. The management was okay. The hardest part of the job to me was complaints only because sometimes I couldn't help with whatever they were complained about. The most enjoyable part of the job was the job itself I enjoyed my job.
good,Fast pace moving all the time getting things cut and put up and helping people think of what they need to fix what ever they are working on
good,"Run the register and check customers through the service line as quickly and friendly as possible. Look up items through the internal computer system, Genesis, to help the customers solve their problems. Take payments for credit cards, find floor associates to help customers, answer phones.

good,"Good work environment, great people to work with and good pay."
good,Interact with customers to provide information in response to inquiries about products and services and to handle and resolve complaints.

good,As a cashier I checked out lots of customers; learned a lot about home improvement stores.  
good,"My day began by walking the store and touching base with the employees, making sure they had the equipment, staffing and training they needed to make the best of their day, and aid them in their career. Then I would reconcile daiy payroll and run exception reporting to meet with store management on to plan the current day staffing as well with sales trends, forecast the week. When the need came I conducted internal investigations and made recomendations on corrective actions. My day is packed with employee benifets, recruiting, and onboarding activities. I lead and set in about eight meetings weekly such as safety, voice team, staff and managment, focus groups. While my days are scheduled heavy, I truly enjoy my position."
good,The management could have been better. They were nice and giving compliments as long as sells were up. But I loved the people I worked with.
good,Lowe's was such a great company to work for...
good,I enjoyed waking up going to work everyday. People are friendly you almost feel like family working there. Customers that were regulars always remembered your name and came and said hey.I met a lot of new friends.Management and co-workers would always make sure you were good. The hardest part of the job was trying to take care and make everyone happy.
good,"I love Lowe's, it has provided me many advancement and financial opportunities, but depending on the store, management isn't so great."
good,"The store I work at is fairly laid back overall, the majority of the employees are friendly and will work as a team when prompted to achieve tasks."
good,"I learned so much everyday from my customers and their projects. I didnt want to quit, but I had to relocate closer to my terminally ill mother. and now I have been unable to get a job at a lowes here. :( Why would they not hire someone who wants to work there soooo bad lol"

good,"Pretty easy going for the most part. the training in most positions is ongoing. Most of management was pretty fair and well trained, eay going. The co-workers were friendly and happy. the hardest part of the job was when management was not all on the same page. The best part of the job was helping the customers. We were able to make decisions without involving management at every turn."
good,When it was time for seasonal to be over the HR Manger decided just not to tell me it was my last day. Also he lied to another manager about me applying for full time positions.

good,Customer Management Performance Management Buyer Behavior/Awareness
good,I have enjoyed every minute of my career at Lowe's! It is a quick and ever changing environment that has a diverse client base and employee roster.

Job skills are fine tuned with every customer interaction and I am given the opportunity to personalize each and every customer's experience here.
good,Love what I do and the length of time I have been part of the Lowe’s team. Looking to see what other opportunities there is with my knowledge and skills I have learned through Lowe’s. Looking for a work life balance.
good,"Great team to work with, I would return there for employment. healthy environment to work in, hard to move up within the company as they advance older employees first."
good,"Moderate traffic volume store, simple learning process, cool management, good pay, good benefits. Overall is a great job, the hardest part of the job is when we're short staffed or co-workers aren't doing anything."
good,Easy to get terminated I would not get license to use forklift nor reach truck license better yet try not to spot anyone if you do and he does something wrong both get terminated
good,"The atmosphere of Lowe's is work first and then we can have some fun.  When there are no customers around, we can chat like good friends. I think that is what sets Lowe's aside from other companies."
good,A nice job as I worked in Outside Lawn and Garden . Did all kind of duties . Enjoyed my own clientele. Made many friends . Many accommodations for Outstanding CS. If you put in the extra effort the man agent I worked with really took notice and rewarded you.
good,Lowes is a great company to work for. They have great benefits and are headed in the right direction with the leadership decisions. I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,I would've liked to have been hired on as a permanent position but that didn't happen. Other than that though the work was easy and my fellow associates were very helpful and nice. So it as quite enjoyable.

good,"I arrive at 515 am walk resent resets  and clean or restock. Then I access our project program and assess the projects that are needed to be done and there priority of the project. Job can ask for full reset or a basic service man hours anticipated ."
good,"Mangement does not communicate amongst each other. Some employees try to get out of work. Great work life balance. If you want work, they will try to put you to work. No HR on property. Orientation is minimal amount of material."
good,Great for entry level employees looking for more experience and room to grow . Hours are flexible . Great for part time employees. Look for applications in store
good,"Started awhile back as part time, moved up quickly and soon had a Monday thru Friday position. Great people to work for and with and lots of potential, however upcoming possible changes to the MST program are not conducive to family life and with a wife who works on call one night a week, I am unable to work late shifts."

good,arrive at work at 5am and proceed to the outside garden area and perform my duties like watering plants or moving merchandise around and cleaning workplace before customers arrive.
good,"I worked at both a Lowe's store and  Lowe's distribution center while I was attending classes at the University of Wyoming. Management was willing to work with me on my schedule so I could work 12 hour shifts on the weekends. The pay was not great, but it was fair. The work was very self driven. You are given a task and are generally left alone to complete your tasks."
good,"I liked working at Lowe's when i did, the pay was reasonable for my age, even though it was difficult to get full time hours. I was started out as part time, and needed full time for benefits and other reasons to stick around."
good,Lowes is a great company to work for. I love the company. If there’s one thing I would have changed about working there it would have to the management team.
good,Not a terrible place to work but if you’re not a favorite within management you don’t move up. Can be very fast or slow paced depending on the department that you work in.
good,Very enjoyable. The company has given me so much training and experience. It’s a great company to work for with great benefits. The employees have become family to me and also some of the customers.

good,I love all the skills I learned working at Lowes. most of my coworkers were amazing to work with. I was able to learn how to use equipment I never thought I would be able to and I learned a lot about other products and basic home improvement that I really enjoy. I was given a half an hour lunch break and two 15 minute paid brakes.
good,Great place to work with discounts on clearance products. Very much customer orientated with a  friendly atmosphere. I moved and there is not a Lowe's where I live and I miss shopping there. They have a great selection in the Garden center of plants and shrubs.
good,"Great job, can be physically demanding and requires problem solving more than other retail jobs. Laborious aspects required a focus on safety and communication among employees"

good,It was a great corporation to work for. Management is fair and very helpful! It is a good place to get 1 on 1 people skills and other operation skills as well
good,"I enjoyed working at Lowe's as a cashier. Everyone was willing to help. Enjoyed"
good,"After a year or so I was left to work with only minimal interferance."
good,They gave 30 mins to an hour for a break which allowed for time to relax my feet since I was always on them walking around the store either helping customers or moving lumber. Work experience allowed for strengthening of communication and interpersonal skills.
good,Lowe's in West Des Moines was very busy. I was never bored. I gave it everything I had. Some managers great and others not so much. Loved the customers and my co-workers. Lowes was flexible with my schedule at the beginning but then a new manager came in and wasn't flexible at all. I would still be there if they had more flexible.
good,Pay is great for retail management.  If you wish to become a store manager you will have to enter a program and 95% chance you will have to relocate.  This is not fair because of opportunities that are readily available in my market.
good,"CSC is a great place to work, I enjoyed working here although the customers can be a bit overwhelming the team I was on was great. My supervisor was the best yet, he always guided me to be better and gave me pointers on certain things to improve on."
good,"A typical day is VERY busy especially when subordinates do not show up for work!"
good,i loved this employment. management and communication was great and work was well recognized. pay and benefits however was not worth the work i put forth
good,I loved working with the public it was great customers were awesome upper management needs to learn how to speak to their managers. Many times you felt not appreciated in your work. Many times you were talked down to instead of being inspired to be better. One or two good Upper managers who tried to help mold you into being successful. left wanting more
good,It has been years since I worked for Lowe's I hope they have settled down. When employed there it seemed to have a high turn around for managers. Some were great others not. Glitches with customer relations and there install sales department.
good,Lowes is a great company to work for. I was hired as a temp and they kept me there for over a year. You always meet new people on a daily bases. Co workers are helpful

good,The overall job at Lowes was great. Management at that time could have used some work. Hours were great and very flexible. Usually only had one weekend off a month.
good,"If you are looking for a Manager position, Lowe's offers great advancement within the stores. Entry Level is Service and Support Managers (Non-Exempt) to next Level of Assistant Store Managers (Exempt). Pay is comparable with other competitors along with bonus opportunities."
good,Lowe's is a great place to work and very flexable with part time hours needing to work. There is always something to do around here so you are never board and the staff is friendly and fun.
good,All I’ll say is one bad manager can ruin an entire store. Two bad managers is lethal. Loved my job until the above mix happened. They made it obvious when it was your time to go.
good,"Complete year to date, shrink and budget report. Conduct follow ups on assignment given to employees in my department. Meet with upper management to discus potential sales issues and employee scheduling.  Down load daily sales goals report and order new inventory. Offer any support need to help complete details within the department. The hardest part was making sure deadlines are achieved. The most enjoyable part was exceeding my budget goals for the week."
good,Typical retail environment where you apply skills you've learned to assist customers in home improvement projects. Often asked to assist other areas of the store and sometimes overtime is needed.
good,"I enjoy working at Lowe's most days, as my particular department- though it is one of the most stressful areas to work in- is fast paced, and compensation is fair for the work level."
good,The only reason I’m job hunting at this time is to prepare for a move to an area that there is no Lowes for me to transfer to. I have worked for Lowes on and off for 13 years and both times I’ve left the grass was definitely not greener and I came back.
good,The work day was typical a long day what i learned i learned to work hard for what you want the management was amazing and was all for his staff the hardest part of the job was the long hours but it all paid off in the long run the most enjoyable part of the job was everyone was a teamplayer no matter what the situation. Thank you lowes for having as part of the family
good,I do not wish to post a review.  It was a good experience.  Ihad an issue where favorites were promoted over the most qualified.  I begain to get regular customers as well a the cashiers would always send difficult questions to me.
good,"I was one of the Sales Associates for the Home Decor department at my local Lowe's store. It felt great to work with people on their home projects and feel productive throughout the day. Sadly, I was let go after a six month temporary season, and if there was another job opening I'd certainly go back."

good,Great team environment and collaboration. New CEO has came in and shook up some things. Lowe's is heading in the right direction but has made significant changes to get where we are with the company today.
good,"Good hard work for those that want to work, good chance to have a job that is actually enjoyable in the customer service sector. "
good,"I work very hard up and down a ladder, looking after customer helping them fined the right product for them listening to their projects finding solution for what their doing. it is a good place to work but i am not the one to do nothing    i might be the one in any department helping the customer.  I also have customer that ask after me and know me by name.  "
good,"The work is challenging at times but after training and time working in the job, you learn how to work with customers to sell Lowe's products.  Long time employees are a benefit to helping your learning curve."
good,I enjoyed working at Lowes. You meet new people and become loyal to recent customers. The job is hard to learn but once you get the hang of it it becomes easier.
good,The onsite cafeteria and onsite clinic were great perks. They could not keep managers as they put too much on them. The best part of the job was getting recognized for my great work and I got recognized 3 times. Hardest part of leaving for medical reasons
good,I really loved it here. My managers were amazing. I was pregnant at the time and they were very understanding and helpful. You have good breaks. And they somwtimw put you in different areas to keep things different
good,I have a set schedule so I usually work the morning shift (6-3). I am the lumber cashier but help out any where else in the store if needed.   When my shift start I open the door on my side of the building then start to clean up my work area. Once I do that and customer start to come then I help them with whatever it is they need.
good,"the days at the production office are fast paced and you have to be focused and not allow yourself to become easily distracted.  The hardest part for some may be that there are so many different moving parts as far as working with peers, business partners that may not share the same beliefs as you do.  If you put in the work you can achieve a lot and move up fast in the company."
good,Can be a demanding and stressful job at times. The best part of the job was dealing with customers. The rest of the time is spent making sure shelves are full and straight.
good,Company challenges personal abilities to perform as an individual as well as a team partner. Opportunities to exercise and perform problem solving skills and apply them to a fast paced retail setting. The store is very much a team culture environment with work /life balance a part of daily operations.
good,Pay fairly and co workers are great to work with. Recommend to friends. Fun place to work and they are fair in any situation you may have to go through.
good,"This company has a lack of ethics, they only care about the numbers and not the people. The building needs work. Management plays favoritism. The turn over rate is high."

good,unloading trucks and breaking down pallets. Looking different products and how they work and what they use it for. working with different people leaning how to work as a team player.The hard part of the Job was 48 pallets breakdown over 4000 products.

good,For the most part I feel this would be a great place to work if you did not seek expanding your career. The climate was pleasant and the facilities were clean
good,The position I worked as a facility service associate was one of the best jobs I ever had. I mostly worked alone but it was great especially as an introvert. Occasionally the staff needed help but it was not hard to be willing because they were so friendly. The management cared about you as well as the staff. It really felt like a work team family.

The hardest part of the job was having to answer questions from other departments that I was not familiar with but always had someone to help me and give me the knowledge that I needed in order to help the customer and have for future reference. Throughout everything my most enjoyable part of the job was being able to satisfy customers with good service and being able to help them with whatever they needed."
good,very good management and assistant managers.Enjoyed the job and hated to leave when I moved.Assisted customers down stocked shelves and scanned shelves for merchandise to fill empty spots.
good,Most work days are busy and non-stop. The company does have different programs to help make Lowe's a fun work environment. Twice a year there is a employee appreciation lunch in. For making safety budgets we have a cook out. There is always other fun events for the stores to do. We also do a lot of volunteer work. These projects are also a lot of fun and help our community.

good,Excellent company.  The overall management team is great.  I happened to be assigned to a terrible Director in my final year of service.  The company as a whole is terrific.

good,When I started out I was a temp seasonal cashier and was able to advance throughout the years amazing opportunity great company to work for they offer great benefits 401K plan
good,grate place to work but very bad management at the store i worked at  more for them selfs then workers did not care -----------------------------------
good,"I enjoyed helped the customers with their needs and helping my fellow employees with the help they needed. I spoke with different cultures that came into the store which was a pleasure. the only problem I had with Lowes was not enough hours. When I applied for a better postion I wasn't chose, but someone off the street was promoted, not from within the company."
good,"•	coordination of interviews in the hiring process. "
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for, but there are differences in the area in which you work,  Working in a store is very different than working at the call center.  There is a lot of pressure working in the call center."
good,My experience at Lowe's was overall a good experience.  They worked with my on part time hours.  They provided lunches at different times and had an open door policy.
good,Great workplace with growth in there stock plans.  I have worked for several different store locations in different states and their work ethic have been upheld at all stores.
good,Great job. the environment was friendly and fun. I highly recommend someone who wants to start their time in retail to definitely take a job a Lowes. They wont regret it.
good,"great work culture, competitive, good management."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers. When I was having a bad day my customers would put a smile on my face every time. I love working with the people in my department. We always work as a team and we always looked out for each other.
good,"I been working mostly at lumber. I like it there, it is fast but love been with customers."
good,"Very good place to work.."
good,Lowes was a good company to work for. You have a flexible schedule and management will communicate with all employees about work schedules. I learned how to properly lead and manage my staff with a strict sense of policy and procedures. Safety council was very important and always up to date. Forklift operator and trainer to properly assure we were following all guidelines and policies.
good,Very good management and great work community. A diverse company where you feel welcomed coming through the door and treated with respect notmatter what your tittle.
good,"I worked there only as a seasonal employee. But, it was a pretty enjoyable job. You learn a lot about your department and neighboring departments. Pay was ok at the time."
good,For a big box store they treat you very good. I worked delivery and loved my job except for the helpers I would get they were horrible. The schedule I had wasn't very good so I seeked other employment but other then that it was a good place.
good,Lowes is a very good organization to work for because they focus on quality products and great services. They have great training.  Love help people with their projects.
good,The people at Lowe's are very nice people. I loved interacting with the customers. The worst part about it is that you have to stand for 8 to 9 hours without really moving.
good,"Es una empresa excelente para laborar, se aprende mucho tanto administrativamente como en atención al  cliente, trabajo bajo presión y el sentido de urgencia"
good,It is a good place to work. it has its challenges like any other job. the con to it is that the store management is not given the freedom to make decisions that impact their businesses rather they are made to depend on corporate decisions which are always faulty
good,"consisted of angry customers from other departments i had to cheer up, i was very friendly of but this review i don't care about. its kinda a waste of my time work here if you want"
good,"Learned a lot working with LOWES, Excellent job satisfaction and learned plenty of things,nice environment to work, "
good,The hardest part of this job is standing all day.  The most enjoyable is getting to be where I love to shop.  The money room was the best part of this job but I was not the main person.  I filled in when needed.
good,"Great job and co-workers."
good,Customer service...cleaning...stocking...learned information on new products...working with all types of people...heavy lifting...merchandising new products.
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for. They are currently undergoing changings that they are trying to work thru. The benefits are great for retail environment. Lowe's as a company care about their e.mployees
good,Lowe's is one of the better jobs I have had. I would recommend others to work there.  They do have some downfalls as scheduling and staffing could be managed better.
good,High volume of costumers and very pleasant environment to work in. I learned how to manage different situations and focus on details and customer service. The management were very focused and determined to keep the store organized and maintain customer service. The hardest part of the job was to move up and grow within the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was to fulfil customer service.
good,This is truly a nice place to work. I enjoyed working there and worked in several department while employed. The reason I left is because I wasnt getting enough hours and the pay just wasnt for me but I was able to support my family on it.
good,"Every day was different , I learned about flowers , and the best seeds to use .This a great place to work, thew Overhaul company does care about its employees . Its hard work at times , but if it wasn't it would be boring ."
good,"I work with some of the nicest people. Work load is a lot for the amount that is paid. Management sometimes want tasks completed in a time manner that is just not reasonable. However, they are very good with working with your home/life schedule, and genuinely care about you."
good,"Checking plants to see what needs water first, stretching water hose out to begin day. Learning about different types of plants. All personal and management was helpful.The company interacted, communicated, and recognized their employees. Stretching the hose out, working out side."
good,Great atmosphere to work at. Must have a great personality and be friendly to customers. Must be able to adapt to changes quickly and be self motivated.
good,A Very good company to work for the work there is very easy the type of work is unloading trucks by hand placing product on pallet and making the product is safe to take away to the location.
good,"Work at lower is fairly routine , but has its advantages in meeting a lot of new people. i really liked working here. people are very friendly and willing to help others."
good,enjoyable employment with little drawbacks. the pay is good and during the summer there is as lot of chances at overtime. the assistant store managers can be uptight but aren't they always. I loved the job and would suggest it to other people.
good,I've been with the company for ten years now and with it had better benefits. The people I work with are friendly and feel that they are more like family. We have fun while we work which is great
good,"Good Place to work, starting pay is decent and the opportunity for raises and advancement is good if you are looking to make a career out of it. Management in the store needed some help, our store manager was horrible and sexist!"
good,"Great Place to work. Encourages growth and advancement."
good,"Lowes has taught me that teamwork and learning how to work within a team is essential to getting the job done and growth, and it helps to enjoy where you work."
good,"It is a good place to work and culture is open, good benefit and environment, it has a lot of opportunity for college hire, only lowes.com has latest technology"
good,"I loved working there. Hard at times, but I got it done.I learned more about tools. And about other tools, that I never heard of.Management wasn't the greatest. Tried to resh me to much. This gives me low esteam in doing my job."
good,"all the people i came into contact with at lowes were great. If they would have had it in their budget to keep me i would still be working there, but it was a seasonal job."
good,"Many people stay and work here, I myself have higher aspirations, but its a nice workplace nonetheless. Its been my best pay so far, just need a full time job."
good,LOWES is probably the very best place I ever worked. The people there make it what it is. Not much room for advancement but all in all they treat their employees well. I would recommend it for anyone.
good,"It is an ok place to work.  Lots of corporate changes that make you feel like you are a number.  Good benefits and good pay.  Sucky schedules.  You get what you give but even then when corporate changes you do not count,"
good,"typical work day would include stocking items, helping customers with key cuttings or finding things around the store and showing them which is the better product to by depending on what they want."
good,"I am currently working for Lowe's Home Improvement part-time the pay is very good for an entry position compared to other jobs in similar field. Although, there is a horrible work/life balance the hours that you get are never guaranteed and ever changing also constantly getting called for extra time in at ridiculous hours ex (6 am). I would definitely have management have more people working shifts since at times seem overwhelmed by customers altogether a great company to work for if these could be improved."
good,"I loved working for lowes. As long as everyone embraces each other and works as a team all seems to go well. There are a lot of things to learn in the store that are self taught. You will be shown how to do your job but to learn everything, you have to learn through a lot of diferent sources."
good,"Nice place to work. Pros,it's pretty much a good  environment. Cons hours sucks, could tell you before they hire you that you will only be working so many hours"
good,Lowes is a wonderful place to work and I have created lifelong friendships there with so many people. I am simply looking for something to challenge me with everyday that provides the opportunity to advance. I have a degree and would like to branch out of Lowes and see what else there is to offer me and my family.
good,Worked at an excellent store.  Staff was friendly and supportive.  Was part of an excellent manager crew.  Had to learn a lot. Expectations are vastly different from your traditional retail store.
good,"I enjoyed working for Lowe's the time that I was there.  I was in the Flooring Department so I was working with heavy inventory, which I enjoyed, and being able to talk to and help the customers with any questions they may have was a nice incentive as well."
good,My managers are amazing and I enjoy my job. The only downfall is that I work 3 days a week. I also do not live close to my store's location.
good,"You can easily advance if you are willing to put in the work and the hours. They offer excellent benefits and fair compensation."
good,A great place to work and co-workers and management are helpful. I find that the company will help you and be there if you are going through any kind of stressful situation.
good,"Typical workday consists of customer service all day! Great environment to work in, lots of freedom to move around and stock / help customers. Management structure needs work - too many chieftains! Hardest part of the job was probably dealing with the way management handled things (and carefully navigating that)."
good,"I started my career with Lowe's as a seasonal employee. I built on that opportunity to work my way up through the store to ultimately become an assistant store manager. This past year the work/life balance went too far over the edge because of external actions beyond my control. I miss all of my associates I worked with there as well as my customer base. I learned how to motivate others with explaining the why of good customer service to help the store drive business. I would either open, and help motivate our team with daily goals during the morning meeting, and send that information out by email to all associates who came in to work later so that our goals were transparent. If I was scheduled to close I would walk the entire store and ensure the end of day recovery was consistent with Lowe's brand. I would look at the sales driver and current tab to ensure all areas of the store were executing great customer service and merchandising the tab.The most enjoyable part of my job was helping associates and giving them the knowledge to help drive sales and service. I love helping people whether they are customers or employees. The hardest part of the job was holding people accountable, but again, you have to analyze opportunities and use the time coaching them to help them further their career."
good,"Helped customers find products that fit their needs "
good,I would do anything asked of me that was beyond my pay and not complain. I had fun at tmes jut doing what was needed to be done. I helped in every department that needed and help train new hires as well. The job was great the management was very disappointing at times but I stuck in as long as my heart would let me
good,"great place to work , nice atmosphere , great customer service , i loved working here just didnt like the lack of hours i was getting ."
good,"just wish I could move or even get a interview to move on to different job,,,like to stay busy and cashier is a slow job ,,other then that just would like to have fixed hours with no week ends"
good,No day is typical. Learned a lot about home improvement. Management could be good or bad depends on who you work for. Liked them made the day go by quickly. Doing alot of heavy lifting. Helping costumers with their problems.
good,"lowes has very hard working people, its very constant and youre always busy. the co workers are very helpful and open to new employees. Its just a very tiring job."
good,minimum hrs only worked seasonal worked 5pm to close no dayshift available for seasonal treated like an outsider because seasonal
good,"I like working with people and helping them find what then need for them homes, gardens, businesses and other projects."
good,LOWES has been great opportunity towards educating there staff members on the unique and passionate customer service teaching but lacks management which makes the whole customer service teaching a load of bs. if your going to work with any home improvement company give the best example of yourself so management knows the real people who run the company
good,"work load is fine truck days can get busy but that just comes with it. .Most employees are fine,To much Drama for me. Most management will help you to move up."
good,"I enjoyed what I did at Lowe's and I may still be there today if the store manager didn't treat and talk to me so bad, when I injured my elbow. It wasn't even that serious."
good,"very communicative environment with the customers and the other employees. Although the hours were long the alternation between cash, loader, and customer service."
good,Overall good company to work for with generally friendly co-workers to help pass the day smoothly. Jobs are fairly easy and all require good customer service. Hours do fluctuate regularly and there are no set schedules.
good,"Schedule varies from 5:30am -11:00pm 40 hours a week.  I do everything from putting up freight, waiting on customers and designing bathrooms.  The hardest part of my job is the hours and heavy lifting.  The best part of this job is bringing happiness to the customers in designing a bathroom or just helping them solve a problem around their home.  I love to help the new employees find their fit within the store thru knowledge that I have a lot of after all the years I have been there.  I work well with management to help them achieve store goals."
good,"upbeat culture, good bene's, nice mix of people. work conditions good."
good,Great place to meet new contractors and also tell customers of the products they want to consume. The management made the job easier at times by hearing requests and input.
good,Unfortunately I don't feel my talents are being properly utilized. They still have not made me a full time employee despite loyal and dedicated service.
good,I really enjoy working here.  Co-workers provide positive feedback and they are always looking for ways to improve employee morale.
good,I would love to go back and work at lowes. the stuff and customer are great and there was a good management as also to co-worker
good,"Lowes is always busy with folks needing help with their projects. "
good,"Seasonal lawn and garden job when wife and I fist move to Abingdon Va. "
good,The most enjoyable part of working there were the people that I worked with on a daily basis. Everybody got along with each other and never had an issue. There was always a new challenge when you went into work everyday. Management was cool and got along with all of their employees.
good,"I loved my job, people were great to work with, great benefits.  Management could have been better some played favorites, some people did what they wanted whenever they wanted.  people were not praised for a job well done, laziness was promoted while hard workers were overlooked and or forced to leave."
good,Helping customer improve their living space. They have on the job training in every department. Great open door policy. You learn to love it.
good,"Lots of hours as well as extra responsibilities beyond human resources.  Good support from upper management, but overwhelming demands at times.  Have to close one night every other week and have to work 6 days straight every other week."
good,Fun and enjoyable place to work. I enjoy with all of the managers I work with and I enjoy the relationships that each has built to create a good team. I enjoy being able to help customers and associates. It is enjoyable helping to associates grow within the company. Helping customers is rewarding because you are helping them to improve where they live. It's is nice building relationships with customers because they will come back to you forever.
good,"to many nights and weekends, needed more time at home to spend with my family, other than that it was a great place to work, The co-workers were usually fun and very customer oriented."
good,Professional and structured work environment. Management responded well to employee concerns and requests. Co-workers were very pleasant and easy to work with.
good,Lowe's is interested in their people. They like to see their people develop and advance. A great place to gain experience.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with customers and fellow employees. To me nobody is a stranger. I feel I am not only part of a great team but that I am respected for my individuality and my own strengths. I am typically on my own as far a supervision and take pride in managing my time to achieve the goals of our company and myself.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company because I could go at my own pace as long as I would get my job duties done. However, I would constantly stay busy so that I would get my job done in a timely manner and there was always something there for me to do."
good,"Lowes was an excellent place to work i really enjoyed my time there. I enjoyed helping the customers most of all, it was a rewarding experience!"
good,Everyday I switched from being a cashier and a gas attendent. I learned that the customer is always right and they should get their way.
good,Lowe's offers decent pay for a retail based job. The responsibilities and requirements for my position are pretty minimal. The company has a system in place to train for promotion and at least in my store there is a positive culture of support.
good,My experience here was awesome. I loved the actual job requirements. It was a good fit for me. The benefits package was great after five years of service you would get three weeks vacation. After ten years if would be four weeks. You were able to take your time off with out any fuss. The only problem I saw was when you had a store manager change. He was able to build his own team and sometimes good people lost their positions because they wanted some else.
good,"I personally didn't like getting dirty but the jobs pretty easy and the people you work with are nice so it is a pretty decent company to work for, also it gets really hot in the containers so more fans at the bay doors would be nice."
good,"Customer service, answered phones, handled returns"
good,Great Place to work. Horrible Schedule. The only thing I do not like about Lowe's is the work schedule.  Great management staff.
good,I believe Lowe's is a great company to work for. However the ability to move up within the company depends on the management in the store.
good,"I work at Lowe's as a truck unloader, I started out as a seasonal night stocker. My manager liked my performance so once the season was over he kept me and put me on part time as an unloader.  I unload trucks every day. It has become a work out so its not that bad. Im not getting enough hours so I am looking for a day time job along side of this one."
good,"Again good place to work. The culture was balanced and it was exciting to go to work every day!"
good,Fast pace locatuion. Management is very friendly and always try to accomadate with your personal needs. Friendly working atmoisphere.     Ability to learn from other departments.
good,I love working at Lowe's with my Lowe's Family.  Being able to help the customers fill their home improvement needs and have fun while doing it.
good,The training is very thorough and the mangers are always willing to help. It was a great place to work
good,I have worked at Lowe's for many years and have enjoyed every one of them. A typical day includes working staff and helping customers fulfill their needs.  Lowe's is a great company and I have no complaints.
good,"I worked in the seasonal department first, I loved stocking all the holiday stuff! I moved into a cashier position. I worked in lawn in garden which is outside so you froze in the winter and burn up in the summer. I then moved up into a management position over the cashiers on the front end. I really enjoyed this job. I like working with the public and I like handling the office work and cash in's and out's."
good,Learned a lot about people and how management has a big responsibility. The people I worked with were get the job down but still have fun doing that job
good,"Lowe's is extremely focused on taking care of the customer, and empowering the employees to do so is no issue."
good,"Moving Trailers around Terminal yard as directed my Distribution Management System, Training all new hire personnel for Yard Driver position. Leadership lacked direction on day in and day out expectations, self sufficient run operation with seldom radio communication with assignments and forecasted tasks other that daily obligations from management. Great team morale mostly due to lack of leadership from within building. Most difficult part of job was the training aspect but was also the most rewarding when the team member grasped the concept of the day in and day out functions of preforming the yard driver role."
good,Awesome place to work and shop at. They have everything you need from lumber to garden items and everything in between.
good,"Starting time is 6:00 am, check for any overnight problems and start on the work list. Management calls me for any pop up breakdowns or emergency. Co-workers can and will call me for any large scale breakdowns for help from me. There`s really no hard parts unless I have been off for awhile and everything is a major mess, but that doesn't happen to much. The most enjoyable part is completing the job at hand so others can do theirs."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job has been working closely "
good,always new products to learn stocking and customer service a must pulling orders for customers loading and unloading trucks helping customers start and finish home projects
good,I provide a safe and clean work environment. I am extremely knowledgeable customer service and make an impact on customer's buying experience.
good,"A typical day at work consist of helping customer anyway possible. Some manager are great at their job, while other are sub-par as well as co-workers. The hardest part of the job is keeping carts in the store, because the store I work at is a high volume store. The most enjoyable part of the jobs is helping customer figure out the solution to their project. weather it be; home, school, work or everyday living issues."

Customer service position includes processing credit applications,purchases, taking credit card account payments, determining the type of repayments with returns, completing internet orders within a given period of time.

The skills are in range from learning the cash office, returns, SOS orders, internet orders, and so much more. My co-workers are great. They will help you when things get busy. Some even go beyond work to help you when needed. The hardest part would be the schedule. It flips from days, mid shift, to nights in one week. The fun part of working at Lowe's is the customers. They are a unique range of people. "
good,Enjoyed the variety and skill levels of the different fields I was involved in while under the employment at Lowe's.  
good,"My typical day at work was helping people with their home projects and picking out the appropriate material.  Management was a little un organized in the department I was working in, but that was due to a new department manager.  I am sure he will get it all ironed out soon.  The most difficult part of the job was walking and standing on concrete for 8 hours a day.  Finding the ""best"" work shoe helped solve the problem."
good,Great people to work with and great managers. Stores have alot of favoritism that go on. 
good,Working with customers that come into the store to help ensure there experience was pleasant and easy to find the products they need. I had learned so much about all department with in the store that helped me to obtain a wide spred knowledge of home improvement and construction.

good,"delivered product to customer, learned how to use a fork truck. learned how to hook up appliances."
good,"A typical day includes helping out any customer that needs it and helping any department that needs an extra hand. I also load and unload trucks. My co-workers are extremely fun to work with and we do our jobs well. The hardest part so far is learning where everything in the store is, so I can help customers no matter what they are looking for. The most enjoyable part is feeling satisfied with the work I am doing and being around my awesome co-workers."
good,Enjoyed working with fellow employees and serving customers. A good customer base. Enjoyed sharing knowledge of products with customers.
good,cool company too work for nice people great guest if you are full time u get a lot of hrs
good,"Working at LOWE'S in City of Industry was a good place to work for in the beginning. I Enjoy ngoing into work everyday and working with my co-workers. I learned alot, how to use a LRT gun, MPI's, IRP, blind cutting machine, and much more. As for the management they had there favorites, If you would ask them for anything or further your education they would turn you to someone else that wasn't management and the store dropped a tier because of the lack of management. My co-workers were great people to work with and very helpful, had no problem helping and Hardest part of my job was lifting 5G paints. Most enjoyable part of working for LOWE'S keeping busy and working with great people."
good,Very good employer
good,"I am now retired, my experience with the Lowes Company was wonderful."
good,I was a cashier there for almost 3 years. It was a descent job!
good,"all the representatives are true professionals they know their stuff,one manager is kinda of a weirdo might have mental problems of some sort besides that everything else is fine."
good,"Fun place to work at and make lots of friends. The managers here are the same as any other store. Just more of them,. I love my co-workers. Became friends with all. The hardest part of my job right now is that the signature caps are older and get the customers annoyed. The most enjoyable is being around my friends at work and the customers who are happy to see me each day"
good,Typical day at work is being assigned as well as distributing assigned tasks to associates in my department and completing tasks assigned to me by upper management. Taking care of customers and fulfilling department manager duties.
good,Was a great place to work
good,"The motto is not just for consumers to think thats a cool motto, internally Lowe's is going through a major over haul on how they operate. They are making most changes for the better, and they want employee idea's but there is a lot of ""this is how we've always done things mindset"" during off hours operations which is their biggest downfall, if you are a younger person looking to kick off a career this is a great place to start with critical thinking skills and dedication and hard work. The managers have no outside worklife really and the expectation is for you to work just as hard and long, which is why I don't recomend this company for people with families or any kind of home life, you will not be home unless you are just part time and already retired. Other than that the company does have great potential and hopefully will make all the changes it needs to, to improve customer service as well as employee quality of life."
good,I have been with lowe's 12 years and I learn something new every day and willing and welcome it.
good,Except poor management very good place as employer.
good,"It's not very fulfilling. People tend to walk over you. Coworkers are great, department managers are fantastic. Lowes, takes a long time to investigate harassment in the work place"
good,"Employee cent-rick organization."
good,Really good place to work everybody was extremely nice most of the managers did not have a problem helping you and if you love customer interaction this is a place for you
good,Worked around my school schedule treated me like family I was very quiet by the time my last day came I was talkative and very interactive it was a very fun job in my opinion
good,"Excellent company to work for."
good,Hablar otro idioma es un plus bien remunerado. Me gusta trabajar en Lowes
good,"I've worked at mom and pop hardware shops, along with Home Depot.. if we are being honest all are pretty much the same job, but Lowe's pays a bit better. The management is pretty good and the coworkers are always fine people. I'd recommend working for Lowe's if you like Hardware retail."
good,I worked here during my last years of high school. I worked as a cashier it was a slow paced job that paid decent for a lot of sitting around. Tbh it's a great place for make extra cash or a teen beginning their career path
good,"Lowe's went away from its original template for employees. I loved my job and working with the customers and employees. However, some upper mgmt. prefer to play power trips instead of working to train and help out talented workers. "
good,I loved my job at lowes. I would take customers items that they bought to their car and I would load their cars. I wished my job was not temporary because I would love to work there permantly.
good,I really enjoyed working for Lowes but it has came to the time where I want something better. The only benefits I had was dental and vision. Lowes would not offer me a full time position because of health insurance.
good,"Lowes is a very nice place to work but the schedule is all over the place, which I don't really like. I wish I had a set schedule.  But they don't offer that."
good,"Very friendly and busy place to work at. If you are an energetic person with high spirits and love to assist customer's, this is the place for you. Can be and will be stressful at times but there will be time for fun and celebrations."
good,"Lowe's is a good place to begin your work. You work as part of a team to unload the trucks and stock the merchandise.  After the truck is complete, you spend the remaining time stocking the store and then you top-stock any remaining merchandise."
good,More positive gesture towards employees. Store manager tells us what to do but she doesn't do the same. At least speak to us acknowledge that we are there.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Lowes. The management that i worked under where educational, fair, helpful and kind to employees that worked under themThe work environment was never hostile. I really appreciated the employee and customer interactions. The only problem was that there was not enough hours for full time work and never a chance for overtime."
good,"Delivering a checkout experience that is quick, professional, and friendly"
good,"Need a strong mind set and good work ethics and willing to multitask. Need to earn trust, and liability to your work. Employees that have been working there longer the me have helped me along the way."
good,"Good to deal lowes"
good,"A typical day at Lowe's begins with a Safety walk, ensuring that the aisles, top stock, displays, and products are stocked and stowed safely and properly.  The next item on the agenda is down stocking any items that appear empty or low on the shelves of the department.  The main focus; however, is the customer, first and foremost.  Acknowledging your customers and asking targeted questions concerning the projects and products they might need to accomplish their tasks and goals."
good,"A typical work day is very busy assisting customers' with purchases offering new products and services. Also, aid in solutions to problems with purchases. Things learned are building a report with new and existing customers by providing excellent customer service. Management is good. Workplace culture very face-pace. The hardest part of the job is standing on concrete floors for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is pay incentives per quarter."
good,Lowe's was a nice place to work.  The employees and managers all worked together to get the job done.  They were flexible with work schedules and would try to give you the time you needed off.  They let you do your job and valued employee input.
good,I liked working there . Getting involved with the customers and solving problems for them. The see them bring friends and family in just to get my help made me feel good
good,I worked at Lowes for 13 years last year they changed company presidents and insteed of adding he immedialy eliminated positions. Retail is about addapting and moving forward not being a dinasour . I loved my time at lowes but not to sound bitter the company president was brought in from a failing company he could not fix and the quikly he tried to make Lowes feel like his previous to last employer. No new ideas just recycled stuff he brought with him but i think that is why so many ceos of companies moved aroud so much
good,Great job but they are cutting to many departments and making the job 10x harder for store employees i mean internet orders was just cancelled thank god i am a cashier too or i would of lost my job completely
good,I enjoyed working there. they worked with my school schedule and gave me hours I needed. Very helpful and gave me the experience I needed while working at lowes and taught me new things.
good,"Lowe’s a well known company to be honest. I thought there was no chance for me to get in, but that’s where I was wrong luckily there were also comrades who told what I needed to have right there and then. The questions in the interview weren’t really hard at all."
good,Its a great job to get into but i would like more hours for cashiers. If Lowe's can be friendly with college students like benefits. Many students that work at Lowes need help.
good,I enjoyed working for Lowe's; enjoyed the atmosphere and the people who I worked with.  Learned many different skills applicable to multiple areas.  Hours were really good.
good,"Lowe’s is a great place to work, I learned a lot in the small amount of time I’ve been there. The association is very friendly and open to helping you achieve your goals. They are also very accommodating to your availability and willing to work with your schedule to get you all your hours."
good,"Culture of hard working people, collaborative and friendly staff, a unique retail experience because you learn a lot about the items in your department and how to use them "
good,The staff was all good people.  They are selective when hiring.  Would like to get back into the company as soon as possible.  Just having a hard time with transportation at the moment.
good,"Working at Lowes was rough because I was never given any true guidance, but was more just put in a spot and left alone, so i had to learn things on my own or from fellow workers, I was given less then adequate training and was often used to cover for others mistakes. but the pay and benefits made all the minor things worth. I did enjoy my work for a time but when i was injured i was not given any compensation."
good,"It was a good job, the management was pretty bad, but the overall job was a good experience, the only issue was the people who would pass through and be hired for 2 or so months and not do anything so you have to pick up their slack and it happened a lot."
good,"I don't know why as a salary manager I have to work 50+ hrs every week... it's too much... Also schedule is very different every week, to set your work life balance.."
good,"Overall a great place to work! Access to information to advance your career. Competitive environment, also has open door policy, newly added. Would definitely recommend."
good,"Lowe's was a wonderful company. "
good,It’s a great place to work fast paced and very customer oriented. Some you know by name we cater to lots of contractors and private owned companies. I’ve learned a lot in my 4 1/2 years working here.
good,My experience working at Lowe’s was a very good one. I got to learn a lot while working there about different various products. I also developed a good deal of customer service skills.
good,"my store manager was the best manager ever. The HR manager and the District manager were horrible. They would stir up trouble, They would not allow us to coach employees who were on drugs. They allowed employees to be sextually harrased. They have since been hired, but it took way yo long."
good,Wanted full-time. Never received it out of four years of work. Most managers work excellent. Would love to work for the company again. Hour Lunches. Customers work great. Management treated you like a human being
good,"A typical day at work would be great because you meet new people & you get to help them , you can make a person day just by saying hello . I learned how to multitask in different parts of the day , it was very welcoming when I started the hardest part of the job was when it was break time I usually like just going and finishing the job with no stopping the most enjoyable part was meeting the  customers needs"
good,"Very fast paced work environment with plenty of room for advancement."
good,I have worked at a variety of stores and each one seems to have its own culture. whenever you initially apply there and it's very welcoming and usually a large learning curve depending on your knowledge. I have no issues with the company more so the work-life situation that I have now makes it difficult to stay within management there.
good,"Great crew and Supervisor, if someone finished their area they would always ask if you needed help."
good,Currently going through operational changes with recent CEO change. Some employees are having trouble dealing with these changes. I believe that these changes will greatly enhance  the quality of Lowe's ability to provide excellent customer service.
good,It was a lot of fun working at Lowe's it just didn't pay enough to meet all my bills and maintain my own residence.  I would recommend Lowe's as a starting position.
good,Overall good place to work. Management can be clueless at times. Communication between corporate and management needs to improve. Lot of the employees are lazy.
good,Great job with benefits. Do your home work and learn your products. This will help you get customer helped and out of the store quickly. YouTube will help you as well with learning tool and with ideas to pass on to your customers.
good,"Simpl, For me a great place to work. Management is very supportive. The company offers great incentives to its guests which becomes great tools in suggesting the best products with value."
good,"A typical day at Lowes including, learning something new, how to help someone, and make someones day (employee or customers). "
good,Lowe's is a good company to work for.  As long as you are making a good effort to do your job it's a great place to work.  I have enjoyed working throughout the years.
good,Lowe's was a Great place to work. I learned a lot and made a lot of Friends.  My boss was totally cool. And I loved doing the work.  I just feel its time to move on and advance in Fork Lifting.
good,I enjoyed working at Lowe's. The people that I worked with were very kind and positive at all times. I would love to work there again to build my resume up as well as learn more about the product that they sell.
good,"One of the best companies to work for. "
good,There were always fun competitions and rewards. I had a lot of fun with my coworkers. They were very helpful and kind. The hours were very flexible. I talked to my manager about school once an he was very understanding with my hours.
good,"All in all, working at Lowe's as a receiver / stocker, is my favorite job I have worked thus far and wish I did not have to stop working there.  On a typical work day, I would get to work around 4 a.m. and me and my coworkers would start off by taking the pallets with the merchandise on them using power equipment to the according section (Electrical, Flooring, Plumbing, Etc.) and then unload the various pallets item by item to their shelve according the the Lowe's item finding terminal.  One of the greatest aspects of this company are the workers inside of it, I have never worked with anyone so friendly and family like.  They happily took me in as a fellow worker and I felt like part of the ""family"" in no time, talking to workers in different departments as well as my own.  The hardest part of the job is the repeated lifting of heavy items, and the most enjoyable for me was interactions with the workers"
good,This place was enjoyable to work for. The most annoying part of applying was having to do the online test. Other than that it was a breeze after passing the psych test.
good,There was a maximum respect in the store for the day to day sync operations done and it exceeded in sales as one of the more known Lowe’s in a area that it competing Home Depot almost each and everywhere you go
good,"a very confortable place to work,open and fun people to work for,nice area with very good customers that understand the company policy and in general."
good,"Knowing various levels and department within the store is beneficial to customers.  Currently I work in Home Decor, place special orders for window treatments and custom cut blinds.  Suggest best overall products for customers based on their description of needs."
good,Great company to work for with a good culture you get full benefits and paid time off.  Several different avenues for advancement. Work life balance is not good but if you enjoy retail its a good company.
good,Great Fortune 50 company to work for - they just don't pay enough. Managers are very straight forward and helpful. They have good projects for IT and a good set of project managers.
good,Typical day very unpredictable i learned how to deal with customers getting everything they needed how to control inventory stock shelves and organize overheads drive 3 different power equipment realizing the priorities on of importance to that day of work but the most enjoyable part is when a frustrated customer came in and by your knowledge of the business helped them solve there problems and they left very happy because of you
good,"It was a very social environment. I went to speaking mostly Spanish to a job that was more English, but that wasn't a problem. I was also now working with a known company and more than 10 other people so it was a lot more social and a lot more doing, instead of just writing orders and working on a cash register. "
good,"Well paying, well established company.  Many advancement opportunities. Would have preferred a particular shift as opposed to shifts changing day to day."
good,I love being a part of something larger than me that makes a difference. I love that everyone in my department cares about the company and that you have flexibility when needed to enjoy our families.
good,if it were not for the fact that i was hired on as seasonal i would have loved to stay here for at least as long as it would have taken me to finish my degree. maybe longer
good,"Lowes is a good place to work, if you like working a set schedule. Management cares about the employees. Good benefits package for those who qualify and opportunity for advancements."
good,Over all good place to work. Some manager structuring and scheduling could be tightened up. Managers were willing to work with good employees and good about keeping teams on task.
good,"Good place to work.  People are all very friendly and helpful.   Enjoyed working with the customers and my co-workers.  Had to leave as they wanted me to work too many hours/days in a row, etc.  Inflexible hours."
good,"nice place to work for a cashier position,some of the people that work there are nice; others not so much, the pay and the befits are good, if you deal with the egos of some."
good,"I loved the family atmosphere. Everyone is always welcoming and helpful. It’s like one big happy family."
good,I loved working at Lowes!  I gained many valuable experiences and met some amazing people in my time at Lowes.  I will forever value the time I spent at Lowes.
good,"Lowe""s was a good place to work.  My position was very repetitive. I actually enjoy interacting with customers and my position as Receiving Manager did not include much of that. Very cool products."
good,Since my background is home-building I enjoyed being able to help customers with their home repair and remodel projects.  I filled in when departments were short handed.  In between helping customers I made sure the shelves had sufficient product stocked.
good,"Lowe""s was a great company in the beginning. Great benefits, bonuses, etc. Restructured and let go everyone that built that company. If you can have three people replace ASMs that built the company, why not? At least 15 fellow managers lost there jobs in Houston North in a week. All people we trained were let go within the year. Restructured again. Just corporate. Do not shop there anymore."
good,Associates are like family and are always there when someone is in need. when there are local disasters they pitch in and help each other and the communities that they reside in.
good,"I enjoyed satisfying a customers needs and expectations. I valued that the most.  I also loved to set up merchandise in different areas so that it would sell easier. A typical day meant dealing with customer's needs, resulting in sales. "
good,Lowes is a great company with good benefits and good work atmosphere.  Company is going thru a restructure and some positions will be going away soon.  Job security is much less than in the past but its still a great place to work.  Job security is the only reason I look elsewhere.
good,"Loved job.  Always work to do and had many great mgrs.  Managed many great people and helped more while I was at the store.  I started out as a loader and less than a year later, I was a dept mgr.  I was cross-trained in many of the departments"
good,"Great people to work for, I just find the retail hours hard to maintain a personal life. They treat their staff fairly and are accommodating when you need time off or a shift change."
good,"Look out for yourself, or you'll get run over. The management is generally a system of older, complacent and tenured individuals who have been at Lowe's for years and aren't going anywhere. Stay on their good side and your job is safe."
good,Love what I do and working with people and helping customers love where they live and coming up with different ways to grow business. I have seen Lowes grow for many years and our partnership with providers
good,This was a great summer job. I worked in Lumber and Outside Lawn & Garden. They paid me handsomely but the work reflects the pay. You will be working hard but always staying busy is great for this job. The managers will step in and help out if you are struggling and do not mind to give you days off or let you go early if you have something going on.
good,"The entire staff was a pleasure to work with. Aside from an ever changing schedule, Lowe's is definitely a great company to work for. I'd recommend them to anyone!"
good,"there's no guess work about what is expected of you everyday.there's a checklist of duties needed and one for end of the day completions. training is always going on. the room for advancement can be slow because the older employees stays and the job opening are few in between.in the store that i was in 80% of us did rack setting ,stocked the shelves and floors. we became like a close family."
good,"The people I worked with were fun and positive. I had such a great time working with such a great group of people."
good,"As a sales associate I am on my feet all the time, walking or standing while doing work.  The exercise is great.  Interacting with customers can be both the most enjoyable part of the day and not so much.  Some have good ideas for their project.  Others only a concept that we need to work out details for.  It can be interesting.  Many part time coworkers have Lowe's as their second job and have worked there for years."
good,team culture is the goal for lowes it promotes making goals and achieves bonuses for workers it allows people to get to know one another their when to help or ask for help is team working for one goal to provide its customers what they need to do their projects
good,"I worked for this company under the Lowe's name, under Food King at the same store, and at a smaller Lowe's. The smaller was the best out of all. Awesome managers, decent hours."
good,"The hours were good, they worked very well with my school schedule. The breaks were very short and I loved all my guests that came through my line! Holidays were super crazy and I wouldn't be able to leave that day until very late. My coworkers were awesome but at the beginning of my job I was on my own a lot. I eventually got the hang of it but I learned by myself."
good,"Set schedule with rotating shifts. Meet with customers, design and sell kitchens. Help in other departments, flooring, fashion bath, mill-work. always feel like you are being watched."
good,"Ultimately, management was nice and the workplace moved at a fair pace. I'd most certainly recommend working there to anyone I know, and certainly have already."
good,I had a great time working for Lowe's. The majority of the employees were happy to be there. Most of them completed their tasks everyday which made the work life very simple. Team work was always available.
good,learned a lot of new things as far as household. Met a variety of interesting people from all kinds of different background cultures. got to help and put a smile on a lot of customers faces. met interesting friends from work and customers. great overall culture and family oriented company.
good,I mostly was a cashier in the garden center.  It was my choice to do this and I really loved it.  Most of the employees in the store are fun and helpful. The products at Lowes are of good quality and it is with good conscience that you can encourage people to buy them.  We were encouraged to offer super customer service and I was proud of that.
good,the people are all amazing and its a great place to learn. Ive had so many opportunities given to me and the possibilities are endless. its very fast paced and you always keep moving. the customers are pretty cool to and you see a new dog everyday.
good,"A normal day at work would mostly be spent on the register waiting for business to pick up. In the summer it got really busy but in the winter, it was the complete opposite. I learned how to unload a truck, properly deal with customers at the customer service desk, and stock items onto shelves. The hardest part of the job was pulling carts in from the snow. The most enjoyable part of the job were the workers, everyone was very welcoming and kind. It was like a home once you got used to it."
good,"Lowe's has offered me a wonderful opportunity to grow and expand my career.  They are genuinely interested in their employees.  Work hours can be hard since you generally have to be available to work from 5-6 am until 10-11 pm and are required to work holidays.  However, I would definitely recommend Lowe's to anyone looking for an employment opportunity."
good,I was young and loved working at lowes.  I worked all over the place in that building. Inside and outside.  I didnt like winter because it was slow then but other than that it was a good job.
good,This was on of the best jobs I've had. It was very hands on and I've learned a lot in home improvement. I am now able to do odd jobs for neighbors. Very positive place to work !
good,I really enjoyed my time with the company. I must admit I had a few health scares and Lowes didn't let me go like Tesla did a few months ago. They secured my position for me. I worked happily for the company for almost 6 years. Thank you my Lowe's family!!
good,Great. Excellent benefits.  Wonderful fellow employees. Level of advancement depends on management.  Getting them to see tour hard work. Having a great relationships with customers.
good,"Los días comienza con un porra, para hacer que la gente se motive, para los jóvenes es un bueno  lugar para aprender de todo sobre nuestra propia casa."
good,"Lowes has an excellent culture and some of the best managers i've worked with. It's only real weakness is the lack of advancement available, that combined with my position not being allowed to transfer to other departments can cause issues."
good,"Great company structure and benefits,Problems with management,communication and employee scheduling.A good company to work for,but not perfect.A sense of acomplishing a good days work,frustrating when you put in overtime and are called in to work on your days off due to understaffing and irresponsible employees calling out frequently."
good,Great place to work love my coworkers and helping customers. The hours are very unstable one day your night shift and then the next day you are day shift.
good,"Employees have to take periodic training as needed dependent on position.  "
good,"I worked in many capacities at Lowe's over my 20 year career.  If you have a good manager, you will enjoy your work.  I enjoyed getting to know the team that worked for me and keep in contact with many of them still."
good,I enjoyed working at LOWES.  I was treated well by management and enjoyed the majority of my fellow associates.  I feel that the LOWES managers for the most part assist in accomplishing the days workload.
good,I love workong at Lowe's  i just became a full time associate  i am hopimg for a raise. If I don't bump up to at 11 an hour. Lowes mangers are wonderful. Don't abuse the privilege that are given  I couldn't be happier
good,"This is a very laid back place to work. It depends on which department you work in though. As a cashier, it is easy breezy. The only downfall to being a cashier is that you can't move further than 15 feet from your register unless you get permission from a head cashier. When it gets really slow, all you do is stand by your register and hope the time goes by."
good,Working at Lowes was fun and competitive. Assiting customers was challenging and rewarding at the same time. You were allowed to learn other departments throughout the store. You were given opportunities for advancement. Discounts were given to employees throughout the year. Fast paced at times. Contests to win prizes.
good,Fun place to work for managers a nice employees a nice I love to work in the work place where everybody feels like family and that’s  Lowes...I’ve learned a lot about customer service ..well a lot more already knew a lot but you never could learn  enough...
good,False promises in regards to time taken off well in advanced and I was also promised full time hours but instead I am only getting part time hours. They would sometimes add additional deliveries last minute on very short notice instead of adding the deliveries in advanced.
good,The full 8 years that I was with/ working for Lowe's I felt like our store was a family. Always felt comfortable to talk with management. I learned a lot in different departments and I use that knowledge to this day because of Lowe's.
good,"I started with Lowes back in 2005 not thinking I would stay there for as many years that I’m there now it’s been a journey and time has flown by so quick , like the company and my co workers , finding new opportunities with different company’s and new chalanges . Seeking a new office position."
good,Good pay. Good people. A line of work that held my interest and allowed me to be of service to others. I don’t recall having even one coworker whom I didn’t get along with and never witnessed other employees having issues with each other. Upper management was just as friendly as a new hire.
good,"Taking care of all of the plants in the garden center was very rewarding. Keeping the shelves stocked and merchandise available, especially during the hurricanes, gave a sense of helping the community."
good,"Amazing place to work if you can learn to balance work and outside of work life. Amazing benefits, great compensations. Busy days make time fly and management could use some work but that's any company."
good,"Great people to work with and the management is very helpful. Easygoing work environment, lots of team work! Management is willing to work with being flexible with schedule."
good,"I always felt like I was part of a family. All my coworkers were amazing but we had quite a few changes in management that, in my opinion, decreased morale."
good,I worked here over 7 years ago but really enjoyed it when I did.  They were flexible with my schedule and provided education to move up in the store if you wanted to.
good,Lowe's provided a great opportunity to get to know some great people.  Very corporate environment that has recently adopted a casual dress code.  Beautiful campus and lots of opportunity.
good,Very great place to learn new things about “do it your self” projects. Very friendly people to work with. The customers are usually always good to you as well.
good,"The company was good and the employees were nice and very friendly."
good,Mgmt is limited. Employees are left to manage themselves most days. Customer service is priority. Task are assigned each day with little or no direction to accomplish task. Training is on the job with little or no help from management. Employees are teaching each other when they can.
good,Very family oriented. They put together picnics for kids and family of the employees. They are a very friendly environment. I just wish they would have given me a little more training
good,"Often hard work, management had reasonable expectations of new employees, did a lot of manual labor which many didn't like but I felt it was reasonable to expect."
good,"Position I held for almost 6 years was eliminated.  Disappointed with replacement position, not happy with direction of company. Lack of understanding from corporate office, trying to hard to increase stock prices."
good,Lowe's is a great company to work for and the people who work for the company are always quite helpful both to staff and customers. I appreciate everything this company has done for me.
good,"I enjoyed working there, learned alot about home improvement. Management was really good. Most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers. Hardest part of the job is also people."
good,"A typical day there is fast past and it is fun with the people you work with."
good,"I really like my job, but it consist of stocking. I go in at 5a till 10 a and I do the irp(product replenishment on the shelves) and down stock. I don't really have to deal with people much."
good,"They had health insurance and life insurance. "
good,"Working as a sub contractor for CMI at Lowes was a very detail oriented job. My job entailed me to move supplies from the pallets they were delivered on and put them in the correct spaces on the shelves. For this job I would call the person that subcontracted me to see if my order was delivered, then once a week (or more if I was asked to do other locations) I would show up and put the supplies on the shelves."
good,I had great time working for Lowe's..I love making delivery and meeting the new clients...a great company to work for.but to move head or for advancement was to political
good,"Really easy, but physical work and seasonal associates are really dragged around the store to every department. They're very understaffed, but will not hire more than what is the bare minimum for work to be done which slows down many activities."
good,"Always changing, every job is what you make it. Meet some great people and learn new things every day. I would recommend people working there. Room for advancement"
good,Good place to work the people are amazing although the store manager is a bit difficult hopefully she has improved. the customers are amazing and the atmosphere is a bit edgy.
good,Typical day was very busy paced. Learned how to deal with customers in a time efficient manner while still providing excellent customer service. Management caries per store. I worked for 3 and 2 had wonderful management. Very family oriented culture. Hardest part of the job is picking up slack when there are not enough people on the floor. Most enjoyable part was the camaraderie.
good,"The job duties themselves are fairly easy and fun, its easy to stay busy and productive like in any retail job there is always something to do or organize, the customers and the employees are both friendly and considerate. The hardest part of the job is honestly trying to get management when they are needed and not knowing how to keep a positive mood for the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was honestly the job itself, its not difficult at all. Very productive. I like keeping busy."
good,"You get out of this job, what you put in. Majority of co-workers are hard-working people, who love working at Lowes.  Some of the management  could have better training on how to interact with employees, to understand exactly what our jobs consist of."
good,"The management was very helpful, the training was easy to follow, and the coworkers were all generally happy and content with working here.  Overall, I enjoyed working at Lowe's, and would recommend you apply there if you want an exciting and honest job that doesn't bore you, and doesn't grind you down.  It is an uplifting job atmosphere that made me content with what I was doing."
good,Having the opportunity to work at Lowe's was an adventure.  Learning so many new terms and tools was a great experience.  It was an easy task earning my red vest.  Loved working there! I met so many good folks. Everybody worked together as a team.
good,"Excellent group of people to work with. Everyday customers would tell us how clean the store was and that was because the management opening team made sure the we kept the ""house"" clean."
good,"Lowes has treated me well for the most part during my tenure, but ever since the restructuring (when I was forced to find a lesser job and lost $6.00 an hour) I have seen a tremendous drop off."
good,"This was a nice place to work, friendly work environment, different departments to learn, fast paced. No complaints about my experience working there."
good,"Good place to learn a new trade.  Flexible management style. Pay could be better.  Once you hit your max, no pay increases.  Lots of different departments to gain experience in retail."
good,fun  place  to  work  loved  helping customers  find  what  they  needed  loved  putting  lumber  packeges  together  the  people  i  worked  withalot
good,"Lowe's is a fantastic place to work.  The only problem I ever had was the rotation of the work schedule.  Had to work days, nights, weekends and holidays.  Benefits are good.  Salary is very competitive.  Lot of room for advancement."
good,"Lowe's is a great company and has been my employer for the last 8 years.  I have learned a lot in a day by day basis. Technology has enhanced the future of this company, providing handheld devices (ipods) to check for inventory and perform duties that used to require a desk station computer."
good,"Working at Lowe's was fulfilling, however the management was lacking the skills to place employees in the correct departments. Having been a flooring installer and salesman, I believe the correct department for me to be the most effective would have been the flooring department."
good,Good place to work if you need a part time job that has fairly flexible hours. the location that I worked at had managers that would work with you to get the schedule that you needed.
good,"Lowe's is a great introductory job for the fact that the management and associates will teach you how to behave with customers, how to handle multiple task, how to be an overachiever, and rewards theiir associates for achieving."
good,"It's a good company to work for when it comes to your fellow associates.  When it comes to scheduling, well, there is allot of room for improvement.  Plus, some managers seem out of touch with work loads vs what is actually humanely possible.  But with the open door policy, any issue can be addressed.  It's just the outcome can either be what you expect, what you don't expect or something out of left field."
good,They worked around my college schedule and made it possible to work part time. A typical day at work is going in and getting your returns and your department phone and start your day putting up stock and zoning.
good,Lowe's is striving to gain market share from the competition in pro services. Work closely with regional staff and store management on a daily basis to ensure we have job lot quantities of product for the pro customers and changing market needs.
good,"Long hours yielded satisfaction when able to solve a customer's problem, advancement was attainable, team was great to work with.  Hardest part was dealing with disgruntled customers. Management was all over the place, no continuity in their policies."
good,In my time at lowes I had multiple position and was able to move around the store and learn how to do a little of everything. I was happy to know that Lowes is one of the few companies on the retail level that offer bonus to the employees.
good,"Even though I was only there for the summer, I worked the amount of hours I wanted and I got to be in Lawn and Garden. Everyone was nice and easy going."
good,"Great company to work for, very busy during spring and summer. I worked outside so it was rough at times, overall still a great company to work for. Coworkers are very supportive."
good,It was a good experience. They even do in-house forklift certificate but are most time under staffed and extremely busy. Due to which you really have to work a lot in order to manage all the customers
good,"because I have had 35 years of construction experience, I feel that this is the perfect retirement job for me. it's not for everyone. The"
good,Productive and fun place to work.  Good benefits. Stock options. Great management. Great discounts when I worked there.  Great group of people to work with.
good,Management styles vary from location to location. However overall family atmosphere with great benefits and Fair compensation. Throughout my 15 year career I learned invaluable management skills as well as how to provide superior customer service while maintaining Lowes company standards and values.
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work and has many opportunities for people of any age to get a good job with much potential.  A typical work day involves many hours on your feet, which is actually quite good for anyone. The workplace culture is great and gives you a feeling of the concerns of everyone to help in any way they can. The hardest part of the job is nothing you can't get used to over time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people, both employees and customers and interfacing with all of them. The managers and bosses are fantastic and helpful while working with you on a daily basis."
good,"If you are looking for a relaxed place to work but also demanding at times, then Lowe's is a good place for you. It isn't difficult and everyone in management were great to work with."
good,"I am a salaried employee and know that my position is extremely demanding and at times stressful even though I do enjoy my work.  Deadlines are the norm. I work on average 10-12 hours a day, but do have flexibility in my job.  My job is more fit to a single person that doesn't have a family, as you stay until the work is done."
good,Lowe's was a great place to work at because there was an open door policy which means that you are free to talk to anybody in the company from a team member to upper management and they made you feel like family.
good,if you enjoy working with customers then this would be a good job for you. not to physically demanding just have to be good with people and you will do great here
good,"Lowe's Canada is an amazing place to work at. I am just looking for a secure full time job at the moment. Ive asked plenty of times but no position in my store are available, but this has so far been the best job yet!!"
good,Lowes provides great insurance benefits. Environment is fast paced. Casual dress. Excellent learning opportunities. Encourages team members to provide excellent customer service.
good,"working as a team with my associates in obtaining a goal, working with challenges everyday to fulfill those goals with time constraints and customer satisfaction"
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work. Good pay, very easy job. Great benefits. Lots of extras for hardworking people, several opportunities for volunteering in your local communities or disaster relief."
good,"Excelente ambiente, líderes humanos, retos constantes, aprendizaje. Retroalimentacion sana y constructiva."
good,"home improvement store,i learned about alot new products within the store,i met with customers who have their own business and they enlighten me on certain products within the store."
good,"Worked here for almost 9 years, made some amazing friends. Loved that you could move from different departments if it ever came up.   The work culture could be great when the right management is there."
good,This was a job that was different from anything I've ever done before. I enjoyed working there and my co-workers and customers were very nice. It was a seasonal job so it ended after summer unfortunately.
good,"A typical day working at Lowe's was high speed and intensive tightly controlled retail checkout process where I learned not only the cash registers and customer service procedures but detailed loss prevention procedures as they apply to retail cashiers who can potentially receive payment for very expensive big-ticket items. The numerous levels of management can give the place a militaristic workplace culture, which can be a good thing in such a high-dollar fast-paced retail cash handling environment. The hardest part of the job was maintaining strict attention to policy and detail while keeping up with the fast pace of the retail home improvement industry. The most enjoyable part of the job was continuous contact with the loveliest customers and coworkers in the retail home improvement industry."
good,"It was great place to work the staff was great ,their benefits was awesome and I really enjoyed my experience there.i enjoyed the public and I loved my work hours"
good,The company Lowes was a great company to work for. They treated me great and a wonderful place to have as a first job. The store manager is very helpful and our service managers were very helpful also.
good,"There is always something new at Lowe's, they are always thinking of ways to boost moral for employees. The pay isn't the best, especially for Colorado."
good,"As with any company,Lowe's was working hard to contain expenses so payroll was always tight.  Even with the modified sales floor coverage, the company was absolutely dedicated to serving customers well.  When I went to work for the company, I was a retail veteran, but I had no background in the hardware/DIY industry.  Lowe's training was exceptional.  I was able to function with confidence in every department of the store.  "
good,"Provides competitive pay and benefits. Great team culture. Advancement opportunities, good training, involved in the community. Management is well trained. Offers appropriate breaks."
good,Hreat place good people. Hard working well worked company onjoy my job very understanding company they work hard for their workers on a daily basis. A place where people help u love where u live. Would tell or recommend to a friend easly
good,"Lowes takes care of their people with great benefits, competitive pay and try to assist when they can as far as management. I would recommend this company to work for"
good,"I have been with this company over two years now. the management is nice and cares about its staff and tries to accommodate when the unexpected happens. One thing I dislike is the inability to obtain full time work if you are part time. That aside, I would highly recommend this company to all."
good,"Competitive wages, The hardest part of the job was that I would work nights one day and the very next day I would open.  With kids it was a little bit harder but they worked with me.  The discounts were great but I have heard they have done away with some of the employee discounts."
good,"I perform many different tasks, cashiering, customer service, rotating snacks, refilling drinks and picking orders from receiving. My management is great, we have an open door policy which makes it easy to talk to them about problems that may arise within the workday. Communication is not always great but we always work and get things done. It is a very safe and fun place to work, especially when you do not have much experience with retail. I really enjoy my coworkers, we all work together great. The hardest part of the job is probably being tasked for different things at the same time."
good,"This job is great for a first time job, or transitional job. I was payed three dollars more here than when I worked as a shift manager. The people are great, the management is friendly, and I had a good time working here."
good,Work is taxing on the body at times but your coworkers are very helpful. Managers willing to listen if you have a problem. Overall job was very enjoyable as far as a retail job goes.
good,"I enjoy working with customers to enjoy home improvements but most of all seeing them smile and making a difference in there life."
good,Lowe's provides it's employees options to grow and advance if one is willing to put forth the effort. If you are a good spirited and minded person you and Lowe's will accomplish great things.
good,lowes was a great company to work for and to retire from. a typical day at work was busy and each day was a learning experience. it was an enjoyable company to work for
good,"Lowes is a Good place to work, but very hot most of the time. Quick pace and odd hours sometimes. They require you to work some weekends. Must be able to stand for periods of time on concrete floor."
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Lowes was being really busy alot of the time because I enjoyed how fast we had to move and work in different departments when the needed help.
good,"As I worked at Lowes Home Improvement, I learned a variety of things. I learned to mix paint as the customers desired colors. I learned to down stock items. I learned to ring up customers in line as a cahier. I learned to locate and recommend items to customers. I learned customer sevice. I did returns and located customer orders. I learned how to run the break bored and act as head cashier at times."
good,There are a lot of great people here. I feel the store is a bit understaffed however they make up for that in hiring really good workers.There are a few communication barriers. but nothing that cant be worked out with a quick note to the next person on shift.
good,A great company to work for. Management can use some help but over all a great place. Workers there are friendly and work well together. A lot of helpful training throughout the store is always provided
good,Worked only part time and in the end result temporary so my review would be of a limited view. Fellow employees quite nice and very helpful. Management at the time at the particular store hard to find.
good,"Good company, great benefits. New corporate structure has put a strain on morale in some locations. Opportunity for advancement has  become more difficult for those wanting management positions, due to decreased number of managers at each store."
good,"Great job if you're in college. Many young recent graduates work here. It's a good place to work. A typical day consists around 8 hours, Mondays and weekends are usually the busiest days but the stress is tolerant. They have a strong human resource department, great training and orientation program for new start employees. They have a strong emphasis in delivering great customer service. The employees and the relationships you build with the people who work here are the most enjoyable part of the day. If your store does good, you will receive a quarterly bonus."
good,"Staff was like family.  Very respectful and motivating environment, which was directly connected to the management staff.  Very high success rate in relation to advancement."
good,"As sales associate stocks shelves, maintains the sales floor, and assists store patrons with exceptional customer service. As a major "
good,Lowes is a great place so I can learn to help customers and to work under a fast pace condition. I love working with the front end we all got a long very well.
good,"Well, I was only there for a month, so i don't know the company as well as I could have.  Nice place, professional with a friendly atmosphere. Simple work for nice pay (and lots of hours). My only problem was that the location that I was at was overrun with business. That made for an overly stocked, difficult to reach stock that had to be pulled. We're talking about stoves, side-by-side refrigerators, washers, dryers, and dishwashers staked 2 and 3 tall and several deep. Always the ones that were needed for delivery were the ones that were the most 'buried'. On the bright side, they used flatbed trucks with mounted forklifts for some deliveries. Pretty cool if you've never driven one. It was nice to see home owners' faces when we brought in their brand new refrigerator or stove and hauled away their busted ones. Management could do with a little prioritization of customer service. Great company if you like to satisfy customers."
good,"Working at Lowe's was a great opportunity to learn about household projects. It worked well for me considering that I was a first time homeowner. Therefore, being able to get an employee discount was a great incentive."
good,"I enjoyed working in the garden department, it was fun and you got to know the customers. WEEKENDS were always a blur because it was so busy. Half the time I didn't get my work done because when it's that busy I become a cashier. Our store did over a million dollars just in the garden department."
good,"A typical day at work consists of assisting patrons pick out paint colors for homes, offices etc. for both interior and exterior.  Afterwards I assist them in determining the type of finish.  I prepare the paint with the color mix, shake to distribute color throughout,  "
good,"I enjoyed working with the people, and running the fork lift.  It was a good job, I had to work less hours while going to college.  I assisted customers with sales, loaded items on trucks and helped with inventory."
good,"My typical  day at work includes answering phones, checking for interneter orders, assisting customers with there checking out or returning items. I file paperwork as well as helping guest apply for a credit card. I also help solve any customers issues they might have with an item."
good,Working with great people and meeting new people everyday to help them with projects. You get to really understand how much you know about home improvement.
good,"Lowe's has been a part of my life for nearly 14 years. I have rarely had a day when the ""Sunday Night Dread"" set in for going back to work. "
good,It is a nice place to work but they are not very understanding when life happens outside of work. This is one of the better companies I have worked for.
good,"Have a few complaints "
good,"I really don't have any complaints. Great Benefits, Great people, great experience and wonderful opportunities to move up in the company. What's not to like?"
good,There is usually a really strong aspect of teamwork here. They work to form a strong bod among the staff and management. Good at keeping the staff informed.
good,"Supervising Store Employees"
good,hard work but fun. get to talk to people and help them and educate them if they ask about it. have to write more cause this thing has a requirement of twenty words
good,"The job is great, currently too many non qualified employees are being promoted to Management positions. Makes work more complicated for CSA's"
good,"I've enjoyed working for Lowes, I have learned a lot over the year's including time management and how to manage employees in a fast work environment. Overall it is a great company to work for with many opportunities."
good,They trained very well 5 weeks of training and always had someone around to ask questions. I was trained in store support and claims.
good,"Lowe's help me get back into Customer Service roll.  Enjoy working with customers helping them love where they live.  A typical day at work is answering phones & assisting customers with questions regarding their install.  Also take calls from Installers to get their schedule updates and leave notes in the customers record.  Also work with management to work on issues that arrive from installs that the customer is upset about however we try to handle it first but if they want a supervisor we work with them.  Also handle complaints that come from corporate as well.  "
good,"A typical day would be tending to checking the customers out as needed when purchasing something. I would either be at the front-end, or the garden area. I learned a few things about being personable and how important it is to relate to the customer. The management was great! The most kind a relaxed outlook on the employees. The workplace culture was where everyone talked to everyone, more of a community based work culture. The hardest part of my job was sometimes not having enough to do. The most enjoyable part about this job was the people."
good,"Lowe's is a great company to work for in my opinion. The pay is good and the central production office environment is great. The only thing that did not work for me is the schedule. It is a rotating shift weekly between 1030-730 p, 9-6 p, 8-5 p and 7-4 p. The week that you work 7-4 p you also work the weekend (8-5) so you're off Monday and Tuesday but that means you work 7 days straight; no overtime. It's fast paced but not too fast and also a great chance for fast advancement.  I have small kids that needs to be picked up from after school care by 6 so you can see how this didn't work for me. Especially having to travel through rush hour west to northeast side. Not to mention having to find someone get them when I was working until 6 and 730 but also the weekends I had to work. If the schedule works for you I'd say go for it. This is definitely a place I would return to if my circumstances ever change."
good,Working at Lowes was a great experience.  I would keep working there except for their has been corporate restructuring that eliminated my job.  The work life balance is terrible. The benefits are amazing and the pay is good.
good,Job is easy. some locations are better then others. dead end job working with small minded people. most people are there either temporarily or as a last resort.
good,Lowes is all about customer service. There's room for advancement if you want to work for it. Many corporate rules to abide by. Management is supportive. Doing our own freight is difficult; this can be an 8 hour chore if the truck was large enough.
good,"All around the my managers, co-workers, and customers were great to work with. Challenges and fun environment. I enjoyed my job as a Head Cashier just wish I could have received full-time."
good,A Typical day at Lowes is you are always on the go. And what I have learned is you cant always make people happy. Management one word is awesome. Hardest part is sometimes not being able to help all customers and the ones you can is a job well done when they keep coming back to see you.
good,"Fast paced working environment. Customer service skills are a must. "
good,My co-workers and ASM's were great to work with and the atmosphere was great. I loved my job here and enjoyed meeting new people every day.
good,Lowe's Does a lot to try to be proactive and change along with the needs and trends of the industry. The offer abundant amounts of training. Lowe's as a company is focused on being fair to all employees and making sure it is there for employees as needed.
good,"The customers and employees are a blast to be around. Some managers are getting paid to do nothing besides belittle and over work employees. Recent job cuts have made it almost to much work on the employees on the sales floor. I got experience in lumber,millworks,building materials,electrical, and plumbing."
good,"Worked here for a long time, My team was my family until restructuring forced layoffs. I worked at every level in the store and was most satisfied with the position of specialist."
good,Lowes is a great place to work overall. The clientele is great to work with and some of them will even share pictures of the finished project with associates. The associates really support each other and help out where needed.
good,Very scripted work. Very picky about how you verbally relate to callers.  Seems they are more focused on how you say things to the customer than how satisfied the customer is
good,"excellent company, however poor management. Great Benefits...medical, dental, vision, 401k. After spending 20 years with Lowes, unfortunately I had to resign due to family health issues."
good,Lowes will always be one of my favorite memorable employment place that I worked at.  Management team was great as well as the associates.
good,I enjoyed working with Lowes. Had a great profit sharing and great employees. Loved the parties for employees and working at inventory time.
good,This is a very friendly place to work I actually love coming to work everyday!! The home base and community service makes me feel cozy!!.
good,took care of a variety of departments at time due to scheduling conflicts but everyone worked as a team and got thru it. if you are interested in learning multiple departments and expanding your knowledge this is a good place to work. the down fall is working the hours you have a rotating schedule with rotating weekends off.
good,"Lowes is a strong company with a great culture, growth as a company, growth for individuals to progess in career. The atmosphere has one encouraging inclusiveness, peer support, good leadership,and teamwork with peers."
good,"Project Management for remodeling kitchen and baths.  Great place to learn, definite servant leadership.  Best part of the job is being in the field to do quality control"
good,"Working for Lowe's was the best job I ever had, I've worked in all areas of the store, gained a lot of knowledge I've worked with all sorts of people in management most that liked me and would take me back any day, until I got to a store that was very competitive and challenging, I was fired the day I came back from my vacation with no real reason for firing me, I would have stayed there till I retired if they would have let me"
good,I LOVE working at Lowe's THe only thing that would make it better and perfect is more hours/full time.   The people I work with are friendly and FUN the job stress free compared to most I have held in the past.  I love talking to all the customers even the slightly grumpy ones.  I find it hard to be in a bad mood.
good,"Great company to work for- decent benefits, opportunities to grow/move throughout company. Really enjoyed my job until management change, which led to culture change, which lead to decreases in sales."
good,"would love to work here in future and it was easy, relaxing and great working environment. i learned many valuable skills and important rules. i hope to find employment in near future in similar store like LOWES."
good,"Normal day at Lowe's includes always having a smile on your face and greet every customer to make them feel welcome and invited to ask questions."
good,"Very easy and engaging job. Very friendly and loving staff. Not many challenges though, they should have a reward system for those who do good and achieve more."
good,"Everyone is willing to help you, no matter what department. If you are interested in changing departments or even helping out in another department, management will arrange for training to help you grow in the store. Breaks are spaced out nicely. Not tiring when you have a 9hr shift"
good,"Once clocked in and ready to work my responsibilities are clearly defined. My role is basically to support many different positions in the store get the results they need. I give support with customer service, during the check-out process, and maintaining the integrity of the store. I learned different skills such as inventory and safety among other skills. My co-workers are professional customer service  associates and specialists. The hardest part of of my job being everywhere I need to be when multiple people need assistance. It's still very enjoyable to help out as much as I can and get paid to do it."
good,If you enjoy customer service i recommend you to give lowe's a try. Great job to start at and gain experience with people. You learn many skills you can use in the nearby future
good,the most enjoyable part is making  every customer leave the store happy and satisfied. that is my main goal and my only goal with achieving greatness with the customer.
good,"Very High Tempo, excellent effort from all levels to accomplish common goals. High standard of execution. Positive acknowledgement of individual achievement."
good,"The management team is so focused on making sure we shave 1-2 seconds off call button response times that the miss the elephant in the room - the reason the times aren't being met. 1/3 of the employees in the Fort Mill store do next to nothing & are happy watching the rest of us work. The management team routinely asks why goals aren't being met & are told about the lack of effort from those folks - by everyone including the customers - but their response is, ""We'll look into it"". Makes you not care after a while.. Sad really."
good,Lowes has a friendly and supportive work atmosphere. The management made an effort to create a family type atmosphere for the associates. The management always treats employees with respect and consideration.
good,"Shop there and find out. In some areas, the experience there can be pleasant or not so. Better staffed would help greatly."
good,I enjoy working at Lowe's and helping others love where they live on a daily basis.  I take great pride in my work and work ethic.
good,"Every store is different. They are ran different. I have found that out."
good,"typical day at lowes is dealing with customers and front end cashiers, learned to use time management and co-workers are very easy to work with"
good,"I loved working here. It was a busy store. I helped a good group of people and everything in the store is place well enough where if you study the store, you'll know where everything's at."
good,"Total team atmosphere.  Flexible work hours. Great Benefits for FT and PT employees.  Like every retail job - nights, weekends and holidays are required."
good,Great place to advance your skills in culinary and the management was nice and very helpful in any situation. Fun and friendly co workers here with an extensive knowledge of food and business.
good,"Fue una de mis mayores experiencias laborales. Donde pude adaptarme rapidamente al proceso y sistema de la empresa. "
good,"Working with Lowe's I primarily perform monetary transactions. In addition to conducting sales transactions, I also perform other customer service duties, such as handling refunds, making returns, and filing orders for specialty products. Depending on the store location and available staff, I sometimes need to perform other jobs, such as sales, stocking, and cleaning responsibilities."
good,"I have worked for Lowe's for 5 years now. At times the environment can be amazing and at times it can be a place of total negativity. On a typical day at work, I review orders for customers who have previously purchased something in the store. Making sure that their order is scheduled to arrive on time, and communicate with the customer if there is any issues that have come up with their order. Other daily tasks include making sure merchandise is placed on the floor for the customers to easily access. The management at Lowe's is my main issue with the company. There tends to be to many voices of reason or chiefs telling you what should be accomplished. Placing the employee in a twisted environment of who to actually listen to on what tasks should be completed. I my self have gone through 5 managers in 2 years with a new store. This has also discouraged any established positive feelings within the workplace."
good,"Great culture and drive to be the best.  Disconnect can occur with management and sales-floor due to poor manager routines and lack of structure.  "
good,I come in with a smile trying to help every customer that I come in contact with. When the customers see that you're going above and beyond they'll most likely come back for your services.
good,Lowes is a fun and challenging job and the only down side is constant swing shifts. Great team atmosphere and everyone that you work with becomes an extended family.  The pay is not great and there never seems to be enough associates to help the customers.  Management is good to work with at the location I was at but that is not always true for other locations. The hardest part of the job was the swing shifts and not spending time with family.
good,"Great job with wonderful co-workers and lots of hours. Accommodating with schedule when needed."
good,Customers are usually friendly and talkative. Staff is supportive of each other which makes for a great way to learn about many areas of the company. Management is very busy and sometimes hard to get a hold of but they are hard working and supportive of their staff. The hardest part of the job has to be sheer customer volume. Even with extra staff it can be pretty overwhelming especially at customer service where you not only deal with a line of customers but must manage the phones as if they were in line and take care of internet orders. The most enjoyable happens to also be the customers. Most of them are friendly and understand that not one person knows everything about the store. You see a lot of the same people and get to know about them and their families through the projects they come to lowe's for. Not only do we help build homes we build relationships that become extended family.
good,"Our only purpose is constant customer focus, at times teaming up with coworkers to secure that aim. I learned the value of participation and cooperation in finding the balance between leading, following, and working together. Management is one cog in the wheel of the retail hierarchy, guiding the flow of optimal customer service with occasional troubleshooting. My coworkers are fun, helpful, knowledgeable, and sometimes annoying. The hardest part of the job is finding the necessary stamina for the unending plight of the retail customer. The most enjoyable part is providing a satisfactory shopping or working experience for the people I encounter during my shift."
good,A great company to work for.  My job was challenging at times but I loved it.  I loved the people that I worked with- this made going to work easy.
good,it was a fun place to work you did a bit of everything there a big place you can get lost if you don't pay attention but most of all I enjoyed every bit of it
good,"Great company to work for would highly recommend working here. Fun atmosphere, great customers, and amazing co workers"
good,"I did not get the training I asked for on material movement due to volume of work during season."
good,Over the years Lowe's has provided me with many opportunities to better myself.  Expand my knowledge and experience in many different areas.  Management at my present location is exceptional and I enjoy each day at work.
good,Typical day is going in at 7 at night and working until 5:30 am. Co-workers and management are fine.  I do my job and then go home.
good,"Lowes is a excellent Company to work for with most associates giving very good Customer Service."
good,"My management   Job has a lot of ups and downs that gave me  a place that you can learn and grow and has given me a place that I can achieve all the things that I have enjoyed in my life,"
good,"I had a great time working for Lowe's. There are always things that could be better, but overall it is a great job. Lots of room to grow."
good,I got my first opportunity with Lowe's. I learned what it meant to really be a team player. The management really took out the time to teach the employees how to properly complete tasks.
good,"Lowe's Home Improvement has been a good company toward for , last 22 years. Would recommend it. I enjoy being able to develop"
good,"No team work on the floor and alot of stress, management too buysy being off the floor in meetings. When in meetings there would be almost no coverage on the floor. So customer service would suffer because of this."
good,I would stock shelves with inbound stock. I did inventory on a daily basis. Assisted customers with the home improvement needs. ordered special order items customers wanted.
good,"- Process credit card applications and online orders"
good,"Working at Lowes has given me a new skill in assembling, grills, picnic tables, log splitters, lawn mowers, etc, great staff, I also have gone on delivery, fun, very demanding."
good,"as a head cashier I over saw all front end operations, while helping department manager with weekly and monthly reports. handle all customer service issues and work quickly to resolve. I learned how to multitask and adapt to learning many different departments and types of people. management overall was good, however it often felt communication was a major issue especially when major issue would develop little or no action would occur nor would it be kept confidential the hardest part of my job was learning to handle and manage all the different personalities of the people you work with. my most enjoyable part of my job was my co workers and the customers I was able to develop relationships with and build trust to allow them to feel comfortable in returning to the store."
good,Lowe's has great benefits for employees. the management need work but overall it was a good place to work. too much drama with management.
good,"A typical day at work entailed building loads for customers, stocking the lumber department, assisting customers with their needs, and going out on deliveries when necessary. My management here was very knowledgeable, and always willing to give you hand. My co-workers were reliable for the most part. The hardest part of the job was when you had multiple loads to build, but they always got done. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with your hands."
good,this job in a fun place to work at you get to meet different people everyday and different cultures also its a fast pace and learn to multitask.
good,Extremely organized and showed appreciation for all workers. I loved this job there are opportunities for advancement I was just not there at a time those demands where needed.
good,"Fun and outgoing work place with understanding management, who support skills and qualifications built on customer service, attention to detail and general math skills!"
good,I like working at Lowe's. I like it there so much i would go back to any Lowe's store in the New York location. I was a unload associate i had to unload the packages an products off the trucks an during the work the i had to put the packages an products in the aisles
good,Fun work place great co-worker. Nice to help customer with purchase . Good management team. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping my customer.
good,"Lowe's is a great place to work, my co-workers are awesome! They make sure you are trained well. The only problem I have is getting enough hours."
good,Lowes is a great place to work. It is defiantly a position that can put into bettering jobs. It is a great job to work on customer service skills.
good,"If you already have a degree or feel like devoting you efforts to Lowe's as a career then this is a great company. If you are working on a degree then this is not the place. They will not work with your schedule. They require open availability to pursue a Full-Time position. If you work Part-Time then they will cut your hours first depending on the sales. During the winter it can be as if you are unemployed. In other words, devote your life to the company to receive full company support."
good,"Progress is made by transferring own skills to others in the form of Biblical studies, personal counselling, accounting and taxation laws and processes, living an ethical lifestyle based on Biblical standards,"
good,great people room for advancement. The only reason I left was for a chance at more money. The only down fall was not getting help on installing 400 pound refrigerators and those 200 hundred pound front load washing machines at apartments with stares.
good,"i miss the people, management, free lunches, very nice place to work at, pay is great! great company to work for lots of opportunities to advance in the company."
good,very good for a part time job. worked here while in college the pay way better than average and wayyy over min wage they were also flexible  when it came to my class schedule and needing time off.
good,"Arrive to work around 5:30, begin downstocking to fill shelves until 8 when we have our morning meeting. Then we go through our outs reports until 10, then we assist customers the rest of the day."
good,"Great working atmosphere,room to grow in the industry,great co- workers.Fair salary,great location with a beautiful view of the water. Overall it's a great company to work for.."
good,Lowe's provides a safe and comfortable working environment that I believe most people can succeed in.  Their culture and employee compensation/benefits make them a quality employer for any employee.
good,"Primary concern was customer service.  I stocked shelves, made keys, doing a safety inspection each morning."
good,"I am very happy at lowes, Great boss, great people. just looking for a great opportunity closer to home.  Been with Lowes for 3 years, I have one of the best bosses I have worked with. Very different place then my previous employer and learned a lot of new aspects of Retail."
good,The environment I was within was not always positive. I left due to the negative impact it was having on my self worth and home life. During my first year of full time employment my health deteriorated due to trying to please so many different management ideals and the use of chemicals without proper PPE. Unsafe practices were overlooked and expected to keep less workload for management at my store.
good,"My everyday tasks are typically routine. I make sure all sales are displayed and all expired signs for sales are taken down. I am required to complete minimum 250 price changes throughout the entire store. I have learned patience and exceptional customer service. I have also learned how to read product information including upc barcodes and model number. I have also increased my product knowledge. I help out the front end associates, which are the cashiers, when their short on coverage. The management team is very supportive and understanding. My co-workers are helpful and goal driven. They do whatever it takes to make sure the customer  gets the product. They also take the time to train each other on each department. The hardest part of my job is when other tasks are added on to work load and I am pulled to another area to help out because there is nobody else in. My work then carries over to the next day. Double the work, still no coverage. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I am my own leader. I make sure all my work is done correctly and efficiently. I take pride in what I do"
good,You get what you put into it. The only negative thing is that their are times where it seems like all they care about is the money besides customer/employee benefits.
good,Excellent about working with a student schedule. Fun to interact with customers and co-workers were like a large family.
good,"Great place to work with the public, to share my skills and knowledge"
good,Work hard and learn. Great co-workers and Managers. Very flexible. Hardest part of job is finding time in a hectic schedule to complete all tasks.
good,Very productive work place love the overall company great customer service.Could'nt will always have an great job summary for the work history for lowes.
good,"Setting appointments for reps to go out to try sell our products and set in system, helped supervisor with daily leads for the reps for the next morning"
good,"it was a very busy place to work,i had good and helpful coworkers that always help when you needed them. the hardest part of the job was standing on your feet"
good,The company relocated.  I worked in traffic control.  I would print pick tickets for the warehouse crew to complete order shipments for stores.  Contacted trucking company for load hauling.  General secretarial duties.
good,"I loved working for Lowes, The pay was good and the job was easy. If personal issues had not occurred then I would still be there."
good,"A typical day starts off with a walk threw the work space and then the doors open up and the fun begins. Working to give all the customers a great shopping experience. Working at Lowes I have learned to better my skills with the fact of talking to people and time management. I have worked with all types of personalities, so working with other staff members has given me more skills to be able to understand more in depth what makes people do what they do. This has been the hardest thing to do and remember that I am no longer in the military and in charge. This has given me the ability to start over. The most enjoyable thing about what I do is seeing the smile and appreciation I see on my customers face when they check out."
good,Excellent environment. Awesome management. Crazy schedules though. Cant plan your life with this job. Only part time positions available unless your a manager but unstable hours and schedule.
good,"learned how to make keys, measure windows and doors, met a lot of great people, mixed paint, management has a lot to be desired, the hardest part of the job is being on my feet all day on the cement floor"
good,"I loved this job but I needed something new. I worked with great people, the company was good but management didn't have a real clue"
good,overall experience was a good one. great co-workers and awesome management. great work experience. enjoyed my job as a customer service rep. at Lowes.
good,"Always had an assignment to do, there was always work to be done, which was enjoyable. There where plenty of nice people there, but the managers always seem to fall into the same groove as all the others before them. They where gods among men. That was their demeanor. Thats retail for you though.."
good,productive and fun workplace. Fast work pace lots of customers everyday great co wokers lots of schedule flexability. I would always like to work at lowes again.
good,My experience so far with Lowe's has been pretty good. The overall environment of the store is great from the CSA to the management team. The best part of my position is working with the customers and my fellow CSAs and the management team.
good,"Lowe's is a reputable home improvement store.  They offer good pay and benefits. They provided a comfortable work atmosphere and excellent training, as well."
good,"Lowes is a fun and safe environment. Very nice and friendly people there. Management is easy going. I absolutely love working with my co-workers, we work as a team! nothing is too hard. I most enjoy my regular customers and meeting new ones. I also enjoy solving problems."
good,"Never a dull moment very enjoyable! Learned how to work with all types of personalities and enjoyed talking to vendors and customers"
good,"Every day is ""A day of learning"""
good,Worked with closely with customers looking to finish a project. Learned alot of gardening and plumbing. The staff was always turning over due to college students moving on but great to work with.
good,"Best job I've ever had, wish I stayed. Management was awesome, dealt with a few cranky customers but lowes does everything they can to make them happy."
good,"I have learned much from my time at this job. Such as how to drive/operate many new types of forklifts and/or order pickers. also,how to install many washers,dryers,refrigerators,etc."
good,There are a lot of people who go through there and a lot of them can be rude or even mean but all you have to do is stay patient and be honest with the customer.
good,"Customer service is a huge priority at Lowe's, and it is all given with a smile."
good,Great people to work with. Fast-paced environment. Considered a business partner.
good,"Lowe's makes a solid effort to get in touch with the employees and offers programs to help them lead healthy, productive lives. The only short-coming in this effort is that the part-time associates often are given minimum hours outside of short spring season to help keep the profit line up."
good,My over all experience was great and I learned plenty valuable lessons.
good,"As a Seasonal/now part time cashier my day typically involves standing at a register processing sales for customers. I also get the opportunity to assist customers in finding where items are located in the store. The managers  are highly supportive and enthusiastic about helping employees advance themselves within the company. My coworkers are friendly and helpful when needed, like a store family. I find the hardest part of this job to be the position itself, I am sort of restricted to the general area of the cash register. This  makes it  difficult to assist in other areas of the business/customer service or learn new skills. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the customer and hearing about the projects they are working on and trying to assist them in getting the right materials to complete their task."
good,"I LOVED working for this company. I worked there 8 years and 3 months. I would have never left except we got a new store manager that turned out to be horrific! So bad, that corporate had to come in multiple times to talk with her. Customers stopped shopping at our location and would drive 30 minutes away to the next closest store. Other than her, I would love to still be working there. I left the sinking ship. But the company itself really provides excellent pay and benefits."
good,"fun great atmosphere, learn how to deal with people & customers on daily basis,"
good,"Lowe's overall is a good company.  However, when you work in the store you have to be prepared for all the childish games that take place.  It's just like high school, once someone doesn't like you or what you do they will stop at nothing in making your life miserable.  That goes for management too.  Also, just know that if someone does come after you and they are 1) in a higher position and 2) have been there longer than you, you will lose so start looking into transferring into another store.  I didn't and was fired.  But the benefits at Lowe's are awesome and so is their appreciation for employees."
good,"Lowes was a great place to work. I enjoyed the customers and the people. I left Lowes only to get closer to home. If a Lowes was in my town or closer were I didn't have to drive an hour and 20 min. I would still be working there. Loved, Loved my job."
good,"walking the store each morning to scan any out of product,Generate a report for each department."
good,"I enjoyed this job the most out of all the jobs Ive had.  This is a fun place to work, and the management team is excellent."
good,I loved my job but at times it could be very demanding and stressful. I loved all my co-workers and enjoyed working with all of them on a daily basis. The most stressful thing about the job was when we didn't always have enough coverage for the store. The greatest thing about my job was that I got along with everyone and they became more like family than co-workers. I miss them everyday!
good,"530 am to 230 pm, ensure loads are ready for delivery and load them and out by 7 am to 730 am"
good,"Being a flooring installer was a great job. It lead to meeting new people, networking myself and my name as an installer threw my good work and friendly attitude towards the customer. I started pursuing a carreer in Computer Science to preserve myself for later years."
good,Dont really have anything to say about it. Decent work. Honest pay but wanted more working experience.
good,I worked as a cashier and also did customer service and return desk every one there was great loved everybody I worked with plus management was a fun job talking to new people and getting to know the regular ones.
good,It was nice to have good co-workers and a nice air of stability.
good,Great learning different areas in a huge store. The one thing that was different was the changing of management all the time. It was a great experience.
good,There is always something to do while at work. No shift is ever boring!
good,"I really did love working at Lowe's for most of the time I was there but there came a time when I noticed a lot of things were going on that were unfair. There was a total lack of communication among upper management, and it affected the entire store. I may go back someday once enough time has passed so that a new set of management is running the store and things are as they should be."
good,"I have dealt with daily business, scheduling of associates, counting of money and banking, HR services, LP processes, Head Cashier responsibilities, Inventory Processes, any and all office processes, computer... Etc. as I was in Admin. I also tracked daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly budget number and created spreadsheets using Excel. I also have vast knowledge in Receiving and RTM process.

I'm also responsible for tracking product from the time it is ordered til the time it reaches the customers hands. Also dealing with manufactures with defective and damaged product to get credit also. As a sales specialist I tracked daily budgets and monthly sales numbers for myself and other associates. Also set goals for the other specialists. Training of new associates in the store and continued training that i brought back from the manufactures. Also had to be able to multi-task covering multi departments. Also worked in HR areas with scheduling with the program called kronos and have had experience with people soft."
good,A good place to work. Busy and fast paced.I learned how to communicate with people. Hardest part of the job are the scheduling system. Best part of the job is helping others and making them feel happy with the outcome.
good,Never a dull moment. A constant changing enviroment which I enjoy.
good,"Great place i love working their they were really understand i enjoyed working with customer> A typical day at work would be helping customer with their purchases and making sure the parking lost was clean>the hardest part of my job is working in the rain. "
good,"Cleaning the service counter daily,keeping fresh product out for the customer,doing inventory to keep from running out."
good,A typical day at work will be a full day in most instances where you will become well rounded with dealing with various customer issues and satisfying them.You will have the opportunity to work with and assist various types of people and grow from it.As you learn from various leaders in the store with a wide range of knowledge and skills you also will sharpen yours to be a success.
good,Helping customers and providing excellent service. I have learned how to work around a great group of people. Management is very helpful and the coworkers are very nice.
good,Everyone there learns to be like family. Customers are tough on the employees but we know how to stick together and get things done.
good,This job a very interning job. Just looking for a another challenge
good,"Great co-workers and the chance to learn new things constantly. Management overall was good, but as always some positions need to be looked at. Not a whole lot of room to advance but overall environment was good."
good,Things get done on time and in a timely manner. All the employees are very friendly and helpful.
good,"Daily routine consists of answering the phone for 8hrs and troubleshooting IT issues at the stores, either with store employees or with Lowe's technicians.  10minutes to resolve and fix the technical issue.  Answered over 400 calls a day with 100% resolution which consisted of configuring ports, switches, rebuilding flat files for servers and rebooting registers.  Additionally, programmed IPhones and IPads for stores."
good,I work for lowes part-time and I'm very impressed by all the benefits awarded to part-timers and the competitive wage is a plus
good,I love when customers are gracious and courteous. I enjoy helping customers find the products they need to complete their tasks. I enjoy learning about the various projects they are doing.
good,This is a great place to work. Everyone is eager to do a good job and management makes sure that it's employees are taken care of.
good,A good place to work with very knowledgeable associates with a focus on great customer service. The work schedule is very erratic and compensation for experience and knowledge pertaining to your particular department is less than it should be. The benefit package is good as are some of the employee incentives and monetary rewards.  Advancement is competitive given the limited number of internal openings in the store during the year.
good,Started as a cashier in 2002 and now I'm a Dept. Manager . I received many skills over the last 12 years with Lowe's.
good,"Lowes was a great place to work, it was fun and challenging people for the most part were great. Management though had there issues, they had there little Clicks and if you were not in that Click it was hard for people to advance."
good,Love working for  Lowe's. The hardest part about the job is the  favoritism. The best part of my job is working with the public. My co-workers are the best!
good,"Helped customers in Plumbing Debt. Stocked Shelves, Operated Fork Lift."
good,overall every aspect of this company is wonderful would recommend working here except as part time employee job security and avail hours given are lacking  and leave wanting of steady hours .
good,First point of contact answering calls and e-mails with data entry within system. Being detailed and accurate in job assigned. Involved in mentoring new hires. Always being open and available for new challenging work enviroment.  Utilize communication skills and customer service background in an exciting.

good,High paced service for Customers and an excellent group of people to work with.
good,"Management isn't encouraging, but very diligent with keeping up with the work done. I learned how to promote sales using our IMPACT model, and I was trained on a register. The job is very demanding and I was eager to step up to the challenge. I had to use concentration, patience and diligence in order to water up to ten thousand plants daily."
good,"i liked this job i learned how to unload, receive and stock the product on all different departments ,everybody was nice from management to co_workers costumers too it was like a happy place but i had to quit cuz i was not making enough money to survive to little hours ."

good,I enjoy my working experience at Lowe's Home Improvement. I interacted with many interesting customer and my manager 's are courteous and very passionate.
good,"I first started working with this company I was working in the window and paint department. In the window department I learned how to up sale, do special sales by using a computer, cutting blinds, stocking, cleaning and helped customers when needed. In the paint department I mixed paint, stocked, cleaned, and helped customers when needed. Before I left Lowe's I moved to the front end where I was a cashier I learned how to do returns, stock, cleaned, helped customers and even ran the cash register."
good,"Lowes is a great place to work with down to earth people. The benefits are good, for retail."
good,"great managers, and the open door policy allows you to always feel as though you can speak your mind without thinking you are disturbing your manager during the day. "
good,Typical day would be to down stock and make sure all the shelves are full. Also to provide customers with information about product and help them pick the best product for there needs. I learned so much about different products and to drive a fork lift. Best part of the day was seeing how grateful customers were for you helping them
good,"I found Lowe's to be a great place to work. "
good,"I love the work atmosphere, I love multi-tasking, I love working with my boss and co-workers."
good,"typical day is full of downstocking or topstocking product filled wth short bursts of customers."
good,"I would come in and start up my computer, check the voicemails, get the appointment log for the day count out the drawer make coffee make sure rooms were ready  for the day greet customers as they came in. I learned so much at this job, possible if you just put your mind to it."
good,Long days at work. Learned to be patient and help customers the best way you can. Management was unorganized. Pay was ok.
good,"good job love working with the customers, managers were pretty good at there job seem to care alot about the employe's."
good,"This is a good job but can be stressful if you let it. The people are good, but management can lack communication."
good,I enjoyed the flexible schedule and pay rate. Easy to get along with management.  Downside not many Team Players wanting to work together made job more difficult.
good,I learned several things involving home improvement from electrical to gardening. A typical work day includes working various departments as needed and being able to help customers as quickly and efficiently as possible. The hardest part of the job was to work customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help and meet new people.
good,Hard work but it was a good balance between work and family time.
good,coworkers nice  enjoyed my job wanted full time status they changed the hours from 9PM to 5AM got a chance for a day took it 
good,"A day at work. Opening the store I have to get the opening paper work, walk thur the dep and make sure the place is ready for opening if anything need to be done or pulled down or cleaned up we do it. Helping someone with what they are working on, finding everything they need to do there job. Making they are happy with there help and got all the right info they need and make sure you ask them to come back. We get our help come in about 10am and that's when we get a lot of our work done b/c we have help and hardest thing we get done b/c we have our co-worker. We enjoy having our lunching at work were all of us can talk and seat back and enjoy life."
good,"My typical day starts with printing out a build list of all customer orders entered into the system, then determining if the items are in stock or not, and when they will be going out for delivery or picked up, and also checking levels of assembled items throughout the store including checking with certain departments to see if they need any displays assembled. My shift varies from 8-10 hour days on the weekends to 5-6 hour days during the week. I personally enjoy the ability to perform customer service functions in a different capacity and how I am able to build items that become part of long lasting family memories for customers and their families. Management is also very flexible and great to work for, if I need time off, or want to stay a little later to get ahead on store stock items or another project I have never once been met with opposition. The only downside is that there is no way at all to advance being in this position."
good,"what i've learned from lowe's is that working with different workers and customers everyday made me more of a peoples person and learned things about outdoors meaning learning about plants,mulch,soil etc....management was great,my co-workers was the best i ever worked with,the hardest part of the job was nothing learned things pretty quick, and the most enjoyable part of the job was trying something different "
good,Helped customers whenever needed. Basically roamed areas and straightened up whatever needed to be straightened.  Everything else was great.

I enjoyed my time with the company and felt that I was treated fairly. It was a fun atmosphere with good bosses and good people, even though there were those that chose to make the work place a difficult place to be."
good,Worked in a variety of departments and built my skills as a customer service associate.
good,Productive and working with the public. Learing about plants and landscaping.
good,This position can be very rewarded especially when training employees on how to identify theft and when the employee uses the knowledge provided to identify items of theft they are rewarded.
good,I like the work that I do and enjoy working with the public.
good,"Work began early, around 5:30 am. During a day, I would help to unload any box or flatbed trucks. I was required to be proficient on all power equipment, and I never had a safety violation. Customer service was the number one requirement and we were all responsible for driving sales by providing everything our customers needed for a project with exceptional customer service. I also read reports regarding sales in the department, worked to plan sales budgets for my associates, and ordered any product that was needed according to sales forecasts. I merchandised the store shelves according to corporate planning. I provided customer service from my ability to perform cashiering, to special ordering/pulling and loading appliances and any other home improvement products. I was able to perform these functions with minimal assistance through any department in the store. I was also well-versed in receiving and installed sales procedures, and was required to assist in any way should the need arise. At any time a senior manager needed, I would also provide any assistance necessary to them. I was always eager to learn a new process! I learned to be proficient in any and all new computer programs and was responsible for training the associates in the store. I was part of every inventory in the store for a total of 14 inventories."
good,Greeted by everyone as I come in to work. Clocked in at any number of locations. Assisted customers in differing ways depending on the department I was working.
good,"This was my first job working in retail, and the experience was great. The head cashiers, supervisors, and managers were extremely friendly and helpful. I was delighted to work with retail customers and serve and meet their needs. The hardest part of the job was learning where all the products were located, being that it is such a big store with lots to offer. However, the most enjoyable part of the job was the knowledge I gained, as well as working in a different enviornment with different types of customers."
good,Fun place to work management was fun to work with and everyone had the opportunity for advancement
good,i enjoy working there there was good people work with and fun to joke around with
good,One of my favorite places to work
good,It was informative and helpful if you're into home improvement.I loved the enviroment and coworkers. They were very helpful.
good,Clean and stocked area.
good,loaded truck delivered product and returned old appliances to store
good,"A typical work day consisted of working as a team and assisting customers with their needs. I learned many leardership, time management, and organization skills. My co-workers for the most part were hard working and gave the company their best effort. The hardest part of the job is dealing with disgruntled customers who were disrespectful but the most enjoyable part were the customers who tell you that you really helped them and made their life/project easier."
good,During the day I help customers pick the right product for their project needs and mix paint using computer based system. Management is always accessible and willing to help with any questions I might have. I enjoy the personal contact with customers and co-workers.
good,"As soon as I clock in I am helping customers with their home projects, whether its mixing paint or walking them to products needed I do so with a smile and positive attitude. I also conduct special orders in the home decor dept. and top freight on freight days. I do inventory and price auditing with a R/F scanner, label and relable bins. The most enjoyable part is that im in an air conditioned building and am free to rome around and help in other departments where I learn more about other jobs and products."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of helping costumers, I learned tons about the home improvement process, and my managers as well as my co-workers were extremely pleasant"

good,Always learning something new everyday. The most enjoyable part of the day is meeting new people and hearing about their projects!
good,Very fun to work for! Management can be a little firm and bully-like. Very accomadating for college schedules!
good,I love working at Lowe's but I'm not make a lot of money
