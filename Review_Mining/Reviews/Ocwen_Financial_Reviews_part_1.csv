rating,review
bad,"All about making money. Zero culture,  zero work life balance, always off shoring and laying off employees. Think if the movie office space. Ocwen is a joke."
bad,"Seeing as I'm still employed with this company, I will give you a prediction of what I've seen in the last two weeks. The trainer is horrible. And the training was for maybe 1 hour a day. After that we were at our desk, reading a book all day or watching videos for a week and a half. This place is a dead-end job. it's one of those jobs you don't care about your life... you just want a paycheck and the people around you think the same. I'm still in training and I can see how overworked and worn out these people are. Please stay from this place if you can.. the only upside is you will be able to pay your bills at the bare minimum.. but you will dread wasting your gas or uber money to come here. Save yourself the headache."
bad,This company does not exist as it took over AHMSI later called Homeward Residential Services for a small stint to get their work completed and then they vanished.
bad,This place was very unprofessional and do not care about their employees. Too much hypocrisy and favoritism going on. I would definitely never recommend this place to anyone! Apply at your own risk!
bad,"Horrible benefits, long work days, low salary, large staff in India that do not understand English, cheap and low grade computer systems, bad management,."
bad,"India calls the shots, even for the few USA based personnel.  Rules are totally different for them vs US.  Board has no clue how to manage direction.  Lifes too short for the degree of dysfunction in a work place you will experience every minute of every day there."
bad,"Workplace culture is awful. Management is horrible they yelled constantly, mostly due to the pressure from upper management. The hardest part of the job was watching HR come down Thursday afternoons and tap someone on the shoulder and you never saw them again."
bad,Would never work for this company.  My manager was only money driven and was fired due to he beat up an employee at a company picnic and broke the employees jaw. Big lawsuit and they did everything to keep the guy until the company was sued and then fired him when they lost the suit.
bad,they did not help with future employment just a number as long as you are making money for them they are happy once the contract ends so does their interest.
bad,tenure was small because employees are expected to work without proper training which is difficult. pay wise it is good. subsidized lunch and snacks available.
bad,"no future, positions were eliminated due to  lack of funds and multiple lawsuits drove company to having to eliminate positions. Notice was to short with no time to find other place of employment."
bad,Ocwen is being sued not only by the CFPB but by multiple states. There are round after round of layoffs. Stressful environment. Management has NO idea how to save the business as law suits keep rushing in. Management doesn't communicate and employees run around trying to put band-aids on the hemorrhaging business with no success. Truly the WORST place I have ever worked.
bad,"I would not recommend anyone work for Ocwen, they are a bad company with a bad culture that doesn't empower its employees. All the company cares about is making money and has been caught on multiple occasions for fraudulent activities with their customers."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this employer. This is a production driven environment however there is no work to be productive. Management is not helpful nor knowledgeable.
bad,"Would not recommend this place to anyone. Strenuous hostile environment, the training is a joke, and there is also a lack of help from management. You are not encourage to ask question to ensure accuracy you are to try find answers while customers are waiting and upset."
bad,Really busy with retention loans business. Really expanded my knowledge of real state. There was no limit and was able to grow fast. Due to the industry bubble was let go after 2 years of working the hardest..
bad,"The company is good and growing but can't trust it as anytime anything can happen. .I had worked with ocwen for 2.5 years as an human resources and had woeked for many different processes. .But the HR operations team is the worst, specially Mr Munish Goyal and Usha K who are the managers, human resources at ocwen. .so guys so not trust the HR dept and you all very well know that where the HR is like this how should the company be..in starting you all will think it is a good company but in sometime you will come yo know about it...Do not go with it"
bad,"I dont understand how the overall ratings for this company are showing over 3 stars. I KNOW this is not accurate, and anybody desiring to rate this company has had obvious daily encounters with that environment like the rest of us. People only stay there because their is no other option for income."
bad,"This company does not set an example for Corporate work culture, it is a BPO. All you can expect is low skilled laborers outsourced by US to India."
bad,"the absolute worst company to work for; A*** Retentive company who micro-manages their employees on a daily basis."
bad,Upper management does not keep their word. They will tell you what sounds good to get what they want but never returns the favor.
bad,A typical day at work was assisting customers with their mortgage issues. I learned that not everyone can be helped and for those that can to make sure that I'm doing the very best to aid them in this troublesome time.
bad,Nothing is done correctly any longer. There is no communication and a large push to move jobs overseas.
bad,"You are timed while you are in the bathroom and every time you walk away from your desk. Ever since Ocwen bought out GMAC, the company has gone down hill. Last year, they had massive layoffs and shipped all the jobs to India. There were rumors that this was not going to happen but it did anyway"
bad,"Coordinate with Servicer, Brokers, Real Estate Agents, County Clerk Offices in 34 states, and VA Regional Counsels. "
bad,Terrible company that does not care about employees AT ALL.
bad,"Atmosphere is like a sweat shop. If you aren't an -$$ kisser, you won't be there very long. No respect towards employees, I was let go for wearing a skirt a manager thought too short. Co-workers were great. Not much applicable training. Outsourced many jobs to India. Lots of people laid off/instability. When you came to work, you never knew who would be let go. They would come up behind you and tap you on the shoulder. They'd have security escort you out and make you wait for someone else to clean out your desk. The most humiliating experience I'd ever had: ANYWHERE! I have over 20 years Real Estate/Mortgage experience so I know how things are supposed to be run. Heard corruption is rampant at the top executive levels (just heresay)"
bad,The Corporate training team is a horrendous place to work with. Especially the management plays heavy politics and shows favoritism. Ideas are never accepted and if one can stand for what is right they are easily thrown out. My biggest career blunder was accepting the offer from Ocwen.
bad,"Run away as fast as you can.  This employer feels more like a prison than anything else.  Management is terrible with no improvement in sight.  Terrible work environment, threatening atmosphere with management.  Extremely hostile."
bad,The company does not care about its employees or customers. Everyday is a stressful day. Training is minimal and ineffective for company goals to achieve effective customer service.
bad,"Management is what makes the company poor for me and you will never get a raise. This company is also very stressful, If you  decide to work there don't plan to grow."
bad,"Though I appreciate the opportunity, this was probably one of yr most stressful companies to work for. It is difficult to be heard & make changes for the best within processes."
bad,"This company is based off of nepotism. It's all about who you know not what you know. Advancement doesn't happen unless you are a part of the ""in crowd"" even if you are the best employee with no complaints."
bad,"Worst. Hire and Fire Policy. Bad Management. Company is going to bankrupt very soon. Request you all guys donot join this company. Upper management not sure about their decisions, they always change their decisions."
bad,"I have spent 3 years I Ocwen. Through all this time, Ocwen provided an excellent learning opportunity through a very hands on approach."
bad,"Typical day at work is getting prepared to take 1-200 calls everyday and being constantly yelled at by customers."
bad,"Ocwen's management wasn't concerned with a good working environment.  There were many people moving into the stat so they didn't feel the need to treat employees well.  Overworked and a pressured environment.  Poor, untrained managers and long hours."
bad,"Unfortunately I have nothing good to say about this company.  They take people who are intelligent, diligent in their jobs and take pride in their work and beat them down until they have no confidence left in themselves.  Once they have accomplished that they walk the beat down person out the door."
bad,"Ocwen is one of those companies, where politics are in full effect. Ocwen has had multiple law suits filed against them, by several states in the billions. They are there to help the customers, however they never do help the customer's. When a request is made, it must be filed under research, however the research can take up to 15 business days. They always try to refer you to the website, but the website doesn't work either. All of the managers are leaving, and moving on to better places."
bad,"This is the worst company I've ever worked for.  They have an 'F' rating with the BBB.  They bought and own the loans they service, know they don't have to treat the customers well and don't.  Callers wait 1/2 an hour online before reaching anyone.  And then, they proably don't know what they're talking about.  Training was minimal at best.  If you have to ask a supervisor for info, they give you attitude.  They place unreasonable expectations on their employees, telling them they have to meet a 95% average score on their call quality monitoring, as well as acheiving a certain number of calls per hour and credits per hour (transaction postings from customers, which are out of rep's control) in order to acheive a monthly bonus; but, nit-pick you for not following their Indian-dictated scripts in order not to have to pay you any bonus for the month.  They lied to me, said I'd be helping distressed homeowners stay in their homes.  Turns out, I can't work out any payment plans for them, because the previous employees supposedly misused that privelege, they say signing up homeowners on payment plans when they really didn't need them in order to get a bonus, so they took that opportunity away from them, giving it only to their 'Relationship Managers,' who, by the way, don't take incoming calls, will only call out on pre-set appointments; and, many times don't even make the calls but memo that they did.  All day long I take calls from frustrated homeowners who can't even get confirmation that their faxes are received.  Payoff quotes are deliberately not sent or delayed so OCWEN can"
bad,pathetic company to work with. hired me to train people but the moment the process went away they asked me to quit.
bad,Terrible culture. The sheer size of this company makes it impossible to be about the customer. They cut corners and offshore any and every department that they possibly can.
bad,"The salary is not in line with other mortgage companies.  No training yet the expectations are extreme.  Management is not involved.  You can exceed at your job and they only want more from you.  They only point out the negatives, never the positives.  Everyone is out for themselves - not a team environment."
bad,This place is the worse. Management are all crooks. They are constantly in trouble with the Government and are constantly being sued. This place is a disaster
bad,They don't care how hard you work or how big of an impact you truly have with the company. As soon as they can they'll ship your job to India! Don't bother wasting time submitting an application. They're corrupt!!!
bad,This place is a fake. Management is based on relationship. Interpersonal intimate relation. Ships going on. Actively promoting racist unethical behavior. HR does nothing to help. They violate labor employment and EEO laws on a daily basis and they are getting away with it...
bad,Co-workers were great and so were most of the supervisors.  The pay & bonus in customer service were good  as long as you read off a script as you are not able to have a normal discussion with customers regarding there mortgage loan.
bad,I have been employed there for 6 years and this company is a sinking ship.  Management is clueless and the CEO approved of illegal and unethical activities to make the company short term profits.
bad,"- Frequent Layoffs"
bad,"Not worker friendly"
bad,"One of the worst places to work for. Management is self centred and does not care about the welfare of employees. Employees have to put in extended hours of work most of the days without additional pay. "
bad,"I worked in the Houston office. The management there is a joke. The Sr. Manager is clueless and has very little industry experience. She is barely qualified to be an analyst at a large servicing shop, yet upper management continues to let her drive that office into the ground. The turnover there is very high and they are constantly trying to hire."
bad,"The Houston office is very poorly managed. They call it a ""commercial real estate"" group but it is not. They are quickly turning the place into a call center. No experienced commercial real estate professionals should entertain working here. The Sr. Manager is a joke. The culture and morale in the office is horrible and she is the major reason why. Most of the staff in the office is great. Not a lot of experienced staff, but most try to do their best. The base pay isn't bad, but the Sr. Manager routinely changes the bonus structure so you never know what you are getting or the criteria you need to meet. There is no management training at any level. Not sure how someone so incapable has been allowed to remain in their position but she has. It is also a direct reflection of the incompetence of the upper level management as well. Ocwen's business practices have come under fire for good reason. Management continues to ignore the reasons why issues exist even when viable solutions are presented. Most operations are outsourced to India and it makes it impossible to do your job. DO NOT GO WORK HERE!!"
bad,"Manage Escrow area within Customer Operations.  Set strategic direction for 74 FTE including in house and off shore.  Responsible for Escrow Operations Technology Team; business analysts responsible for developing enhancements, managing test environments and implementation of process improvements.  Manage compliance of Investor, Federal and State Regulatory Requirements."
bad,"I was laid off, I was home for 3 months until my end date which was 7/1/2013"
bad,"A great way to meet other intelligent individuals from many backgrounds and cultures. However, the company was unstructured with no HR prescence on location."
bad,"The team leader was no leader at all!  He was extremely unprofessional, making vulgar jokes and speaking about our customers in an inappropriate way.  When asked for help he would tell you ""Google it!""  He had no interest in teaching us things to expand our knowledge of IT and make us better employees, and did not delegate enough work, nor did he even know how to for that matter.  He was rude, arrogant and condescending.  There was absolutely no structure.  We were told to ""walk the floors and see if anyone needs help.""  Probably b/c we didn't even have a help desk ticketing system to utilize.  It was a depressing atmosphere but luckily I met a couple good people that I worked with!"
bad,Don’t value their employees. Need to do a better job with their background company and their HR department. Job security is non existent as everyone is walking on egg shells.
bad,"She didn't really care about the team, and had a poor attitude if you needed to ask her for any assistance. She also lied, when I was preparing to go to a new job she stated I should submit my resignation and she'd let me work out the pay period, which an hour after sending it to her I was walked out."
bad,One of the worst places I've worked. The culture was terrible and management did not make it better. Managers did not care about their staff or how the work was done only the number.
bad,Lacks respect for employees and lacks integrity in the business environment. Extremely poor communication. Senior management are bullies who use threats to intimidate employees Do not care about investor regulations or borrower's accounts.
bad,"New People have started worked in our team.  You would think they would have a quick pow wow to introduce them and welcome them to our company and show them at least the rest rooms and vending machines-NOT.  Its goes how unprofessional the management is. And management is cut throat as they come, reading our emails, timing bath room breaks.  We are all adults .Don't know where they get these managers from, but in any case they are fired or leave shortly thereafter (GOD) decides."
bad,"Most jobs are/were outsourced to India.  Those that still remain, I'm assuming are management.  Employees are little more than livestock.  The operation in Orlando, I believe, is closed and has been for some time."
bad,"Management was not good,"
bad,"Bad senior management purely work on favoritism."
bad,"Ocwen is a terrible company to work for.  They pay well, but that is only because they HAVE to.  They are working desperately to improve their culture due to the fact that their turnover rate is so high, but it's not enough.  They pay well, but they work their people to death and do not staff their departments appropriately so everyone is overwhelmed.  I feel as if I am in a meat grinder."
bad,"If you are looking for a rewarding career in commercial servicing, do not work here. They claim to service commercial loans, however they service SFR investment properties disguised as commercial loans. If you have no experience and a GED, then the commercial servicing department is perfect for you."
bad,"Ocwen is a small company that became huge in a matter of a couple of years.  Poor business plan and horrible infrastructure and operating systems.  look away attitude, and fix once broke approach.  no proactive measures taken here.  Quick to lay-off entire sites and move work off shore."
bad,Did not provide sufficient notice during lay offs. Did not keep employees updated with important company information. Supervisors  showed favoritism towards employees. Employees were not recognized for hard work.
bad,"Assisted site leadership with employee relations and performance management issues, fostered recruiting relationships across the Cedar Valley to assist with applicant pipeline, benefit administration, conduct New Employee Orientation, facilitate site wide training sessions in personal/professional development."
bad,This company went through many changes but over all it was a pleasant place to work.  There was never a dull moment due to the amount of work needed as well as positions to fill. Various departments was short handed due to work out source to India. Management was great and very reliable through the out source process.
bad,Unless something has changed in management this place is a sweatshop which uses and abuses people and tosses them aside.
bad,"The place pays the bills / It's a job. Management was ok. Outside of pay compensation the company really doesn't do much for you.                                    "
bad,possibly the worst company that I've ever worked at. Do not bother submitting a resume to this company. Company laid off my entire department and laid off everyoone.
bad,"Two week to two month onboarding process.  Texas is an  at-will employment state and employment is strictly at the sales director's whim,  Does not matter if it is Liberty or Homeward, this place is a meat-grinder.  There are some good people I worked with at Ocwen, but Ocwen is in the talent export business.  Anyone with a lick of sense leaves.  Avoid this company like the plague."
bad,"No opportunity to advance; lack technology, some work-life balance however, it was selective. No real open door policy with upper management, no real sense of communication."
bad,"Inability to implement change"
bad,"Worked there for a little over three years,same position, same routine YET the demands changed monthly.Job security is non existent there were two major layoffs one was as large as closing an entire location over three hundred employees affected.Management is horrid and have no regard for employees. But my co workers were an awesome group but I'm glad I left when I did that place is one audit away from a federal investigation and shut down."
bad,The hours varied every few months due to shift bids. The customers were usually very upset when they called in so you need to have a lot of patience and be prepared for verbal abuse.
bad,"Boarding process is grueling however expected of a Mortgage type company that requires loads of security.  Most employees and management are new so there is no tenure or resident expert that can offer expertize or answer questions.  No one takes accountability or ownership of their mistakes and quickly, you realize the importance of sending emails to refer back to when the blame game begins. Culture is cold and impersonal and teamwork is lacking.  The type of work is engaging but the lack of good management demotivates even the best of employees.  Research the company!  Internal systematic problems plague this place and as a result they have been fined by many government regulating entities.  I did work with some great people but overall this has been one of the worst work experiences I have had."
bad,"Except that there is one good Team Lead on the floor for CCC- that's about it."
bad,"It thought , no raise and micromanaged ."
bad,"marketing program is NOT relevant to environment"
bad,"The hardest part of the job is the unorganized, chaotic environment and high rate of personnel turnover.  "
bad,"The typical day consisted of you getting yelled at for simple mistakes and or issues caused by someone else, I learned a lot with Microsoft but nothing is worth the amount of hate from the management inside that company. They manage based off fear. You stress everyday if you will be fired for no reason. The hardest part of the job is definitely the HRD (hourly standards) you have to achieve or ""receive counseling"" from one of the unprofessional managers."
bad,I started working for GMAC who really cared about their employees and within the first year the company switched to Ocwen. They opted out of a better system to use scripts and ended up using all of their own plicies for what they already have in India instead of looking into a better system with a company who already had a better rating with the BBB and among customers. Consumed with buying instead of actual customer service.
bad,"pour management, they don't consider people personal life pertaining to their children or if the employee is sick. you must request everything in advanced before you agree to any outside activities or any doctor appointment. They monitor you for bathroom breaks, water breaks, lunch, 15 min break, and even if you have an emergency call pertaining to family."
bad,Everyone wants to be a manager. Too many Indians And not enough chiefs. If you know what I’m saying.Big time Micromanaging. Lots of layoffs...........
bad,I came here after doing a similar job at a competitor. I was already very familiar with the job so it was easy for me. However I quickly learned that some laws weren't being followed and there were so many gray areas. I felt I was there to help people keep their homes but many times it felt like they just wanted to foreclose on these people by making things more difficult than they needed to be fore the customers.
bad,The day used to go very easily as there with the smoothness of the work there was lots of learning things with the system and the management was really good and the environment was really very friendly the hardest part of the job was the targets and the most enjoyable part of the job was user friendly system and the co- workers
bad,"It is a great place to work at and I loved my job check against duplicate entries appropriate approvals and backup documentation. Assist with VA closed assets, send assignment to the "
bad,"This place lied from day one. Lied about wage, lied about having to perform cold calls. Thank God I had years of previous call center experience to draw upon because this was the worst training of any job I've had. Their compensation was nothing compared to what you had to deal with every minute of every day there. This is the most disorganized place in the history of mankind. No one knew what was going on. There was virtually no communication between departments. It was like I was working in a psych ward."
bad,"If they can ship your job to India, they will in a heartbeat. If they buy your company you better update your resume in a hurry. You WILL be out of a job soon."
bad,beyond comprehension and understanding of the business model.
bad,this job provided me with a new knowledge of affidavits and assignments. the workplace culture was great. The hardest part of the job was ensuring everything was done correctly with all the changes that took place on a daily basis.
bad,"Ocwen as an organization is a old style and redundant company, this is very evident in the various Business Functions, IT Systems, Technology, Workforce; in fact which is one of the major reasons Ocwen has been booked under various law suits in various states of US for not having customer records maintained, hence unlawfully foreclosing customer mortgage loans, not following Federal and various other governing bodies guidelines in mortgage loan servicing."
bad,"Ocwen is by far the worst company that I have worked for.  First, Management sucks, they don't value or appreciate their employees.  The pay was not that great.  They had me doing work that was not event in my job description, and they didn't want to give me a raise. My work load kept climbing up, I was doing 3 different peoples job and getting paid for 1 person. The environment was awful.  I dreaded going to work every morning. The managers are very rude and treat the employees like dirt.  Worse company to work for."
bad,Not that great place to work. No good salary. There is no standard of people.
bad,"Managed 13,000+ Bankruptcy accounts, service inbound calls from Customers, Trustees, and Attorneys. Discussed the bankruptcy accounts and service inbound calls, after the property has been brought out of bankruptcy."
bad,"The company has potential. Management has no training skills, they are unprofessional. They do not have good leadership qualities. Anyone can be promoted if you're in the right clique. The turn around is very high and HR is blinded by the things that really go on in the office. Favoritism is shown if you're in the ""clique"" If you ever speak up about anything, you will be black balled. So people are afraid to speak up about anything. One of the most toxic places I've ever worked at."
bad,The work was interesting and exciting. The company did not fairly compensate its employees.  The company did not give annual raises or holiday bonuses. It failed to find affordable health insurance plans.
bad,"Management need to be trained because their skills are lacking, but it does not appear to be a priority.  The environment is more like a middle school than a business."
bad,"Working at this company was interesting."
bad,"Micromanaged workplace, low employee moral and immature senior management who do not trust employees. No work life balance"
bad,"Job offered challenges with regard to learning more about the mortgage industry. However, Management was lacking in professionalism, team building, support and personal educational growth..  Supervisors not knowledgeable regarding work issues also lacked experience in management.  Not a stable atmosphere or working environment.  Layoffs, cutbacks constant loss of employees.  Stressful atmosphere."
bad,A typical day at work is log in and start receiving inbound/outbound calls to assist borrower with inquiries about their mortgage. What I have learn are valuable to me for the future when I decide to purchase a home and know the entire process of obtaining a loan and the life of the loan.
bad,"Bad management , training and no job security. The people always frown and there is much distrust by peers.  The only people that seem to get along have worked there for 10-15 years. New comers are not appreciated apparently, and viewed as a threat."
bad,"Management always seemed to be in the dark, making up processes along the way, only to change them numerous times. Advancement is not an option. One has to apply to a whole other department as there are no progression steps in any current role. Leadership is picked by other leaders and most have no experience or knowledge of leadership. Promotions are favored, I was one of the ones favored. The only thing great about Ocwen are the benefits. Ocwen purchased PHH, another mortgage servicer with bad history as Ocwen. Ocwen will be changing to PHH to rid of the Ocwen name due to all its lawsuits and bad publicity."
bad,Enjoy your coworkers they make the place great. Some managers are very hard to deal with and make working there extremely stressful. Human Resources will not help you. Don’t expect a raise. Kissing up is the primary culture if you can do that well you will suceed.
bad,"Ocwen needs to find a balance in roles between their Offshore and Domestic workforce. Too much value is given to Offshore (cheap labor) which explains the indifferent attitude of management towards the Domestic workforce. They do not think twice to layoff their US employees and should develop them more to help improve client delight scores. Clients repeat the same message when they give feedback: I don't want to entrust my mortgage servicing to people who do not understand the English language and who commit costly errors that could impact my mortgage payment! Offshore is too robotic and scripted and not as understanding as the Domestic workforce. There is no continuity at Ocwen because of the constant threat of layoffs or stressful culture Domestically. The culture can be  turned around relatively easy if leadership truly practiced what they preach and make it a priority to develop its domestic workforce. Offshore's role, although valuable in the global economy, should be secondary in nature and consist of activities not requiring critical financial operations. We spend too much time fixing Offshores' mistakes!"
bad,"layoffs every quarter, inefficient managers, company is reactive instead of proactive. The india operations run the show. The american workforce is just there to clean up india's messes."
bad,"Ocwen is going thru a difficult time financially at present, This is causing them to shift most jobs offshore. Given that be the case, there is NO job security at all. They are completely focused on doing more with less."
bad,"You cannot build an career in this company."
bad,"No words. File submission low with very low accuracy. No one to voice problems to. Number driven, lack concern of borrowers"
bad,"Sky high Incentives"
bad,Too many chiefs in charge of individual projects.  Ineffective financing policies prevented what were suppose to be critical and time sensitive projects from being completed on time and on budget.  Constant delays caused project budgets to increase.  Sr management wanted X project done yesterday but would take way beyond their established deadlines to look at and approve reqs.  As mentioned too many chiefs and at that level had no idea on how the nuts and bolts of the projects worked.
bad,Its uncertainty is what scares me. They are quick to move jobs overseas.
bad,"Nobody knew what they were doing, or even cared.  They only cared about protecting their only little box and not assuming responsibility for anything.   Every memo the company put out never failed to mention termination for violating said new policy in memo.  Who needed to be reminded daily that the company only viewed you as a drone?"
bad,"Other than salary not a single thing is well managed,"
bad,"To recover their lose started cost cutting, by less incentive, after March appraisal increment pay effective after 5months. "
bad,"A typical day in the office seems like a tornado.  Broken processes, no response from upper management, no direction.  New CEO came in and cleaned house, laid off so many offices with no plan on who would be taking over all the work associated with the layoffs."
bad,"Boss, would allow leads, to cause tension on the office. "
bad,"Ocwen has a history of buying companies and slowly dismantling them over a couple of years. If you find out your company has been bought out by Ocwen, start looking for another job immediately!"
bad,This company is defenitey not the answer if you want a great carreer or if you are looking for great mamangement. This is not a great place for an experienced processor because it hard to even close 10 loans here due to the jacked up system that they have. Everything is manual when it come to processing. The loan officers there for the majority don't give out clean files so therefore most of your files will end up being adversed. The Management is horrible as well the company.  It takes an average of 3-4 months to close a loan because of the underwriters and closing department don't know their right hand from the left hand. The only reason I gave this comany 2 stars is because the processors were great to work around. I would make this company my last resort for a processing job.
bad,Job security is zero; 2 layoffs while I was there as a temporary.  Managers are not helpful or friendly.  It's everyone for themselves.  Little cooperation between team members.
bad,"Ocwen only cares about profitability and cost cutting measures. Since they acquired the company formerly know as GMAC, they have sacrificed quality in countless areas."
bad,This is absolutely the worst company I've ever worked for. I would rather go back to working at Taco Bell than to work for Ocwen again.
bad,"Company is hard to work with, there is too much going on within the company. It is not an organized environment, no job security, and it just felt like you were on a ride waiting to end."
bad,You never feel like you have any sort of job security.  Work/ life balance is horrible. Management did not stand up for employees. The building we worked in sometimes smelled horribly.
bad,The management of the company has created an environment of fear. No job is secure. Management does not recognize accomplishments and does not show appreciation to employees.
bad,"Ocwen was the new company that bought us out, it was a outsourced company so we had to teach them our positions and write desk procedures.  Worked in Investor Reporting"
bad,"Ocwen offers decent compensation and benefits, but there is basically no opportunity for advancement currently. Severe layoffs and consistent losses have made advancement impossible. Further, the company appears to be going down the road of reducing compensation and benefits further."
bad,"Ocwen Management gives opportunity to growth only if you are the boss friend. The hardest part is this company is all Corporate America, no work/life balance. "
bad,The company is not a  learning organizations and the management team is not knowledgeable  . The reporting is never accurate and  they have  several Lawsuits
bad,"Very little or no training provided when new programs or procedures were implemented. Excessive micromanagement. unfair critic given on monitored calls, which could jeopardize ones entire month on earned commissions."
bad,"Needs to work on the tech side of the business"
bad,"The MNC which give a high work standard and technology."
bad,The corporate office treats their employees like robots. They don't care about anyone on a personal level at all. They reprimand you for even a minute of overtime even though they make a ton of money off of poor people who lose their homes. They don't care about ideas to improve efficiency and actually discourage employees from offering ideas. This place sucks the life out of you. It is boring and management does not like employee interaction.
bad,Systems are inefficient making it challenging to find the right business unit to accomplish a specific task. Company seems to have challanges meeting regulatory compliances; more and more of the core operations are being outsourced.
bad,Ocwen management is incredibly out of touch with employees and there are more issues to name than I have time for.
bad,"The work place fine my co-workers made the day. I enjoyed helping my customers concerning there matters. I also learned a lot concerning HAMP,HARP, Short sale and DILs."
bad,"I’m currently working in OLS as I started with MERS (Mortgage Electronic Registration System) than I started with handling cases of simple summons and complaint to critical ones, communicating with attorney and law firms in US. Counsels who manage the hearing to keep them up to date inform about the hearing and paper work.ETC"
bad,"Hard work, ok place to work. Would not go back, learned a lot at this job."
bad,My former company was bought out by Ocwen financial. We were responsible in making welcome calls to prior mortgage clients who were facing defaulting on their loans due to being behind in their payments. We were told that the intent was to lay us off after the transitioning of databases was completed. Ocwen has a reputation for outsourcing their work to India so it was very hard to deal with customers calling in who needed to be transfered to a different department where the Representatives were in India. Communication issues occured regularily between U.S  and India employees and customers were quite upset.
bad,I learned management skills and to think outside the box for better performance.
bad,"I have learned a lot of things at times, lessons for life and at times lessons for work. Working here has made me a stronger person and made me who I am today."
bad,"The most important thing to know is Ocwen is an INDIAN company. It has outsourced almost all its departments either entirely or in part to keep their overhead costs low. This makes it challenging to get anything done on a timely basis. The Indian employees speak a kind of English but it seems largely by rote, so the fine meanings of English are often lost. There is a lot of duplication of work, needless forwardings of emails because India has struggles to justify its importance by having almost every email funneled through them -- even though they may not be able to provide the help needed."
bad,"Talent is not noticed , no growth and salary is low . not happy with the work ."
bad,"Communicate daily with management as well as customers in regards to the status of their loan and the solutions at hand. When I first started in 2002, the company was Litton Loan Servicing. In 2011, Goldman Sachs sold Litton to Ocwen. At that time I was selected to work the remaining Goldman loans that were left to be serviced at Ocwen."
bad,"This was a temporary assignment in the Finance Department. The work was steady and I enjoyed the variety of assignments from International Expense Reports, making travel arrangements, tracking vacations, etc. The people were nice and the executives were often away. I was able to interact with accounting and co-workers were very helpful."
bad,Company is losing money due to poor strategic decisions in the past. Now they are cost-cutting mode. All of the good leaders who encouraged interaction and positivity are gone.
bad,"If they hire from within they cap your promotion/raise, and try to negotiate a lower rate... STAY STRONG.  The energy level is depressing and not motivating at all."
bad,This job was the best paying but by far the worst job environment I ever worked in. It was managed by India and that created many barriers for employees in the United States trying to service American customers.
bad,"Working at Ocwen was a rollercoaster.  It certainly did have its up days but also its down days.  While working in the Philippines for the companies off-shore operations has been very interesting and challenging, it also has demonstrated a lack of open attitude towards new ideas.  Most of the negatives are not necessarily attached to the company itself, but more based on the local leadership and their inability to bring about new ideas or be open to them.  I have had many clashes with management for their lack of awareness of the problems surrounding them which has been very frustrating.  While I have enjoyed the aspects of work-life balance allotted, I don't feel appreciated for the work done.  It can be a good place to work if only they could change their attitudes and culture."
bad,Management problems contributing to downward spiral of a distressed company. Company selling off assets and letting people go continually. Skeleton crew left to pick up the pieces. Key personnel leaving or being let go from the company.
bad,a Good company that is currently making servicing changes to try and address issues that have caused scrutiny from numerous regulators over the past year.
bad,"I initially took this job for more money and was promised job stability.  However, after only 7 months on staff, a number of us were grouped together on a phone call to be told we were being laid off."
bad,"Ocwen Financials being my first exposure to corporate life was a very happy friendly environment which provides the basic lessons and need to know for a fresher out of college.  It helped me understand how corporate culture works, the importance of banking and finance, lifestyle of people living in the United States in relation to the business process, and many networking opportunities."
bad,"Managed voluminous complex files related to mortgage modifications in compliance with the Department of Justice 2013 HAMP regulations while sustaining support to internal retention and in-house counsel, opposing counsel, trustee offices, and other related departments within OFS.  Acting as a liaison to ensure the integral processing of complex foreclosure matters in accordance with each states jurisdictional rules of civil practice and procedure, in an attempt to resolve title, litigation, and modification matters to conclude any outstanding impediment within the foreclosure process."
bad,Pay was good but that is about it. No work/life balance. Most tasks are outsourced. Out of date software. Departments too silo-ed.
bad,They tell you how great the company is and then in the next breath lay off ALOT of people-
bad,"I enjoyed the position as REO Coordinator, reconciling REO proceeds received via wire. I was able to cross train with other departments in REO, which helped me have a better understanding of the REO process.  My co-workers were great"
bad,"Customers constantly asked me, how could I work for such a company!"
bad,"New Operations manager with new ideas, unrelated and un-compared to the normal business day. The new operations manager came in to clean house and had a very negative attitude towards the manager she replaced and was very vocal about it."
bad,Its a place to learn loan servicing. if you want to be a drone then go to work at OCN. Great management but under pressure daily. low level employees with a sense of entitlement and looking to just get paid.
bad,Jobs were sent overseas so company let a lot of people go.  Expected you to work 10-12 hour days for months at a time versus hiring additional employees.
bad,Work/Life balance is hard to achieve at times.  It is also very cut-throat and you do not know when the next person to walk the door will be.  Always have to be on your toes at all times.
bad,My job and manager were all right but I worked in the executive office and some of the other executives were not very nice to the employees.  I heard complaints regularly from associates.
bad,"The compensation package is the only thing that was ideal with this company.  Promotions are not based on skill or quality of work product but favoritism. Nepotism is RAMPANT within organization.  The work is not difficult at all but management makes things much more difficult than need be and create a hostile work environment. The company experienced five layoffs in my four and half year tenure all around holidays and without notice. I had three different managers  and 6 team lead within same time frame.  No employee confidentiality between staff and supervisors, who gossip like high school freshman encouraging discourse among the staff. Constantly creating useless positions to promote friends and family members which actually make things more difficult and confusing  (too many cooks in the kitchen to boil an hotdog that noone wants to eat!).  Company constantly being sued for poor business practices yet CEO receives million dollar bonuses and laying off workers every few months . All around disorganized place to work.  The hourly rate was good considering local economy (which is why I stayed until eventual layoff) but I think salary has dropped considerably for new hires since then."
bad,"Ocwen is a company that is slowly dying. Despite some recent last minute efforts, the chances of this company surviving for another 3+ years is slim. I would not recommend working here, as the chances are it will be a very short tenure. The company has been conducting layoffs every 6 months like clock work."
bad,A company which is good for starters or freshers. Especially Commerce & MBA graduates because the learning of Financial & Mortgage banking ibdustry will be awesome.
bad,"This is a good place to get a start in your career, but upper management is constantly policies and procedures, and employees are constantly in fear for their jobs, whether it be being let go, or another round of layoffs."
bad,"Ocwen purchased the ResCap portfolio from Ally Financial, and we went from a company that cared about people to one that only thought of money.  The job was no longer about quality but quantity."
bad,The demands were not realistic and the company outsourced a majority of the work and a large portion of the workforce got laid off. I would not recommend this company
bad,Compensation package was changed directly after hiring and licensing process.  Management should consider more on-site training of pipeline processing in order to give priority to the mortgage clients going through process.
bad,"Its a very Stressful work environment, However Job security is there if you apply yourself. The Secretary to the CEO is very crazy , please avoid her at all cost.If she doesn't like you you'll be fired"
bad,Nothing to say about the job positive or negative. I have bills and a family. I met some amazing people and gain a lot of knowledge. The company is changing.
bad,"People are kicked out on a moment's notice. People who work, work. Others, have fun for more than half time of their shift. incentives have been cut drastically recently, else, pay is good."
bad,The environment at work was ok. Management was not the best but the pay was great and the pool tables and air hockey was great. The co workers were awesome.
bad,"there will be a daily work of productivity of long hours,and management oki, coworkers are good and helpful in working conditions."
bad,"Always busy, which was good, but production was never enough for management. There was a big lack of communication. All of the non management co-workers were very good people."
bad,"Managers and leads need more training."
bad,work env was good.. management and canteen facility is also good. Have little bit extra work load but thats fine
bad,I enjoyed the position i was in initially but i kept getting moved over and over due to a lack of management and staff retention. Never staffed correctly for the time of year/busy season. Mgmt was all over the place. The people in the FHA dept were bullies/very difficult to work with. Post closing had a great team that they kept shuffling around.
bad,"It was a call center environment and I personally don't like call centers, costumers can curse you out especially when you are calling to collect their payments and they are financially struggling. At the time we had loan modifications to help them out but the department I worked for relocated to south America."
bad,"Management & workplace is good. Haven't learned much. There is no creativity in the job. Job isn't motivating. Work environment is good, there is safety for women apart from that its boring."
bad,"India Controllership functions."
bad,I was honestly shocked at Ocwen's poor technology infrastructure. Things are really in a poor state or affairs. Decent interview but poor onboarding. Mgmt seemed  to treat remote workers with suspicion and were mostly ineffective. I found another job in less than 60 days.
bad,I was dissatisfied with the training for my specific department. They also have a lot of system which interferes with your work.
bad,"I loved my up-line for sure, but the work itself was mundane and boring.  Nothing exciting and no incentive to work harder or more.  There was a lot of turn over and rumors of how poor the company was doing overall."
bad,Good Company Decent pay but the structure is a little out of order as they just bought out a couple of different mortgage servicers. My direct supervisor is great. If i could change anything i say they need to have better benefits and personal time as well as sick time.
bad,"Mortgage Servicing "
good,"Expected to do more with less."
good,Home Retention Consultant is an excellent role where i could take individual decisions.  It was an excellent opportunity to communicate with the home owners to help them come out of a difficult situation.
good,"I spent a significant amount of time with Ocwen (10+ years). "
good,"Atypical day is being on time."
good,the company is not an employee centric company. lot of work pressure. no new learnings or trainings.
good,"During my tenure, a couple of senior executives spent entirely too much time and effort trying to out do one another rather than focusing on doing the right thing for internal stakeholders."
good,"Homeward Residential, a subsidiary of Ocwen Financial Corporation, has provided mortgage solutions to retail consumers and lending partners. As a national direct lender, we are committed to making it easy for our customers to get great rates and close their loans quickly."
good,Good Training and sessions were very productive which helped in scaling through.
good,Small stateside shop. Little knowledge in servicing GSE and Government.
good,Unfortunately the company has lost so much money that it has impacted its culture and current management doesn't help either.  For the work we do we are easily underpaid by $15-20k per year.  Better management and the company becoming profitable would make this an ok place to build your skills for you to eventually move on to bigger and better .
good,It was my great pleasure working for Ocwen for the past 7 years in three different departments. I have enjoyed my tenure working with my colleagues & supervisors.
good,"Ocwen Financial has a lot of regulatory ghosts that have caused it to downsize tremendously over the last few years.  There is very little opportunity for career growth and the company benefits are nothing to write home about. If you are a career woman and want to have children there is no maternity benefits beyond short term disability.  Ocwen has made a attempt to improve their culture and the Texas office is much better than any of the other offices to work at.  The culture is more laid back and relaxed offering a better work/life balance. Depending on the department you work in, it will spend on the level of stress that your role plays."
good,Ocwen is a great place to start your carrier and it also has a lot of learning and training activities for its employees. Ocwen conducts time to time training which helps the employee in his day to day activity.
good,Company is not that great they will not care for employees they don't have sick leaves and include their PF contribution in you ctc they will be paying incentives all of the sudden they will reduce incentives by 80 percent and every alternative month you have to work over the weekends
good,Management would create a hostile environment and cause waves of discontent. Advancement was based on favoritism and not skills.
good,"Management is not good at Ocwen.  Company is behind on government regulations.  Lots of down time.  How to use my time to work more detailed on my job,  Bonus plan was very good.  Getting answer and/or updates was the hardest part of the job.  Mostly updates were manual.  No solid policies and procedures."
good,"Great people to work with"
good,Great place to learn and hone your skills but not too much loyalty there.  Your job is in jeopardy always.  Pay is ok but not easy to advance in their current financial condition.
good,The work environment was very stressful due to the lack of experience and understanding of the Federal Rules and Regulations that were set out by the Department of Justice and I honestly felt like I wouldn't be employed there long.
good,"Good place to gain experience for graduate fresher. They do not have good work life balance. As a fresher, I have gained working experience of banking operations."
good,"Ocwen is good work place for freshers to start their career. Since, I have gained masters degree in finance and working knowledge of mortgage industry, I am looking out for better opportunities across globe in finance industry."
good,"Management doesn't know what they are doing but think they have all the answers, They pile unbearable workloads on team leads and have no structure in place to get us any help. Management doesn't hold anyone accountable for anything, frequent layoffs and horrible systems. They don't pay the customer care reps enough money for all of the things that they have to deal with. One of the few mortgage companies that still have bonus structure which is great but they keep reducing the earning potential. We are allowed to have employee engagement activities within the department but HR is horrible with planning site events with substance. ALOT of offshoring which is mostly irritating because the agents have to listen to the customers complain about it all the time. Management has no backbone when it comes to standing up for fairness and equality and has been trained to give textbooks responses when approached with a question. The company is actually a great company but if certain people that don't fit with the culture of the place could be moved out then it would be much better."
good,Good environment to work but no job security in Ocwen. Management is not supportive to their employees. The Goals are not explained to employees clearly.
good,"Salary employee, the better I did, the more they assigned until I was working 70+ hours a week and could not keep up.  Running 22 projects at one time.  Hired to work from home but then assigned to an office 35 miles away from my home.  In the beginning I loved my job but over the two year timespan it became to hard to manage my job and still have a life outside of work.  I am okay with working 70+ hours once in a while but after a year I was just too tired."
good,Ocwen is good place to work however completely unorganised and decision taken by management seems to hasty and less growth opportunity according to merit
good,"The company provides a fast paced environment, but lacks in some areas to recognize employee's and their contributions to the success of the company."
good,"Ocwen purchased Homeward- Ocwen is pretty typical, similar to other major financial institutions. they all have their pros and cons"
good,"crazy lady in a black shawl ran around yelling at people about perfume. i got yelled at for using scented body wash. she liked to put signs up everywhere. "
good,"a typical day at work"
good,A good  place to work in. Reasonably Good Culture. BPO company which is a captive unit of a US Mortgage company. Was working for the Collections Dept. making collection calls to Sub-Prime customers.  Learned a lot on this job. Had to leave because of a car Accident which required me to be off  work for months.
good,I worked for a bad period that all call center jobs were being outsourced to India. They were constantly closing down departments. reason why i left.
good,Leaned Quality what matters with productivity and efficiency.
good,Ocwen in a slowly evolving organization that lacks focus on employee resource tools and network backbone. The organization is still digesting the acquisition and merger with PHH and has a focus on cost cutting to restore profitability.
good,Continue losses in revenue causes uncertainty in the company.  So many loans were denied due to company overlays.  Only about 60% loans closed.  Frustrating.
good,"When I joined this company I had very less experience. But now I am very confident on how businesses work."
good,"Worked with Ocwen for 3 to 4 years everyone who works here hates the office environment and the lack of communication between employer and employees, overall it’s a boring place to work."
good,"Ocwen salaries their workers well, but treats them like children.  Very strict.  No exceptions for any reason.  A lot of employees, so I get it.  If they give to one person, they have to give to everyone."
good,"Was a good experience On calls"
good,okay.. good office environment.. but workload and pressure to newly employed freshers.. growth is stagnant..salary paid on timely basis.. A well framed rules and regulations to all the employees... team work by all the senior employees...
good,The employees were nice the company itself was a mortgage loan servicing/collection agency that assisted with loss mitigation. you are on an autodialer and you had to follow scripting.
good,"Management is scarce and can seldom be found.  The pay is great but you are working for a company that is a lot of trouble legally and financially so you will hear about it on a regular basis.  Each quarter means lay-off, it is only a matter of time before the entire company is located in India"
good,A typical day at work for me consisted of handling a fast paced volume of outbound/inbound telephone calls which required obtaining all details of default and/or financial obligation in order for the borrower to resolve the delinquency of the mortgage loan.
good,I was able to move into several departments and meet lots of great people. There were opportunities to move into other departments depending on what you wanted to do.
good,Its more of work oriented culture and not employee oriented. Its not Ocwen Financial but still Homeward Residential. Quality Assurance Underwriting is good team to work with.
good,I USED TO LOVE WORKING FOR THE COMPANY WHEN IT WAS GMAC BUT SINCE IT HAS SWITCHED OVER NOT SO MUCH EXCITING. I currently work in customer service and I love helping people especially those who have had a negative view on the company and I can be the one to change that view
good,"dull, routine work, paper shuffling, need automatons to perform all tasks, bad supplies & old equipment, expected to create up to date results with limited & outdated equipment. young inexperienced supervisors."
good,The people and jobs themselves are satifsying and enjoyable but the overall structure of the business is extrememly unstable and management is not dependable.
good,"Not a place recommended to work unless one wants to be taken advantage of and is ok with apathy within the workplace. More problems are created than there is the expertise and man power to solve, giving off a poor sense of job security and questionable ethics."
good,"Ocwen is the industry leader in servicing high-risk loans. Ocwen works with customers in a variety of ways to make their loans worth more, including purchasing of mortgage servicing rights, sub-servicing, special servicing and stand-by servicing. We can also support companies that wish to utilize our best-in-class technology and know-how to support improvements in their own operations."
good,"My overall experience of working at Ocwen was very good. When I joined I was the only one handling compliance matters for India and I reported directly to the Associate General Council in the US. "
good,I left right before Ocwen started changes things from the previous GMAC Mortgage. All I know is that Ocwen was a downgrade.
good,Take care of inbound calls  with home owners issues that need to be address in timely manner. Hardest thing to do was to give customer no as answer since hard to get info from different department and management.
good,"Co-workers are the best part of the day.  Everyone tends to get along extremely well for such a large company.  GMAC was purchased by Ocwen in February 2013, after GMAC filed for Bankruptcy the year prior.  There are so many uncertanties and changes on a daily basis that it gets hard to keep up with what the rule is from one minute to another.  Not a lot of direction has been provided by upper management.  It becomes a very stressful environment when employees have to go for a long period of time trying to keep up with minute-to-minute changes.  Luckily our department was able to maintain our positions and not get laid off through the sale process.  The employees have become each other's support circle."
good,"Work pressure is very less. Huge incentive scheme. Poor management. Overall, a good place to make money, however can never be sure for how long employment can last."
good,"My company was recently acquired by Ocwen. I really liked the previous owners, so my rating is probably biased by that. As soon as Ocwen bought us, there were layoffs and pay cuts. Luckily, I was not affected by either. However, that doesn't make a great first impression. The next thing that happened is that we got a lot of new draconian rules. OT exempt employees have to clock in now. No more than 3 sick days per year. Only one week of PTO rolls over to the next year. They didn't really have a lot of respect for the expectations that had been set by our previous owners. Now, they are shutting out site down and moving us to a location an hour drive away. So, I have a commute now when I didn't before. Overall, every change that has been made has been negative and has not kept the employees in mind. A lot of people have already left, which may be what they are hoping for anyway."
good,Good place to earn money but no job security. management never stick to there words and too much of risk in terms of quality
good,"Our days consisted of scheduled telephone appointments with troubled home owners who were behind on thier mortgages due to loss of employment, or some other occurance. I learned alot about why some people get qualified for loan modifications while others don't. And why the application process for a modification or short sale can and often does take longer than expected."
good,Working in Ocwen was good initially when we joined in 2011 we were paid well through incentives and perks apart from salary but after 2015 management made rigid rules which was not employee friendly..
good,"They over hire n then start removing agents. "
good,"No stability"
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job was being responsible for multiple functions and tasks.  Project Management, Policies and Procedures, IT Audits, Supervisory roles and cross functional training.  Great team members."
good,Job is pretty comfortable but recent management changes and company moves have decreased its appeal somewhat. Overall its a decent place to gain experience and pay before moving onto bigger and better things.
good,It's a good place to work and fun.. The work culture is really good.. Management is also fine.. There is no complaints there... People working there are nice
good,Required job due to reduction of staff. And i have learned alot with the 7.5 years of experince.Making critical reports.tracking the workflow. Learn alot fron my colleges
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was helping borrowers by saving there homes. Workplace was peace full as long as you work your appointment calendar and manage your time wisely.
good,"A good place to work, however there is no job security. Career advancement may be a challenge at this place and of course keeping your job in place!..."
good,Ocwen needs to care more about their employees and hire a management department within processing that knows processing
good,"One of the best company to work with. Many plus poinrs to work and few to not. Salary, work pressure and job  security is a thing to be concerned about."
good,Good workplace with very good shift timing.office location is good.provides opportunity in employee engagement activities.fun activities keep us involved in work
good,"When I worked for them, Ocwen was a big mover in subprime mortgages and subsidized loans. I felt some ethical issues in this, but my coworkers and management were all excellent, doing their best in an awkward situation."
good,"I handle both inbound and outbound calls."
good,"Working condition in ocwen is very good. all the management people are very good. facilities provide by ocwen regarding cafeteria,transport is very good. Employee welfare program is happening every three month."
good,"For more than 1 year working on that company somehow I feel blessed because I was able to helped my co-employees by sharing the knowledge and talent that I have. Though, there's a politics I still keep calm and ignore them."
good,"Needs process improvement, corporate training, and management training. The compensation is very good. Benefits are good. There should be focus on making the company a people centric environment."
good,"Timing were flexible with previous management, but got stringent with new management of Project Management Office."
good,"At Ocwen we built great relationships and a comfortable working environment. I supervised a floor of 65 agents with 12 of them reporting directly to me. I learned every aspect of the mortgage servicing as my department was the front line to all the customers questions and concerns. I handled accounts with escrow issues, insurance claims, fraud accounts, repayment plans, explaining transaction history, payment reapplication, ACH payment processing, bank drafts, loan modifications, foreclosures, bankruptcies, charge offs, short sales, deed in lieu. My Sr. manager provided great support and had confidence in his management team. Our agents were professional & friendly. Always ready to assist with any new projects and new hires. "
good,"Ocwen is a standard ""office space"" type of employer that is not above using any tactic to further its own advancement at its employees expense."
good,"Ocwen as an employer is very informative and knowledge providing organization, where an employee can not only gain complete process knowledge about current working vertical also about various sections of verticals related to the process, its origination process and flow chart."
good,"Company promotes unexperienced individuals for management.  Not even the best performers.  Creativity is stiffled, and no annual pay raises."
good,"Typical day at work would be to review the call backs from the day b/4 and call them at the agreed times."
good,"Process is like very challenging."
good,"Assisted borrowers looking to retain homeownership via a modification, forbearance plan or repayment plan when possible. I also worked with realtors and homeowners to complete short sales or deed in Lieu."
good,"I am a supervisor for about 20 agents on and off shore.  I manage their quality reviews for the FCL and BK departments.  I aid our department in adhering to government, investor and corporate regulations and guidelines."
good,The empoyment and benefits offered are average for large financial instituitions.
good,"Upper management openly favored our offshore counterparts which made most of us feel unappreciated for our contributions. It was stressful and fast paced which is doable. But, what create undue stress was the issues that upper management failed to address and correct."
good,"The company offers a fast-paced workday and a good environment to succeed with no micromanagement.  However, the work processes are rather siloed and the corporate vision and mission is controled by a small group of upper managers who communicate very little until all decisions have already been made. The company needs to be streamlined."
good,"Worked there for 10 years, was recently laid off. Good pay, great coworkers, but there were several rounds of layoffs while I was employed there so I never felt I had job security."
good,"Decent pay in Palm Beach County."
good,The company keeps going through rounds of layoffs sending most of the positions overseas. The company continues to shoot itself in the foot on a consistent basis.
good,"The company says that they value open communication and employee satisfaction but then acts very secretively and only in self interest. For instance, I, and about a hundred others, was laid off on the day before Thanksgiving, thereby ensuring we did not receive holiday pay or end of month PTO accrual before we were let go. Even though we had worked the entire month to earn those benefits."
good,This position was a temporary job that last almost two years but I was informed of my release of the role the night before.  Could've been handled a little better.
good,"Culture at ocwen is quite relaxed one of the best place for a fresher to start  get a experience and ground level knowledge about the industry. pay is very good, overall speaking its a good place to work but not from a long time perspective."
good,"It's your typical office, you come in do your job and leave.  Yearly compensation is a joke.  Poor communication from management.  Moral is very low because so many jobs have gone offshore."
good,"The pay here is good but based on commissions + base. Pay keeps most people on board but they sqeeze every cent out of you. Heavy work load, difficult customers, management is overloaded and cannot assist with ""fires"". Work is also outsourced which makes communication btwn departments extremely difficult and all calls are monitored/graded which may affect pay. When youre able to actually help a grateful customer, the job can be rewarding."
good,Company culture is not up to mark. work is good but you have to find chalanges yourself. Company politics will break your head. if you are starting then it's a good place.
good,My co-workers where great no complaints. The main problem l the heavy reliance on Offshore personal to the point where you could see  the major impact it had on  Operations. you could see why the company was losing money because of it.. Management does not care though. Because of the saving up front.  Employees based in India make for a miserable day and made it sometimes impossible to get anything done in a reasonable amount of time .
good,Ocwen is very good company for fresher. Many things you can learn while working here. Investor reporting reporting is the best department to work in Ocwen.
good,It was a good company to work for. The environment was pleasant and the management staff as well as my co workers were great.
good,"Challenging work environment.  "
good,"Great Place to work, friendly people.  The cafe could be improved with greater food selection.  I enjoy the people and the management staff and the ability to learn new things.  It's a relaxed environment."
good,The employment with Ocwen once they purchase GMAC the jobs became very unsecure. It became hard to work in an environment that was folding.I have learned alot about the managment as a whole that they too find ways to keep their job secure. The hardest part of the job was when we had to witness former employees that you have worked with throughout your tenure in this field leave being laid off because the position was being moved overseas literally.
good,"A typical day at work was answering a large number of calls for customers and helping them on their mortgage information.I learned to read various types of mortgage documents such as short sale, foreclosure and other types. My management was helpful and willing to help. I enjoyed working with my co-workers always to help on doubts or questions you sometimes didn't know how to answer for the customer. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers and making sure their needs were met. The hardest part of my job making sure the customers those needs were always met."
good,friendly co workers but the company is not employee centric and facilities not so good. since it was my first job got to learn a lot
good,"A typical day at work included managing a team of approximately 13 agents and team leaders.  4 in same office, the rest were overseas.  My job was to simply ensure all agents had workload available, that they were meeting goals, and following along with policies and procedures.

My co-workers were great for the most part and we created a ""family"" atmosphere and relationship.  Management absolutely horrible.

good,"We have 6 working days in total. Each day we need to reach our quotas by classifying the documents given to us and from that routine, I learned different kinds of documents. Also, I learned the time management in order to reach the goal quota and be keen on every detail. There are teams in our workplace consisting 15 agents above with a Team Leader which assist and motivate us everyday. I think the hardest part of it was the time when I don't know where the documents should be classify and on the other hand, the most enjoyable part of it, I was be able to have fun with my colleagues and have a friendly competition with them which helps us to reach higher quota."
good,Work hours were 8 am to 6 pm. I was responsible for running reports and remittance of payments. Monthly review of files. the hours were long and tediuos and sometimes we worked on weekends. co workers were friendly and young.

good,"Ocwen has 2 locations in WPB- 45th St. and Worthington Ave.  45th St. is record services and that is where all collateral is warehoused.  Most jobs in this location are volume/ production, cubicle jobs.  If you like repetitive workflows and are not necessarily too driven, this is a pretty good job but advancement will be an arduous task.  If this is ok, these positions actually pay really well for the job you do and is a pretty casual environment.  Worthington Road is headquarters and is a little more 'corporate'. Pay is competitive with the market.  Future of company in general is a bit shaky."
good,"Is a great place to start, but not when your a single parent and with one income. The pay is low and there’s lots of work to do, but not enough initiative. Management is great never had an issue."

good,"typical day of work consisted of completing call back appointments with clients searching for home retentions options. I learned that even though you may not be able to find the resolution the client wants, you still treat everyone with kindness and courtesy. management was helpful but difficult to locate sometimes. id have to say the workplace culture was one of diversity and acceptance. the hardest part of the job for me was having to tell a client that all of the options had been exhausted and there was nothing I could do to save it from foreclosure. the most enjoyable part of the job was finding a solution to keep someone in their home and my co-workers."

All companies change and all of us have to deal with changes. I learned a lot about the whole process of bankruptcies from both companies. I worked pretty well with management and co-workers. I am a people person so I got along with just about everyone. The hardest part of the day is when you plan where to start with your duties and something else is brought to your attention that is a priority first.
