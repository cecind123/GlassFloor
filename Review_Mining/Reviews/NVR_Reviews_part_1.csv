rating,review
bad,"they dont care about the employee, promise false growth opportunities, id not recommend to work in a place that plays with employees time, no overtime, if you ever work OT they make come early and leave early so you still not working 40+"
bad,"Not a bad place to work if you don't like thinking about better ways of doing your job. they seem how much money they can make for themselves - meaning people at the top,  How much money can one spend in a year, They have people running the various entities who have never done the job - just ask how many sr managers have ever taken a loan application or sold a house,    They value the people that will not ask questions and do the things that make no sense or risk being terminated., Too many people drink the tea and believe me most people really think this but are afraid to discuss it.  They make up reasons to get rid of people and it would seen that at some locations age is an issue - just an observation and maybe it ain't so.  It is really to bad as it used to be a nice place to work - 1980s. More cons because the space one can write is limited - Management does seem to like to hire or keep experience people -- too much money to be paid for people that have other ideas and the Company seems not to want that,  What a novel idea - they want yes men and yes women - The NVR way, nothing but an army that has peter principle managers again do not ask questions"
bad,"Employees were yelled at and treated horribly. Daily crying and upset. Managers were clicky and unwilling to be supportive.  They were often non approachable and unhelpful in daily needs "
bad,If you are a top sales person you are better off working somewhere else.  They pay you less than any other builder.  I sold 30 homes in 1 year of being on the floor and I earned less than 70k.  Mind you all the homes I sold were average price of 290k.
bad,"Worked there for almost 9 months they make it sound like a wonderful place but  no pay raises like promised, No advancement opportunity. They pick favorites and move those employee's up while everyone else is worked like dogs. The hours were horrible. One week we would work 30 hours and the next was 55 hours. Awful management and communication. On the weeks you would work short hours you would have to use your vacation days to get a full paycheck. They make promises they don't keep and management would yell and treat everyone poorly. I was the only women on my shift and harassed by management. Everything about that place was horrible. I tried to switch shifts and no one would talk to me about it. They say to go to management for any issues, that's really hard when management is the issue. Very high turnover rate due to management."
bad,"I regret working here everyday. Management, workplace culture, career development and growth are disappointing  and below expectation. Certainly many opportunities to work on improving these areas for a productive working environment."
bad,"The pay sucked they expect you to Bust your butt  for low amounts of money  and everyone that worked there were trash and very ignorant and didn't give new people a chance to learn they act like you should know how to do the job after 3 days of training the supervisors and management were a joke"
bad,"When you interview, you're told 8hrs a day and then you are done. Well once you get in you find out that every week is mandatory overtime. People have families and schedules that look for 8hrs a week. The leadership is a joke and cannot manage the personal under them."
bad,"Laid off so that new employees hired at a lower rate could take my postition. Not a good company, does not care about its employees. Never took a day off, was never late and my job was given to a someone who had no experience therefore they could pay them less."
bad,"I applied for a accounting position and a production assistant position with this company. I have 26 years of accounting, office management experience. I have also worked as a Project Superintendent for the last 17 years. So my advice if you qualify for a position. Do Not Apply as you will be ignored. Don't waste your time."
bad,"No communication or lack of"
bad,"If you want to be treated like a valued team player and be recognized for your achievements and a positive upbeat environment, then this is not the place for you."
bad,"The customers are incentivized to use you, so management holds sales team accountable and responsible for all roles in office.  There is no accountability for the inside staff.  Management is never present or around.  Turn-over is incredibly high.  Company runs off of a culture of intimidation and bullying.  Often worked 60 or more hours in a week.  They sell you on ""all of the money you can make"" but it's not nearly as much as they make it seem."
bad,"There were a lot of good lessons to learn from this company, unfortunately not all of them were good but you definitely come out a stronger individual"
bad,"You are truly just a number. The division I worked in had terrible management, lied to employees and customers. People are not treated equally and they do not care about your work life balance. Worst years of my life. Money was ok, but not consistent and didn't make up for mistreatment. Turn over reports say it all."
bad,to much micro managing took long time to get things done because of that
bad,"They pay alright, but they treat you like slaves! Managers talk down to you, only aloud to go to the bathroom twice a day. They promise a great work experience but it’s awful. I hated everyday when I went to work. Wouldn’t wish this on the worst person!"
bad,"At one point the Columbus Division was an amazing place to work! Terrible New Leadership! Fantastic office support staff, and great project managers. SALES: They TRY to lead by fear and intimidation, performance reviews, threatening to fire staff...Sales leaders even President talk bad about all the other sales people, sit in your model homes for every appointment, and do nothing to help you . Way too much micro management, and the management team does not know how to effectively launch a successful grand opening in a community. If the execs at Reston ever knew what was actually really going on they would fire them all. Unfortunately, sales leaders are not held accountable for doing their job, and can really just get away with about anything. They offer no real value or benefit! Most of the managment team were terrible average sales people at best.  Really felt they were just there to bully, and try to intimidate the sales people. Life is too short to work with sub par team, and pay! Pass!"
bad,"I worked in the Dayton, Oh  division and it was the worst work experience of my life. Some project managers had over 20 homes they were responsible for. Needless to say it was very difficult for them to achieve their bonuses at a build time of around 60 days. Our weekly meetings were always negative, and often lasted all day."
bad,Very poor corporate leadership. Employees are numbers to them.  Benefits and salary was excellent but not for the stress and aggravation you had deal with on a daily basis. No work/life balance. Good vacation after you become vested after 6 years.
bad,"Micro Management is the motto. Made up metrics that make zero sense. They promote people based on who sucks up the most. Meetings are non stop along with 100+ emails a day makes it nearly impossible to achieve the set metrics. This is of course you work OT which is not allowed so you dont get paid for it."
bad,"Horrible place to work:"
bad,"I worked at the Blue Bell branch for less than a year and it was utter madness the entire time. Every day it seemed like someone was being fired or demoted or quitting. Management toted ""internal limelight"" however no one in upper management was willing to take responsibility when everything broke down. We did visit other branches and they seemed to run smoothly, so I think it was just our branch."
bad,This company does not challenge you to use your brain.  This is more of a paper pushing job.  The office is poorly managed.  Team members call out frequently and their work needs to be completed by those who do come to work
bad,The company uses temp agencies to fill seasonal positions. NVR management leaves much to be desired. The managers do not generally treat their employees with any respect. The hours are good and do not vary with the occasional overtime on the weekends. When hired through the seasonal positions though you never know when they will lay off. Generally they maintain these positions for one or two months then those that were hired are laid off.
bad,"I have hope that changes made to the management and by bringing management team that understands the NVR way, things will settle in the Florida area and that employees will be able to feel satisfied and supported at their positions now without the effect of favoritism and unethical practices developed by some."
bad,"The people employed at NVR are good but the job culture is poor.  The management and job culture is not employee friendly.  It's a company that stresses bottom line.  Goals are set for many employees.  The goals are not always fair or realistic, which makes it difficult to earn a bonus.  Years ago NVR was employee friendly but not anymore."
bad,"This is not a career opportunity, you are treated like child. If you are asked what you like, dislike or want to see improve. Keep your mouth shut. No matter how well you perform, are a team player, have respect from other, your management team will manage you through gossip and own self righteousness, learning about you is never sought out."
bad,"Its a bad place to work the money is good but everyone is 2 faced and things get changed every other day I recently got fired cause I wasn't meeting ""company standards """
bad,Very little opportunity for career advancement for cost managers. Deceptive recruiting and interviewing for the cost manager position. Company changes not well communicated.
bad,Started hiring throw temporary workers place went down hill. Did not care about the long time employee. Took away overtime from anyone that worked there even the drivers. Took the CDL trucks away so they didn’t have to pay the employees CDL paid.
bad,Home builder & mortgage provider with a VERY HIGH employee turnover.  Great place to come in and get some experience in home sales or home building before moving on to a good job.
bad,"Advertising as a ""commission-based"" income for a Sales & Marketing Representative is extremely deceptive!! This is the only company that I have experience with that gives a ""quota"" per month... how much you make per sale varies greatly with this ""quota system"" and if you achieve that ""quota"" by working very hard... they increase it the following month so you make less money per sale!! One would think that if you sell more homes... you would make more income... but not with Ryan Homes!! This division has gone to h...l since the new division manager came in a few years ago, who knows nothing about the Cincinnati market and only has HER best interest at heart, and not those of the sales/ sales managers teams. It's disgusting and a horrible move from the 'corporate' office, as the past Cincinnati Division President was awesome and truly cared about the team as a whole & most importantly... the customers!!!"
bad,They pay decently. Empty promises of advancement and job security. Tell you business is booming and tell you they are growin but will let you go at any giving moment and not bat an eye. Supervisor pretends to understand work issues slowing work flow then turn on you to upper management.
bad,"Model usually opens at 11 am, you want to get there early and setup the model. Lots to learn in the job, but outside of the industry it's pretty worthless info. Culture is competitive and doesn't really encourage friendships. Tons of micromanaging and latent racism as well."
bad,"Selling new construction in a sub market is always a challenge. Unfortunately WNY is a decaying population. "
bad,"I have constantly monitored the same open positions at this company for well over 3 years.  They never seem to get filled.  Which is very odd, when a company can't find qualified candidates in an area completely saturated with talent/prospects.  This should be a red flag to anyone applying. "
bad,Someone in a management position should know how to do their job and not become a manager just because you have been there for 10 years. Absolutely a pathetic company to work for.
bad,The plant in Delanco has potential but the current plant manager is clueless about what's happening on the production floor. The contract workers that come in have a complete lack of talent some can't even read a simple tape measure. It's quantity above all else. That's the reason for the high turnover rate. 75-80% of the workers have less than 3 years with the company. There's a pay rate schedule contains 6 or 7 levels and within each level there are 3 sub levels.  So working your way up to a decent pay rate is painfully slow.  The work day is 6a-2:30p. with a mid-day break and lunch break. OVERTIME in non existent with this company. Co-workers are generally good to work with. The hardest part of the job is keeping a positive outlook when you know that those in leadership positions can't tell their *ss from their face!
bad,I have worked at NVR for 7 years now. It is going down hill fast. There are no more incentives to stay. No bonuses. Supervisors try hard to only let you work 32 hour weeks instead of 40. I don't know what happened.
bad,"You are doomed if you have a bad or credit challenged community. nothing was as it seemed. If management likes you they will help you...otherwise, you are on your own."
bad,"Salary and benefits were great, but there was no management or training.  This office was in turmoil when I arrived with a very high turn over rate.  The process in place was incredibly redundant with no focus on customer service.  Borrowers are forced to wait hours at closing."
bad,"You are only a number in the world of corporate. Experienced mixed emotions the entire length of employment, enjoyed co-workers disliked the corporate mentality."
bad,"A typical work day is you may be handed a loan to close within hours from the time its scheduled to close. The work  environment is very"
bad,Got to hit numbers with no exceptions have to stay at your department their is no way to hit the numbers they want that they up every year to what they know even the most experienced can't even hit
bad,"Company is very organized, which means every dept. needs to meet time goals. Tricky to do with uncooperative clients, and management pressures.Travel may be needed to meet clients evenings and weekends at models."
bad,"Extremely fast paced, high stress and high pressure. Excellent project management training program. Build cycles are 65-75 days from start to finish. Expected to deliver perfect results on time and on budget. You are also expected to hold the customers hand throughout the entire construction process. They provide 15 vacation days a year but good luck actually taking them or enjoying them. Customer survey scores determine your success and your bonus. Houses are built cheap and as fast as possible by the lowest priced sub contractor they can find. Managers are only concerned with looking good for corporate based on your results. Culture is a cut throat corporate environment. Highly competitive personalities looking out for #1. It is possible to make well over $100k based on bonuses but the daily stress and high pressure comes along with it."
bad,"if they like you on day 1,  you are golden. if they don't like you one time,  you will never be promoted. great vacating time and sick time,  but its not worth the hassle inn three long run."
bad,"Nepotism is rampant. Plus, they don’t care about their employees. They could care less about the safety of their employees as well. The company is ran Soviet style."
bad,I would not recommend working there unless you cannot go elsewhere. The hours are long and the company pushes you. They are greedy and concerned about more money. They don’t promote from within like they claim. Also they force a lot of overtime.
bad,Not received well by present sales agent. Uncomfortable Environment  to work within.  Management can work on meetings. Need more screening of team matching in communities.
bad,"- great people who work there"
bad,"I loved my job. Great co-workers and awesome customers! However, management could use an overhaul. Hopefully this has changed in the last couple of years."
bad,Top management dis-respected the Division managers. An inordinate amount of time was devoted to one and five year plans - then top manager told us what the answers had to be. It was like they were setting the standards in a way that prevented paying performance bonuses.
good,go in an never have a set job title. you never know what your going to do one day to the next. didn't learn much here other than you have no team environment.they show favoritism the management takes advantage of the hardworking dedicated employee.most of them look out for self.going in not knowing day to day what your going to do an no team environment where it certainly is needed. the end of the day.
good,"Goal oriented, highly profitable company.  Good work environment, good return to shareholders.  Company wants to be the best builder in all markets, not the largest builder."
good,My experience with the local Cincinnati office management was not in line with the companies culture and core values.  There was great division between the two sales managers at the time.
good,"I will never say I won’t work there again but I would try really hard not to have to. My experience was not always great with this company, but  others may love it."
good,Work was ok. demand to much from one person. hours where good. pay was decent. to many chiefs giving different directions. lots of babying and coddling
good,"Overall, the staff that worked in my department were pretty unhappy. The pay was terrible and the work was redundant. Management was very process driven which wasn't bad but it would have been nice if there was a little more flexibility offered."
good,"Hours are grueling, work/life balance is non-existent, direct management is unstable. Pay is good."
good,"Turnover rate is enormous, quotas randomly increase based on overprojected sales, they’re always understaffed, but there’s little room for advancement, people in the office tell you to work even harder for no pay increase while they sit in a/c at a desk. They’ll also hire in people with less or no experience, for the same wage just to fill an opening. Benefits are good, but not worth working to death for."
good,Working there was similar to the twilight zone... there were extremely helpful coworkers but they’d clam up around Management... always a weird energy in the office.
good,"i wasnt there long as i was placed there through a temp agency, and after the contract was up i was let go. all in all though it was a pretty okay place to work for."
good,"The company will manage your day down to the second, watching and questioning your every move.  Expect to spend about 20 hours out of your week in meetings (not an exaggeration, this actually occurred more than once).  They promote to failure, and will continue to pile work on you until you practically live under your desk.  Then they will ask you why your metrics are suffering, but in the same breath tell you that you are so good at your current position that they cannot afford to promote you.  If you are good with sucking up to management, they will do your work for you and promote you quickly.  But beware if you try to teach an old dog new tricks, because any innovation will have you stuck in your entry level position until you finally give up."
good,"I had a nice time working here.  Pay was decent, job left a lot of free time though and not a lot of direction to fill it.  Little room for advancement, and office staff was a little bit catty."
good,"Busy with work everyday which made the day goes by faster. Fast pace and demanding, colleges are good and friendly, everyone willing to help in any condition"
good,"Not open to new ideas. Work life balance is not ideal.                     Change for the better  takes too long."
good,The company is extremely micro managed. They have metrics on every aspect of every part of the job. The company uses the cheapest materials to build a terrible product and then make you defend the product to customers. The job does pay very well but you must sell your soul to the company.
good,"The Community Sales Manager ensures a high conversion rate by providing meaningful sales presentations and consistent follow-up, leading to the attainment of sales goals; oversees the Home Buyer Experience Program through Customer Relations Coordinator, certifying that it is consistently executed and results in high customer satisfaction ratings."
good,"The Charlotte division of Ryan Homes is a pleasant place to work with highly qualified teammates. The compensation has decreased in the last few years while sales quotas increased. The product they build is of high quality, but often times does not keep up with competition or market trends."
good,decent place to work some management could be/do better.  higher up could benefit a lot from listening to their employees and the people that are hands on and deal with the everyday.
good,"Extremely fast paced and stressful work environment. On a given day you will manage up to 30 contractors. The contractors that are selected are generally the cheapest bidder. Often times the individuals you have to oversee have poor work ethic and the quality of work is awful. You are expected to do more with less and that is often not possible. Customers are frequently unhappy with the quality of work they are receiving and you are the one that must try to justify what they are being given. You are given so much volume of work to manage that is borderline unmanageable. Be prepared to work 60-70 hours per week. They do give decent bonuses on top of your salary, but you will definitely put in more than enough hours to offset what you actually receive."
good,"Working for NVR was great at first, but management under pressure creates a hostile work environment. The managers struggle with doing what’s right, and doing what’s necessary to get one more sale. The managers create a hostile working environment by playing sales reps against each other. Other than poor management, NVR has been fine, I make great money and achieve monthly quotas."
good,"I do not wish to write a review about my previous employer. It was a competitive sales job. Very stressful, but they paid well. Overall, it is a good company"
good,The people are great to work with. The boss is great to work for as long as your working. No job security. No benefits. Doesn't want to give you forklift certification but wants you to drive it
good,"Started working here in 2012, absolutely loved it at first. Once I was there a while I quickly seen the change. Managers show favoritism. Give advancement and raises to less qualified based on looks. Not a good company to work for."
good,"•	Network with Builder and Realtors to build better relationships and increase business"
good,"* Doing PM, also making break downs calls on all machines plus doing paper work."
good,"NVR inc. is a company that you have to brown nose to get where you want to go, the company doesn’t care about how hard you work, only if your attendance is good, the management is poor, I worked very hard to try and get where I’m at and so did many others but got no where, I’ve been asking for a forklift license for 6 months and haven’t gotten a word back, I haven’t been able to excel within the company’s status and that’s not fair to the ones that actually work."
good,Nothing needs to be change hours where good location was far pay was great certain employees could have been more welcoming and maybe better care for employees during an injury
good,"Management does not care about work life balance and will make you work on weekends without getting paid overtime. They will also make you work on weekends with almost no notice. This is a high pressure job with very little guidance, so you have to work around the clock in order to keep up with the demands. "
good,Not a bad place to work. Bosses where layed back and understanding. All the people here are very easy to get along with . I actually enjoyed my time at NVR.
good,training has opportunities that need addressing for new hires and management needs coaching on people skills.  they have the knowledge but relating the message is not always in the best way.
good,It will keep you very busy and is quite challenging with access to a wide variety of companies and individuals.  Customer Service skills are key.    You need to be a real team player to work within this company.
good,My division was purchased by NVR and was run for less then 2 years.  Not much changed except they added many layers of management over the time they owned the company.  It was closed shortly after the purchase of the company.
good,"All in all, a solid, reputable company. However, the sales representative position is not geared towards high-level, experienced sales reps. Income opportunities are limited."
good,"very good place to work ,very fast paced,hrs are great ..so many differnt areas you can go to if you cant perform at one ..cross training is a very big goal for nvr employees,,,"
good,"When the company is fully staffed the job is not too bad. When someone leaves, goes on vacation the job can be very stressful due to the pipelines being divided up."
good,If you want to work for this company you can't be lazy.  Company is more concerned with quantity than quality even though they are building people houses.
good,Early shifts guarantee a full day of work. Able to pick up necessary information to handle most tools. Hardest part of job is the weight of the material used.
good,"Good company to work for, but limited opportunities for growth in some departments.  Great ESOP and training for sales and production employees."
good,very convenient place to work because of very little travel but the outdoor work in the winter is not very pleasant. management was decent and the hours were always consistent.
good,Worked 6 to 4:30 build interior walls. Learned how to use a nail gun. Learned how to to build trusses and assemble them.  Also worked on exterior walls only if they where behind or they needed help.
good,"Nice place to work out of college. Solid training and benefits. Commission job, selling to-be-built houses in different communities. Weekend work required. Must be self-motivated."
good,"It is fast paced environment, busy in the summer, slow in the winter. May work inside or outside. Day shift work. High turn over rate. You either stack trusses, build them, or pick lumber for or gable them if you work in truss. other departments there to work for also."
good,"Great office morale, supportive management.  Lots of reports and meetings"
good,"Since I worked for this company almost seven years ago, I don't feel my review would be relevant."
good,Long days with moderate rewards the job is not difficult but takes a mental stamina to get through the day.
good,"It can be a great choice for job opportunities just need a lot of patience,  "
good,This was a temporary assignment that I acquired through a temp agency named Career's Express. I worked as an administrative assistant for about a year before the assignment came to an end.
good,"Very hot in Portland,TN warehouse"
good,I enjoyed what I did here. It is a fast pace type of work so you can reach your daily production goals. The pay is good and the benefits are not terrible.
good,NVR Building Products has a family like atmosphere.  It is a low stress job. I  would probably return to NVR if unless I had a better opportunity. Thanks for listening.
good,My time at NVR / Ryan Homes was filled with a tremendous amount of learning and career advancement.  The company helped me to hone my sales and marketing skills.
good,"-6 files a day production requirement "
good,"n/a to my experience here - the biggest con is the tiny (aka non-existent) raises. The biggest pro is a nice esop plan & 401k matching, along with some salt of the earth folks to work with."
good,"Great co-workers, and managers, but a lack of vision and direction from leadership.  Great place to work if you like consistency and have a family."
good,A hard working branch.  Everyone is a team player.  Branch does get involved in activities to boost moral.  The branch is a great bunch of happy people.
good,"Friendly work environment, but at the same time also very competitive. Lots of people that inspire motivation and success in others. Self time management is one plus side of the job, but as time goes on, gets less challenging."
good,If they can keep the drugs away and stop laying off the good people it would be the best place to work. Very high paced work put you in good shape. But you have to work really hard.
good,Sales team in Frederick was great.  The Management team unfortunately was not very supportive.  They often did not follow through on commitments made to the sales team.
good,Throw u under bus no problem. Lead two face. Will let you go. They don’t care. Just want you to work and suffer. Training sucks. Hot in the summer. Have big fans
good,"The base pay is great, the bonuses are awesome. you can make a lot of money but you also work under extreme pressure and super high stress. extremely short building cycles and extremely small budgets."
good,"Company has a great culture, but are more focussed on numbers than job satisfaction. Time off was highly looked down upon and missing quota one month resulted in a potential job loss after being with company for almost 2 years."
good,Had a terrific Sales Manager who was hands on. The Division Manager was preoccupied and let the division crumble underneath him. He lacked work focus and in-turn left many sales reps and project managers with out property to sell and build on. regional management took way to long to react and see the situation. I've heard that in many other of their markets the culture is much different. I also know that the new acting division manager is much better.
good,"The company is great at making money, but recently, there has been a bit of a leadership crisis within the management ranks.  Many Sales Reps simply do not feel listened to, and they certainly don't pay much attention to culture anymore."
good,lead supervisor over a team made sure the jobs were completed correctly at all times and went behind them to check work as well also checked work list off
good,This is a truly rewarding job by building something from start to finish and see something that a family is going to live in for years to come and to enjoy.
good,"Worked over 8 years and not a whole lot of growth in IT, not really a negative just limited.  Peers were trustworthy as a rule and could be counted on for support."
good,As a loan processor I work with both clients and loan officers to ensure customers are qualified and approved for mortgage loans.
good,Overall a good place to work.  Excellent co-workers and lots of responsibility.
good,"A typical day of work consists of developing multiple marketing pieces to boost sales for the division, daily follow up with lead prospects, and administrative responsibilities. I handle the brainstorming, planning, and execution of various events, ranging from local broker events, open houses, parade of homes, and home owner appreciation events.This position has allowed me to utilize a wide array of skills, including: time management, creativity, customer service, cultivating relationships, organization, flexibility, and initiative."
good,"My time at Nvr has been both challenging and rewarding. I started as a customer care associate in the warranty department call center, I was promoted to a senior associate and then promoted to associate accountant to help integrate a new paperless billing system. I have since been promoted to team lead and oversee 6 employees. I love that I have been able to work on multiple teams."
good,"Great company.  I worked with a staffing agency, and I think that the.  a typical day at work, what you learned management, workplace culture"
good,"Construction of production homes is a very fast-paced job.  Schedules are tight, expectations are very high, but it's an honest living.  Upper management is willing to help when it is needed, not a desk job--will be working outside 90% of the time, on job sites.  Hours can be very long though."
good,"More pros than cons, but the company could definitely use a more experienced management team. A lot of favoritism among the staff."
good,"Great job for someone with a high energy, goal-oriented outlook. Great training available but often not much chance for advancement. Must be willing to set your own goals and meet them with satisfaction and not need constant re-assurance from upper management. Great exposure to the public and wonderful satisfaction from the ability to help people make one of the most important purchases of their life."
good,The company offers great benefits and compensation . Work life balance is hard to achieve but they compensate you for this. If money is what you want great company to work for!
good,Tough environment for a young sales person/someone young in their career. Real estate in general is a difficult career path for someone fairly recently out of college.
good,"They have very high expectations. their payscale is a little lopsided but once you get into  management, the salary scale is amazing.  I worked there for 17 years and they treated me well."
good,"I have enjoyed my time employed here but theres no advancement or room for growth, I need to obtain a position with a future and not just for a paycheck."
good,"I work in a model home where customers can come and visit to make a buying decision.  It is my job to guide the customer through the buying process and help them with their option and mortgage needs.  I conduct extensive marketing follow along with maintaining an extensive backlog of buyers and also prospect for future buyers.  "
good,Lays off all the time wait forever to get hired on tell you 90 days but as long as a year it will take. Its hard labor you work in all weatjer conditions you epast in the summer and freeze in the winter they do not provide u with good weather performance clothes.
good,"I do like the job I have now, I just feel it is time for a change.  After working for this company for 19 years, I would like a change."
good,"The two best things about working at NVR are your direct co-workers and the training you receive during the process. It is not required to have any construction experience as they will train you from the ground up as if you know nothing. You do have to interact with homeowners, the sales team, the office staff and management at the same time as making sure the construction schedule and sub-contractors are doing what they are supposed to do and in a timely manner. It can be very stressful, but if you stay on your game and are organized it can be rewarding"
good,NVR was an enjoyable company to work for. They had great work hours and benefits. The only downside would be the fact that NVR is a corporate owned company so they did try to cut hours as much as possible to save labor hours.
good,"Great people to work with and great management."
good,Great Company but advancing in the company takes along time. Management can use some improvement. Personal Business spreads fast around the plant . Doctors excuses only works if you are the patient only.. N.V.R will not excuse you if it is your spouse or child.
good,"For the most part, this is an excellent company to work for. Excellent benefits and good opportunity for growth within the company. Very professional enjoyable work environment."
good,"Overall, there were no problems with the work environment. The people were friendly and interacted with one another in a courteous and respectful manner. The main drawback was that some decisions that were made in the division office went counter to the general directives of the company and it created opportunities for work that was ultimately fruitless and resource consuming."
good,"The days can be fast-paced and stressful taking calls, troubleshooting issues, and facilitating calls. The company can be a great place to work for and good benefits."
good,"great pay, long hours.  ryan homes in-house lender. serviced ryan home sales people in the sale of ryan homes. good underwriting. mlocal sales manager was poor. no human relation skills."
good,NVR is a solid company that offers great opportunities.  It is a fast paced organization that demands consistent performance.  NVR provides the opportunity to work for the fourth largest homebuilder in the U.S.
good,I worked at this company for almost 6 years before getting laid off. This place was very fast paces but it kept you in shape as well. I made a lot of friends at this company and still talk to many of them to this day.
good,"Time management was key because of how busy we were so that was helpful to learn and adjust to. Management was unprofessional and micromanaging at times. The hardest part of my job was doing monotonous tasks every day, while they are beneficial to the progress of production, they are not by any means problem solving tasks or projects involving brain storming and team work..which is something I am looking for."
good,I was a production intern with NVR and I really enjoyed the experience. It was very hands on and you spent every day on the work site learning about home building processes and how to keep organized and on schedule. My managers were helpful and supportive. They were also very flexible with me about time off and let me spend the latter half of the summer in sales to learn more about that - which I loved. It was a unique experience and I learned a lot. DIfficult at first if construction is completely new to you.
good,Not  bad place  to work. I did enjoy my time with nvr but unfortunately I had to move on. I  really enjoy unloading the railroad cars and stocking the lines. Felt like our success definitely depended on my timely tasks
good,"cut wood load kitchens heavy lifting "
good,"*Salary based on 45 hours per week"
good,"As the summary suggests, I didn't know what task I would have to take on. While I was to primarily work on creating lender profiles, I also had to address the questions and issues presented by branches and corporate departments. I learned several aspects of the mortgage industry. My coworkers are always very helpful and teamwork is important to make our customers happy."
good,"6am-2pm 5 day a week schedule; physically engaging. Learned safety of equipment such as nail-guns, staple guns, press machines, and saw machinery."
good,great place great bossess great people great distance to work and again economy brougth the company down and some of us end it up with lay off
good,I really enjoy the ability to work remotely. I am traveling throughout Northeast Ohio to varous communities I am responsible to work on my own.  I love meeting with our customers who are excited about building a new home and having to earn their business with NVR.
good,"Fun and great place to work though you have to watch the other employees, they are always looking to stab you in the back to try and get ahead.  Very cpmetitive work place.  Long hours."
good,"Well compensated job but you will have to work, they keep their teams small and focus on efficiency to keep the costs of their homes low. I would recommend working here if you are a hard worker because you will be compensated fairly."
good,A typical day at work is very fast paced. It is important to be able to multitask. I learned to be organized and tis job helped me to improve my problem solving skills. The managers were a little overbearing.
good,"Working for NVR, inc. was a pleasant experience for me, just not the type of work that keeps me in a position long. The management and leads were knowledgeable and understanding. Teamwork is a real asset to this company."
good,"NVR is a great place to work, but I will say it is not for the laid back type. The work environment is very demanding and stressful at times. Long hours during their night shift. It is a place of production, so numbers and performance does matter. Even with that said I did enjoy my time at this company even though it was short. Advancements are there but require hard work and time to get them."
good,I gained a multitude of knowledge and experience during my time at Ryan Homes!  I enjoyed my time there and am grateful for the support and appreciated everyone  that was part of the team!!  Being organized and having good communication kills are a must!  I resigned only because I had to relocate!
good,"They set you up for success. Strong financially stable company. Quality builder. You will become proficient in reading blueprints, contracts, sales process, etc."

good,"Good compensation and benefits for real estate builder sales.  There is a lot pressure to produce sales.  Management and other sales reps are generally supportive.  The job was varied in terms of marketing, selling and administrative duties.  Worked three weekends per month.  Employees in general pretty young.  Much technical information to be learned in order for job to be performed well."
good,"This company allowed me to come into an entry-level position, and after learning about the customers and company, I was given the opportunity to grow in the direction that I wanted to - network engineering. After three years, I was able to move to Tier 3 Network Engineering, and spread my wings in my dream field."
good,"Great management."
good,"NVR had a wonderful management team that constantly asked for feedback.  I appreciated the opportunities and the trust and responsibility I was given.  However, I wasn't always happy with the monotony of the daily tasks and the lack of variety.  I learned a substantial amount from this company and matured as an employee.  Unfortunately I had to leave this position because I moved to another state."
good,"Less turnover than most builders sas teams. As far as compensation, the floor I higher but the ceiling is lower than others. The product is solid and I feel good standing behind it."
good,"I wish I could have continued with NVR. I am never one to quit a job. "
good,"good hours"
good,worked there for 10 years. Many good people left the company and things change on how they ran the company. It was a good job. I am now going to work for myself as a contract settlement officer. This way I get to work for many different companies and have flexible hours so I can continue to take care of my mother who also has a tumor in her brain
good,Great place to work. They have great benefits.  We also recieve incentives through out the year. Very upbeat environment. Alot of mental thinking such as measuring. Great place to learn basic skills.
good,Great company & management. Sales has LONG hours but great income. Rewarding through building process & homeowners loving their home. Beautiful communities.
good,"Good company in a competitive industry.  A performance company with high expectations for execution and timeliness.  Excellent benefits, particularly for those with stock options.."
good,The commission structure is such that you are stifled the better you do.  Overall great company to work for.  Down side you can be relocated in an instant with no warning and could be a location that is not feasible for you personally
good,I wentered through the orientation with no problem and it has a friendly atmosphere to work in. The coworkers get along well with each other and are great people.
good,"If the housing market didn't crash when it did, I would be happy to still be working for them. Overall, I really enjoyed the company. Great benefits and bonus opportunities."
good,Very competitive and results driven company. Compensation is well above that of industry averages. Advancement is very slow unfortunately. Project managers are expected to manage several facets of the production process. The most important task is to balance customer service and site management in order to achieve maximum scores on quality ratings and customer surveys.
good,"Typically as an IT Helpdesk Tech, you essentially serve as the face of IT. Depending upon your skill and willingness to learn, you can possibly move into more advanced Help Desk positions. However, the type advancement is limited due to the size of the IT Dept. During my time with the company, it has taught me one facet of how a larger volume of inbound calls are handled. I've also been able to expand my knowledge of how a larger corporate network operates. The co-workers in general are excellent to work with, but as with any company they aren't without their flaws. The hardest part of the job is the complexity of their daily processes (from adding a new user to replacing a PC) - it is far more complex than it should be. The most enjoyable part is I am challenged on a daily basis - either by the complexities of the job or new issue I hadn't faced before."
good,"Liked being on first shift"
good,"I had decided to move on and start my own business. I practiced many learning skills, and management skills."
good,"it was enjoyable for the most part. friendly staff, the company did a lot to show thanks to its employees through outtings and company picnics as well as the benefits it provided"
good,Fast paced training can be very stressful. Potential for advancement within company is excellent.  Work/life balance excellent. Great benefits. Great compensation possible for self motivated individual.
good,"The atmosphere of NVR was your typical IT department with cubicles and a busy environment. The dress code was casual but strict in terms of tucking your shirt in. The management was excellent in making sure the employees were doing alright and always made sure your voice has been heard regarding an issue with the company policies. "
good,"I worked at Fairfax, VA office. The team is make this place is fun, everyone is there to help and got your back. I really enjoyed working for NVR, they have good benefits and company stocks."
good,It's a good place to work. Good balance between work and home life as well as a well kept morale and work intuitive attitude. Jobs are goal driven so you know what you need to achieve everyday. Associates are easy to get along with and driven towards a common goal.
good,"The production side is fast paced but beats sitting behind a desk.  The training process is likely the best in the industry but does take a while to complete.  Once completed, the money is really unmatched."
good,Awesome growth potential. Management is fun and laid back. High expectation allow you to push yourself to achieve more. Long term career if you can handle pressure. 
good,"NVR delivers on the ability for an employee to create a better career for themselves.  It is built on a foundation of C.I. and seeks strengthening and change throughout it's ranks.  So if a manufacturing employee can see positive change, communicate this improvement and demonstrate this as part of their character, then they can go places.  Employee safety is held at the highest level of focus."

ATLAS automates complete sales, Contracts and back office modules of homebuilding portfolio for NVR homes."
good,"At NVR i started my day with giving task to my team for that day ."
good,I could at time be good depending on the day.  Sometimes locations in the Winter being in a model home alone could be a little uneasy since one was there alone.  Otherwise found it most interesting in meeting with the public and helping them with the information they needed and guide them through the house explaining all the advantages of purchasing a house in that particular area.  Th majority of the sales reps were courteous.
good,"Working at NVR was great pay, but was very fast paced work. somedays it was hard working there because it takes so much out of you, but it was a good job to work at"
good,"From this internship, I learned a great deal of Network Engineering. Management treated me as a fellow engineer and gave me challenging tasks throughout the summer."
good,NVR is an industry leader and offers fantastic sales training.  They have an incredible group of hard working employees.  It offers a great team environment and strong compensation.
good,"My day starts at 9am EST and i have learnt lot of things at NVR. I had lot of support from my leads and co workers. Whenever i faced any difficulty in my work, my lead and co workers were always there with helping hands."
good,Anyone could consider themselves fortunate to be employed by this great company! The management truly values their employees and does all they can to assist. Great training program. Office staff extremely helpful and pleasant.

good,• Involved in the development of Sales Navigator 2 project.
good,Was given so many opportunities with this company. Learned alot. The only negative was not getting paid  for the different jobs I did after the company downsized.  I took pride in the jobs I did and performed them in a timely manner.
good,"NVR has a great work culture, and a very supportive environment. It can be competitive at times, especially with such a high stake in sales. There are many employee activities put on by the company which helps to increase morale and bonding between coworkers."
good,"I have an amazing ""work family"" at NVR.  We all work hard and work together so that we are able to achieve our goals, both individually and as a team.  We all value a strong work-life balance, and family is very important.  My managers and very experienced and approachable, and have helped me grow as a young manager as well.  I can honestly say that I enjoy coming to work each day."
good,"Great group of people! Makes work fun! Stable six figure income, plenty of room for advancement, and great overall culture."
good,A great work environment with wonderful talented people. Top notch training and development and management that promoted advancement and growth.
good,Great Co-Workers
good,Great people and awesome training! Exciting and fun place to work with many opportunities for growth and advancement. Competitive but collaborative sales environment.
good,"Challenging, Rewarding - great training and benefits.   Very demanding to approve loans for all buyers.   Great co-workers and management"
good,"Scheduled"
good,"I worked in one of the regional offices and really enjoyed working with my coworkers, the collaborative efforts, and the work I was expected to do. There's no culture stuff (occasional lunch and holiday party but nothing beyond that) if that's something that's important to you. The only thing I didn't like was, in my role, there was little room for advancement without moving to a corporate or sales role but I do know other departments have more of an opportunity here."
good,NVR is a good job for a man with a construction background even carpentry you build prefab walls and roof trusses to be shipped out for Dan Ryan Homes and other builders Building Homes long hours and good pay just the hours don't cut it with getting kids up for school in the morning
good,"It was a great place to work. Great staff to work with. Real quick pace. Show up do your job, and things went great. Great benefits, employee owned stock."
good,Ryan Homes is an amazing machine.  Their process and communities are always well done.  Ryan Homes has communities everywhere you want to live or work.
good,Good people to work with. Fun knowledgeable people that do not mind sharing information. Tight nit group.  Good supervisors that know how to lead.
good,"In my late 30s, and was going for a slight career change and a move from NC. I applied and got a job offer in the Fairfax branch. Upon moving I found the company to be an inviting culture. There were some hurdles that seemed to get smoothed out as I have continued to work there. I.e.: job training, and job security (not knowing that I was doing well). Turnover wasn't much. Transferred branches for the opportunity to advance, and was the best decision. The new office is great - all very friendly, more laid back, and seemingly more productive, albeit - a much younger staff."
good,Always a constant battle between day and swing shift. its a numbers game. have to hit footage goal. sometimes run out of material. some managers spend more time in their office than they should. other than that its a fun energetic place to work.
good,"Having worked for other national builders I am impressed with the level of professional team members, the resources committed to each discipline and the level of execution of a great product. It is an organization that I am proud to be associated with."

good,"Many opportunities within company to advance career. "
good,"Great management, provided thorough training, long hours during month-end but wonderful place to work at. Work-load is quite high but it is always changing and interesting so you never get bored."
good,"This was the job I had hoped to retire from. Great environment and wonderful colleagues. Ryan Homes really believes in helping an individual grow and accomplish their career goals. The benefits are outstanding. I would give anything to still be working there...but the housing market the way it was, I was laid off."
good,I really enjoyed working for NVR.  It payed well and had great benefits.  The company manufactors and distributes prefabricated homes. I worked on the panel side and we were responsible for building all the walls that went to the home. I moved up very quickly through the positions and eventually was the lead framer overseeing a group of six or seven guys.  This was a very physically demanding job with a goal that was set to keep guys moving.  I was always looking for ways to make things easier on the team and to increase our efficiency. I learned nothing is to small of an idea to help achieve these goals.  Unfortunatly in the winter the housing market slows and there is a high layoff rate every year.  The company cared about it's employees and offered many great benefits.
good,"First job in construction. Great time ,good company , very good training , good pay and bonus. Outstanding benefits. Spent time in sale  and service department which added to a learning experience."
good,"NVR provided the opportunity to work your own pipeline, meaning you could choose how you scheduled customer appointments, and could work remotely or from a model home most days.  You would be required to attend meetings in the office, and it was good to put in ""face time"" with your processors, but as long as you were hitting your goals and checking in, management was very flexible and accommodating."
good,"Always kept up to date with the Sales Process"
good,"very repetitive work."
good,"Loved that job, Great hours, Great people, I learned a great amount through working for NVR.I worked in the exterior door department, learned how doors where put together and additions that were added as well."

good,"Perform morning inspection, schedule work to be done, go on several service related appointments. Attend weekly managers meetings. Return customers calls and make appointments in a timely manner."
good,I enjoyed working for NVR Mortgage.  It is a large company with many different departments and branches.  They like to promote from within if possible.
good,"I enjoyed this company. I started there a temporary receptionist and after my contract I was hired with the company to be a Sales assistant in there Model Homes. I had a very good salary and benefits to match. There was room for advancement within that company. "

good,NVR is a great company to work for. I have had the opportunity to work with them for a little over 15 years. The most enjoyable part of the job has been the interaction with all of the great employees.
good,"I was hired by NVR Mortgage as a Loan Processor in October 2016 and my experience has met and exceeded my expectations in many ways. When speaking with the outsourced recruiter from StraussGroup in Buffalo, NY, I was unsure if what they were telling me was true because he is technically not an NVR employee. Glad to find that he knew more about what I was could expect working for NVR than I every imagined. He guided me through the process by scheduling my interviews, setting me up with NVR's assessment, talking through my offer letter with me, and even calling me the day before I started to make sure I was ready to go! The 3rd-Party perspective he provided me helped me tremendously with acclimating to the work-life here at NVR. "
good,One of the best companies to work for. I worked in model homes as a sales assistant. My responsibilities included insuring the homes were clean and inviting. I welcomed potential home buyers and provided a tour of the home. We then discussed credit worthiness and home needs. I reviewed credit applications and determined credit worthiness. I set appointments with potential home buyers to further discus purchase options after credit eligibility was approved.

good,"NVR was a warm and welcoming environment that would appeal to any mortgage professional looking to join a great team! The company is top tier with there commitment to excellence..but more than that..they honestly care about their employees and want to give everyone the tools they need to succeed. My co-workers were all hard-working in their roles but not a day went by where we didn't all share a good laugh in the office! Like any job, the work is hard and requires good attention to detail along with a strong ability to multi-task. I had the great priveledge of doing what I love and being surrounded by positive, encouraging people who truly supported each other to bring the loans to closing. It is a rare thing to find a work environment that allows you the opportunity for professional growth along with a little fun while meeting your goals. I tend to write long stories when I'm expressing myself, I'm just passionate about my work! ... I'll give one help-ful hint to any new Processors that want to impress from the get-go...Include detailed Memo's on every file for your Underwriters..they really appreciate the extra effort and it makes there jobs so much easier..you will be a superstar out of the gate!"
