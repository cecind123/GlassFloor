rating,review
bad,all about the spanish. I feel like I dont fit.  I feel like an outsider. Not able to learn new things to move up in the company.Like my job and some of the people. I get paid less then most. This is so not fair.
bad,Immature management - not professional dealing with workers - always have stock rupture- downsizing every year  - not recommended at all especially for people with experience
bad,"As a contract employee, we were often treated poorly. We were constantly forced to compete with each other to earn a permanent position. We were denied many opportunities."
bad,Nothing gets done.  Endless meeting.  Told to not put cyber security concerns in email to avoid paper trails. I can’t believe a large company like Abbvie cyber security issues.
bad,As soon as I and other nurses took medical leave of absences were either laid off of or put on suspension on our return to work date . Very disheartening for how hard we world for the company
bad,"Do not work for Abbvie if you want to live a satisfying life.  Their management is horrendous and they allow bullying, discrimination as well as terrible quality of life."
bad,"This company has a terrible style of management by assigning you to report to people who's position at the company doesn't even fall under, or pertain to the group you are working for. "
bad,"If you like to have no life, please apply at AbbVie.  The company culture is ancient and carried over from Abbott.  No work life balance AT ALL.. Unless you come in as a senior manager or above there are no real good perks besides wasting your time and life for pennies on the dollar."
bad,"poor management who took care of old timers even if they broke the rules. As a result, the weak people got into a position of power and the franchise that I worked in became the last performing franchise."
bad,"If you have no call center experience and you just need a year as a resume builder, go for it. But if you have experience, never come here. The management does not expect work life balance and you are expected to do 10 peoples jobs for $11 an hour. You learn a lot, how to use up and coming systems and the call center culture, etc. "
bad,This is a great opportunity with a great company.where you will be challenged and developed.  I enjoyed developing  new technical skills.
bad,This place doesn't consider a contractor as a person.  If they offer you a contract don't take it.  They will work you as long as they can without offering you a full time position and keep making promises to you.
bad,"No vale de nada el ser humano para Abbvie, solo importa vender a cualquier costo"
bad,"Non professional environment, Terrible managers and terrible work life balance.  No training; expected to hit the ground running without any job specific training."
bad,"The HEOR and medical teams are vastly overstretched and under resourced. People are leaving all the time and morale is low. I know the grass is always greener, but other departments like marketing affairs are generously resourced. Wouldn't really be a problem if it wasn't for the blame culture between departments. Middle management is also struggling which means those at the coal face get a hard ride. The hardest part of the job is constantly having to show off my skills rather then get on with the actual workload. The most enjoyable part is opportunity to learn -the learning curve is steep and the penalties are severe (blame + less opportunities) but this throws you in the deep end quite early on. The pay is not inline with industry standard but this is taboo."
bad,"Where dreams go to die. No hope for getting hired in pharmacy solutions. Contractors treated like dirt. Poor stressful training. One lead is a rude heffer who shuffles around miserably, dresses down and never smiles. Very bad politics and culture."
bad,Very Tense and thankless jobs. Order taker is the workplace culture. Everyone shouting to you missed the date. I have to report to 10 different project manager. Expectation to work overtime.
bad,"Pharmacy Solutions is high school in repeat, not what you know , but who you know in order to advance. They want every employee to look, and act the same- the company treats people that are not yes people horrible."
bad,Bad culture with bad managers - A lot of bureaucracy with no or bad leadership.   This company is a sinking ship and people are thrown off in the worst way.
bad,"This company’s leaders do not walk the talk. They aspire to make a remarkable impact but all they really care about is making money. The communications team is full of selfish, cutthroat people — although there are a few exceptions to the rule (and many of them have left). They pay well so people won’t leave."
bad,"Not a good place to work, very stressful. Management not trained to manage senior people. They want to see how high you will jump for them at any given moment"
bad,Just don’t ever work there. You will never advance as a full time or contracted employee. You dreams will die and you will become a misanthrope. The supervisors in pap have no education and are a gas light culture. This place reeks favoritism. HR is a joke too hence a few managers had to leave because they couldn’t fix anything but made it worse.
bad,"My department was terrible!  It was like I was back in High School. It's not about what you know, it's who you know.  More concerned about productivity than they are about accuracy."
bad,Management is the worst. Managers are more worried about asskissing than getting the right solutions. Micromanagement at very best. Probably the worst place i have ever worked
bad,This company needs a lot of work internally they don’t put there employees first. Once you leave they don’t want to accept you working else where in the company. They don’t promote from within and they let people who’s been there forever walk all over new people and treat each other like trash.
bad,"Hard to get into AbbVie and once in then hard to move up. People stay in the same position for years despite having qualifications or degrees. There is something fundamentally wrong in pharmacy solutions. In my group after five years, after dozens of people, only three people ever got promoted to other departments. Development is a complete sham. I’m glad I left when I could because I gave up trying to make an effort or impression simply making managers look good who were clueless... employees often step in to answer manager questions or help with other simple tasks.  Manager turnover rather high too. Only one manager knows what their doing. The culture isn’t good mainly because many in techs or csr roles are never given chance to move up or shadow others. Contractors are even discriminated against if trying to apply for another Internal contractor roles. Someone needs to blow the whistle on hiring practices here. Definite EEO violations. They always decide who they want when there is a position open because they groom certain people so no one is given a fair chance. It’s a facade to make it look like interview quota is good and just. When they decide who they want, they quickly filter people and give you fake feedback or set your interview up so you fail. Asking how many projects you have done or so and so unrealistic questions because they should know limitations in your role especially if tied to a desk or phone. Shame on AbbVie for letting such practices run rampant. There are so many talented and educated people in pharmacy solutions who are stuck because of poor culture"
bad,"Not a good place for US based IT professionals, very biased towards hiring those from India and it’s hard to understand conversations in meeting as most are from india"
bad,"The inability to share knowledge for fear of being replaced would be the number one downfall of this great company. People in leadership roles do not help develop their employees and do not share their wealth of knowledge. The culture is also very much “be quiet, do your job, and do not complain”."
bad,It is no longer a job I look forward to. The stress is never-ending and overtime requirements are unrealistic. There is no homelife-work balance. Management is incredibly unorganized and all over the place. There is little room for advancement in my department. The department is very poorly run.
bad,Very poor management all employees kiss butt just to stay around also racist they can't stand to see other minorities doing better then them also backstabbers will smile in your face train u for 1 day then go and report your performance to the production manager to get you fired and he is a fat slob worse job every i would never recommend the AbbVie in Northchicago off Waukegan Rd for anyone
bad,"The worst company I have ever worked for. If you don't schmooze and play the office politics games you will never be promoted no matter how hard you work, your commitment level to the company, or how skilled you are. I can't think of a single positive thing to say about this company and would love to get out as soon as possible."
bad,no room for growth and learning for someone who is brought in as a consultant. failure to give credit where it needs to be given. even though the department needs help the management won't hire
bad,It's an okay place to work if you need good money to support yourself. The work can take it's toll on your mental and physical health depending on what your roll is.
bad,"Because I had not so great experience but I would still recommend AbbVie if you have a great team. Unfortunately, I was not so lucky. Although I did learn a lot in short experience."
bad,The product IPSWITCH  gives users the ability to share files within the company  and outside the company firewalls usually for 3rd party vendors to update and retrieve documents in a secure area. No limit on file sizes - disk space was always a concern.  A typical day at work would be setting up new users and creating the environment for each dept needs and use. The hardest part of the job was managing resources without clear and defined roles of who would be responsible for outcome deliverables. The most enjoyable part of the job was providing satisfaction and quick turn around time to Customers and as an alternative to the standard MQ messaging environment which was both costly and cumbersome for small business units within the organization.
bad,Management very focused on vendettas against each other. Same people get promotions and usually the least qualified for the job. Corporate culture is management does no wrong and employees cause all problems themselves.
bad,"Working 50-80 hrs a week is common. Nights and weekends are expected."
bad,"Management of Studies, being able to do my daily tasks and accomplish my daily goals. It was a good place to work due to that time went by fast and my work was great!"
bad,"Company as a whole is excellent in terms of compensation and benefits, which it needs to be if you work in Access and Reimbursement Services (formerly Pharmacy Solutions) as that will become your only motivation to continue to show up every day. Astoundingly abysmal leadership, hired based on nepotism rather than qualifications, experience, knowledge, education, or actual leadership abilities.  Nobody is even really sure what it is they do all day outside of counting how many minutes the employees take to go to the bathroom and running productivity reports. They have no ability to answer questions about the actual work or HR related issues. Zero work life balance, years on end of mandatory OT which would be unnecessary if leadership applied logic and reason to processes, focused on fixing the terrible systems, or implemented things that are proven to increase productivity (eg working from home, ending OT by properly staffing and training) instead of micro managing like the power tripping control freaks they are. And the work systems and platforms - absolute joke. Employees are treated like factory machines (and have actually been referred to as such by leadership in analogies), nothing is ever good enough, and all the focus is constantly on what employees are doing wrong, going so far as to blame them for the years on end of mandatory OT (as if everyone is slacking off, which most are not).  Forget making good suggestions or giving feedback on ways to improve processes, or anything else for that matter, as it WILL be reflected negatively in your reviews and in whether or not"
bad,"Very hard for advancement if you are not in PDP program."
bad,"Good benefits but if you are not favorite then don’t work there. Micromanagement and faviralizm with toxic managers no place for advancement."
bad,Offers an opportunity to get familiar with Clinical Research and Pharma.  Little opportunity to move upward and out of the dept within company.  Mgt is lacking.
bad,"DAILY WORK"
bad,"It is an unhappy experience at AbbVie. It is a place where the politics have taken over. The company strives for new culture but it is hard to change it. "
bad,35 percent turnover in my area. Poor development for mid-level career. My supervisor actually called me 6 different bad names in one conversation ineffective senior management with lack of subject area knowledge.
bad,"too much politics going on, culture based on complaints and negativity, instead of positive feedback.   Never had new hardware for projects.   too many projects piled on at the same time and no time allocated to complete them all."
bad,"Interesting place to work. If you are popular, you're are good.  One wrong move, and you're nonexistent.  It's best not to voice your opinion...just go along with the program."
bad,Poor management non caring your just a number...disorder on the get go.. no collaboration with employees. Manager was not educated in clinical studies.
bad,"I get along with my co-workers well enough but I am a contract employee.  I have heard they keep their contact employees as contract employees as long as possible, and when they cannot extend the contract any longer the employee gets furloughed for thirty days."
bad,"Lots of people are just interested in keeping there little kingdom in power."
bad,"Limited transparency, low pay, high workload, great work life balance. Every man for themselves, job security rocky, that's about it"
bad,New company with old ways. Poor management. No advancement unless you're friends with a manager. Average benefits. VPs in place that have no business in the position and rule like a dictator.
bad,"HR is of no assistance to employee's being mistreated for racism, sexism. religion etc. People are being fired based on these grounds by managers due to the aforementioned and no one listens or looks into the situation even after it's been reported on several occasions. The job itself was great but the two levels of management above me were some of the worse I've seen in their treatment of employee's. Perhaps, if I had been in another area of the company I might have stayed."
bad,"If you're looking for a mediocre place to work, here it is.  Beware of extremely sub-par HR coworkers (and policies).  There are a LOT of corporate politics at this company.  The C Suite boasts a plethora of disappointing individuals who have no interest in making AbbVie a great place to work.  It's fear-based.  I was also paid quite a bit less than my male colleagues.  Every year they're voted a ""great place to work"" and I never understood it (no one else did either)."
bad,"Bienvenue chez Abbvie !"
bad,"Its all about who you know and whether or not they like you.  If you make the wrong person angry at you, then your career is over.  ""behaviors"" are valued more than actual results.  At any time you may be reorganized out of the company."
bad,This is a very stressful company to work at and the culture is cut throat. The benefits are great which is good because you are going to need them due to the stress of working at this company.
bad,People don't leave companies they leave managers that is all we need to say. Managers should be experienced or trained prior to managing people.  Training was not in place or even remotely professional.
bad,"Môi trường làm việc ồn,độc hại"
bad,A typical large company to work for.  Many great people within the business and there are many good managers and VP's.  But the culture is a decade behind and the management at large generally sees no reason to change course.
bad,The project I was on was short term and didn't give me enough time to get a sense of the culture.  The people I met and worked with were kind and hard working.
bad,"The co-workers seem to be welcoming at first, but after a while, they start to cheat chat behind your back. "
bad,"Great benefits and the company culture they are striving for is great however, old Abbott employees that came over are not onboard thus making it a horrible place to work. The managers are not prepared to manage projects or people; the culture is largely surrounded by folks pointing blame at others and  projects suffers and the cycle continues"
bad,"Abbvie uses its location heavily to its advantage as there are no other large pharma companies based in the area. They use this to leverage low pay and posses the mentality they do not care if you stay or leave. Upward movement within the company is stagnant and many directors and managers are hired from external sources. Extremely high turn over and require you to be a contract employee with no benefits, sick days , or paid time off for a year prior to being hired. Great for a brief pit stop then move on to an actual career with upward opportunities. Terrible at talent retention. Focus more on incoming college students than employees that already work there."
bad,"worst management ever. my manager, supervisor, and trainer were all full of bs. a typical day at work consisted of confusion and arguments. i learned to never work here again. management here was a nightmare. my coworkers were decent. the hardest part of the job was dealing with all of the stupidity. the most enjoyable part of the job was the money. i guess they pay you well just to put up with their bs."
bad,"Abbvie, as a whole, is a a wonderful company, however, my department is very poorly managed, which causes unneeded stress and a high turn over rate. It is INCREDIBLY micro-managed."
bad,Currently in the department that I work there have been some on and off turmoil.  The moral is low at the current moment.  It is hard to advance.  I do enjoy the work that I do.
bad,Enjoy time leading people at this organization.  It's a large matrixed organization which is focused on improving the culture.
bad,"I enjoyed working at Abbvie, however I was stuck with a very angry and hostile manager. I could not take it and left. I can not comprehend how this person stays in their job, much less is a supervisor."
bad,me desarrollo como especialista en la compañía y recorro barios puntos del país
bad,"Wonderful working with AbbVie, even if it was for a short time (on contract Management was especially understanding (as a working parent) and pro work life balance. Work was very specific as with any Data entry / Information sensitive position."
bad,"In my experience as a contractor here, the work environment is kind of hostile and competitive. I saw several people come and go throughout my time as a contractor. Departments don't really get a long and it kind of felt like a cut throat environment."
bad,The organization is very solid and is going through a great deal of change from Abbott to Abbott and Abbvie.  Though the change is going well and they are looking to continue to change.
bad,"Pre-planning months in advance is necessary as individual innovation and motivation is quickly killed under the weight of bureaucracy. "
bad,"There are no promotional opportunities here.  Its sad when I don't see people that look like me.  If yo are not in management, there is no place to go."
good,"If you ever worked at Abbott,it's the same culture as AbbVie.  So much for spinning off a new company with the hope of doing things differently.  Only problem was that the Management at AbbVie came from Abbott.  Only certain favorites were able to work from home at a moments notice, while others had to beg to go to a dentist appointment because your from tooth fell out.  We had several people who were doing more than 1 job and it was expected of them.  as a matter of fact we had 1 person in particular who was actually doing 3 jobs at once.  There was a lot of ""throwing people under the bus"" when management did something wrong."
good,"To avoid conflicts of interest, contractors should not be put in a position to rate other contractors.  Ideas should be better thought through by the leadership teams from the top down."
good,I was mainly responsible for change management of all the mobile applications and consolidation of different MDM solutions. I designed an application to automate a lot of the the change management controls.
good,"I left my previous employer to work at Abbvie hoping to branch out of Pharmacy Solutions and to advance my career, later found out that this was impossible. Abbvie has a lot of temps/contractors and when there's an opening for a position they hire the contractor but not a current employee. Which is fine, but gives no opportunity to current employees wanting to advance their careers."
good,Was hired as a line tech. Turned out that they wanted to train me as a line tech and a line operator. So in the 6 months I was there I wasn’t certified to do either since they kept switching me from one job duty to the next daily. And then they started with mandatory overtime with weekends also. Felt like an indentured servant and not an employee there.
good,"I enjoyed my position. The most enjoyable part of my job was creating and learning how to make many different types of foods.  My work was so thoroughly completed, that I advanced from dishwasher to deli lead in a matter of two months .Not only did I efficiently do my job, I also trained new employees in the dishwashing room, as well as, effectively running the deli. My customers were very pleased with how I created and distributed their meals. I had a great rapport with my supervisor, customers and co-workers. A typical day at Abbvie was setting up the area in which I worked and being prepared for the breakfast and lunch rush hours. I learned many different ways of making salads. I also learned about many different types of cheese, as well as lunch meats and how to create many different sub sandwiches. The workplace culture was diverse. I worked with multiple nationalities, allowing me to learn traditions and languages of others. I think the hardest part of my job was being able to take and complete so many orders in a efficient time because I ad to take and make orders by myself."
good,"Being a contractor at AbbVie for 2 years was not a good idea. Nothing wrong with being a contractor at all, helps you get your foot in the door, and several have been hired as employees in a short time. Unfortunately this just wasn't the case for me. If you are hired as a contractor, don't stay in the same position for more than a year. There are other opportunities waiting."
good,"Cut throat corporate life. No true room for growth in terms of years with the company. It’s so competitive, it’s hard to actually work because you’re worried about making the wrong move. It’s strict but seems laid back but great rep."
good,As a consultant I was very effective and was acknowledged as a valued contributor to the IT organization. I was not treated that way as an employee in a new department under different management.  My direct manger was threatened by my presence and rather than engage with me to partner on a shared goal.  My manager shut down and removed herself from that and began to look for any reason to discount my actions.
good,"Great Example of the peter principle at work. Good pay and benefits, however quality of life, working environment and work life balance are all areas where this company fails miserably. Management is clueless about creating a vibrant, healthy and creative work environment. Tons of policies and process heavy."
good,"Some of the employees I worked with were under-qualified therefore, they became very defensive.  Embarrassed people in meetings, etc.  I noticed it more with the contractors than employees."
good,"I believe AbbVie is an excellent company to work for. I personally didn't have the best management team. However, I had great interactions with other department managers."
good,No room for advancement. Lack of professional management. Unpredictable and long working hours. Unreasonable expectations of employees. Pay is low. Concepts of work life balance are ignored.
good,"This was the worst position that I had at this company. Worked there or 27 years got fired for a maintenance person not asking for a hot work permit. Management did not care that day shift did the minimum amount of work that needed to be performed and expected 2nd shift to make up the work. If you said something you had a bad attitude.  The pay was great but I would have rather cleaned toilets every day than work for this mismanagement. Also, the work-life balance is the worst."
good,"Productive, fast paced, great team of colleagues. Must be quick study able to run with new projects and assignments with little to no training. Fun culture events."
good,"When hired as a contractor, overtime was optional except alternating Saturdays, but after two weeks of training, started to have to do at least 3 days of early or late overtime and haven’t had a Saturday off since February. Only way to get a Saturday 100% off was to work for 12 days straight. And if you come in or stay for overtime, the breaks are about 6 hours in between"
good,"Decent company with decent benefits and if you are lucky, a pension and 401k.  This is a very fast paced company with lots to offer in the realm of job diversity.  You can move and grow within the company.  Unfortunately many of the managers come in using this company as a stepping stone.  They come with education and no people skills.  They seek to make a name for themselves by saving money with no consideration of the impact their decisions have on employees.  This is based on a lack of experience. "
good,"I was given an opportunity to start as an administrative assistant but i was a contractor so I did not receive any benefits, could not work over-time, and was excluded from a lot of activities. I was trying my hardest to understand all aspects of the job and did my best- but that was not good enough. I did not get the training or the help I needed and was let go after just a couple months telling me that my assignment ended. I could not go back on the premises to retrieve my belongings and when I did, some of my things had been missing. Everyone was very snooty and rude so to me it was a hostile environment."
good,"Due to the demand of becoming the leading pharmaceutical company with the top selling drug, HUMIRA, there is a demand of employees to get the job done and work many hours to get it done.  There is no limit to the hours you work. Even the managers are overworked and burned out."
good,Office politics at its best. Employee voice is not heard unless supports the manager of the line of business. Annual reviews are not for mutual benefits of employee and company but only for the company. Employee career path is not a priority for the company
good,"If you are a Administrative Asst. make sure you have a Manager that supports you and your skill development and goals. Working at Abbvie can be great if you have a Team, and/or Manager that supports your growth, or if you have worked with individual before at Abbott, otherwise you can get stuck in the same role, same responsibilities and no room for growth. You get stuck in a role with a non-creative Manager, that is only concern about self. Therefore, when it's time for changes that could affect your role and staying with the company, you are hung out to dry. Abbvie should pay attention to all workers to make sure all are being treated fairly. I really don't think Abbvie is completely aware of all the mistreatment that is done, especially to the Admins."
good,"The overall company is good, certain areas are more politically charged, business services was not a good place to work. some leadership styles do not fir the with company mission."
good,"My review is based solely on management. I felt that management does not communicate with the employee as they should. I felt they left me out in important decisions. They didn't ask my opinion as often as they should. "
good,Great place to learn the politics of industry. Typical day at work is meetings. Hardest part of the job is the navigating the politics.Must drive your own development.
good,El proyecto fu corto pero se desarrolló una dos aplicaciones robustas para este cliente.
good,"Good place to start your career."
good,"The culture is about blaming and shaming and not about learning or development.  Teamwork is not a strong suit, nor is open communication.  Otherwise a great company.  Hopefully that will change."
good,"The company is a great company to work for if you are hired in, but not the best position as a contractor. All of the departments operate differently, so I can only tell you that the people at the bottom get treated like they belong at the bottom, which is not a good moral for a  company."
good,"pay is below average but they make do offer a profit sharing and bonus structure."
good,"nice place to work"
good,"Na verdade, devo tudo à AbbVie. Foi a empresa que me ensinou tudo que sei. "
good,AbbVie is alright. It really depends on which department/group you are under.
good,Overall rating: average.  Co-workers are great.  Hardest part of the job is meetin the expectations.
good,Good company and management. Nice to work here  people are nice and environment really good. and lot to learn on new technologies. little hectic work and some process in place
good,"Overall a great place to work and advance to mid management level. After that, it’s difficult to advance in field sales positions without in house HQ experience. Only available in Chicago."
good,Impossible to get a permanent employment. Very competitive and stressful work environment. No benefits including paid vacation. 
good,"Management attempted to honor the work/life balance, but did not always honor the request for time off.  Management made an effort to include employees involved in the transition to outsourcing."
good,"Management disorganized and does not provide clear direction. In theory, teamwork encouraged, but not practiced. Company provides excellent benefits, but number of vacation days could be better."
good,Excellent company if you don't mind working mindless hours with poor training opportunities. Please take a moment to review the financial health of this organization before you decide to make any type of commitment. They will likely ask you to sign a Do Not Compete contract as a condition of employment.
good,"low pay and no growth opportunities to move around, great work/life balance. Upper management is okay. Okay place to work. Not a career."
good,No comment - nothing to say about company - best way to find out is to apply and work for them yourselves. Form your own opinions.
good,"Abbvie is op zicht een prima bedrijf, de doorgroeimogelijkheden zijn sterk afhankelijk van je functie. Helaas is het voor mijn functie weinig tot geen. Ook loop ik meerdere voordelen mis in mijn functie zoals een leaseauto, bonus/ winstdeling."
good,"Friendly and helpful people, good flexibility, learned how to work as a team, fun events"
good,"After a year since the split, a lot of AbbVie employees are waiting to see when the job culture will change. "
good,"AbbVie, as a company, is inspiring; unfortunately, I had terrible managers who were seldom around/involved and who disparaged those with a solid work ethic while praising those who did next to nothing. It was very demoralizing. I would have liked to have remained with the company but was essentially blackballed despite constantly going above and beyond."
good,"The culture at Abbvie is fun and friendly, with a sense the work you're doing is impactful. However, this is overshadowed by an large workload, a virtually non-existent work/life balance, and upper management stonewalling any questions and withholding information until the last possible second."
good,Stressvolle werkomgeving waar iedereen haast heeft en overvolle agenda's. Goed salaris maar je levert veel in qua energie.
good,Science was impressive. Career development was lacking. Moving up was difficult. Very hierarchically. Not motivated or supported to be involved in science at associate level.
good,The typical workday is non-stop; this is complicated by the number of systems used to conduct and document activities.  The hardest part of the job is training on the numerous software systems; this is typically on the job  training; formal training is rare.  It is great that the company is investing so much money and resources into the development on new drugs for diseases where the needs are the greatest.
good,"You work a lot and sit in a cube all day. There is not much interaction with other people, and when there is interaction, people are not very professional."
good,Abbvie was an entry level position in my career. I learned a few things about working with animals that I have carried with me into my current position.
good,"ok place to work, very stressful, have been working mandatory OT for 1 year straight. Poor management, unable to balance work and life. Poor forcasting, will not hire enough people to take load off of other workers"
good,"No existía un director general ni director del área a la que ingresé (Comunicación). La empresa recién se creaba por lo que no hubo una inducción ni descripción de puesto. La persona que me contrató, renunció el mismo día de mi ingreso por lo que la falta de liderazgo se hizo evidente."
good,The department I was in was micro-managed.  Supervisors have their favorite people and only they get opportunity to move on.  Only people who run to upper management for little things turns out to be seen as over-achievers. People who need minimal supervision are overlooked and never given a chance to participate in big projects unless you fight for it or keep asking for more challenges.
good,"Busy early risers; highly organized and performance driven. Fast paced decisions, multi-tasking and lots of meeting, I wondered how to do the work effectively with all those meetings scheduled throughout the day."
good,"Abbvie has poor management and difficult to advance if you do not have the proper networking connections. Makes claims of the company being big on work life balance, however it is not company wide. Each manager has the right to chose how they deliver work life balance principals. Benefits are the location is great, and convenient. One of the only companies that still offers pension."
good,平和な感じではあるが、外資であっても実質は日系の印象が強かった。私は仕事がやりやすいとは感じなかった。
good,Some management team members are very nice and really qualified for their position where as someone at the management level just become manager as they spend few years in same company. Some doesn't deserve to be at their post with the kind of knowledge they have.
good,It is a new company that is still growing and slowly stabilizing in all the different department from Human Resource to the API department. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the technician and supervisor be it who ever teams you are working for.
good,"The silos are hard to break down at AbbVie and the Sales focused culture is hard to see shift into a marketing culture. If you're looking for a great marketing position, do your homework and see if they value your skills. Most of the top ranks are very successful sales professionals. Nothing wrong with this but not for everyone."
good,Excellent senior leadership. Good products and pipeline. Challenged as any large organization is to evolve and change. Work environments vary by management experience levels.
good,A good place to work. However Job security is not guaranteed due to the political situation. People are enthusiastic and hard working. Plenty of employee events thoughout the year.
good,"Great introduction to Pharma Compliance; "
good,"Who's your buddy, who's your pal. Your department is lean and overworked and the department next you is fat and the supervisors sit around planning bake-offs and cook-offs. It's ridiculous. But if you are in the in-crowd and crack the right jokes it's all good. Dumb."
good,The company recently went through a split from Abbott and is still trying to find it's ways. Lots of changes and not all are good. The company has a lot of very good people working for it and has a ton of great research.
good,Abbvie è una azienza di nuova costituzione dopo la separazione da Abbott. E' un ambiente esigente ma molto stimolante
good,"azienda solida, colleghi disponibili, lavoro tranquillo non eccessivamente stimolane"
good,"Not sure why indeed requires this, it is not applicable and I do not see how it will benefit any job seekers to require a 150 character minimum assesement"
good,It was a good experience working at AbbVie and had a very supportive manager. We developed a great working relationship and had the opportunity to establish a technology platform to assess PK in animal tissues
good,"Like many people, I was brought on as a contractor with the potential to convert to full-time. I worked for 2.5 years and was never converted, which was typical. Some of my colleagues were contractors for 5 or more years."
good,"It's just about the same as working at Abbott. Atmosphere was ok, work ethics ok, some opportunity for work/life balance, pretty hard to get in. ....."
good,Just Ok. Free lunches sometimes. HR benefits could be explained more to new employees.  PTO does not rollover which is not good for people traveling to see family overseas.
good,"In general, the experience was very positive. Particularly, there was a career plan for every employee and talents recognitions so the promotions were very often for those who achieved their goals.  In my case,  I had 2 promotions in almost 3 years."
good,"I have no comment "
good,"Abbvie was a good experience.  I am happy I had the opportunity to work with a large pharmaceutical company.  I needed more growth and my mother became ill during my time there, otherwise I might have been able to stay."
good,I have not worked at Abbvie long enough to provide a review.   I was hired as an immunology representative and have been with them since the beginning of this year.  A majority of sales representatives have worked for the company for over a decade.
good,"Great Company, but no work/life balance. "
good,"AbbVie is a research-based global biopharmaceutical company committed to developing innovative, advanced therapies for some of the world's most complex and critical conditions. The company's mission is to use its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to markedly improve treatments across four primary therapeutic areas: immunology, oncology, virology and neuroscience, as well as general medicine."
good,"Learned a great deal about clinical trials and documenting the safety aspect of events.  "
good,It has been 4 months since I joined and workstation is allocated. Now I am being asked to relocate which does not make sense as I have recently joined here.
good,"Micro-management for biotech"
good,"Abbvie is a great place to work for permanent positions, as far as contractors it isn't that great and trying to get into the company is very difficult"
good,"AbBvie is a very relaxed place to work as an intern which was nice since I was working there while still in school. However, when it came down to overall experience I would rather go to a company more serious about careers."
good,"Locaux très agréables et salariés cosmopolites, ce qui contribue à une bonne ouverture d'esprit"
good,"•	Main task is to run and operate the batch in compliance with "
good,This is a good company to work for! Great benefit package!I would recommend it to my freinds.  Some locations are more modern then others. Waukegan is nice.
good,"A typical day requires 5 doctor calls on rheumatologists."
good,I worked at Abbott for many years prior to the company becoming AbbVie. The culture and focus of the company changed dramatically when the company became AbbVie.
good,"I learned all of what I know about the Pharma industry and LIMS with the company.  I enjoyed my 14 years at Abbott/AbbVie.  Sadly, I have to move on from there."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Abbott very much, they are my client. My employer is TAPFIN, a ManpowerGroup company, a very negative working environment, they expected a lot from the employees but no appreciation. They were the worse employer I ever had, had to work so hard but in the hostile working environment."
good,"If you are looking to work with a company and stay for a really long time this company is a good fit.  Most employees have been here for well over 10 years.  "
good,"I was working for AbbVie as a contractor for 6 months only. The environment is nice and they have pretty good benefits. If you're a contractor, you will be sharing a cube with another contractor."
good,What I learned was that I no longer was a good match for this company and I wish the best for them. Co-workers are great. Hardest part was working within the new culture.
good,Po rozdělení společnosti na Abbott a AbbVie již nemám relevantní informace o této firmě
good,I was really excited to work at AbbVie and was hoping to make a career there but my boss didn't give me work to do eventhough everyone was swamped.  My bosses boss gave me projects and was positive and encouraging but my boss took away the project.
good,Fun place to work not a lot of room for growth in my department. Lots of inefficient processes and meetings.Management tended to pick favorites.
good,"Gaining access to funding for Hep C drug, under diagnosed patients, engaging with NHS customers at a high level of decision making across London & Thames Valley. Differentiating new product to gain advocacy and inclusion on treatment protocols. Access to customers difficult. Emphasis on team working across departments. Seeing patients cured of their Hep C was the most rewarding part of the job."
good,Reviewing the requirements with the business users and help the developer and test team understand the requirements. The Management had given freedom to directly interact with Business user and push them for answers. The Co-Workers were knowledgeable and helping
good,Avaliação positiva geral da empresa para exercer qualquer função
good,Great environment. Plenty to learn. Great management. Always new projects going on.
good,Good long term company.   AbbVie offers employees good benefits.  They offer many programs to enhance culture and any social activities are encouraged.
good,"Abbvie has a great working environment, but wish there was room for growth and visibility to other areas within agency."
good,"Unfortunately , career wise, they did away with my position"
good,I liked working for AbbVie all in all. I spent 5 years in total there across two positions. The one thing I disliked was how difficult it was to get promoted.
good,"I do not wish to review the company as my experiences are limited to the administrative assistant role within departments of the company. As the culture for administrative support is generally not of a supportive nature, to base a company reputation on the experiences of personnel within a particular job description can be subjective at best."
good,"The training was awesome, I learned more than I needed to for the job. The culture was welcoming, the actual department had a lot of change. The work environment for that particular team left little to be desired. The turn over rate was higher than I expected."
good,"Experis is a temp agency I go through in order to work at AbbVie.  Experis offer benefits, but they are not good.  The medical insurance is high and there is no Paid Time Off. "
good,"Job was mis-represented.  There job requirements were parochial compared to the level of responsibility that I was used to.  Also, there was little to none opportunity for career advancement."
good,"I negotiate contracts with vendors, work cross-functionally with legal, risk management, finance, and  many other areas within the company. Each day is fast-paced, stimulating work, interact with internal and external clients. The hardest part of my job is trying not to work more than 10 hrs. Per day. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to contribute to the success of our company."
good,"A great place to work but not the only place to work.  The company offers many unique opportunities and benefits but there are some downfalls with inexperienced management which could affect your life and work environment.  "
good,Good company to work for but no room for advancement. Extensive mandatory overtime requirements and management is not available at times. Need more room for growth and needs to staff according to demand.
good,"Growing Fast , strong pipeline , good stock price , attractive for careers, stakeholders engagement , learning & development"
good,"People. Passion. Possibilities."
good,Good company with integrity. As many organizations there are constant changes but all in the name of improvement and trying to stay competitive. The company has a lot of integrity compared to a lot of organizations I worked for. Can be very political when it comes to advancement and career growth but if you find the right place in the company you can do well.
good,"Too many in Upper management trying to justify position, erogant. Unable to do job paid to do. Frustrating. Marketing job, not sales job."
good,"Nothing every thing is good in workplace culture"
good,Nice place great desk space. Did not like the training was not  any in place for AbbVie to be a big company. Great environment. Some great group of people.
good,AbbVie is a sister company of Abbott Laboratories.  AbbVie started out with employees of Abbott to mirrior the way Abbott became successful.  I feel the company when I worked for AbbVie had a mediocre environment for their employees.
good,"I enjoyed my work at AbbVie. I like the varieties of work that were assigned to me."
good,"Une assez bonne entreprise pour se faire les armes."
good,"Worked 16 years here and they lowered the pay grades significantly across the board for hourly employees, therefore resulting in me being topped out at my pay grade with no room for advancement.  I’m expexed to never get a raise for the next 24 yrs of my career here? No thanks. Management doesn’t care or even try to fix this issue. I’ve never felt so disrespected by an employer in my life."
good,"Typical day includes working with dozens of customer inquiries that come up, while maintaining larger projects and daily routine that is scheduled."
good,"Regulatory changes are making this a difficult place to work, combined with only an average training program and poor management, create an environment that is difficult to succeed in."
good,"This company requires their employees and contractors to be proactive and be accountable with every decision ones make, which really pushes us to excel in every area of our expertise."
good,"Great place to learn and gain very relevant experience that will take you far in live."
good,"The benefit and salary are ok, but you need work really hard. The manager here care more about your delivery than your growth."
good,you are expected to work a full day and learned a lot from management. coworkers were very helpful and knowledgeable.
good,"-Learn may aspects of Environmental, Health and Safety role"
good,"If you do not possess a college degree, there is not much room for any advancement. Ypu are transitioned or reorged to another department and lateral move."
good,"I had little work, days were long with nothing to do.  I had to reach out to other areas for work.  Work culture was nice, laid back and great staff. Everyone was friendly."
good,"Voted best place to work for several years.  Senior management is very supportive of employees.  Good pension, 401k and profit sharing program. Very good work life balance workplace."
good,Great place to start your career. Many opportunities to learn new skills.  Organization works hard to foster the growth of entry level employees.  Great work/life balance.
good,Typical big company culture.  The company values its employees and is prone to providing lunch during working meetings.  Pace of IT development is slow compared companies doing Agile development.
good,"Great Team Work and Job Culture,the hardest part of the work is the big territory I haved"
good,"management in the contact center is poor, not transparent, micromanaged, constant last minute changes, retaliation for speaking to hire up management, poor computer systems, unrealistic expectations"
good,"Culture is not the greatest, and the managers are mostly untruthful.  My manager did not help me advance to my fullest potential, and he was a micro- manager.  Some people do not stay long, because of the culture.  Typically people leave within 2 years or less.  The hardest part of the job is there is no Career Life balance.  I have averaged a 60 hour work week.  My coworkers were awesome along with the cross functional teams.  The job itself is very interesting.  A typical day is that your manager will give you a list of things to do, and you complete the job.  You will either develop analytical methods or support the chemical pilot plant, which can create extra hours.  The plant will run 24/7 especially on weekends.  AbbVie has not created shifts for chemists so there are times I have worked 15 to 17 hours a day during pilot plant.  It is something they need to improve on."
good,"Mala administración de recursos, aun no sabe que quieren de la empresa y sus empleados"
good,While working at abbvie I encounter many times harassment from management as well as discrimination.  The company fired my supervisor after he made comments regarding my short term FMLA time off.
good,"Great, solid company, that being said, not many opportunities for advancement. Can get stuck in a position for years. But good job security if you are willing too grind it out."
good,"Competitive company - ambitious environment."
good,"It's a call center so it's very busy you are answering phones taking inquiries from patients, doctor offices you are performing a lot of data entry and updating of patient information/demographics. I have learned a lot about the system that we use due to the fact I have never used Scriptmed before. The management team is comprised of 2 TL's and 3 supervisors we are pretty much split up between each supervisor.  I don't see my manager much except when she is walking the floor to go into a meeting I see a lot of emails from her however.  I do see my supervisor on a weekly basis to go over stats, productivity and things of that nature.  My co workers are lively some are just there for a job, others want to advance into other departments and then you have the ones who try and work hard because they feel they have something to prove. The hardest part of the job to me there isn't really one for me.  I mean when you have been in customer service you learn that you are going to deal with all kinds of people.  It's about being humble remaining calm and having the attitude that you can deal with anything.  The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the patients knowing that I am doing for them what they couldn't do for themselves."
good,Loved the benefits. But the job is more about office politics than what you know. So learn to kiss butt or you will never move up! Once you get in you are in forever unless you leave!
good,"Very challenging environment, compensation is very good.  If not a graduate of the company's development program, growth within the company can be rather challenging."
good,"Schichtplan ist die Hölle"
good,"Dynamic and highly collaborative work place in a nice location."
good,"Micro managed reps, poor middle management, excellent resources, lots of people with a lot of experience, flexible work schedule, territory routing designed by reps, ability to do extra work for extra recognition"
good,I have learned the balance between working directly with clinical sites staff and making sure they are efficient and capable to conduct research. The culture of the environment does not lack the tension of micromanagement but with some managers micromanagement isnt there at all. The wonderful part of the position happens when you are able to open clinical sites knowing that patients will be helped.
good,"As a Contractor you don't have any access to the rating criteria.  If you work in a good area, as I did for about 2 years, things can be great.  As soon as that changes, your career can change drastically."
good,I'm learning to take my day to day process with headcount management and real estate planning and seize the opportunity to consult or advisor.
good,"I enjoyed working in ProMO for Abbvie. I was able to be challenged using my Excel skill set for reporting and data output. Very flexible. Allowed to work from home sometimes. I was on the Activities Committee, planned fun events monthly to boost moral."
good,"Dépend des personnes en poste."
good,"Too many upper management positions trying to justify position. Upper management somewhat erogant and likes to push down information and strategies rather than a pull up philosophy. Mid level managers hanging on trying to keep Regionals happy while trying to keep an unmotivated, beaten up sales team focused on trying to move business without being able to see physicians. Pharma field environment is very poor."
good,"First time being in a call center environment. Everything was by a script, timed, monitored, and robotic in a sense. Not much room to incorporate your personality in helping patients."
good,Good Place but very bad Central Management in Dubai . Each year downsize for four continuance years . Comp. & Benefits less than similar industries in market .
good,"Challenging workplace that provides tons of opportunities to grow if you have the right connections internally.  Department to department moves are highly encouraged, especially at junior levels.  Good benefits, especially pension plan."
good,"The culture is getting better, but the work is rewarding. I have learned to ask questions about things that you think don't matter, and to never be afraid to discuss concerns with upper management."
good,"A growing profitable company with many opportunities for growth."
good,Some of the IT managers were insecure about their jobs. They were not able to lead the team with any direction. Managers would not allow to find root cause for failures but just put numbers in metrics.
good,"Managers: Great to work with and very supportive "
good,The on-boarding was lacking the necessary training regarding the the variety of brands and and what they're used for. If you have a question people are willing to stop what they are doing and take the time get you up to speed.
good,"Part of the Drug Product manufacturing side of commercial production. Involved with the creation and upkeep of SOP for various processing units as well as problem solving for these units."
good,I was a contractor there for two years. Worked 8 hour days doing data entry work. Managers and supervisors were nice and approachable. Data Entry software was not great and we had bad IT problems and not a great IT team. Co workers were very nice.
good,Questa in AbbVie è la mia prima esperienza lavorativa nel mondo delle Pharma Company. Ho trovato l'ambiente molto accogliente e stimolante. Il valore delle persone viene riconosciuto.
good,possibilità di crescita professionale al momento ridotte
good,"Refer to resume"
good,This organization is customer and employee focused and has management concerned in promoting and engaging in the employee's career and professional growth.
good,"In the period of Abbvie, I am responsible for the promotional activities. The most challenging part of the job is facing extreme competition. People respect each other and show cohesiveness toward the goal of company. Happiness environment and easy communication culture are strongly encouraged."
good,"It's all about who you know.  But great benefits. The company works hard to create consistent culture.  Management heavy, hard to get noticed depending on what you do."
good,"Although Abbvie management was great, there was a lack of career achievement and advancement. No holiday or vacation paid time off was available for my personal position. Causing difficulty in work life balance when days off were needed."
good,It's a boys club which makes movement upwards difficult as a female.  The company itself is also stuck in the 90's and wants to innovate but cant see a way clear to vis its own stricturesz
good,"I love Abbvie , it is reall best place to work , I got lot of experiences and I learned many and many.life , work , fun all at abbvie.Abbvie family day, vacation from time to time, gifts to our families"
good,I had a great time working at AbbVie. For an intern right out of high school I had a lot of freedom which was nice. Could have used a few more structured projects but it was good.
good,"- A typical day at work : promotion of Qurevo, Sales follow up"
good,"Great co-workers who are willing to help the larger team.  Challenging workload, but supportive environment and professional culture."
good,"Het leukste van een baan is de persoonlijke bijdrage die kan worden geleverd aan de mens en de organisatie! Daarnaast is het erg leuk dat de persoonlijke ontwikkeling door blijft gaan. De energie die hieruit wordt gehaald, zorgt ervoor dat je gemotiveerd blijft en er elke dag weer vol tegen aan gaat! Zowel in werk- als in het priveleven."
good,"Ações da empresa não estão alinhadas com seus valores e elementos de cultura. "
good,Not applicable. Pipeline seems to be strong in certain disease states. Many other disease states with mature brands is winding down.
good,"Good program for Nurse Connector"
good,"AbbVie is a new company with historic traditions and success stories.  I enjoy the wealth of initiatives and opportunities available.  Being able to have a direct impact to our business and our patients is very rewarding. "
good,"Great organization with a great future. Enjoy working with top-notch people in GMA. Overall, this is a very good place to work."
good,one of the best places i work in pharmaceutical companies in egypt was Sanofi Aventis with good and supportive management
good,"Great company to work with. Awesome salad bar! Awesome staff! Awesome benefits! I will definitely contract there again, if asked to go back."
good,Great place to gain experience during an internship. Offer credits for classes while interning plus you get paid unlike most internships.
good,"Great company to work with, good people and growth into different departments"
good,AbbVie is a good company to work for. Being a Humira rep for 6 years has allowed me to build solid relationships with my clients.
good,"Although there was a lot of work and activity, everyone cooperated to get the work done."
good,I was exposed to a highly dynamic and complex workplace that incorporated both engineering and business practices.
good,"While working your normal job, AbbVie encourages volunteerism, and working towards making life better.  They are very focused on making lives better - including working with the animal enrichment program to help acclimate test dogs out to public retirement to live out their life as a healthy and happy member of a family.  They have lots of programs such as these to make your work experience whole."
good,"Strong brand teams and office culture"
good,In general it is good place and good working environment.Work load is very high and some people from management are bad too.Overall a good leaning place and give a nice industry exposure
good,E' stata un' importante e bella esperienza lavorativa
good,"As a company, AbbVie is quite impressive. The pay and benefits are competitive. The job culture overall isn't bad. Certain departments have a hard time keeping employees, either due to contract or management, but most of the other departments do very well."
good,"Professional environment with fun colleagues but have changed recently, work-life balance dramatically deteriorated.  Nice working environment; have new offices."
good,Good project to work on. Good Learning and Challenging work. Time flexibility. Work from home availablle and can be opted. Less onshore oppurtunities.
good,"The company benefits are fairly standard, however the pay is definitely at the top end within the area. They expect delivery and people are happy to do it. Lots of nights and occasional weekends."
good,"A typical day at work are spend 1-3 hours at meetings, 2-3 hours at lab and 1-2 hours of paper work."
good,Was great working there just didn’t have opportunity to advance in company. Great overtime great people to work with and the work being done there is great
good,"Great place to work!!  Benefits are awesome!!  The middle management is fine, upper management needs to refocus on the talent they have and respect the people they have in place."
good,"Nice place to work with nice people. Many people have been contractors for 2, 4 and 5 years. Never bring them on as a full time employee. No paid time off."
good,"Scheduled interviews with hiring managers and candidates, setup travel, processed background checks and drug screens, processed new hire paperwork, new hire orientation, sourced, phone screened candidates for various roles."
good,"Really enjoy working here, friendly co workers. Job satisfaction that you are making a difference in somebodies life.  Training is a downside and seems to be put on the long finger but overall a good place to work."
good,"I""ve had a great career working at AbbVie. The culture is really familylike. Have bene happy for over 13 years. The only holdup is that the corporate office is located in Chicago. It may not be feasible to relocate."
good,"collaborative, all for one abbvie"
good,"Solid company w/ strong performance track record. Very competitive culture, needs to work at change management. Patient centered environment across all areas."
good,"Good company to work for for the most part... good benefits, good environment / culture, on site gym, bank, Starbucks, and cafe"
good,"This is a great place to learn some aspects of the HR field in a professional workplace. There are different projects assigned to you which keeps the work interesting. However, the pay rate is not incredible and there is almost no promise of full time placement."
good,"In the six years I spent with Abbvie I have been given a unique opportunity to sell within internal medicine and multiple specialty practices. Pancreatic enzymes are widely used in a multiude of physicians and I would consistently have to change my messaging office to office. Gastroenterology would use pancreatic enzymes for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to chronic pancreatitis and pulmonology dieticians would use them for the complications of CF. In endocrinology, internal medicine, and oncology, pancreatic enzymes were used for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency with variable causes, a diagnosis which required a lot of physician education. "
good,"..."
good,Good company; needs to buy a molecule to promote until pipeline is ready
good,"Excelente lugar para trabajar, desarrollo profesional"
good,Overall a very helpfull environment to work in. Good facitiies easy to get to most offices since it is not downtown. Flexible hours and remote work important since I have a minimum 1 hour commute when I go in.
good,"Great colleagues and great development atmosphere. Lots of learning and development tools, good people above you and good products in pipeline. "
good,"Strong focus on product knowledge and business analysis.  Bonus structure and compensation is fair. Numerous opportunities to make extra money with key initiatives and SPIFFS,"

good,"Most of all I loved the people and the Compensation/Benefits."
good,"I enjoy going to work.  I self taught my self, no hands on training lots of ISITraining through the computer.  My typical day at work would be formatting document for the scientist and chemist to put into attache pro.  I do lots of scheduling for two directors of who I work for. I set up conference room meetings and order the food.  Travel for my group domestic and international."
good,"nice place to work, I think they treat most everyone well.   They pay well, management tries hard to have a good culture.  It's a good job if you can get it."
good,"I have worked at abbvie for nearly 6 years.Was part of an enjoyable fun loving helpful team. Never got an opportunity to work as an FTE."
good,"AbbVie is a conducive work environment, that took the wok place health, and wellness of its workers into cognizance. With highly innovative staffs and management."
good,"good company to work for, the health benefits were ok,but overall,a good company to work for. The managers were good and took care of everything that was needed."
good,"Periodo di stage (inizio 5 Sett 16) con un contratto di Internship della durata di 6 mesi (Medical Operations Team - implementazione di studi clinici). Con un programma di Tutorship sono stata affiancata ad un Sr Project Manager che ha curato la mia formazione professionale nell'ambito della ricerca clinica in campo immunologico."
good,"a typical day at work - No"
good,Very unprofessional staff...management does not do anything when incidents are reported...energy draining environment...performance is not considered when raises are given out everyone gets the same amount..
good,"Great company, safe environment, slow growth in terms of advancement. Good people some no so good, management is slow to respond in some situations."
good,Saisie des encaissements clients et analyse des provisions et établissements de celles-ci.
good,"While i working i used to work in very professional way. Other employees are good with each other."
good,Even though new company management is great. Enjoyed while working as team coordination is great. Salary benefits are justifiable as per position in company.
good,The work atmosphere is good .People are friendly. Job pressure is not too much. Not providing many full time positions.
good,"The environment of One AbbVie is that of cooperation, collaboration, and happy interactions between coworkers.  In the two years I have been with this company I have thoroughly enjoyed the coworkers and the management."
good,"I have been here for over 12 years.  Co-workers are great to work with. "
good,"As a contractor, their is support from my team to get my projects and tasks completed.  There are challenges but we come together as a team to resolve and help our customers."
good,"After working for Abbott/Abbvie for 25 years, the only issue I would say where they are not as competitive is salary.  When I left Abbvie, other companies had a higher salary rate for similar positions."
good,"Ambiente lavorativo stimolante e collaborativo."
good,"I was contracted to work for Abbvie thru Quintiles . My position is to promote two products to Primary Care Physicians as well as Specialists. I worked with an Abbvie counterpart who mirrored my territory. Abbvie believes in coaching and empowering representatives while on the field . The management of Abbvie has high expectations of their employee sales performance so we try our best to reach and exceed our goals. During my employment there, I was able to increase market shares above and beyond target goals. We established excellent relationships with our high volume physicians that move our business to reach an upward trend. I was fortunate to have a great partner who was in sync with our Plan of Action for our team. This is the most enjoyable part of the job. We had a lot of challenges but we made our goals and exceeded them. The hardest part of the job is converting a physician to change his prescribing habit and we succeeded most of the time with our perseverance and focusing on our goal."
good,The work was very interesting and productive. I was able to manage my tasks and break time. There was however some lack of communication with my supervisors so I was not fully aware of office norms.
good,"Nose place to work, employees are helpful.. quiet nut fast paced... managers are supportive.. it is a far place to work in North Chicago, but Metra makes it accessible..."
good,All the requirements are properly documented.Company is well organised. Management is good. But the vendor company cognizant is not professional at the work place.
good,"Good company to work for laid off several years ago Typical pharma sales, flexibility, good benefits and pay, Room for promotion and other task per manager needs"
good,"Een typische dag brengt normaal veel variatie met zich mee vanwege een redelijk complexe organisatie. Daardoor waren we nu het proces aan het herstructureren en efficienter aan het maken omdat we 1 FTE zouden verliezen. Dit zijn belangrijke leermomenten, naast structuur in het eigen werk brengen, juist door de complexe organisatie. Bedrijfscultuur is in het nederlandse kantoor informeel, hoewel ik de benadering vanuit het amerikaanse kantoor weer erg formeel vind. Het moeilijkste van de baan is structuur houden in het werk, en zich aanpassen aan de vele veranderingen in het process door de amerikaanse regels. Het leukste is toch wel de afwisseling, en de goede informele contacten binnen het kantoor"
good,Very busy and never a dull moment. A very fast paced environment and positions within will always keep you busy with projects or deadlines. Everyone is a team player and there is a lot of follow-up.
good,The company and the people are great but they prefer to hire more contractors than permanent employees which sucks. Otherwise a great place to learn and grow.
good,En general la empresa es buena. El equipo es bueno y el clima laboral aceptable. Sin embargo las expectativas comerciales no son muy realistas. No se conoce el mercado local y se asumen similitudes con otros países de la región que no son reales y eso genera metas inalcanzables. El equipo de liderazgo reconoce la escasez de recursos locales pero no es consecuente con esa realidad y la carga laboral local resulta inmanejable.
good,"Abbvie was very much very much like Abbott Laboratories.  I already knew many of the people I worked with and for before joining that organization.  Upon joining Abbvie, I was able to immediately make a positive contribution to that organization."
good,"AbbVie has a wonderful mission and an excellent pay and benefits program.  The facilities are very good and budgets are decent, depends on your organization - lots of money gets spent on commercial employees, less so on operations employees.  Managers are not prepared to manage - there is not mandatory intro to management training for example, so your experience there will depend on the manager you work for - some are great and some are terrible.  Generally, AbbVie is a very results oriented company and will not tolerate employees who do not perform.  It is also the kind of company that generally expects employees to check email on weekends and vacations.   AbbVie is a very large organization so there are plenty of career opportunities - higher up in the organization you have to be willing to move if you really want to get to the VP level in some areas."
good,"Horaire de 37,5/sem."
good,Manager was amazing and learned a lot about the pharma industry. I was a contractor but would love the opportunity of working for this company. Collaborative.
good,Overall a good company to work for.  Lots of micro-managers with some AMAZING managers mixed in. I learned a lot during my time there and was able to experience many aspects of the business.  Only have one or two products that really do well.  Other products are very hard sales.
good,"Nice working environment, I would recommend this company to anyone. Fair working conditions, along with good management, team oriented, and good pay. Not a lot of overtime, or heavy lifting."
good,Challenging. A do more with less environment. Needed a more comprehensive training program due to merging with a Waste treatment department. Acquiring many personnel  with no Boiler operation knowledge or desiring to learn.

good,Abbvie Stemcentrx is a great place to work.  The environment embodies that of a productive positive place to grow within its industry of Biotherapeutics.

good,My day involves constant attention to detail and the ability to work effectively and efficiently with other people.  My tasks are frequently change and require the ability to be flexible and supportive of management directives and initiatives.  The greatest challenge keeping communication open between various groups over a large manufacturing floor.  I enjoy the daily challenges of learning new tasks and growing technically.
good,I liked working for AbbVie. The management was very understanding and does not micromanage. Very flexible schedule can chose my own hours. Job Advancement is horrible. I was a contractor and they had no work for me. I was let go due to no work. They don't hire employees just contractors so no room to grow.
good,"I've been here 16 years and have been very happy here. While working here, I took advantage of tuition reimbursement and earned my Associates and Bachelors degrees. I was promised many advancement opportunities by management, yet they never materialized - with management finding any excuse, be it environmental or otherwise, to not advance me."
good,"Enjoyed working at Abbott/Abbvie in the Virology franchise.  Unfortunately, Kaletra had progressed beyond it's life cycle.  I stayed for the VieKira Hep C launch, which did not live up to the expectations."
good,the work life balance of this fantastic company is great.  Their Culture Is always moving forward and always looking to improve.
good,The organization is really large but full of hard working people. There is a lot of room for movement and growth opportunities. Some of the business culture is old fashion compared to other large pharma companies. However they are in growth mode so things are starting to come up to speed at a slow but steady pace.

The enjoyment is working with professionals not only HCPS but also co-workers to be more creative in territory."
good,"Abbvie very good company to work for, I work closely with internal and external users to support them with issues related to our clinical system and applications, currently our team consist of two clinical support coordinators in US and two in Germany along with three project managers.

I Work very closely with project managers, testing new applications and system before implementing, creation of UATs, testing of UATs, creation how to documents for system support coordinators and end users, and the learning new systems and applications.

If you're interested in the pharma industry / medical breakthroughs, the work at AbbVie will certainly fuel your passion (as they are very patient centric). And the people within your department or team are great."
good,"Getting to work early and being most productive before lunch time.   Learning new ways to implement my skills and knowledge while gaining more. Management assigning work and trusting my ability enough to get it done without hovering. Having coworkers who understand my work ethic and are just nice in general. Caring enough to congratulate each other when we have life changes. The hardest part would be under staffing and more task being demanded with unrealistic time lines. The most enjoyable part of the job is acquiring new techniques and networking with people that are like minded, hard working individuals."

good,The compensation and benefits package is above average with increase based on an annual review. The company is cutting-edge and the work environment is challenging and positive/upbeat.

In a typical day intellectual property paralegals are asked to work on various projects that are mentally stimulating and challenging.  Work on these projects allows the paralegals to interact with those in sales, marketing, human resources, clinical, and research and development (just to name a few).  The most enjoyable part of being an intellectual property paralegal is learning the history of Abbvie's products.

My only complaint is the lack of hands on management. Supervisors are gone a lot due to their own personal issues.

You will stay at the level you came in for years unless you completely change your roles. Management is poor and have issues with other management team.

good,"This job works with your schedule very well. I come into work and go straight to my desk and start cataloging. Seeing that it's an office job, everyone is usually kept to themselves. Unless someone stops to say hi at your cube or catches you at the coffee machine. Once learning the method of the task, getting the job done is easy. Management is split into 3 ways. We have 3 teams doing different projects that all ties up into one. Everyone is nice. I've learned a lot about pharmaceutical jobs and the way companies work through this job. I'd have to say the hardest thing about this job is really just making sure you keep your error rate below a certain percentage. The most enjoyable part is how close everyone is, we're all like a corporate family."

good,"Bently Nevada was the first job I took after I graduated college.  I started out as an Inside Sales Person and loved my Regional Manager and co-workers.  Most of the outside sales men taught me so well in 6 months I was promoted to an outside sales representative myself.  A typical day at work was being there for our customers, being there for the outside sales reps, and being there for my Regional Manger. I learned so much at Bently Nevada to start my sales career.  During the first 3 months the company sent me over-seas to the Netherlands to train there for 10 weeks for an intense training course.  Management was great and I loved my Regional Manager.  My co-workers were excellent as well and we worked well as a team.  The hardest part of the job was the insecurity.  The were so many rumors about GE Electric buying us out and of lay-offs that is one of the main reasons why I pursued other opportunities.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with the customers, training, and especially when they sent me to train in the Netherlands.  It was such a tremendous experience."

The hardest part about my job is linking licensed HCP's to their identifiers because our information is limited.
