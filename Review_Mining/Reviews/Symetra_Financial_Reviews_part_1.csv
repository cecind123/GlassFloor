bad,"this company is all about community until it’s inconvenient for them. give them a week to show their true colors and it will be obvious that they don’t care about you. they will drop you with no prior communication which is super disrespectful and unprofessional on all levels. the shifts suck, the management is even worse. run away from this company as fast as you possibly can. this place is not worth your time."
bad,"The weak managment hired me and a few temps and terminated us because they had no idea what to do with us for 2.5 weeks. "
bad,Symetra does not care about it's employees.  The manager's aren't helpful and don't work with you.  I learned that most of management has favorites who suck up to them.
bad,Poor management style. Stressful work environment. A typical day consists of getting cases done in time. The manager comes by my desk and sucks the happy right out of the room.
bad,"Salary is low based on work expected. Management is inexperienced and catty. Over time and hours expected to work differ from what is presented in job offer. 100% quality metrics are unattainable and you will never meet expectations in a review, unless you are favored. This is a biased work environment on many levels."
bad,The lack of integrity among the management and human resources division of this office is truly astonishing! And this lack of integrity has filtered down through the ranks to cause an atmosphere of distrust among the entire New Business staff.
bad,"The lack of integrity among the management and human resources division of this office is truly astonishing! And this lack of integrity has filtered down through the ranks to cause an atmosphere of distrust among the entire New Business staff. I have never worked in an organization where those who lie are held in high regard and those who value hard work and honesty are seen as lacking qualifications. I believe if the CEO had any idea what was going on in this office, he would be appalled! Especially since he is counting on this office to build the life business. My advice, avoid this company!"
bad,"poor training, poor management, favoritism abound, pay seemed reasonable until you got your caseload and job duties. keep looking."
bad,"This place is a mess.  Several reorgs have happened over the years and it just keeps getting worse."
bad,"I started working at Symetra with the hopes of being there for years to come and possibly retiring there, but the process of the training and lack of training and what the expectations they required of us employees was sometimes overwhelming. I feel that the any company the most important thing is the best interest of the client and I know that many clients were not very happy."
bad,"While the people were friendly enough, there was a universal attitude of negativity towards management, fellow colleagues, and towards the perceived direction of the company. Symetra stifles advancement, and they allow gross incompetence, making it nearly impossible to get fired. Management is rarely engaging with subordinates, and when they are, they do not readily accept opinion or theory. Expect to be treated like a child there. If you prefer to do the bare minimum without fear of losing your job, then this is the place for you."
bad,"Too much whispering, too much favoritism, too much micro-management, old IT infrastructure, some poor hires into management positions, good people leaving with alarming regularity."
bad,Management is terrible. You work hard with no recognition or room for advancement. No work life balance. You have to work over time to maintain your work
bad,"My experience at Symetra has not been a good one. I work smart, I work hard and I do what I was hired to do. But there is a large amount of favoritism played by managers. The employees that never question anything and and just go the way of the herd day in and day out are the employees that a lot of managers at Symetra play favorites to. I very much believe that this is a big reason Symetra has a hard time of keeping talented employees and the company has issues keeping up with the competition."
bad,Disorganized and ethically challenged organization. Management in the compliance and ethics departments cater to the marketing and sales departments due to the business side pressuring compliance and legal departments to do illegal and unethical activities.
bad,"Symetra was an organization I envisioned being with until I retired. With a lack of management support and career growth, I opted to find an employer that would help guide me in the next steps of my career. The company fails to recognize internal talent. The organization has so much potential but it can't seem to get out of its own way."
bad,"Not a place for the feint of heart. Very production oriented and extremely high volume, high stress work environment. Great dedicated employees, but corporate culture is extremely dysfunctional."
bad,Starter Disability company great opportunities only between friends. Culture is currently terrible. I would not recommend this company as I feel is going downhill for Disability Products.
bad,"I feel Symetra has the opportunity to be a fantastic company, if it could get out of it's own way.  The Company has amazing staff, but it has a turnover ratio of +30 percent.  The company churns through Employees."
bad,Management is poor in team leadership. Horrible work life balance. They have one person doing the job of 2 people. Compensation is very average. The company is behind with technology and ways of thinking.
bad,"It just doesn’t seem like Symetra has the fire it needs to be successful. The company is slow moving and behind the times with technology and ways of thinking. Managers often appear to be untrained, unsure of their decisions or just plain don’t care. I hear of many complaints about the way we payout claims and how difficult/slow/confusing the process is but yet nothing ever gets done to fix the problems which is really unfortunate because the one making the claim is usually going through a tough time in their life with us only making it harder."
bad,"The way this company runs boggles my mind. I've worked in a few different departments for a bunch of different managers at Symetra and rarely has there been process or order. It makes it unbelievably hard to keep work on track."
bad,"My experience at Symetra was not as great. The management team was not professional enough, give team members a lot of stress. During none peak time, the work is rather slow pace and not challenge enough."
bad,"The employees, primarily non-management employees, make this a good company to work for. Work/life balance, pay, legitamet advancements (based on actual knowledge and hard work), and management needs vast improvement."
bad,"Not much positive can be said.  I cannot, in good conscience,  recommend working at Symetra.  That is all I have to say about working at Symetra."
bad,"The company has gone down hill - bad management, low morale, etc"
bad,Very poor training and not very good at maintaining morale.
bad,"A lot changed as of 2018 - health benefits got worse (more expensive for the member), they changed the sick day policy, and the delegation of workload completely crumbled. You've got Case Managers working 40 claims, and another Case Manager only working 10 - for example."
bad,"This company was great to work for at first, but new management brought in from the outside tried to change the culture and workloads increased, rules changed and the company became more than stressful to work for."
bad,"Good opportunities for career advancement with good benefits package. Great community support from company and employees. Need for single Project Management Office to manage all Project Managers and Projects. Hostile leadership, that has expectations of employees to work extra hours weekly without compensation."
bad,"Symetra touts as an innovative company but really needs to catch up with current technologies to which they are working on. Pace is slow and as of late a high turnover rate in the technology groups. Overall great benefits, decent salary, however promotional paths and growth opportunities are limited."
bad,"In general, most of the rank and file staff are really nice and treat you with respect.  But beware, managers will not have your back if it means taking any risk.  Furthermore, all people are not treated equitably.  If you are one of the favorites, you get treated better, and won't necessarily face consequences for your actions."
good,"I enjoy the people I work with.  The overall environment is not bad.  Compensation appears to be below average.  The company has a list of values they adhere to, which is laudable, but they do have challenges with transparency in decision making."
good,"Symetra wants to be a ""big dog"" but can't find it's way.  Managers and employees come and go on a regular basis.  Few Employees have been with the company for more than 2 years.  In one year, one team had 6 different managers.  Company pay is below market, and Management feels that giving away $5 Dunkin or Starbucks gift cards will make the difference."
good,Management is very inexperienced and lacks the knowledge and skills necessary to properly run departments. There is no work/life balance and training is nonexistent.
good,"Its very dynamic depending on work volume. There is good team spirit there. It is a very corporate environment. Its a foot in the door at the bottom, there are no real perquisites for this position."
good,"Management is in constant turmoil.  Overall Employee Morale is low.  Your Fellow Employees are what motivate you to want to do well.  Management Talks a Good Game, but is very inconsistent."
good,"They always  tell you and others that its a great company with amazing stepping stones, yet there is no room for growth. your requests to shadow other departments are ignored. When you apply within to other dept. your managers have to sign off on it.. they don't and there you are waiting for an interview that will never happen. Management does not even know the procedures, they refuse to help when there are escalated issues resulting in clients being upset. "
good,Symetra is a nice and comfortable place to work.  Not a lot of room for advancement.  Life balance is hard to manage.  Not equal in promotions.  Could be a more professional.
good,Ineffective management.  I had managers who seemed totally unaware of the workflow and volumes in our group and had no interest in making sure it was apportioned fairly.  
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers.  They are willing to help.  Lack of training and management does serve a purpose but mostly missing in action.   if they are around they don't know what to do, and goodness don't ask to answer a call.  with the exception to one manager,  Wish all were like him and willing to help."
good,"If you are looking for a place where you are not expected to contribute much or are comfortable with letting your coworkers pick up your slack, Symetra's IT organization would be a great fit for you.  "
good,"Typical day can be stressful due to the customers and volume of work. Other times it is a lack of company resources and they are not up to date with technology. "
good,"High pay for high stress. Executive Management is a bit heavy, given the unique shortcomings in frontline staff. Customer service and sales never seem to have enough FTEs. HR has no clue how to recruit or terminate employment. Seattle made Symetra a unique financial services company in a Microsoft cultured land."
good,"This is ultimately a start up company with no processes in place. It is very difficult to do your job when there are no guidelines, standards, or over all continuity."
good,Great co-workers and management is always trying to find ways to help their employees. OT is readily available during commission cut-off's and month end.
good,"Time consuming for daily long commute to work, Option of flexible work schedule- e.g working from home. Prefer to have a Management team that ""Willing to listen to your opinion and room for imporvement""."
good,"I love working in claims but i was tired of overly corporate major insurance companies. I started working here to get away from that. New management started shortly  before i did which was both a positive and negative. They have good intentions but not enough staff to effectively implement these changes. It negatively impacted the entire department and we got the short end of the stick."
good,"Great place to learn about the insurance industry and get licensed. Unfortunately there is no career advancement or support from upper management.  Senior management will pretend they have your interests at heart, but have a hidden agenda that they already have in mind."
good,I would have never left had they allowed me to work remote as they let many employees do. Its a good company and the pay was ok. I didnt not feel my accomplishments were recognized - but that had alot to do with a certain VP who is no longer apart of the company.
good,"Worked with agents and policyholders on a daily basis. Performed audits on Whole Life policies. Processed illustrations for agents and clients. Trained agents to use our online tool to process illustrations and rate calculations. Trained co-workers to utilize their soft-skills, and was on the escalation team for my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was getting the claim call when a client had just lost a loved one and was calling to process a claim. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping a client receive her life insurance early cause she was terminally ill, so she could use that money as she needed. "
good,"It is a good company, however during my time there I had 4 managers and it was extremely difficult to ramp up to be proficient for a call center environment."
good,"Interesting work, interesting location, interesting management culture, interesting career politics, interesting promotion practices, interesting compensation calibration process."
good,"Great job for someone looking for stability and good work life balance. Great location (downtown Bellevue). Lots of great transportation options (buses, walking and carpool)."
good,"I loved all of my co-workers and got along in the office famously."
good,A typical day involved taking customer calls and processing 1035 Exchanges. Spent a great deal of time training and learning about the insurance industry. This was my first post college insurance industry job.
good,"Symetra has gone from place to work, to a place where you feel big brother is watching you. Management has been making some questionable decisions regarding job responsibilities lately, having over-worked teams take on more and those who need work with less. Benefits are good as and compensation is okay."
good,"A typical day at work consists of meetings, underwriting loans, external service with borrowers and mortgage bankers."
good,"People at Symetra are very friendly and energetic, but organization as a whole has issue with communications."
good,"Great Benefits, relaxed environment, career advancement"
good,They work hard to keep a fun environment. It is starting to be more stable but there are still lots of changes and this can be hard and confusing for new hires.
good,Hours are flexible in the Call Center between 6:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. PT. Can start as early as 6:00 a.m. and end at 2:30 p.m. or start as late as 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. 45-minute lunch. Paid for 7.75 hours daily.
good,"been working here for 3 years. they do provide lots of opportunity to be promoted, however pay raises are a little under market value. the shift in adding more vacations makes it very nice, 7 flex days, can get 2+ hours of PTO per pay check. 6% 401k is also really nice."
good,Good environment for acquiring professional designations
good,Everything here depends on what dept your in and who your manager is.
good,"Typical day at work is spend 50% of time in meetings strategizing on the firms initiatives. I was instrumental in the rebranding, advertising, website design, corporate collateral and recruiting and business development. The most enjoyable part of my job is to work with amazing people who collaborate on all projects and are willing to go the extra mile to get results. Analytics and creating a sustainable business has been very rewarding. Results rule!"
good,"good times in the Symmetry. opportunities, support. friendly but impersonal environment. Big building. in downtown bellevue. near highway. easy to commute to."
good,"For those who drive down to work, Symentra is not the place, but it's a minute away from the bus station. Enjoyed working there and if I had  the chance i will join again. Pay structure is not that great"
good,Ability to work autonomously and allowed to work on what you feel is most important based on your role and responsibilities. Hold strong to allowing for a nice work / life balance
good,"I was with the company for 18 months, starting in customer services and then moving up to sales support. "
good,Positive supportive environment
good,A reccommendable work place.
good,Working with independent insurance professionals.Compensation is on the low end of what comparable companies pay for similar positions.  Current company focus seems to be more concerned about the bottom line than having a mix of products that are needed to be competitive.
good,Great place to learn new skills and get involved in a community related work.
good,"I was part of the Marketing Team. The work was a bit dry as this was a insurance company but my coworkers were great, the benefits and pay were awesome and the work was fairly easy. No coming in over the weekend and that sort of thing."
good,Very small office - currently only about 165 in the building.  Relaxed and casual atmosphere.  Doesn't seem to be a lot of room for growth or movement as it is mostly a claim shop.  Main office is located Bellevue WA
good,"A typical day at work would be a few meetings and working on projects/deadlines. I learned the importance of staying on tasks and up to date with my duties. I never felt like I had enough input or one-on-one time with my manager, which became one of the hardest parts of the job. I enjoyed my years at Symetra and the relationships I've built with my colleagues. I feel it its now time to move on to other career options."
good,"People here are generally underpaid to begin with, those who do well tend to start at the bottom and slowly work their way up, which unfortunately results in having some very under-qualified managers."
good,The life insurance business is difficult in that new products must continue to be developed and marketed.  If the product is not well received then the overall mood is reduced.
good,"Standard but well-run developmental maintenance shop supporting Vantage One admin package system for annuities.  Included in house developed add-ons for distributed communication (CICS middleware) and data warehousing.  Range of responsibility as a systems analyst from business specs through technical analysis, development  to QA testing and defect correction.  I did it cross-country offsite since Symtra systems based in Seattle and i live in CT"
good,Great place to work from a cultural and work/life balance perspective. They do like to promote internally where possible however the opportunities in some areas can be somewhat limited due to the small size of the organization and that many people stay in their roles for a long time.
good,I was a new business coordinator.  I processed life applications on the computer.  I worked with agents to make sure that the applications they were sending in had all the necessary paper work needed.  I also put together and mailed policies.
good,Decent company - not a fit on my team.  Good for IT positon at a financial services company.  Process no more than usual.  Make sure training is given as needed.
good,"This company is a small insurance company with a small staff.  It has great insurance and other benefits and very good salary brackets.  Since it is a bi-coastal company, there could be cultural differences from time to time between the staffs on the different coasts."
good,"I think Symetra is a great company.  I felt welcomed, the first day I started.  It's a rapidly growing company and they really care about their employees and clients.  The department I worked in - Retirement, New Business - was very fast paced.  We had high expectations and worked a lot of overtime.  It was stressful, at times, but we managed to meet our obligations to our clients.  It's a great company to work for.  I learned a lot, during my time there."
good,Great culture and work environment. Executive leadership is supportive. Fast moving and a leader in the industry with product solutions.
good,"Good company to work for with potential to grow within company.  Help encouragement movement throughout the company.  Management for certain departments are great and others could use some improvement.  Able to wear regular clothes, no business attire needed unless informed."
good,"Steady work, great coworkers.  Some stress, but very cooperative people throughout the company and nationally.  A tad of overmanagement (weekly one on one meetings).  Work load on a seasonal basis can be heavy.  Working with co-workers - great team."
good,"Long commute, upper and middle management not always on the same page. Can be stressful navigating two different objectives."
good,"Got to work with a talented team of staff accountants who were all very technical. "
good,"There is lots of work to be done, but time is also dedicated for fan activities and team building. Technology is the focus for improving their product's satisfaction from customers."
good,"I learned all about Life Insurance products, and how to explain them to clients and agents. I assisted callers and processed policy changes. "
good,"Prepare training materials; handle communications such as telephone calls, e-mail and in person."
good,"Everyone I've met here cares about each other, gets their work done, and are very friendly. I enjoyed working with them even though insurance is not the most interesting thing to me. I highly recommend at least applying just to meet the people and get a feel of what the company is like."
good,Engineers are very experienced; some have been with the company for decades. Mainly a .NET shop but always looking to enhance their dev stack and adopt new technologies and practices. Ideal work-life balance and overall a great place to work.
good,Growing company with vision of growth to national player in all three divisional arenas. Management has great relationships within industry. Work life balance is better than most. Growing pains are mostly related to sales volumes and vintage technology. Company is investing for the future currently.
good,Awesome job.Nice benefits and good work/life balance. Good management team but looses site of upper management vision. Loses team focus.
good,"A typical day at work is meeting the productivity goals. "
good,Worked as a temp. Enjoyed every minute of it. It really depends on who your manager is. Other co-workers were stressed out because of their managers. It was easy work.
good,"Work life balance is non existent, 6 days a week and overtime is basically required in most IT positions, so expect that. Buisness side and IT clash constantly."
good,"If you are at all interested in the Insurance Benefits Finance Industry then Symetra is the place for you."
good,I was hired on at Symetra after I lost my job of 34 years with an outsourcing company.  I worked with Symetra at the outsourcing company from 2005 and had background knowledge required for their move to another outsourcing company.  I was hired a a contractor for 2 months to help with the move and write documentation for them on jobs and processes they required.  My co-workers at Symetra were the best.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with.
good,"A lot of community outreach and managers are encouraged to allow employees time away from the office for community service projects.  A lot of hiring from within creates room for advancement.  Some managers play favorites which can lead to inexperienced or unqualified people being promoted, but for those who are ambitious and capable, it does not hinder growth."
good,Great Management and extremely comfortable environment to be in. Company offered constant training opportunities.
good,"Symetra is a great company that loves to enable their workers to move up within. There was plenty of opportunities to meet with management, shadow others to learn, and apply yourself further."
good,"I worked in the retirement division at Symetra. The sales culture is great as there is a lot of collaboration between sales teams sharing ideas and helping with financial knowledge."
good,"Great place to work, nice office in downtown Bellevue.  My supervisor and co-workers made the work day fun.  The only reason I'm leaving is to join my husband in another state."
good,Great people work here and company  makes sure you know they appreciate you. Very team orientated and goal orientated ................................
good,Symetra is a dynamic company to work for. There are strong career opportunies given the aspiration the company has to advance in the financial services and insurance industries
good,"I've been provided with so many new opportunities during my time with Symetra. I've grown my leadership skills, tackled new projects, and am now learning a whole new field. The saying, ""You learn something new everyday."" is an understatement."
good,"I started at Symetra in July 2011 after relocating to the PNW. I didn't know anything about the company but was curious to learn more after seeing the brand on one of the buildings in downtown Bellevue. Since I've been here, I've found my coworkers to all be very supportive and willing to help with training. My management team trusts that I will do my job and provides me with the freedom to determine my own best way to get results.I still have a lot more to learn, but I'm confident that I'll have the resources to do so."
good,"My team is awesome and Manager has great leadership skills. The work flexibility is awesome, team is great, management is great, office building is great."
good,"All levels of management are transparent and take the time to get to know you."
good,"There is tons of job security and the pay is great. "
good,"Working at Symetra was a great experience for me.  The work life balance and ability to make your own start and end work times daily were great. It was pretty rare that I worked with someone I did not like working with.  All the management, including VPs and executives, I was in contact with were approachable and friendly.  They wanted to provide you with a path to success."
good,"As an intern, it was great that they gave me full control of projects. I've also gotten a lot of mentorship and help throughout the summer. I've gained a lot of knowledge on tools and processes including ITIL, ServiceNow, and Scrum best practices. Overall would recommend!"
good,"Great place to grow and gain influence. It is small enough that each employee can enact change, but large/old enough to be stable. The new CEO is going to take us places and so it is a perfect time to join!"
good,"Great company, good benefits, great management. It's a fun place to work and I always get good support and feedback from my managers. I have only good things to say about Symetra."
good,"The job was nice, the people were swell, and the benefits were pretty convenient. Would work there again if offered a permanent position, unfortunately, I was just an intern there."
good,Fun environment and a close group. They have great training and will pay you more than the industry average no matter what position you are applying. I recommend Symetra.
good,"great place to work, benefits are good.  flexible work hours, work at home available.  management is great.  training is provided.  friendly work environment. "
good,"I have worked in my field for over 30 years.  I feel like I achieve something when I am able to assist others and complete tasks in a timely manner."
good,Working for Symetra was a terrific job.  The job atmosphere was clean and professional.  The work material was fun.  There was always plenty of work to do.  Symetra provides great benefits to their employees
good,Work has been fun. Good systems in place and friendly co-workers
good,"Management very focused on where they want to take the company, Professional organization."
