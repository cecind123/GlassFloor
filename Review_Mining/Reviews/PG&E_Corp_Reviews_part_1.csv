bad,"I can't say much, but I feel that I / we are not valued in IT. If unhappy with your job you have 2 options, either get over it or go and look for another job. It's a great market out there today."
bad,"Forget all the talk of ""Safe, Affordable, and Reliable,"" The Company Executives and Leadership drive their people to the absolute edge of performance. Whether it is constantly shifting priorities or changing  organizational structure, OR, the constant turnstile of contract workers that are treated like dogs, there is no mistaking the real, and salient corruption of the entire organization, from top to bottom! Don't get me wrong: there are some great, sincere people in the Company. But this has shown to be of little significance, when countless numbers of catastrophes continue to happen. There is a sincere dysfunction happening here. I only hope that they can correct course before more of their customer's lives are lost."
bad,"If you are a driven IT professional you should look elsewhere.  You will not be welcome if you are too productive.  "
bad,Hired for my knowlege and experience only.  Just get the job done no matter what the cost.  No incentive other than salary.  .Company only uses people to fulfill their needs.
bad,bad management and unorganized they do not know whats going on and too busy to listen to back dated procedures. need to change the management and be ope minded
bad,I didn't like working here because everyone is fake especially management and the union IS A JOKE!!! All of the shop stewards work for PGE and are in a clique with management so YOU DO NOT GET HEARD!!!!
bad,Supervisors are not skilled to lead a team. Most employees lack ambition to perform above and beyond. Career advancements are not considered by job performance rather by years of service.
bad,The culture here is horrible and people have worked there for years and are set in their ways and unwilling to try new things and move the business forward.
bad,"There is no better training for line work than Pacific Gas & Electric, Hands on training from climbing poles to towers, splicing underground and overhead electrical transmission and distribution electrical systems"
bad,"I did not enjoy my time working as a Gas Operating Clerk for the short time I did for PG&E. There was no formal training involved whatsoever, which led to me being very confused about the job itself and what it actually entails."
bad,i enjoyed a lot working in this company. management support is good.
bad,"Do not like how they harm our environment. I have worked there I felt too long and no advancement, its like they kept dangling the carrot on the stick and never let the employee's have it at all."
bad,I would NOT recommend working in the Transmission or Gas Depart at PG&E.  Very bad Management.  Management too young and does know what she's doing.  Will set you up to FAIL!!!!!  Run far away from that department!!!!
bad,Technologically far behind.  Not using enterprise software as designed.  Focused solely on projected budgets not actual admin of work.
bad,"Very similar culture as the DMV or post office.  It may have been cutting-edge in the 60s an 70s but mid level management is antiquated in leadership skills and resistant to change. A very wrote method of orientation and training of “it’s the Pge way, make it happen”."
bad,"Ask a former vet, they fire them like crazy and don't accommodate for disabilities. They treat contractors as the enemy, not a team member. The driving factor for employees is to make money and do nothing,"
bad,"The company is good, takes care of the employees in terms of health, time off and trainings. A lot of opportunity to move around and learn things. The company has been lately hiring some very bright talent. However, the overall morale is at a record low. There are continuous talks of lay offs due to affordability. Major budget cuts have impacted management expectations. The expectations is to achieve I am not sure what. Nothing is every good enough, nothing. The company has a 'speak up' culture but if you do it does come with repercussions. You alone will face them. The company does give trainings on no retaliation but I have faced it myself. Overall, disappointed at the work life balance and constant pressure from old timers who are insecure about their job position."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Expecting too much of the employees, Dysfunctional, unorganized. Of the almost 40 years I have been working, this by far is the worst place I ever worked"
bad,The “leadership” in the contact center is a joke. They say they encourage diversity and inclusion but they really don’t. This job will drain you of all your humanity.
bad,"Management has no accountability, union representation is a joke, upcoming reorganization will crush what’s left of the company. Medical benefits are extremely expensive and consume your paycheck. Pension is no longer offered to new hires."
bad,Union does not even have your back. management is there to just come after you and micro manage. There is not structure and no one to go to that ever has answers.
bad,"Terrible company to work for.  Outsourced American IT jobs to India in January of 2017.  The company did not disclose this to the media, only that they had a workforce reduction.  False!  They backfilled the American jobs with lower paid workers in India."
bad,"3 reorgs in last 2 years.  Multiple laid off and job outsourced in the last 3 years.  Permanent employees get to train the Off Shore team so they can ""help"" with the work load.  Management believed that by just moving people around they reduce the amount of work. Lots of off hours work without any compensation. The amount of work kept increasing and management continue to target reduction in permanent work force. Yes, they said there might be more reduction in force after the latest reorg."
bad,"Company cares more about #'s and not people.  "
bad,"Terrible place to work; seemed corrupt. Seriously wondered if the rumors were true that the Mob runs this place. At first I thought it was hyperbole; now, not so sure."
bad,It’s very volatile. Work life balance is nonexistent and management is in survival mode causing a lot of “Authoritarian” like Leadership.  No bonus payments were made in 2018 and the company in in Chapter 11. It’s not the best place to be employed at.
bad,Horrible culture and management. Company is too big.  Not rewarded for hard work. Good work/life balance. I stayed at the company for too long because the benefits were so good.
bad,"Worst management out of any employer I’ve ever worked for. Terrible work culture full of incompetent, selfish, lazy individuals. The only thing that’s good about pge is the pay. I absolutely hate going to work everyday because of the people. Which is really unfortunate because I love the job itself. No opportunities for advancement unless you have a high level close friend or relative"
bad,Employees not appreciated by management; Cut throat environment; A non-trust culture; You either belong to click or you are out in a few weeks; Management is retaliatory.
bad,"The culture varies by department.  Some places to work are better than others.  But there is a lot of politics, lack of transparency and people afraid of loosing jobs.  This is not just my opinion.  They do have outside surveys and this is one of the things that comes up."
bad,It's a passive-aggressive management team. Each person trying to keep face in front of the others. Company overspends with little accountability. Those trying to make significant change are often cut from the group.
bad,"Many IT groups that were created to support the rest of the organization such as Teradata and Linux admin groups were so unhelpful that they were the major obstacles to fulfilling my responsibilities."
bad,"A changing culture that is overly demanding with no work/life balance.  Although the pay and benefits are good, I would not recommend this company as a good place to work."
bad,Place is ok. I wouldn't make a career out of PG&E. The culture is very union oriented and that is hard to change. But not a bad place to gain some experience.
bad,"poor attitudes, clicky, treat ""outsiders"" like they don't know linework, arrogant, ridiculous construction specs and horrible work/life balance are a few descriptions I can come up with. Groundman yell at lineman, lineman taddle on other lineman, management threatens to fire everyone from pre-apprentices to foreman and they promote a hostile work environment. I would not recommend working for this company unless you are looking for a stepping stone to get to a good company or if you are desperate for a job. the pay is great and a ton of overtime. Do yourself a favor and ask around in the lineman community about working for this company before taking their bonus' and moving expenses."
bad,After 6 1/2 years working for PG&E I was fired for refusing to shave my short beard that I had the whole time I worked for them and for half of my life.  They black balled me from ever getting rehired like the guy that got fired for smoking crack on the job and like the guy who got fired for stealing backhoe equipment
bad,Poor management. No communication. Funky old computers and work stations. Prima donnas and weirdos. Proprietary processes hard to learn and obscure. Weird culture.
bad,"Dishonesty , poor communication, horrible work environment and impossible work homelife balance.   Travel all the time with unknown return dates to see home.   Supervisors will transfer people out of town the first time you disagree with them.  The scream safety but have the most unsafe work practices I have ever seen"
bad,"No vision, no focus - burns people out.  "
bad,"PG&E has great culture on paper and mission statement. It definitely lacks that in implementation. Nepotism is the norm and old school managers do not allow for new ideas or processes to be put into practice. It's a very cubicle oriented work life and people do not hesitate to pass you to the next cubicle even though they can resolve it themselves. They are not proactive about anything, it's always looking for ways and answers after things blow up. Programs are rolled out but not though through practically or without weighing the pros and cons and ways to implement. Having said that not everyone is like that and the new blood is definitely a joy to work with.  Excited about the future the present needs a lot of work."
bad,"The company is dominated by politics. Things move slowly. People feel entitled to work there, regardless of incompetence. It's always a constant battle between the competent and the inept."
bad,"Everybody at PGE is in fear of losing their jobs if they do not have enough hours for themselves through projects. And these projects are jealously guarded. Permanent employees are working 80 hours weekly, while new contractors have to fight to get 40 hours a week. Usually you would have 20-32 hours. When new projects come in, these hours should be spread out among all employees, but instead, ""permanent employees"" pick up a phone and you lose the project to them, since they are permanent. Other departments keep two books. One for everyone to look at, and one with the real dates they are following. Very crooked. They also lay off employees. and re-hire others shortly after to fill in the need. A very broken system. If you get a good manager, I imagine it could be good. I would avoid them at all costs."
bad,The company does not value employees.  You are just another number.  They are not advanced.  Everything they do is a waste of time and money.  They could do so many things easier but refuse to conform.
bad,"I will only speak to the incompetency of PG&E's newly created network management group called ENOC. The leadership literally has no understanding of anything technology related. The laughable part is that they only hire warm bodies that apparently where never in the IT field. It was so funny working with these people, but also somewhat scary thinking all the damage they could have done as a major utility."
bad,"Who knows what the future will bring. The company allegedly started some wildfires that destroyed a lot of property.  Now that they declared bankruptcy, who knows how they will be bailed out or dissolved."
bad,PG&E needs to work on having better leaders in the company. company needs to make sure employees have better work life balance.  Needs to believe in their employees and have a better compensation.
bad,"The company is losing it’s monopoly and it’s last hope of long term survival is the grid. It’s complete focus is holding on, there is no growth in the company’s future."
bad,"I worked as a contractor at PGE, so my opinion reflects that. It is not a good place to be a contractor, as mgmt does not respect or support its contingent workforce."
bad,"I had, which I refused, to play politics. Too much finger-pointing. Not much cooperation with other teams. Lack of opportunities for advancement. Unfriendly."
bad,People and social culture are enjoyable.  Large corporation with little motivation to drive change.
bad,"Excessive work hours required lead to burnout"
bad,"PG&E a terrific company with too many layers of management and too many procedures, mostly allowing some mid level employees too much control in the absence of real leadership. The New President is terrific and will turn the company around but not quickly."
bad,"I worked in a highly stressful job, which if fine, but leadership did not help manage the workload which would ease the stress. Workplace culture needs improvement."
bad,"The big problem at PG&E is an ongoing disconnect between senior leadership at the company and the work force. The regular communications from senior leaders always indicate that the company's problems can be corrected with better communications, but the leaders (from second-level managers and up) seem to ignore all uphill communication. Reorganizations are almost annually, to no benefit, and only result in more people at the top who also don't listen."
bad,"This is a large utility that still hasn't adapted to deregulation. They are  operating in a complex & modern marketplace with a management structure, culture, and back end systems built and designed in the pre-internet era. Most of the management that I worked with achieved their rank due to political skill or longevity rather than qualifications for the role. During my tenure, many of the roles in IT were being outsourced to overseas labor firms, so the employee morale was low. The most difficult part of the job was the overwhelming levels of bureaucracy as a result of poor strategic planning at the C-level and from the restrictions that were placed on the company due to ongoing legal actions. While I worked with some talented and skilled people there, the overall company was a mess."
bad,"the company is stuck in the old ways, and most people who have worked at the company for 25+ years refuse to change.  management plays favorites and retaliates if anyone speaks up."
bad,PG&E has several fiefdoms where people are protected. If you push for change or question authority you are retaliated against. Different departments protect their own and if you don't belong to a clique they will sacrifice you when cutbacks are implemented.
bad,They spend more time pointing fingers than actually working on the task at hand.  Too many meetings just to set up another meeting.  The business lines did not get along and would often try to sabotage the other.
bad,Not a great place to start your career after graduating college. Great place if your passion is not into computer science.
bad,Very heirarchical. Not many management people with proper knowledgebase to move the company forward.
bad,The company has been good to me over the decade plus I have worked here. Unfortunately form over substance has been the mantra for advancement and promotion within business. Work/life balance isn't a core competency 9talked about but little is done to enhance).
bad,"Every team I worked with was short staffed and we never had enough resources to complete the amount of work we had.  Our PR  and morale was at an all time low, and it was difficult to retain employees."
bad,A nice typical day with more work than is possible to complete.  A lot of very educated and nice people.  Near a lot of place to eat.  Big pretty windows so you can watch the parades and protest.
bad,Avoid working here as a contractor - Managers are incompetent people managers and support cutthroat tactics used by contractors to get ahead. This is a toxic workplace.
bad,"no career advancement, rampant nepotism, management has no strategic vision for the future of the company.  Currently competing round after round of lay-offs."
bad,No Comments.  Glad they gave me the opportunity to serve.  Thank you for all your time to serve.  Let's keep making the company lean.  Management is awesome.
bad,highly unorganized and incompetent. PG&E has good reviews primarily from field personnel because they are highly overpaid for what they do. But PG&E as a company has quite the criminal record and its much more obvious why in management.
bad,"A typical work day is putting out ""fires"" and running various data request drills.  As a supervisor or manager you will spend very little time with coaching or managing your staff.  There is lots of talk about work/life balance but that is not going to get you promoted, only those willing to short their personal lives will see the few meager awards that are placed in front of your hamster wheel."
bad,Too strict too many politics I would be at my computer someone would come behind me and say Im not sitting correctly and then start to measure how far/close I am etc. Very stressful environment
bad,Preach open honest communication while they don't value that.  Co-workers are hard workers.  Creativity is not encouraged.
bad,Tough culture but the comp and long term benefits are solid. Few in the Bay area offer pensions...PG&E does after 5 years!  Too many issues on the table politically and in the culture across the Bay Area due to San Bruno.  But time heals all...
bad,"The Customers who called in were Verbally Abusive.  Rules and Policies were not consistent. "
bad,"I enjoyed the work, people and learning new skills.  I was a contractor when PG&E filed bankruptcy, and at that time they let all the contractors go first.  Their service centers are over worked and understaffed."
bad,"You guessed it - it's who you know.  Management and internal advancement is a ""country club"".  Advancement depends on who you know and your invitation into the club. It is scary of how many Directors and Senior Managers have (a) no management skills, (b) thrive on self glorification, and (c) do not believe in compliance and  quality management."
bad,"Risky if you're a contractor without a cohort or team of consultants to back you up. Can get very cut throat and often the managers are incompetent as they were promoted for the wrong reasons. They may be looking for ""yes men"" or folks that make them look good regardless of how engaged or knowledgeable they really are. The key is to get on a team you relate well with and know who your allies are."
bad,"Although the compensation for working in a call center is great, dealing with the daily factor of not feeling valued, concerned about the possiblity of office closures. With management if they have been there so some time there is that sense of security that they will not lead you astray however, by the time you are comfortable with your manager you are switched to someone new.You start to feel like you are only a number. The advancement possiblities are extremely low unless you plan to relocate to the Bay Area. There isnt any true security with a call center."
bad,"Internal employees are horrible to outsiders and have no integrity.  Mgmt condones bad behaviors and even participates in badmouthing the very people they hired. Full of labor union employees that grieve every chance they get and do the least work possible.  Managers coddle unions, pass the buck, never make decisions, and lie to get their jobs.  Heavily silo-ed, with every department doing it differently and no top down leadership to be found anywhere to reign it all in."
bad,"The company said they wanted change and innovation but that wasn't really true.  Very subversive culture that would ""bite"" you when you least expected it."
bad,"Stressful, commute is murder,they need to stop using contractors. Overly demanding.  Should be more focused on call quality not call times.  I learned I don't like working in a call center."
bad,"PG&E is a big company and there are some great departments, but the IT department is poor and not well managed. How well you are treated (training, resources, etc.) depends on which group/city you are in.  "
bad,"My job was pretty repetitive and not all that challenging. It can be a good fit for some engineers but was not for me."
bad,"PG&E is a BIG and complex company. I'm confident that the average consumer has no idea how difficult it is to maintain utilities. Weather, wildfires, consumer damage to equipment etc. are all under the umbrella of care that PG&E provides. HOWEVER, you'd think that a company this size would use more sophisticated data management systems to support employees i.e. a central facility directory; connectivity between departments and functions to save time and access to day to day information. Formal processes are lacking in many areas and efficiency is severely impeded by the long-term culture. You literally have to know who knows to find what you're looking for. By no means am I saying PG&E is careless, casual or irresponsible in their culture or management of their responsibilities, only that as an employee you are often weighed down by the lack of organization within and the exceptions that are granted to long term leaders that may have never worked outside of PG&E. Makes it a challenge to get things done."
bad,"I did not enjoy my time there.  My manager was the reason I left.  She would tell me to do things one way, one day; and then berate me for not doing it another way. I would show her the notes I took when she would tell me how she wanted something done, and she would become even more irate towards me.  Every day sucked.  I finally decided to quite, finish my MBA and go to a happier company and more enjoyable position."
bad,"To many conflicts of interest -"
bad,"I was a contractor only briefly here.  When I arrived, it took almost 2 weeks to get me the software/ database access I needed, despite my opening umpteen trouble tickets to numerous IT groups, which kept passing me on to other groups, or to get more layered pieces of the access levels/ resources and management approvals I needed.  I didn't have a swipe badge for a week either, so it was a pain just to get into my work area, or even go the restroom.  It was unnecessarily convoluted, and I don't understand why they couldn't have requested most of the resource access, badge etc before I arrived.  Nonetheless, they gave me a hard time about why it took so long to get access...  Then as soon as I had access, I was expected to learn about 6 very complex software systems simultaneously within a week or so and start producing work product asap.  I have a long I.T. and project management background, so I know I'm not slow, but they wanted me to ramp up to high productivity with all new software and complicated research extremely fast.  I understood that my group was WAY understaffed and it had a truly mountainous workload, but I felt they were pretty impatient with new hires."
bad,"They recruited me to come to this company. Terrible management, as illustrated by our bankruptcy. Under constant time constraints. "
bad,"The company is stagnant and fears change. Many of the employees are unionized and have a sense of entitlement. Navigating through this culture requires a unique skill set, that will test your business acumen and any efficient process you bring in will be challenged."
bad,"The days were stressful. Multiple jobs required to complete one job. "
good,"It was a typical call center.  They worked you around the clock and really didn't care about your well being as a person.  Very unsympathetic, it was more stressful than any other call center I had ever worked in."
good,"We started early in the morning. I learned the installation of gas and electric meters, I also did module work on the meters. I would input the new information into our computer. At the end of the day I would finish up by stocking and cleaning up my truck."
good,Too many organizational changes and virtually no downward communication. As a consultant I was not allowed to participate in any organizational changes or communications.
good,"Advancement is highly dependent on the group you are in."
good,PG&E is a suitable work environment if you only there for a paycheck and not looking to improve the system to provide above adequate service to its customers.
good,"Perpetual reorgs, at times several in a 12 month period making it very difficult to know and understand clearly roles and responsibilities. Often senior leaders felt compelled to reorganize to stamp their style or simply to show that they were making improvements, without much comprehension of the impact to staff and their productivity. Paralyzed mid-management afraid to make decisions, often preferring to bring in outside consulting help, and if the advice didn't pan out they would often blame the consultants.  Arcane systems built haphazardly and at times without a clear understanding of its objectives or how one system would or should connect to another. "
good,Too many layers of managements. Very unstable job security and not very innovative in coming up with ways of doing works. doesn't provide a lot of training in doing works.
good,"It is an unstable company to work for right now, they are laying off lots of people and they are is a lot of frustration and uncertainty among employees."
good,"PG&E remains a leader among U.S. investor-owned utilities in many respects, but its stature and future is challenged by structural changes in the California regulated energy marketplace. Genuine commitment to improving customer and public safety, but efforts to address insular, fear-based and excessively hierarchical corporate culture are half-hearted at best. Benefits and work-life balance are generally decent, although the latter can be difficult to come by in some departments. Collegiality among front-line employees is the norm."
good,"I was not managed properly or professionally and did not like working for PGE. I would not go back there again. I handled all projects totally alone, but had unreasonable and unfair projections put on me, with the limited resources i was given to work with."
good,The new culture and management of PG&E has killed this company. Too worried about bonuses for upper management and dividends to stockholders then doing the right thing for it's customers.
good,"Over my many years of employment at PG&E the moral for experienced workers is trending downward. The upper management and leaders are working tremendously hard to save the repetition of the company and build positive moral, but middle manage lack the leadership and motivation skills to address directional tactics to move the company in a positive direction. PG&E remains a good place to work but lack the level of being one of California's best places to work, per it's historical trademark. As with many utilities, old process still rules the day but with a health remake of skills, processes and innovation, PG&E return to its position as one of California's best companies and places to work. Long live PG&E."
good,If you want a job as stable as a government job and don't mind the office politics. This would be a perfect place for you. The hardest part of the job is to keep track of how many different supervisors you have had for the time you were with the company.
good,"Poor management, employees were waiting to retire to avail of pension benefits. High priority projects were distributed to contractors and consultants as against employees receiving these opportunities. Opportunities provided for career path advancement, challenging work life balance situation even though attempt to provide the same."
good,"The company offers good benefits on average, although below comparisons to other Bay Area companies.  Leadership is not great.  Very few people who know what they are doing and most work gets delegated down because no one knows what they are doing.  Advancement is based on your relationships, not your performance or qualifications.  You will very often hear that ""you don't need to be an expert to be a leader"" here."
good,"Most of the culture at PG&E- Gas, that is - revolves around engineering.  As a result, there is not as much emphasis on innovation.  Rather, the culture is quasi-governmental.  Probably as a result of the fact that there is a big focus on regulatory compliance.  Despite all of this, there are"
good,First time manager who thought creative writing assignments assigned on Wed and due on Thurs when the latter end of the week is the busiest...manager never showed up for 1:1 meetings.
good,A typical day would be either in the office in San Ramon or in the car going all over Northern California to different offices. I did a lot of web page building for different IT projects. The car travel was the hardest part while the most enjoyable was my co-workers.
good,"Many people work at PG&E quite successfully.  I never did.  The company is too heavy in middle-management positions and uses outdated means of management.  Even though the CEO is female, the culture is that of a good 'ol boys club."
good,"I do not wish to go into detail. My comments are reflected in my answers to your previous questions. Management is poorly selected and good managers get laid off or fired. Turn much turnover. PG&E is following the philosophy in OT that cheaper (offshoring to India) is better, which is not true. Plus, grading system for raises is horribly done; people can have little chance if any of advancement. Managers are poorly trained and most do not support their people."
good,So much work and not enough resources to manage it. Project managers have no experience. Definition of hypocrisy- keep doing the same thing expecting a different result.
good,"The first five was a fun and great place to with for. Work life balance were great! Once the out sourcing is on the plate, it changed the work culture."
good,"PG&E used to be a fantastic company, but now that things are changing in the energy landscape it is becoming more evident that PG&E is not ready and will most likely not be able to keep up."
good,I had a good experience in general and fortunate to meet some good folks. There are several mid-level managers that do treat others fairly and layoff of contract folks is common.
good,"You will not be part of a growing, fast paced, and fun team. You will not have ownership for the implementation of your work. You will not see direct product improvements based on the results of your work."
good,"PG&E is a HUGE company with many different departments. The workplace culture varies widely between each. If you are new to the company and do not have someone to guide you through for the first few years it is very easy to get lost in the mix. "
good,Typical call center where you're on the phone all day dealing with some pretty mean customers and not a lot of support from management. Pay is much better than other call centers.
good,Great people! A lot of untapped talent in this organization.
good,Enjoy being a procedure writer in the right environment and with the right professional people.
good,"Your success at PG&E largely depends on your relationship with your supervisor/manager."
good,"Hard for upward mobility, a lot of people at the company who have been here for many years and have not left. Therefore, manager positions are few and far between and come with a lot of politics"
good,"Corporate Structure needs work, work life balance is out of whack. Also corporate culture and employee moral/engagement is completely out the door. Hoping the company will jump back into the positive environment it markets to our customers"
good,"Typical day at work: Always very busy, and the day finishes fast."
good,Seemed like a great place to work and probably is if you dont live in the bay area. i relocated here and have trouble affording housing while making 250000 a year. the average home in this area is over 1 million. not to mention the lack of union representation.
good,"PG&E can provide you with many opportunities to learn within the organization, and if you are partial to very large, corporate companies, the red tape, and bureaucracy might not bother you, but it is not for everyone."
good,"PG&E is a good place to work if you are a person in your 20's or 30's because of the  retirement pension"
good,"10 hrs or more a day"
good,"If you have less than 10 years in the company, you are eligible for being laid off.  Other than that, this company is a good company to invest towards your career in your prime."
good,"The department I worked in was always busy. The team overall was great. There were issues with management from time to time. The teams that are located in the offices need to work on respecting, recognizing, and valuing their employees."
good,"Trying to get access and connections through security and network take and extremely long amount of time.Most places have you up and running within a month at max. It took over a month to get building access, two month to receive a laptop and desk phone. It took even longer to get access to the network."
good,"Be careful applying for them, they will go all the way to the point of hiring you then shoot you down due to not having an union apprenticeship. Also they will treat you like a complete moron if you didn't go through their training.  Good Luck!"
good,The company compensates employees and consultants well.  There are people there in a lot of administrative roles trying to get into other positions.   Political environment but orchestrate yourself carefully!
good,I had good work life balance @ PGE. But the management doesnt have powers to change the culture of the company. Technologies used are pretty old. I would not recommend this company to some one who wants to learn new technologies/processes
good,The company is doing great things in energy savings. I've really learned allot by working for the company. 
good,"Offers stable job, variety of work, good people, good location."
good,"Pros: Good benefits "
good,"The leaders I had lacked in training."
good,"The team I worked with was top notch.  Unfortunately, I was a contractor and was let go due to PG&E filing for bankruptcy.  It was unfortunate I had such a short tenure."
good,"Proud to have been part of PG&E. Very busy and lots of opportunity to learn but one must go for it. Culture is static and change is hard, the employees are dedicated and committed. Cons is work-life balance was NOT there."
good,"PG&E payed well and benefits were good. However, the working environment wan't a good place to work in. PG&E decided to out source the IT department. The company continued to review and purchase software. before the implementation was completed. The would move to another product. This was a was of time and money. They had no automation."
good,"From a contract position point of view, I learned a lot working at PG&E. It was fast paced, but was afforded the luxury to work autonomously. At times it was difficult to find the appropriate support and/or how best to escalate issues or concerns. As a contractor, it was a challenge of being accepted by actual PG&E employees, even if I worked as hard as them."
good,"Very stable company, but incredibly slow to change. Company needs to compensate or more monetary/stock incentives to their employees. Typical 40 hour a week job."
good,"Banker Hours"
good,Great environment for safety. Relatively young workforce. Open work stations that can get pretty noisy. Modern technology and equipment. Most people have flexibility about telecommuting at least some of the time.
good,What is this and is it needed?? It is like working for any Utility they have good points and bad.
good,"A typical day is design reviews, field assistance of technical issues, writing RTU programming, material review and product assistance. "
good,"Engaging and experienced leadership."
good,Typical day I was able to be creative. I learned more about eLearning and branding. It was a little micro-managed but I loved everyone I worked with except for the few cut throats that work out of fear instead of camaraderie. Hardest part was all the office politics. Most enjoyable was the work.
good,"•	Ensure the safe, reliable, and efficient operation of the gas transmission and storage system  "
good,I enjoy the team I work with and most of the management staff make themselves available when you need them. They encourage you to use the chain of command and someone always gets back to you in a timely manner. The individuals are a pleasure to be around. The job is not always easy however it can be very rewarding. You have to be willing to put the work in and be a team player.
good,The culture at PG&E is old school so the almost retiring folks can be racist found guilty Through HR and still be able to work side by side with you which is insane. There are other Supervisors that will talk to you inappropriate and call you names and you have to be tough because if you tell your work life will Be tough. The benefits are great the hours are good the pay is good and some of the people are good. It’s upper management that needs to get it together.
good,"If you intend to join as a manager, I highly advise not to.  Manager and Directors have no clear lines to distinguish.  And there is limited opportunity or support moving from Manager to Director.  It is a rarity.  If you are ambitious and produce, it will not result in upward movement.  The culture is such that they want you here at least 5-7 years before they will advance you.  If you do advance it will be because someone left the company and there is no one else left.  The later means you will be qualified and working below your ability and income potential.  Also, they adjust the salary mid-point often and do not adjust salaries.  This means there is a potential to hire people that will be making more money than you.  HR is not consistent at any level."
good,"Job offer did not reflect an appreciation for breadth and depth of expertise."
good,"Being a utilities company, they were highly undocumented and unorganized. Had to struggle a lot to understand the day-to-day processes. Management was not encouraging as well."
good,Work is interesting and balanced. The general office location in SF downtown is the best. Good children's daycare onsite for employees with young kids.
good,"I have worked with some great, experienced field people at PG&E.  The management has been hit or miss.  There are some excellent managers that are well-versed in the business and care about the work impact and make sure the processes work and that employees are doing the right work at the right time with the right resources.  There are some inexperienced managers as well that are hired due to nepotism and favortism.  Unfortunately, I do not see a lot of women nor minorities promoted or groomed for management positions at PG&E."
good,"This company offers a lot of training from driving to safet. My day consisted of driving to different accounts from rual to city reading meters, and talking to customers to gain access to their meter"
good,It has been many years since I worked there. I'm sure that much has changed in the work and culture of the job site so I don't feel comfortable commenting on them.
good,"Really depends what department you are in. As a contractor you are mostly persona non grata, which is a shame because there is alot of opportunity there that could capitalized on by smart people who happen to be contractors."
good,"the company is very large. depending on which organization you work in, the culture, collaboration space, talents, and management differs.With the recent change in the energy market, top management and bottom individual contributors are carrying most of loads and work pressure."
good,"PG&E is a very stable working environment.  If you live to work and want to make lots of money, it is available.  If you want a family or a life outside, it is difficult.  The culture is, we pay, so you work. Mandatory overtime is a normal weekly occurrence.  Sometimes daily depending on the season."
good,"The work you do is certainly worth the wages you earn, but if your a contractor than your just an extra pair of hands so a year long contract could end after only a month."
good,"PG&E is made up of highly qualified, smart, friendly and productive folks."
good,The company is a decent place to work but it's very slow moving and not technologically advanced like many other companies.  It's hard to get a promotion here.
good,"Great People, great opportunities, great management, great place to work. Smart-Meters were new at the time, and it was fun to be a part of this project."
good,if you are int unions and doing the same job for 50 years BGE is your place to go. no chance of advancement out side of the union. if you are management everybody will go after you.
good,"A typical day at work was not stressful."
good,"PG&E is a large utility with a territory of Northern California. It provides both electricity and natural gas. The electricity is generated using natural gas, hydro, nuclear power, wind and solar."
good,This is a very diverse company.  The only reason I left was due to relocating.  Management gives you the autonomy to work independently and lets you get creative.
good,"Regardless of who your Hiring Manager is, your level of satisfaction depends more on the day-to-day experience you have with the various project manager's with whom you work. Some are professional and easy to work with, others, not so much. It's vital to have a solid Hiring Manager to run interference for you when needed."
good,"With increased competition in the Bay Area, PG&E has really struggled to stay relevant despite being seen as a monopoly in most of their service territory. This trickles into their workforce, as increased budget cuts and headcount reductions add to the already-high stress levels of their individual contributors. Promotions or career advancement seem to have hit a standstill, although top leaders continue to get paid handsomely. It's really hard to stand for a company that has lost touch with their employees."
good,"The company has a large tenured ""family"" employee base but that unfortunately is changing. Long term loyalty is becoming a thing of the past like most companies. They're downsizing and outsourcing but new opportunities are becoming available."
good,Corporate organization where much involved political. Technical behind and slow. Not a good place to improve skill and personal growth for young people.
good,"There is always more work to do.  All of my departments clients are internal, so we don't add to the bottom line and have to justify ourselves during each job.  This causes stress and changes in upper  management means layoffs. "
good,"PG&E is a company that is truly a fortune 500. It has every bit of the american corporate structure, which consists of various departments that contributes to the company's overall mission and goals."
good,It's a very good place to make a career. Management made questionable decisions. The work itself was very interesting and enjoyable. Most workers were helpful.
good,"This was once a great company - Great people. I learned a lot from working on multiple projects. It's unfortunate that they chose to ""Outsource"" to save on cost."
good,Working at PG&E is an inspirational experience - there are a lot of mentors who are willing to go beyond their roles and teach you to be a better employee and a better person.
good,"If you are a contractor, then its just lots of work. Managing utility projects in the bay area region, utilizing various contractors and subcontractors."
good,"Overall PG&E is a good place to work.  Like any large company, politics and budget are underlying themes in daily activities.  PG&E is going through a much needed, major cost cutting exercise and outsourcing many jobs to India.  Most people that I work with, work more than 40 hours a week and work a bit on the weekends.  My immediate managers are smart, hard working individuals."
good,"The company has positive benefits in that there is job security.  However, there are quite a few people that are moving around the company because they are unhappy in their current positions."
good,I got a great start from beginning with the company as a warehouse person and progressed to an IT project manager.  The company is definitely willing to work with you on your career if you are willing to work as well.
good,"PG&E provided all high voltage electrical skills I have acquired.  Working in one of their most crucial markets, in San Francisco,  I am proficient in the distribution and transmission system."
good,PG&E has great benefits and the pay is generally competitive in the market. Work life balance varies between departments but is definitely possible across the enterprise.
good,The group I was in was amazing. You get to work with great individuals and learn a lot from a company that has been around for a long time.
good,"I learned a great deal about myself, importance of adapting to new environment, I value the people I work with, and a greater appreciation of the generation and transmission of energy across California."
good,"the people are great to work with, the environment is high pressure"
good,"good company to work for, alot of stress and a narrow chance of having a glimpse of personal life"
good,"Working at PG&E gave me a chance and opportunity to learn about database management:  creating and analyzing reports, writing queries, and working with different programs/softwares.  I met and worked with a lot of great people."
good,I think the company as a whole could learn a thing or two about what true value of treating employees is about.
good,Contribute to and execute strategy for advertising campaigns based on PG&E’s current business objectives and customer insights. Manage the development of advertising creative and oversee the strategic creative briefs. Manage branded communications to ensure that advertising reinforces brand reputation and positioning
good,"Provided a wide variety of growth opportunities, including teaching, tech staff representation, and software development life cycle."
good,Worked with both the administrators and the customers of the company.
good,"Was ok place to work, decent, good work life balance, they tried to work things out with me, nice people there, pay could have been higher, it's up to you"
good,"As a senior I.T. product specialist, my typical day at work is related to the design, implementation and support of backup and recovery applications for internal business clients."
good,"I was very productive at PG&E, but I had a mean and very demanding   supervisor.  She never showed a appreciation, and I felt that she always wanted the credit for herself on the expense of others.   With all that said, I enjoyed the work I did for PG&E, and I wished that I had a better supervisor."
good,"There are lots of talented people but you quicly learn you will be bogged down. Bogged down by old technology, old assets, old systems. Who knows what the future holds but it feels difficult to drive positive change."
good,"PG&E used to be a great company to work for.  The mission was clear and leadership had a vision to be the best.  Last few years have been rough and they have a strong focus now on cutting costs.  This includes layoffs which leads to low morale among employees.  The mid-management and director level can be hit or miss.  If you are unlucky and get tied to a poor organization, you're time won't be happy because they don't know what they're doing.  If lucky, the work the can be great and rewarding.  i've had both."
good,"- Lot's of meetings, not sure if they are that productive. Company goals keep changing"
good,"PG&E offers their employees the opportunity to apply for positions in different departments where the position can be for six months to up to one year.  After the rotation is over, the employee can go back to their previous position.  There are times when the rotation can turn into a permanent position. There is definitely a lot of opportunity to transfer to different departments."
good,"fast paced mornings, slow afternoons"
good,"Great working in team environment."
good,"I was fired but the managers had a snarky way of doing it. I was told to take the rest of the day off, because there were too many people training that day. So they said they would call me back the next day to train if it wasn't to busy. Turns out after I went home they told me to mail my badge in. I would have settled for honesty."
good,"The typical work day is responding to email inquiries, attending meetings, and trying to keep up with daily responsibilities. This is  an extremely fast-pace envirorment.  You can become overwhelm if you can't keep up."
good,"Hardest part of the Job is that this is heavily process driven and difficult to get things done."
good,The company is focused on trying to improve overall.  Many in management don't really care about change but counting the days till retirement.  Also have people in positions that should be filled with persons with knowledge of the work being performed.  Employees are treated better than supervisors.
good,"The best one can hope for in nuclear power operations is to allow the public to ignore you.  If you achieve that, then you can focus on the regulatory requirements and the demands of the continuous improvement assistance groups."
good,"In general, it was very difficult to effect change in such a highly regulated work environment."
good,"Nobody wll bother youm No one cares of anyones' job. Work by your own. 1 question, 1 answer system. Speak monly when you are ask too. or else, no onel will listen to you. I love my Boss though, Do not get me wrong."
good,"A Fortune 200 company with a high public profile, serving Northern California. For the most part, days do not tend to have a ""typical"" profile. Its a dynamic business and each day can bring about a new aspect that needs to be tackled. It provides a great opportunity to learn the mechanics of how a regulated company operates and provides electric/gas to customers. People are generally cooperative and helpful. As with most similar companies, hardest part of the job is telling Field Operations personnel that there is not unlimited funding to do everything in just one calendar year. On the other hand, it is fun to see how employees' actions directly effect how customers see the company."
good,"I had a wonderful job in an interesting industry - energy management solutions.  However, the CPUC controls the budgets and priorities of the company, and the two don't have a great relationship.  I found the business strategy and priorities to be highly reactive, and we didn't have enough budget to do the best job in the market.  "
good,"Over paid for such easy job. A mokey could do it. Loved the pay and the fact that they left my alone to do my job."
good,There are some great people working at PG&E but many talented employees are now treated like they’re valued and even with the financial issues the company has not focused on employees development or retention.
good,Ok company to work for. Great culture. Friendly people. stagnant. lots of red tape. management does not give you autonomy over your work. good benefits.
good,"Responsible for the design, engineering, construction and maintenance of electric distribution, transmission substations, and lines, Manage Engineer, procure and Construct projects, Design architect of SB198 IIPP Program, Contractor pre-qualification, Analyze and implement cost measurement tools, monitor time tables and costs associated with construction activities, Provide senior level executive assistance. Strong Union interaction"
good,Middle management is under qualified don’t know how to manage people. They select ambitious people who don’t care about their home life. They have no job experience or knowledge on how to deal with people.
good,Interesting place to work but need a little more time to fully understand and develop in the Project and Contract management concept.  They can be a great company with the right leadership and talent that can support the vision for success.
good,"My management did not seem to be well experienced with the responsibilities of being in management roles. The company vision was a bit convoluted, and the management did not provide any tangible objectives or expectations to accomplish the company vision. This allows some employees freedom to identify objectives and build expertise in the best way that they feel is suited to them"
good,"Great benefits yet slow and difficult to advance...had the privilege of 2 great managers who left the company."
good,"Worked at the facility in downtown SF. It's decent place to work if you happen to land in the right  group... As always, network with people on your floor at least. I was on the 10th floor, which was Regulatory compliance and electric forecast. Had some interesting people there that I could have struck a friendship up with over time. But other non-company matters necessitated my departure."
good,"Not much room for growth, as it seems they already know who they want to hire before a job posting goes up. The work/life balance is nice, but the pay for non-union employees could be improved on."
good,Favors bargaining units and senior management in terms of stability and pay. Moving towards outsourcing many technology jobs. Slow to change and reactive; numerous unfinished initiatives. But pretty good benefits.
good,Big company you are a number but when you have option to change positions there are options. You get to keep your seniority and that goes a long way. Especially when you have put in the years.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the diverse backgrounds of the people and how they all want to do their best each and every day.   The hardest part of the job is the slow pace to make changes or drive new efforts; PG&E is always struggling to be more agile and purposeful when attempting anything new.  The workplace culture is family oriented, which is great from a work atmosphere perspective.  It is easy to find a friendly face."
good,"Enjoyed working with my colleagues, however my project was mismanaged which lead to incomplete business requirements and poorly managed changes. The technical work was really fun though. Designed a small rules engine within grails that was able to keep up with the constant requirement changes."
good,"Overall, PG&E is a good place to work, but not as my dream job.  I do recommended PG&E as mid level career job move."
good,"If you can find a niche with a great team, this can be a great place to work. Processes can be slow and frustrating."
good,"* A Typical Day at Work: Varies from day to day. That is the greatest aspect of this position. Site visits for orientation with the job site and scope of work, to pre-construction meetings and follow up of progress of the work onsite. "
good,It was very nice working for PG&E. It has very good benifits.
good,"My Group let us take risks and learn from them."
good,"This organization is a mixed bag.  Sometimes you run into great people and have the opportunity to work with and learn from them. Most of the time though you run into the other end of the spectrum.  "
good,Good for career advancement due to challenges company is facing. Once culture is mastered the company rewards performance. Company slowly adapting to younger workforce.
good,"job was a great job, great pay, great benefits but was not very stable. Started as a 12 month contract was let go due to budget cuts. "
good,"If you can't handle stressful situations and long work hours with days upon days of meetings then PG&E isn't the place for you.  There are a lot of changes taking place within the company to change the culture and adopt lean management, but its often times too much all at once and very difficult to hit all targets."
good,"I think the company is an OK company to work for.  Unfortunately, I worked for an executive that did not like me from the beginning and waited until I came back from a family leave due to my mother's death and then she let me go."
good,"This is not a high tech job environment....more like a government job for the long term. Older coworkers. Workplace culture is more ""traditional"". It's a steady job with similar day in and day out typical working days."
good,"Overall, a good company.  It's a large, regulated utility so it does have its challenges from an organizational perspective."
good,The company speaks of moving into gloving and working their Electrical Distribution system energized. Their training and construction does not promote it. There's a lot of safety concerns on the filed.
good,"Worked with a great IT team that consisted of Architects, Application Programmers, both employees and contractors."
good,"I started at PG&A as an intern in Corporate Accounting.  it was a good entry level job to learn the the regulated public utility and company culture. Later I was offered a full time job, and I enjoyed the 9/80 schedule (i,e. worked 9 hours a day, and got 1 day off every 2 weeks).  the flexible schedule was especially helpful to the part-time MBA student like myself."
good,"The company is constantly restructuring, which leaves and uneasy feeling as far as security goes."
good,"-It is obvious that PG&E is similar to other companies in its conservatism, especially as a utility."
good,I was a consultant and received no benefits beyond my agreed upon hourly rate. My manager provided no leadership. Other managers that I reported to were consultants and did not seem to care about the job.
good,Good place to work if the boss is fare and open to discussion. Hard to become full-time if you are a contractor. You have a better chance of success if you work directly with the hiring manager and keep third party vendors away from your work. The SMEs were great.
good,"Walking around all day alone ,no problems"
good,"As a customer service representative I handled a high volume of incoming calls dealing with complex billing questions and emergency response issues. Excelled in AHT guidelines."
good,Solid employer; multiple meetings daily; no time to focus; collaborative management and decision making.  Strong emphasis on speaking up.  Travel into city is extremely problematic
good,"This is definitely a beneficial entry level IT position."
good,"Employees have to prepared for a change in the way the work is being managed or done. As the company changes, employees will have to exercise flexibility."
good,Provides training modules. Convenient commute and location. Great people to work with in a friendly and team environment. Also great tools and access to job aids.
good,I DO NOT LEARN ANYTHING. I ENJOY THE WORK BUT NOT WORKPLACE. IT IS GOOD BUT VERY POLITICAL PLACE. not very organized. vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
good,I enjoyed this job for that I was outdoors. I met new people. It was hard to work during rain storm and hot days.
good,"My most recent experiences have required long days and the ability to work at a moment’s notice. It has required diplomacy, versatility, and interpersonal skills."
good,"Good work/life balance as long as department is properly staffed. Love the people that work here, everyone is willing to help each other out. Lots of turn over in management."
good,"I very much enjoyed the personnel I worked with over a nearly 30 year span of time.  I am friends to this day with all of my coworkers and my supervisors.  However, the work was seasonal and had no benefits.  The work was challenging and rewarding, as I served as a technician calibrating and repairing test equipment for about 60 hrs per week, two months out of the year.  The pay was outstanding, but there were no benefits.  Sometimes, the work was dangerous, but it was rewarding in the sense allowing one to problem solve.  The plant where I worked is due to close in 2022 and after the death of my husband, it has become necessary for me to seek work elsewhere."
good,"The company is a great place to work for in the energy space as it is forward thinking and one of the trend-setting utilities in the world. But like many large organizations, the company is weighed down by bureaucratic procedures. Efforts seem underway to break some of these barriers."
good,"I interned for this company two summers in a row.  Great experience as an intern.  Met a lot of good people.  As a developer, it was very laid back and not stressful.  The environment in San Ramon was spartan at best.  Full on cubicles. They did have a couple ping pong tables for entertainment, but that was it."
good,"Learned many valuable things as an intern, with the most important being how the company operates so that I could improve as a consultant for them in the future."
good,"Working with 6 product teams on developing innovative mobile products. Dynamic and collaborative work environment. Board games, food and general excitement always present in the team."
good,veryy fun place to work and a good environment people are very respectful and are always willing to help and give training and answer any questions you may have
good,Very relaxed work environment but very production oriented. Do your work with integrity and there will be no issue. Ensuring quality is the most important component of this team.
good,The management was poor. I would of liked to experience a work experience from someone a bit more professional and who actually has the mind set to operate a successful business.
good,"Good collaborative effort with contractors.  Insight Global is an important partner with PG&E, and we found the relationship with Pacific Gas and Electric to be very positive."
good,The hardest part of the job was dogs. the best part is freedom and working outside.You know exactly how your day will be because you have your same route. The pay was excellent a great place to grow.
good,"PG&E is a large org, so everything depends on your manager and unit. If people leave all the time in the group it is a good sign that it is not a good place to stay."
good,"I enjoyed my time there. Not a stimulating culture. Very slow work environment and work moves too slowly. however, very nice people. Has a government mindset."
good,"While PG&E is well accomplished and stable company, the company's internal bureaucracy and often convoluted policies create a work hindrance. This makes the typical day slower than usual, often waiting on approvals etc to get ahead. The management is struggling currently especially with a new company vision and mission. The workplace culture is relaxed and slow with occasional high energy momentum."
good,"I enjoyed working for PG&E.  I found the company culture supportive, and encouraging.  They are very clear about the ex[pecations of the job, and the training I received was awesome.  I felt totally well prepped for the position."
good,A high pace work environment with managers involvement. i learn how to effectively manage a project. Employees not sharing knowledge effectively along
good,Work is fast paced and somewhat redundant at times. Everything is an emergency and must be discussed 1 million times after the fact. They overspent compared to the rate case and have been laying off significant portions of management.
good,PG&E is a good place to work. Their training is second to none. They have plenty of work and if you like overtime you'll really like working here. Overall I would recommend working for this company
good,"As a contractor, you are expected to do your job from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.  I can work independently on my own with little direction.  I always ask questions if I need any clarification on something I am doing.   I know where to go and who to go to when resolving problems.   I always let whoever I am doing a job for when the problem or task has been completed by forwarding them the confirmation."
good,One of the best companies you will find with plenty of diversity and a large opportunity for growth. Very structured and very caring about the community.
good,Not a bad place to work. Workload can be demanding and long hours. Company provides limited opportunities for advancement which can be frustrating fro some. .
good,"I work for a short time, I was introduce into the work without training. The work place is nice, but you can see from the other employee the work is pretty stressful."
good,Company that focuses on providing customer service.  Respects and values employees.  Includes community service and charity as its corporate mission
good,"Shift in culture in the short time I've been there and heavily focused on safety, process improvements and increasing overall efficiency. Heavy spending in IT with technology in field, but lack in spending in IT for tools for employees"
good,This is a great place to work with great people doing a lot of great things. I've learned a lot and grown a lot working for this company:-)
good,"HECO is a good company for advancement and people generally say that once your in the company your set.  This can be true if you are able to prove that you know the ""right"" people to advance. Its a very ""family"" and ""who you know"" company."
good,Too much Corporate interference with the day to day tasks required by employees. Dividing electrical engineers into separate types (Planning or Operations) was a terrible idea. I continue to hope that Management will come to it's senses and return both operation and planning tasks back to the division EEs.
good,"A great place to work, very team oriented and ethical.  Provides a necessity of life."
good,my experiance at the PG&E fremont material was a great experience was sad to be laid off and would love to get back to work with PG&E no matter were
good,"PG&E is an employee focused company where the well being and life-work-balance is important, as well as customer service."
good,"Plenty of opportunity to learn all about the power industry.  The biggest downside is that the cost of living in the area is quite expensive.  Other than that, a great area to be outside."
good,"The atmosphere was laid back and everybody got along well as a team. There was little to no stress which made working more productive and enjoyable."
good,"Given my background is mostly in the Oil and Gas industry, I did further my career in electrical safety.  I was also asked to keep the public informed on a daily basis of our progress on keeping our lives safe from wildfires."
good,During my time at Pacific Gas and Electric I worked with many dedicated and smart individuals that were very helpful to me and made my time there good overall.
good,"Very Inclusive and Diverse workforce (+)"
good,Great company with great values. Call center does not align with corporate values. Management states that efficiency and multi-tasking is not allowed. It should have been mandatory and rewarded as such.
good,Great organization with committed employees. Deep knowledge and a long history. Plenty of opportunity to move around and take on different jobs. Generous funding for education and training. A commitment to community service and supporting diversity.
good,The typical day for the last position consisted of assigning work to crew members and maintaining dates for planned maintenance as well as unscheduled work.  Meetings which required travel were also attended several times a month and conference calls for upcoming work and reporting out on the work your group performed
good,I have been working at this company for almost 10 years. It's a good company but will be going through some major changes in the near future.
good,From the time I worked in the San Jose Call Center to the times I was in the Stockton Credit and Records center and when I ended my time at PG&E in The Modesto Yard there was never a day where is was stale. From handling large amounts of in coming calls to correcting large amount of bills and then to working with numerous contractors to protect PG&E's underground structures kept it's employees busy.
good,Worked with many different departments to find success. I was very well compensated but was very hard to make an actual difference to our customers.
good,PG&E is an innovative and progressive company.  A typical day for a project manager is very busy and hectic with project and program monitoring. the management is supportive and willing to work with the team toward the mutual goals. The hardest part is decisions are sometimes made before a clear project scope has been agreed upon. The most enjoyable part is working with dedicated professionals to accomplish a goal.
good,"Multi tasking managing Gas & Electric crews on a daily basis"
good,"Company did not communicate changes accordingly across the board.  There was a huge gap in communication,"
good,"Good work environment"
good,"has been a very interesting company to work for. The largest I've ever worked for. I started out in Finance and worked my way still doing numbers but within the line of business. There are many lines of business and ""mini operations"" I would say within PG&E. Each one is different pull and lever to the success of the company overall."
good,"Due to PG&E's financial hardships, I would be very cautious about taking a job from them.  Currently most of their onboarding is occuring thru recruiting agencies."
good,"I found the use of contractors offensive. Out of 30 person NOC crew only 8 to 10 Full-time employee's. Among cohorts, this creates a cutthroat culture. Only the nastiest survives."
good,"Worked with great people across all lines of business during a difficult time for the company. At the time, the workplace culture instilled a renewed commitment to safety and ultimately to the company's customers."
good,"Overall, this a good company to work for from a pay/benefits perspective.  As with any large organization (20,000+ employees) often times the bureaucracy prevents accomplishing goals in a timely manner."
good,"If you're not digging ditches or climbing poles, you really don't matter.  The duality of corporate America, that and the Company is going bankrupt.       I don't really have anything else to say, but I have a minimum number of characters required for this ridiculous review process."
good,"Historically, PGE has been a very good company to work for.  Good benefits, very good pay, and a good work environment.  Now with all the uncertainties regarding wildfire liability, the atmosphere is very job scared.  The future of the company will definitely be different from its current state, but no one knows what that will be."
good,"Meetings with the line of business I support."
good,"06:00-Wake up and get ready for work; 06:30 Travel to work, arrive at 06:45, speak to dispatch about workload and staffing for the day, pull work up on computer to verify work is distributed correctly to 20 field employees. Verify work priorities and tags are issued correctly, log in to payroll site to verify and approve payroll for employees, get on conference call at 07:30 to discuss workload challenges while simultaneously checking work load; field calls from employees and tracking switching challenges. Receive calls from various departments asking for assistance with issues and challenges. Attend various meetings throughout the day, check with dispatch and employees throughout the day to verify work is being completed efficiently. Travel to the field and spot check employees for work verification concerns at least 30-40% of the time with a goal of 50%. Finish day around 16:30, travel home. On-call throughout the evening in the event an emergency occurs or employees need assistance in the field."
good,Great company to work for. The challenge is that many decisions are taken as a result of bad press instead of what it is better in the long term for our customers. Safety is in fact the number one priority. It is sad to see in the news people speaking badly with second intentions (layers).
good,"My experience at PG&E saw the company lose its reputation as a company that cared for its employees and customers, to a company that cared only for its bottom line and stock value. It neglected its obligation to the public to perform proper maintenance of its infrastructure in order to lower its operating costs on a regular basis year after year, resulting in severe consequences to public safety."
good,"PG&E deals in Gas & Electricity.  With both being volatile, employees are usually serious about what they do.  Rather they take their job seriously, and they should.  The field workers (linemen) are well trained and do their job safely and proficiently.  There is a pride that every PG&E employee has, be it in an office or in the field.  It comes from the days when the company was looked at with softer eyes.  A tmen or crew were heros when they'd re-energize an outage particularly following or in the middle of a big storm.  It's less so now days, but still true to some degree.  On a typical day our (work) group of as many as 10 (usually less) total had 3 daily ""A"" desks or hot seats as they are sometimes called,  Others worked a swingshift and a graveyard shift.  The job requires 24 hour coverage.  The three (at times with supplemental help) would divide the work somewhat equally while preparing to get barraged with field personnel wanting to know and get direction about their planned or emergent work.  All of us tried to do our best to keep planned work on track while dealing with outages and other work emergencies.  All the while balancing digital maps, reporting, dealing with field employees, rules, computer equipment (SCADA), unforeseen issues and requests from supervisors.  The hardest part of the job is juggling and prioritizing the work while maintaining alertness and staying cut in so that everyone goes home safely.  The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the people I work with (field) and beside."
good,"Need to improve the work environment ethnics, understaning and more clarity defining methodologies..  "
good,Good salary and benefits. somehow the management plays too much politics. making individual employee compete each other in a bad way. Overall it is still a good company to work for.
good,PG&E was an excellent place to work and the project team was well qualified and supported. The culture and the workplace either in San Francisco or in San Ramon was quite good.
good,Utility business is generally risk averse and not much incentive to use industry best practices. Many processess and work flow could be improved with better application of best of class industry practices.
good,They dont treat contract employees with respect and the contract extensions are unpredictable.I worked here for 9 months and would rate this place a average place to work.
good,"This is my first job after a successful military career. PG&E definitely is a great place to work and offers many career opportunities However, it is not perfect. A few minor changes could make this company a top ten place to work."
good,"Staff is very friendly and supportive. Management is trying to keep up with the latest technology and processes. Management can be a bit too secretive and don't really let the staff know about changes till they actually happen. Workplace culture is quite relaxed and everyone does what they are supposed to do. Networking in this company is very important if you want to push your work through faster. That's the hardest part of the job because it sometimes takes longer than it should to get some things/issues resolved."
good,Training and education provided throughout the company to help you know your job and perform at a high level.  Good training is one of the hallmarks of PG&E jobs.
good,"Great co-workers.  Lay offs every year that I worked there.  Very damaging to moral.  Administrative Assistants are generally over looked in every way.  Very little acknowledgment, but well paid.  Hardest part of job was creating ways to make a difference and be acknowledged for accomplishments."
good,"I've worked for 38 years for PG&E in numerous job locations on both sides of the house, gas and electric. I've had the privilege of working with highly talented and creative people. I'm fortunate in working in gas storage for one of the most knowledgeable supervisors I've come across and hopefully will be retiring under his leadership. The technical work is challenging and cutting edge. My crew members are highly motivated and my boss, having been a tech, is in touch with the work in such a way that he schedules and plans so well that we do an astounding amount of compliance and reliability work safely with a small group of people. The work life balance isn't great sometimes and that has kept me in the union as I see our supervisors working extended hours and making about 5% more than the top paid craft. I haven't had a day where I haven't learned something new or been bored, so feel like this has been a great job."
good,"Every day is different. Fast paced, need to multi task, be a quick thinker, and handle emergencies when arised. With our department an emergency response department, we must ensure safety and at the same time meet our customer appointments and demands."
good,"My workday is hectic, busy, challenging, but a job is what you make it, and I keep very busy and challenge myself to exceed my daily goals.  I've learned that what I learn on my own and incorporate into my work helps me the most; anyone can fill my chair; don't expect anything and you won't be disappointed.  I know my job and have many contacts, my focus is to get the job done with little or no supervision. I have many co-workers in several departments at my work site.   I enjoy working with the crews at our yard, as well as outlying yards.  The hardest part of my job is being a union member;  It's nice to have union benefits, but when it protects people who don't want to work, it makes my job harder.  The most enjoyable part of my job is going to the office, taking care of the crews, learning something new every day and know I did the best job I possibly could whenever I'm there. The relationships I have with my fellow employees is priceless, and we are all like a family.  I know that when I retire it will be difficult to leave, but I also know that I gave it my best every day."
good,The most enjoyable part of my work day at PG&E was educating the small to mid sized hispanic businesses on how to save electricity and money. Also introducing them to programs that would retro fit their currrent lighting or refrigeration at little or no cost to them.
good,A very fast track . I was contract labor-worked in central California in mid summer. I learned a lot in daily job cost reporting and people management.
good,"•	Management and on the job training of all PSO’s."
good,"It started as a great place to work. Highly family oriented at first, people would interact outside of the job. It changed over the last 15 years to a company that seemed more interested in making money than caring for their employees. It then got more rigid with the installation of managers that didn't know the work. It forced people to manage themselves with no one to turn to for help except their peers. Good benefits and great union people to work with."
good,I worked at PG&E for almost ten years and I believe that it is a great place. I started in a very entry level position and was promoted several times over the years. I worked very hard and I was recognized by the company. I loved working on a team and I was a great team player. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team and working with all of the different personalities trying to accomplish a project on time.
good,Start work at 6:30 am have a meeting. Get my paperwork out of cubby. Get my itron device grab keys if needed or special instructions. with my route map start my 12 to 15 mile walk residents or business' recording volumes of gas and electric meters. on a daily had to deal with dogs some of the routes were backyard routes. Finished my day at 3:00pm
good,"I've worked 3 separate times at PG&E as a Contractor. They pay very well, if you are highly skilled and educated. They treat their employees well, even their Contractors. I've tried to go perm there a few times but each time, I either don't get the job or the job is removed do all the drama with downsizing and budget changes because of the fires and lawsuits. I would go back, if asked and I do still occasionally apply, something comes up that I seem qualified for.  PG&E is one of the last companies to offer a pension, which is unprecedented in today's corporate world. The managers are very nice, and employees are very helpful and work in teams. People are often afraid to speak up for fear of upsetting higher management since the management style is top down. Senior management is constantly under scrutiny from the CPUC so there is no creativity or innovation. But it's still a great company to work for. I will always have fond memories of my time at PG&E."
good,I worked as a contactor at PG&E for two years and enjoyed the experience!  There is a 2 year limit for contractors.  You must then take 6 months off before being eligible for another contract.
good,"Top notch and conscientious organization. Working on 2 Projects for PG&E. One was a Licensing Basis Verification Project and the other, a Cyber Security Project. The people at PG&E are very supportive, professional and care deeply about their job and responsibilities to provide safe, efficient nuclear power."
good,"PG&E did not pay our short term incentive plan because of folks who suffered in wild fires.  Also my work was demoted to a lower salary level.  This is not good.  I think I'm worth more than the 33 cents I got per hour this year.  "
good,"I love working at PG&E. Due to current issues, this is some turbulent times and the energy efficiency programs may be in trouble. Would be intereted to see what happens in the future."
good,All in all PGE is a great place to work. My only complaint is that my pay scale does not fit my job duties and the commute. I do enjoy working a 4/10 schedule and would hope to continue that schedule if I were to ever choose to leave the company before retirement.
good,"On an average day, we would get to the yard and make sure our truck had every that we needed for that particular day. We would then head to the job site, do our tailboard, and start working. The management was just OK, I felt that there could have been much better communication between the foreman and supervisors."
good,"Project management that turned out to be 85% finance juggling, and the rest actual management.  Very odd model for balancing finances and budgets.  Workplace atmosphere relaxed to hectic, and have meetings thrown in for good measure....lots of meetings.  Hardest part of job was relying on good data for accurate projections.  Most enjoyable was the team atmosphere."
good,"Great place for administrative roles.   The sales and service department however, was very dismal because it is not a real sales organization.  There was no product training at all, which means not much chance in succeeding in the role."
good,"Great place to work, terrific benefits and lots of opportunity to stretch yourself. Many different departments to work for within company. Hundreds of different jobs."
good,You could start your day with a light workload. The weather wasn't the only thing that could change your workload. It could be a system failure or a Car Pole accident many things could change your day from an 8hr day to a 48hr day once you started your day anything could change your day or week.
good,"In some positions it can be stressful and work /life balance lack at times, but PG&E pays well and still a great place to work. You can excel and move to different positions. There's no one place to work here. You can be customer service to project manager"
good,"Good place to work not too much wiggle room with schedule.  Would definitely recommend this company to anyone.  Great pay for customer service, best in industry."
good,"Good variety of growth/positions within the company and excellent benefits. "
good,"PG&E is a good place to work. They have a wellness program center. We can have Yoga, Zumba, Meditation, TRX, etc. practices almost everyday.  They have pretty good benefits such as 401K, pension plan, employee discounts, etc."
good,"I like working at PG&E.  Great people throughout the company.   Job satisfaction however is based on your manager.  If you have a good, transparent manager, work is good.  If you work for a micro manager (like one I had that timed a bathroom break), it can be really demeaning.  On one level the company taps all the right buttons, but in some internal organizations, the best thing you can do is hide in your cube with headphones on and block your calendar from your manager's view"
good,"Not without flaws, but this is a good company that rewards hard work and critical thinking.  There are challenges in the industry and in the way the company functions at times, but these are balanced by the depth of experience one can gain and the opportunity for advancement that is available."
good,"A super great place to work if you are an employee.  Contractors, however, are not as fortunate with the job security there.  Recent fines imposed by the CPUC required the heavy layoffs of about 800 plus contracted staff.  The experience of employment depends highly on the supervisors and managers you work under and the people in the group, as is with many large organizations."
good,It was great working in a team environment.  I enjoyed working across the various engineering domain teams. Upper management made it easy to talk too.
good,"Doing great things and can use more innovative thinkers at every level, within each group. "
good,"This truly is a great company to work for with excellent salary and great benefits.  The only down side is that at times it can be too process heavy due to too many engineers in leadership positions."
good,"Team work important"
good,"good company to work for. great people to work with, safe environment, travels a bit too much, a typical work day can be to change a backyard pole that is inaccessible using cranes or helicopters, or changing out 2-6 poles while circuit is still energized. most enjoyable part is working storms and watching people get their power back on."
good,Good place to work. Worked here for more than one year. Good communication among employees. Better place to share knowledge.
good,"Currently plan out jobs for the Gas I&R (Instruments and Regulations) department. Pull data from SAP, PLM and other reports and create Work Plans for Supervisors and higher management. "
good,"Generally, a comfortable place to work. However at some times, some management folks were so focused driven on some goals that would reflect their bonuses or possible promotions .... they in a sense, tuned out the reality of what really happens and what needs to be done. In today's culture, I'm guessing this goes on all over, gathering from various conversations I have with folks whom are in various industries."
good,"Working for a company that places such a high emphasis on community and personal safety is a delight. I recently had the opportunity (and there are many opportunities here) to visit the field and speak with construction crews. Their concern for the local community and with the safety of their crews and the general public is nothing like I've ever seen before. No matter who you talk to - whether it's an employee or a contractor - you can tell the values of the company are deeply held and honored."
good,Typical day involved customer generated appointments for gas appliances and service.  Along with immediate response to gas leaks and down power lines.  Most enjoyable was meeting new customers and filling their needs and eliminating hazardous conditions.
good,"A typical day at PG&E is one of fun and self motivation. I Learned to work independently and convey compassion for customers in compromising situations. My co-workers i considered to be part of a work family, we all worked well as a team and helped one another with any job related problems. The hardest part of my job was overcoming my fear of dogs. working for PG&E we encountered many different kinds of dog on our routs. Working safe was an important factor in meter reading and in my everyday life, so learning how to deal with certain dogs and making sure i was able to contact customers to put aggressive dogs away helped me work safely and proficiently. The most enjoyable part of my job was month end. Month end was a time when all of the states came out on performance and i loved to see how well i did. I enjoyed my time at PG&E it was a wonderful experience. I especially enjoyed my manager Kitty Russel, she was a grate manager who taught me allot about myself. I was 24 years old when i started at PG&E and she helped develop me professionally. Unfortunately due to smart meters i was laid off but i will take everything i learned to my next career were i can shine in success."
good,"PG&E is a good place to work, there are generally a lot of job opportunity and the ability to move up within the line of business or the company in general.  The benefits are great and by and large the people are top notch."
good,Ensured the safety of the public through security measures
good,"Myriad of departments that contribute to power and gas. A typical day is never typical, always something new and exciting."
good,"-2012 was about customer outreach, with the Time of Use Rates coming into effect.  We needed to make phone calls to reach out to our customer to give them the information and offer ways to beat the TOU Rate change with doing energy efficiency projects."
good,"Good Organization to work for.  Lots of social activities and charitable donation push. A friendly environment to work in, people are usually very friendly."
good,Used to be a family oriented and had work-life balance and not anymore. Outsourcing strategy changed the culture heading south. Very reasonable compensation and benefits. Will give 7 out of 10.
good,There were a lot of contractors vs employees who work there and the environment is very political and competitive.  Overall though it was a nice place to work.  I learned a lot in the years I was there and most everyone helps each other.
good,"fellow employees were setting you upm fpr failure, management at higher levels would not take medical documentation as justifiable absence. I quit a career in the US postal service to join PGE only to get done wrong."
good,"I was a contractor at PG&E, helping to work on their SCADA systems, which were very complex and critically important to help run and monitor PG&Es many systems.  The technology was a bit dated, but the people you worked with were solid and made the job well worth it."
good,"I worked for this company for 35 years.   During my employment the company was consistently results and safety focused.  There was no question as to the direction to be taken to perform well in one's job nor the standards that were to be met.  Metrics were a big driver to performance.  "
good,"If you are looking for a stable career, PG&E is a great place to work. There are several different departments, so even though your career interests may change over time, you can maintain your transferable skill set to every job within the same corporation for your entire career."
good,PG&E is a competitive company that provides a treat learning opportunity to build and grow existing skills.  Management can be difficult but i feel the company was moving in a positive direction when i left.
good,"Allowed me to develop my strategy, implement, and be recognized for the accomplishments. I routinely meet with the top executives and I influence the company’s direction for material and service quality."
good,"As a Contractor, I was greeted with fear and slight upset as the position I was given was not known to the team I was joining. I would recommend PG &E review their office dynamic policy about how people are treated upon starting a new position with the company. Over all, once everyone got comfortable with each other the entire office was pleasant to be in and I felt like it was a collaborative team."
good,Great team work and a lot of support from the team and managers to get the tasks done. Opportunity to learn new skills and technologies. Management is open to suggestions to improve the process for solid product dleivery and operational support.
good,"Good work culture, good management, good learning opportunities provided, latest technologies used, competitive and helpful teams tow work with. "
good,"I was a contractor and left PG&E as my contract ended and relocated to the Redding, CA area for a better quality of life.  My job was fun as I was able to work with various employees and help them meet their construction equipment rental needs."
good,"Best job I've had. Great management and work environment with excellent support system and amazing training. The pay can't be beat, and the advancement opportunity is there."
good,Working hard to correct issues and will be a great company in the future. It is difficult to work in San Francisco unless you can afford to live downtown. The cost of living in downtown or nearby is very expensive. The employees are good to work with and generally very friendly.
good,Work environment with flexi schedule. Suitable environment to learn about Utilities domain. Since I was a contractor here not much I know on the employee benefits
good,"I was contracted through Robert Stephen Consulting a chunk of all of PG&E's property to see that their floor plans were still the same. It was very flexible but did require a lot of driving and planning beforehand. Essentially, I just walked through their buildings and made sure that everything was exactly as my tablet said. If things did no match up I had to redraw them with measurements and send the drawings to an architect at PG&E to have fixed."
good,"Amazing company, love working here! Very stable company."
good,"After 12 years with PG&E I've learned a lot and accomplished a lot,  met a lot of smart people and worked with a lot of quality people.  I'm doing what I like and feel that it matters.   Everyday I'm learning something new,  that's the best way to participate in the growth of a company."
good,"You clock in and get o work . "
good,I love this place because people treat you professionally and even though I was handling 5 projects at a time I my working hours never crossed beyond 7-8hrs a day and I was never stressed and salary that was paid is awesome as a contractor.
good,had a wonderful time as a Summer Intern within the ISTS Telecommunications team.
good,"PG&E is a an interesting company to be a part of to say the least. As a marketer within the company, you are constantly challenged on how to engage customers with an intangible commodity that they never think about unless it is broken. This hurdle pushes the team to think outside of the box to come up with creative and persuasive ideas to reach customers and cut through the clutter."
good,"As far as the benefits and work life balance you won’t find a better company."
good,"The good: Upper level management is serious about customer satisfaction"
good,"If you are looking for a truly diverse workforce that has an outside reputation of not being cool but really is, then this is the place for you   Coming from the tech sector I thought we had the best systems and thought leaders.  While some companies are sexier the systems the sleekest; however, the how they conduct themselves with each other, care about their work and the customer is amazing   I will take PG&E over primary colors any day  anytime"
good,"Good company, friendly co-workers, responsible and dedicated people.  Good corporate culture, reasonable accommodations when needed, and a very interesting job."
good,PG&E is changing. In the IT department they are moving from traditional organizational structures and waterfall SLDC methodology to an Agile framework.
good,PGE's office is in San Francisco. It is an amazing city. San Francisco is a beautiful place to work and a wonderful place to live in. I loved living in San Francisco
good,My student internship with PG&G was too short to have a qualified review. The overall experience during this one month internship interested me enough to pursue a career as a lineman.
good,Don’t believe all the negative press PGE is a nice place to work. In beautiful San Ramon. It’s peaceful. Could have a better cafeteria but other than that I loved it
good,Loved working there and it was a great place to grow and continue the career.   Manager was very knowledgeable and learned from her and the other members of the team
good,"The work environment is really good,got to learn many new things in SAP,also learnt every type of activity for professional and physical growth too.I learned the most in my PG&E account as the leads were there to guide at every point and gave us KT too if stuck anywhere.the most enjoyable part in company is the project meetings where you can without any fear discuss with your manger about your problems.Also,we have different activities like flashmobs,singing,cooking sessions and much more."
good,This project was a major corporatewide initiative which impacted over 6000 users.  It was a transformational project with great cost saving opportunity.
good,"Stable, productive and fun place to work. Great location in the city, downtown with good access to local facilities. People there are generally kind & supportive"
good,It was a great working experience. I learned a lot. There are lost of opportunity for growth. There is a job/work life balance. I enjoyed working with them.
good,"Good company, great innovative team.  Project managers are respected and PMO community is very collaborative.  Overall, PGE has alot of opportunities within."
good,It is a very good place to work.  Many hard working and excellent professionals make a different for PG&E customers.  The work life balance is good and sometimes remote work is allowed.
good,Field engineer with roughly 30-40% field work and the remaining office work. Nice work life balance. Employee appreciation could be better but overall amazing benefits.
good,they believe in their people and it shows. I can be a little slow to hire people from contractor to FTE. I liked who I worked with and they liked me. yes
good,"great place to work if you like contracting.  Too bad the work is in California where the government thinks it needs to help workers.  Government, please stop helping me.  You turn so many employment jobs into contract jobs because of all the ""help."""
good,People at PG&E are super friendly and welcome a new employee to help. I've had a great experience with people so far the only issue I faced was that onboarding took a very long time.
good,The company is well maintain to the employees for healthy work environment. company is giving good salary and well treating for the employees security
good,"As an intern, at first the company was very unorganized in finding stuff for me to do. But, as time went on I was placed in R&D group and started working on things."
good,"Benefits include a great health insurance package, pension, and discounts. If employees participate in a health screen they receive cash that is applicable to the health insurance deductible."
good,"PG&E was a very large utility company in northern CA, which includes the Bay Area. They had a large contingent of contractors which tend to be a revolving door, but also has a diverse set of SME's workforce which came from the field and other business units. I liked this because they gave a different and invaluable perspective to the IT culture. However being a large utility, they were process heavy and bureaucratic. "
good,"I was brought in to assist the Information Technology group,. It was a good group where it had a great team environment.  The assistance and appreciation was great."
good,I have been with PG&E for almost 9 years. Very good place to work. Changing culture and environment. Job security not that same due to financial challenges.
good,Technology was dated and needed improvement.  The work was not creative or challenging.  The company was trying to make changes in the technology but was a slow pace.
good,Great place to work with a lot of opportunity to advance in your career and develop new skills. Great leadership in my experience that values work/life balance and aims to support employees however it can.
good,"Best part of the job is the benefits and pay, your role is very clear and you work in a large expansive system."
good,"PG&E is a stable company to work for, with engaged employees who care about the work they do. Most of management supports a good work/life balance, and promotes upward mobility. Communication between corporate and field employees could improve. The company is at a crossroads as the energy market changes."
good,"Pros: excellent benefits, stable company, lots of free perks; company is doing well "
good,"I have worked at PGE for well over 20 years. I would say that this is a great place to work, and it focuses on diversity, Job Work/life balance. I would recommend PGE to anyone who is looking for a career."
good,"The benefits are great!  But it's not a sexy company that you would necessarily brag to your friends about working at like Facebook, Google or Apple.  Overall, it's stable because for the foreseeable future, people are going to continue to need electricity (even if it's just for back up for customers with solar and battery storage)."
good,As a saw operator and skilled laborer i was new to the logging culture but i grew quickly within the company. It was a laid back job and for the most part simple tasks (if you have common sense).
good,Challenging job.  Well worth the effort and stress.  I was able to see parts of the state that I would not have been able to otherwise.  The people are focused and enjoyable to work with.
good,"Love PG&E i’ve always considered my strength to be ‘the Translator’ between the business units and the technical departments. To properly interpret, comprehend and then transcribe what is needed and when it is needed. I have worked across all business areas, understanding the human interaction required to be business, personal & professionally diplomatic. Both business and normal conversations can illicit great results in gathering business & functional requirements and to write development documents if needed. As a consultant, I have experience in bringing on board and transitioning both internal & external development teams. I try to work like I live, to create something great and have fun doing it."
good,"Friendly atmosphere. Many opportunities for career advancement in pursuing whatever your career aspirations may be. Great comprehensive benefits - medical, vision, dental, 401K and pension plan. Headquarters is in the heart of the Financial District in San Francisco."
good,Great place to work. The company provides the training you need to work safely. The primary focus is on safety and customer service.  They allow you to try different departments on a temporary basis.
good,Coworkers lacked motivation and were not very willing to help.  Management seemed to be the root cause of this issue as they did not expect much productivity.  Lack of pride in work showed.
good,i work with a variety of people and their common goal is obvious in their committment to a safe workplace and their high ethic stand.
good,Great Company to work for. Great potential for growth and scope for more opportunities and networking. Highly recommended for anyone.
good,I am on call 24/7 365 days a year and handle all security request and most major security incidents for PG&E. Very exciting position and no day is ever the same.
good,Loved working for PG&E. I was hired as a contractor through a contracting agency and I loved every day and minute working for the TSC with in PG&E. I worked for them for a full year till sadly my contract was cut short. I wish that I could do it all again!
good,Company values your experience.  Plenty of opportunities to benefit the organization.  Work is valued.  Employees hold high standards for conduct.
good,I only worked here for 3 months. It was a great summer internship experience during graduate school (MBA). But I'm on-the-fence as far as working here full-time.
good,"PG&E is a typical large company where job satisfaction depends on ones immediate management chain."
good,"In a city of tech start-ups with catered lunch, potentially massive windfalls if the company does well with an IPO, blow-out holiday parties, and limitless vacation time, PG&E sort of sucks in comparison. But, in the rest of the country, this would be considered a pretty good place to work. There is definite job security, great benefits (pension!), great location if you work at headquarters, definitely opportunities for advancement, and a good work-life balance."
good,"Took calls from PG&E employees with PG&E facility related matters."
good,"A typical day at work can consists of meetings in the field with different construction and maintenance personnel to discuss a current project or doing design work via CAD or different meetings with other engineering team members. My department has an extremely diverse employee base in terms of age, race, and background. The hardest part of the job is working with very old substations with little and/or inaccurate information and working from that. The most enjoyable part of the job is the camaraderie and team work."
good,"good team culture"
good,"Casual working environment in a union setting, always busy."
good,I enjoyed working with my crew. There was a constant focus on safety.
good,"I enjoyed my tenure at PG&E.  The benefits are great and there is plenty of room for career advancement.  With more than 20,000 employees, there are a lot of perks and discounts that are not available to smaller companies."
good,"This is a very interesting company t work for if you are interesting in the energy sector, but it comes with the challenges of a big corporation... and then some."
good,"Routine Planner work."
good,"Love my job, company is great to work for and has wonderful benefits."
good,Love working here. Company is a great place to work for. Enjoy the family environment and the different cultures. Love the different possibilities of positions you can choose from.
good,"This has been a good place to work at, Pg&e provides a positive work environment with a dedication to safety and job completion. Management and personnel work together closely to ensure the jobs get done right and efficiently. The benefits provided are second to none."
good,"Pacific gas and electric is a great place to work with both people and envirognment,  not only do you learn about people put your computer skills grow in leaps and bonds"
good,PG&E offers a unique environment to work in allowing one to expose themselves to various other work cultures.  Definitely a necessity in developing a well round individual able to handle all aspects of a work environment.
good,Not a lot to say except things are challenging currently. You can get more information by reading the news. I'm not comfortable elaborating at this point.
good,Utility job.  Lots to learn and do.  In California.  Not sure of what if any work outside California.  I worked for them about 30 years and retired.  Now I live in Tennessee and thinking of doing some work here.
good,PG&E provided a great salary considering the short term job I was hired to do. I worked well with my schedule as a student and helped me get some much needed experience.
good,Management was a little difficult at times. You just have to work through it. The overall culture is very friendly. Your co workers have no problem answering difficult questions when you need help.
good,PG&E has a very strong culture of creating a diverse and inclusive workplace.   They have been promoting D&I for over 40 years.   They have an onsite day care and are a great place for women to work.
good,At PG&E you can have a long and extensive career and if you would like to try your hand at other jobs it is a good place to try things out and move around in your career or advance yourself.
good,"They saw to it that power was delivered to their customers. We paralegal temps were treated fairly and respectfully. We assembled ,reviewed, and graded documents that were responsive to requests."
good,overall great experience would highly recommend working for this company. They are very stricken about attendance will be terminated if your late from breaks or lunch.
good,Fast Paced and a great leadership team. They understand the challenges coming in this industry and are adapting. They focus a lot on employee engagement and have great benefits.
good,"IT was a great experience working here, for the most part people will lend a helping hand when they can. Unfortunately budget is the top priority and it really shows when it comes to cuts."
good,"Although I was in the Call Center, the company as a whole is an excellent company to work for. "
good,Good people and solid comp and benefits.  Offers state of the art Utility computing experience.  I enjoyed working here.
good,"Great place to work with great workers that are part of the union.  The company paid very well, and most of the management were very professional."
good,As a intern you learn a lot about the company. As a intern you don't necessarily get to take on too much meaningful work. Management is nice and supportive. The CEO seems like a great person with good leadership.
good,"Busy workplace with great attention to detail - dealing with legal timelines and accuracy cultivate a focused mind.  The annual FERC filing consisted of witnesses crafting testimony for various departments throughout the Company (e.g., Finance Department) - the variety of areas made this work interesting."
good,"This is a company that offers relative stability and job security but suffers from antiquated thinking and a very hierarchical structure that limits its ability to evolve. The energy business is undergoing rapid transformation and presents great opportunities in many areas including renewable energy, smart grid technologies and electrification of transportation. Unfortunately, despite its size and critical role in providing energy, PG&E is not a very nimble or forward thinking organization and doesn't present an inspiring career environment for anyone seeking to advance quickly in the energy business. I think this is partly attributable to it being a regulated utility and partly because it is a very old company."
good,Project cost analysis for over 200 previous projects.  Learned SAP and provided summaries and graphics pertaining to the progress of the clearance operations team.
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced, prioritization is an often utilized skill. I've gained a lot of Project Management skills in my current position and have utilized customer service skills throughout my career. Management does their best to get involved with escalated issues and improve business processes. I have worked throughout different departments of the company and every team I've been involved with has been very knowledgeable and helpful. The hardest part of the job can be dealing with a very high workload at times but every individual within the group does their best to help each other out."
good,"Good place to work and enhance your skills."
good,"awesome company and geea coworkers"
good,It was a challenging and fun working environment where ideas were shared and incorporated into the work culture. I appreciated the emphasis on utilizing minority and veteran owned business suppliers whenever possible. Deadlines and workload sometimes seemed overwhelming but management supported and encouraged employees through difficult times and made the day fly by with a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment.
good,"PG&E has a commitment to supporting its employees' professional development through work experience and/or educational opportunities."
good,"My day typically started at 6:00am and ended at 5:00 - 6:00pm."
good,"PG&E has given me the opportunity to grow and learn. I was able to make an impact in several areas including making things better for our customers. Unfortunately after camp fire and bankruptcy, the company is trying to find its path again"
good,Company is great but lost its vision. There is less emphasis on trainings other than on the job training (work related only). There are lots of surprises (not good ones).
good,Everyone who works there is very individualistic. The office is nice but the internship itself is more of a learning experience involving CPR training and etc.
good,Everyone says good morning to you each and every morning. There is light breakfast every morning at all break areas. Need to buy your own lunch. I'm running out of things to write
good,I enjoy working at PG&E.  I do travel a lot and that can get old sometimes but I enjoy the work and the people I work with.  I am always in different cities and towns so it makes the job very interesting.  I have great management to work under.  They take care of what needs to be done.
good,"Well balanced for work / personal life, "

good,Great place to work and a very educational. It is a place for people that have Utility experience
good,I worked for PG&E for one year in the student as temporary/seasonal employee.
good,I likes everything on my current job with PG&E but work location is 125 miles from my home in San Ramon. So I am staying in a hotel while I am working and on my days off I am coming back to San Ramon. So that is main reason to change my job. I need a job closer to San Ramon so I can come home everyday and maintain my family life.
good,Flexibility to work from home or office in newly renovated collaboration.Good work environment for new employe. Also the co-workers are very helpful during the project.
good,Typical work day: Interfacing with various departments and traveling to job sites for project meetings. I enjoyed learning about power transmission  operations. The managers were good and the workplace culture was conducive to good team work. The hardest part of the job was having the workers follow new procedures but this was overcome. I enjoyed contributing to completing projects on schedule.
good,Brief experience with the company but they have a heavy emphasis on safety and really want to take care of their customers.
good,"The week I was there everyone was nice, both as a Site Supervisor and as an Intern. Everything went as planned during the internship and many my interns that I supervised had a great time being there as well."
good,"Typical Day conducting maintenance on electrical circuit. "
good,I advise that if you can get a position outside of the Customer Contact Center (CCO) you will have a much better chance of success within the company.  The contact center acts as of if they are their own company within PGE. EXAMPLE they recently started randomly drug testing ONLY CONTACT CENTER EMPLOYEES. However Credit/Billing/Call Center are under the same union contact. However they can up with a clause that since Reps answer emergency calls such as gas leaks and outage that falls under theb DOT. Funny thingbis Mangement doesnt have to test.Management changes every 3 to 5 months they aren't helpful you are micro managed If your even 1 minute late they give you a tardy.They expect you to put up with customer talking rude and disrestpectful to you.Customer file a complaint and they open an investigation. You pay union dues every month and the shop stewards don't fight for you.The union reps seem to work with management not employees.Best thing about this place is the pay But a very stressful environment.Honestly management doesn't even talk to you until you have did something wrong.
good,"amazing people building a facility for other apprentice lineman to obtain their hot hours. I learned how to do everything from setting poles, stringing wire and energizing the circuit. it was all enjoyable!"
good,Able to help the community to stay safe by keeping vegetation away from poles with high voltage of electricity. Being able to help people to stay safe was the most rewarding part of the job.
good,"Great place to collaborate. Employees stays there for 16,20,25,30 years. My boss have been there for 16 years, and even after all the negative stories we hear, she is still in love with our company."
good,"PG&E is a great company, with management that genuinely cares about its staff. I believe in the company, and the direction its headed. We adapt quickly to the changing environment, and always attract talented people"

good,"This 3-pack of 5 gal. paint sticks are the highest quality. It is sanded to a fine finish for great quality wood product. It can be used for mixing or stirring paint. Other uses include making crafts, signs, etc."
good,"I was a contractor there however I was given opportunities to work for different teams, network with other colleagues within the organization.  I maintain positive relations with folks I worked with there."
good,"i loved that company, because of my pregnancy i quit the job, and again i just wanted to go back that company but there is no vaccancy tats why i am looking forward."
good,As a Project Analyst at PGE.  I was always collaborating with others to come up with the right solution and providing analysis of various projects.  I enjoyed the interaction with others in the job.
good,Budget cuts have impacted IT staffing makes it difficult to get all project work done on time. Most PM's are two year contracts therefore always a churn. New offshore transitions are still a work in progress.
good,It was a wonderful experience working with the PG&E team. The project was implemented in agile environment. The best part of my job was to interact with all middleware team for integration.
good,"Used to be a great relaxed place to work,now people that have no actual experience working in the field are running the store and have unrealistic expectations.has created an atmosphere of unhappiness and also they don't take care of their injured workers who gave there blood and sweat over the years to help make this company great.once your injured and of no use to them your pushed out the door,they only do for you what's required by law nothing more.in my situation after 43,yrs of service and this is my personal opinion and observation"
good,"fast paced environment, good people.   must be able to think quickly and adapt to new situations.   value safety and be willing to help others.  great office environment and employees"
good,"Great work life balance and learning curve."
good,"PG&E is great Company and i have learnt so much and enjoyed working.  I have supported three IT directors and team of 101 which was very challenging.  I also managed dual location, three days in San Francisco and 2 days in San Ramon.  Workplace culture was excellent and enjoying part of the job was to support so many people and i become strong team player.  I have great experience in doing so many different tasts."
good,"Safety and customer satisfaction are PG&E's top priorities. Working closely with so many different departments gives an employee great satisfaction throughout ones career. Camaraderie amongst all employee's came very fast and led to many friendships, both the working force and management."
good,Pacific Gas and Electric is an amazing place to work. There is plenty of room for advancement if you are a dedicated person and if you re willing to travel or move.
good,"nice working place for learning .enjoyed working there"
good,It was great working at PG&E with professional people who did their very best everyday. Working as a Land Technician was a rewarding job that I hope to turn into a career.

good,"great company to work for, but after 3 years, I needed a change"
good,"Great Place to work. Excellent company ethics, community promotion and involvement. Green - renewable, etc focused. Good benefits."
good,I was lucky enough to have a mentor who really took the time to understand my career goals when I first began working at PG&E. He was also my boss and the person who hired me so it meant even more to me that he wanted to help push me into the next role i was seeking.
good,"It was a great place to work. Good people with great work ethics. Wild fires cause lots of layoffs but when global warming occurs, what do you do? Had so of the best years of my life in California...."
good,"great place to work and advance for career purposes. Very progressive regarding employee development and technical training, Good focus on performance management issues as well as compensation/rewards and recognition."
good,"PG&E is a great place to work.  There is always change going on, however Safety is always their priority.  The people you work with are for the most part happy friendly people."
good,"There aren’t many opportunities to do something really big. To impact the lives of millions of your friends, family and neighbors. This is what we offer you at PG&E. We deliver innovative energy solutions to 15 million Californians, from the Central Valley to Silicon Valley, all the way to the Oregon border. Join us as we build a better Californi"
good,"As a contract employee in my work there was little to no room for a permanent position in current title.  Flexible work schedule with all remote access needs except cell phone.  Management is good with many changes in co-worker support.  Hardest part of job was trying to get correct financial information with recent changes to internal processes.  Most emphasis is placed on finance, not project construction.  this was a great learning experience that will carry on for long times."
good,good place to work over all but they are clearly going down. I myself was not ready for a no fun dry environment. I would tell you not to do it its a older persons work place
good,Awesome place to work if you are a full-time employee. Too bad their staffing selection is not based on the skill-set that a potential hire possesses.
good,"This was at a Nuclear Power Plant it was on the beach, I could see whales out my office window.  Very relax place to work.  Management was great.  Great safety culture."
good,"The company offers great benefits and most people are great to work with. There is a strong culture of safety and it is practiced by all employees.  Unfortunately, approval and deployment of technology projects requires a lengthy process causing them to lag in technology to be productive and efficient."
good,"I have been with the company for years. I plan on retiring here. The pay is amazing. The benefits are good, but they used to be better. And after some time under your belt, you can work a shift of your choice and achieve good work/life balance but it takes time, and lots of hard work to be successful here. But I will say, this is a tough job to have when you're a parent. I wish there were more parent friendly jobs to work while parenting young kids. "
good,Can't describe a typical day at work as I worked in several departments over my 10 year employment with PG&E.  I always worked with awesome co-workers.  We always worked as a team.  I learned the ins and outs of each department.  I worked for some really neat supervisors.  I think the best part of my job was working in the front where the public paid their utility bill. The interaction with the public was so awesome.
good,"learned a lot of information about the Hacking and its methodology."
good,Due to the fact that there are not very many big companies in fresno if you get a job here you can feel secure. Pay is good and you get pleanty of overtime
good,"Excellent Benefits"
good,"I loved working for the company. I had a pretty hectic work schedule. I was the assistant for the manager along with 5 supervisors and over 50 field tech installers. Along with handling basic admin duties for my team, I was an invoice specialist. I worked daily with our vendors and third party contractors who did jobs for our department. I was responsible for processing the invoices for the work that they did in order for them to be paid."
good,"Managers were good, fun people to work with. They were very supportive and tried to help me as much as they could particularly in my first few days as a consultant there."
good,"Smart, professional people. People work a normal 8 to 5 pm work day. Downside is I worked for a supervisor who didn't have much to do and tried to micromanage me to justify his position. Eventually I had to leave."
good,It's a good career. There are a lot of job opportunity. I really like the place. I enjoy working with customer's and my coworkers. The day goes by fast in this fast pace environment.
good,The company offers great opportunities to develop your skillset. This will allow you to pursue career advancement as well as an increase of responsibilities.
good,"This is a fast pace job with many different things to do depending on season and what drills are happening. Great coworkers, and great management. Everyone is more than happy to help everyone else."
good,"I loved coming to work. I worked a lot of overtime and had my own balance. We always had something to do, it was always different. I learned from being at Alameda that I learned far more than I ever thought. For the most part I had great experiences with my             co-workers. The hardest part was staying up all night. The best part was staying up all night and having people come out in the morning and thanking us."
good,"My review of PG&E is that it's a great company to work for because the job culture is very diverse and they provide continuous learning, growth, & development for their employees."
good,"good work enviroment with other employees, all hands on work from the working boss to the lowest man. Everbody is eager to help, On the road most of the time. Coming home is the best part of the job"
good,"PG&E was a great place to work, Everyone who works there was excited, and proud of the position they held. Although the company has its issues, we all really wanted to help do our part. I am thankful for the oppertunity PG&E provided to me. Almost the whole company is Union, so the pay and benefits were AWESOME. I would go back in a heart beat."
good,"Until a reorganization occurred I was very pleased and positive about my role."
good,"People can be really nice to work with and have great knowledge of the work.  However, it may take time to move up/get promoted.  Depending on the job, there may not be much work/life balance."
good,PG &E is a good company to learn new stuff. But i spent very little time with them.I worked as a contractor. Its good organization to learn new stuff.
good,As a hiring hall employee you will answer a job listing and it can be listed for a few weeks or a year this is not a Guarantee that is one of the things I dislike about the Co. I have several years as a hiring hall employee and I have been trying to get a full time permanent position with PG&E for years. I am number one in the books at the hall and you would think they would want somebody with that much experienced.
good,"It was a typical office job. I spent my day evaluating projects that were submitted to PGandE, speaking with customers on what they needed to do if their proposed project did not comply to regulations, and attending meetings."
good,PG&E values safety above all and managers working for PG&E are given complete control over the safe completion of their work and that of the crews reporting to them.
good,"When you can get in at PGE, they do compensate you well and the benefits are good. The people I work with are lovely and it is an enjoyable work atmosphere. Management is old school and elitist and that was the worst part. Very exclusionary."
good,"Amazing place to start your career as a young professional looking for career advancement opportunities.  Great benefits, paid time off, and a multitude of job types and locations."
good,"Great place to work and advance.  Salary above average  Can work "
good,Great place to work if you have the option to work in a department that value you and your contribution. My supervisor was non responsive to anything that I did and did not provide a good atmosphere to complain.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with and the fact that my job was fast paced and I learned something new every day-never a dull moment.
good,I love it here. I'm not sure what you guys would like me to say about PG&E. Very good retirement packages when your work life cycle is completed. Very easy to commute.
good,"I have worked for PG&E for ten years, and I am happy with the company's direction and enjoy my current position. My goal however is to move out of California, in which I hope to find similar employment.PG&E has great benefits, great management, and a strong Union - all things I hope to acquire if the opportunity presents itself."
good,"I REALLY love this company. They take care of their employees through wonderful benefits, a competitive salary and flexible work schedules, at least within the Safety organization."
good,One of the best companies in Northern California to work for. Diversified work force and great benefits.
good,Great Bay area company that hand picks and scouts theire own talent and belie es in them. It was a great job that I wish I sti was at. But I was too young to understand big money corporations and how they operate. You live and you leE

good,"Pacific Gas and Electric is a good company to work and offer great career opportunities, good benefits, and compensation. I would recommend Pacific Gas and Electric to anyone."
good,"PG&E is a big company with a lot of benefits. This is the good side of it. However, hours can be long and salaries aren't that high, so this is the bad side of it."

good,"This company may be big and stodgy, but it is getting back to basics by focusing on its customers and improving its core business."
good,"I was a contractor for PG&E at the general office complex in San Francisco. Title: Installer; meaning, I worked out of a PC lab delivering/installing computers and computer accessories to PG&E employees while also performing other misc. tasks. My typical day of work included working alongside talented and knowledgable people who taught me a lot about Telecommunications and computer science. The work environment, while at times felt cramped, was never stressful and was actually very enjoyable. Due to the nature of my job, I got to visit employees all over the building and meet all types of people every day. Everyone was generous for the help and understanding when issues required further examination. My co-workers were like me in the sense that they were young and technically savvy, so it was a pleasure working with them. The hardest part of the job was the occasional slow patch that came along once in awhile where our typical workload was seemingly nonexistent (but I suppose that means we did our jobs right the first time around.) Overall, my personal experience at PG&E was very enjoyable, and, while not exactly being the type of job that one might call a career, it was the best job i've had yet."

good,The projects I was assigned to were a great fit to my overall experience. My bosses were very good managers and very well versed in the PGE culture. They offered good advice and were always available.
good,"Great place to work.  Tremendous investments in their employee development.  Afford a lot of movement including job rotations.  Masters degrees preferred, preferably from a top college required for advancement."
good,Great job just keep in mind it’s kind a like going back to high school and everybody thinks they are the cool kids compared to the new guys so there’s a lot a behind the backTalking and gossiping which is disgraceful because Pg&e is supposed to have an equal quality and treat people with kindness and respect but I didn’t get any of that when I was working there from the shore for months but all in all it was a great job because of the money I just wish that there wasn’t so much favor doing in managing positions in and just all-around child like behavior when it comes to a job so serious we’re all here to get the job done
good,If you are looking for a career this a great place if you are committed and willing to relocate throughout CA as advancement opportunities present themselves. If you are just looking for a job...this is NOT the place. Linemen and Lawyers will have work for life.
good,I enjoyed the challenge and support received during my employment. There's so much opportunity to grow and excel your skills because of the support and training.  People are treated with respect and very professional.  I highly recommend PG&E a great workplace.

The workers were all nice and very open to answer questions. The most enjoyable part of the job was visiting different job sites and learning about the different task they had to complete.
good,"Typical day, enjoying my day and time with my co-workers from the moment we walk in to the office we are talking, laughing, making jokes. The management is amazing here I couldn't ask for a better boss or supervisors, they work in a team and make everything easy for us to understand. Ive learned so much from this job, especially learning about all the forms from the state/government that everyone can have. The best part of every day is being around such an amazing team that helps one another, all smiles in this amazing office. I couldn't ask for a better team than the Care department."

It has changed so much, however, that I don't know if it still has the same culture that it did, which included great advancement opportunities for women, excellent benefits, clear expectations, high safety standards, and exceptional professional and academic advancement opportunities. There was a reason employees stayed for their entire careers."

good,"Great place to work as a contract employee that allows one to obtain experience working in the electrical field, as well as open doors for one to become a permanent employee."
good,I was able to complete grad school with full support from my employer. I will be forever grateful. Their tuition reimbursement program is perfect for employees who want to continue with higher education. The leadership team worked with me while I was in the MBA program. I was able to maintain a healthy work-life balance all along.
good,"I do like working here but feel particularly lucky with the GTPM team that I work with. There are opportunities to move around and grow, BUT currently (2017) we are hugely cutting back/laying off."

The manager for my position was very insightful, doing his utmost to make sure I was both included as well as had a valued experience within the company. The employees always made sure that I was comfortable within my work environment as well as offering me a plethora of options and outlets for help with the assigned tasks given to me within the company. Helpful site visits proved critical to me being able to grasp the constructs of my position."
good,"PG&E strives to provide employees with every benefit available.  They are focused on customer, as well as employee, satisfaction.  Safety is of utmost importance and is practiced daily in all facets of work.  They stand behind their values and extend them to their employees as well.  Support for me was always available."
