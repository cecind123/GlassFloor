rating,review
bad,Racist company from the head down. Allows management to bully and assault employees then push them out the door to avoid legal consequences. They don’t care about workers.
bad,The management gave the employees no margin for error. Always looking for a guilty party to blame. Half the day was spent on meetings instead of working or hands on solutions.
bad,This review only covers the department I worked in. The management of my division had unrealistic expectations for all non-management staff. They would frequently expect employees to work 12-16 hours.
bad,Not surprised they have been purchased by another company.  Extremely demanding and really don't care about employees just the bottom line.  Apparently the didn't watch their bottom line enough and have been purchased by a foreign entity.  Good job St. Jude.......cluster of a company.  Best place to work my $$$!
bad,"Lacks good work-life balance, opportunities to grow. Senior management is clueless and keeps on changing the org structure around every 2 years."
bad,"The management are very bad, the workload are extremely stressful, "
bad,"A typical day at work consists of going to work at either 7am or 3pm. You will work 8 hours from the time you get there including two 15 minute breaks and a lunch break. The work is boring and takes a lot of looking through microscopes which hurts the eyes. The coworkers were nice though, so I'll give them that."
bad,"The management is awful, the supervisors, HR department just about everything in this company is terrible, they treat you very bad, unfair, no benefits and $7.25 for 3 years!."
bad,Worse place I have ever worked. Management is a joke they have their picks. You are not given the respect you deserve. And you make one mistake even if you are training you never hear the end of it. Low salary also 10.00 for first second and third 11.00 that is hired on. Tempts. Make 9.25.
bad,Stay away  from this company managment treat you like a nobody no paid raise to many coordinators that sit @ there desk all day and do nothing to help
bad,"- Crabby supervisor"
bad,It was stressful and hard to do your job.  It was a racially driven place. No advancement for certain kind of people. The manager would never say anything nice only negative.
bad,"The area that most technical knowledge should have , they do not "
bad,"Towards the end of my time with St.Jude Medical, the job became very unsatisfactory for me. It was sad to see the way people use the Human Resource department against their fellow employees."
bad,"Avoid "
bad,Unfortunately St. Jude is a bottom line driven company that uses employees as a resource rather than personal. Managers use intimidation and fear of termination to reach their production goals.
bad,"Can't really say it was a great place to work, but it was a job that paid decently. Too bad they laid all of third shift without any warning and right before the holidays. There is no opportunity for advancement unless you are really good friends with (or are related to) one of the managers."
bad,I would prefer a better culture more interested in reliability engineering.  Reliability engineering is not a discipline the company currently actively utilizes.
bad,needs to develop  technical electronics product trainings
bad,Micro management and no personal life is what would describe this place the best. You'd have to work 10 to 12 hours daily at minimum wage and not complain about it ever or you'd probably hit a blacklist with administration and soon after that would get fired. This company really doesn't know how to manage its employee's and literally will put anyone with a degree as a supervisor or manager and never give it a thought to evaluate their work. Very stressful environment at all times with harassing-type of management. Would never recommend working here unless you are literally on the brink of bankruptcy.
bad,"Learned a lot from my manager, although I went through multiple managers within my time there. I felt I was overworked and was not compensated fairly for the duties I performed."
bad,"There is no St. Jude Medical."
bad,"Overall I would not recommend working there. Too much politics and managment has no vision for the future. New engineers are hired based on capabilities, rather than on experience."
bad,i worked on a project there and it was alright. if you like a quite area and no one to talk to then work there. i feel the people are highly judgmental
bad,In 2012 this company paid over $200 million in fines to DOJ. Corporate and personal greed rule. Sales are down. Benefits have been cut several times. Employees used to be valued. Now they are an expense to be controlled as much as possible. Morale is horrible.
bad,Managers are very strict hard to advance to many coordinators that sit around and don't help out on the floor going to the restroom you need to let the coordinator know you are going very strict on lunch and breaks .
bad,Stressful workplace.  Management is bad.  Favoritism is wide spread.  Not a lot of room for advancement.  Very low pay.  Definitely not a good place to work.
bad,"Management is really not strong. they are not on the same page, its not a united place where every one will work together as a team. They do not hire the right people for the higher chairs of the company."
bad,Employees are not appreciated. Salary is so low I can't afford to move out! If you're not in with the supervisor... Then you don't matter! When we have a shut down we HAVE to use our vacation time! We are watched 24/7 and get in trouble for talking like we are children. The best thing about my job are the friends I have made.
bad,"Get rid of supervisor for incoming quality she is trouble,liar,and not a women of her word the manger is worst she tells him what to do.the work place is very stressful if she doesn't like you find away to get  you out door even lie on you and ha e others to lie for her because they are so scare of loosing their job"
bad,Management can get very unorganized and sometimes unprofessional. Don't expect too much on pay increases when converting from temp to full time St. Jude employee. They offer good benefits but PTO sucks. A lot of opportunities for over time.
bad,Best paying job ever. Tedious work; call center for Pacemaker/ICD mfg. Fascinating engineering aspects of the job. So many bright Biomedical Engineers. Not many clinical roles
bad,working with aerotek as a tavi operatore was very poor. they didn't care much about they're employees.
bad,"The job was a contract job to help St. Jude  close many old buildings at its Minnetonka facility. It was a job with lots of lighting changes made, including changing ballasts in whole areas of ceilings, working 27 feet in the air."
bad,"Terrible mangement and pay . Not ethical but practice a lot of diversity which is fine mangers don't talk to you like you are an adult.  No room for growth.  Can't take off or be a minute late without getting ding for it. Benefits just barely meet requirements "
bad,"Boa empresa ,tem bons benefios,a direçao da empresa muito boa todos sao muito educados,sabe entender a situaçao dos funcionarios,a parte mas dificil era fazer a valvula e ela voltar para retrabalho,a parte agradavel era fazer e ela passar de primeira era gratificante."
good,"Lack training, structure and motivation. Constant overtime, however, contract employees remain permanently contract."
good,"worked manufacturing."
good,"A typical day at work is processing medical device report forms by correlating in groups or with field specialists such as sales representatives and health professionals. "
good,"Money good, but unorganized. When St. Jude bought out Cardio MEMS, They did little listening and change processes they knew nothing about. Purchased equipment that the building Clean room could not support or get up and running."
good,Typical day is you sit at the same table everyday and do the same operation everyday. Temporary workers takes two years to be hired usually try to fire you first.
good,I weld and inspect medical parts. I test each part to make sure there are no problems. Working at St. Jude Medical I learned a lot about making and inspecting medical devices. The management there was poor in my opinion. The job was very easy but the shifts were long.
good,SJM is very behind in the software technology it uses to build products. This used to be a great and fun place to work at but has changed a lot since the last 5 years due to several reorganization changes.
good,Alot of work and not enough hands to complete the task. There is always assignments to do but not enough hands to do it. Too many generals and not enough soldiers.
good,"St Jude was a good place good workers. They have good ethics. However, the management but unnecessary stress on the workers. They made it seem that number is better than quality."
good,"My experience was that it was a wonderful place to work. I did very detailed important work. It was facinating to learn their products. The work was rewarding. Later in my five years, the management became intolerable. However, they were all let go since."
good,Job is extremely challenging and busy. I really enjoy helping the entire global team. We have executed lots of changes since I joined and we have done a great job.
good,"A typical day working in my department usually consists of processing compliant files from the field about the products that SJM makes. Occasionally there will be meetings on how to process specific categories of complaints or group meetings because the project is broken up into different groups. The co-workers are nice and friendly and like to help each other. The hardest part about the job is that the rules in which we process the records constantly change, sometimes multiple times a day, which requires us to go back and do a lot of rework. The most enjoyable part of the job is being in an open setting as opposed to being confined to a cubicle."
good,"Fun work place. I learned a lot. Unfortunately, there are no advancement in my position, no salary increase and no motivational benefits for the employees."
good,Everything is done manually.  We were not using any accounting software. The management is open for suggestions which make easier to discuss have anything that would benefit the entire organization
good,Management has went down since I have been there since November of 2014. Good place at first but then soon find and see the many flaws of the company. Management think mandatory over time will fix there problems and it is only waring down the employees.
good,"I manage 10 different clinical studies (in CRM/CV/Structural Heart) at a number of North Texas Centers. I assist centers with the regulatory/contract/budget processes start up. Support is provided through the enrollment phase. As technical or  clinical support is necessary for the devices or studies I provide that support. When centers need prompting to submit the clinical data at a high level of compliance & proficiency, I provide that encouragement."
good,It's always fun working with people who has the same thinking towards anything in life but it's the salary and management that's not favorable or so.
good,"Um dia bom para trabalhar, dias corridos e outros tranquilos, aprendir a dar mais valor a vida, a direção e a gerência é boa,os colegas de trabalhos são tranquilos,o mais difícil e aprender lidar com as diferenças,a mais agradavél são os ensinos que a empresa oferece."
good,"Currently the company is in transition after consolidation of multiple divisions. What will the culture be like and will leadership that has brought the company through many successes in the past pull the company out of the current wreckage to a prosperous future, or is this the beginning of a long slow death. It is hard to tell at this point if pride and greed for power will win over open mindedness, humility and drive for innovation."
good,"Turn over, over 20% is too high having an unemployment rate over 17%, no work retention plan...business goodies as software & technology last in line...most enjoyable part of the job co-workers. Lesson learned brown noising works..."
good,Benefits taken away. Extraordinary growth with profit sharing taken away. No incentive to stay. Years of valuable people leaving. Future of this location uncertain. Management and intern run.
good,muchas ventajas en la empresa bastantes beneficios para sus empleados buen trato humano
good,"Buen paquete salarial y beneficios sociales, pero ambiente de trabajo malo sin posibilidad de promocionar."
good,A typical day is going into work greeting people with a smile and a hello.I have learned a lot from this job as a QC Inspector. The hardest part of the job is working four ten hour days.The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I am making a difference in someones life with the products that we make. example:(neurostimulators for the spine).
good,"Nice cookers, nice supervisor, have a place for walk during break, the management is low,and in lunch room very dirty, we have six microwaves and only three of them are working. all the trash can in the lunch room are open during lunch time."
good,"If you only want to maintain the status quo and not go anywhere, this is the place to work. Job security is minimal at best. Management allows an environment of childishness and tattling. Perception is everything here, as I have been told multiple times. So, it doesn't matter what your work abilities are, or that you can prioritize and meet deadlines..."
good,"I learned a lot from my first Manager. She was an excellent manager, however my second manager would only look after himself. I learned how to do cost accounting and how to analyze the data that I received."
good,Everyone is polite and help each other when they are needed. Having celebrations and fun outing activity with other people within the company that you barely knew.
good,Not much room for advancement. Decent company ultimately acquired by a larger firm. Management was too rigid to change and continued making the same mistakes
good,"Currently I am a contract worker for St. Jude. I do not get company benefits. That is why I am applying for other jobs"
good,"Medical assembly working Monday-Thursday 10-hour shifts.  Sitting for a majority of work day.  People are generally friendly but workplace can be cliquey,"
good,It was cool working here but the co workers were always talking. Pretty diverse culture. Alot of favoritism was given by supervisers. Dead end job couldnt move up.
good,"empresa muy ambiciosa en los objetivos de venta, lo que conlleva mucha presión en las ventas. Invierte en investigación y compra de otras empresas pero no tanto en el desarrollo de personas. La formación técnica es buena, pero es un equipo pequeño en España y no tiene muchas oportunidades de desarrollo real."
good,Learned to work in a clean room environment.Made sure tools were sanitize and the chemicals i used were up to date and not mix batches and all raw materials were recycled.Got along with most workers
good,"Medical products take years to develop and mature, it uses rather older technologies and kept improving the product. Not really a place that uses top-notch technologies. If you wish to learn new things, probably not a suitable place for you. However, it's Medical product is still very cool though..."
good,I learn the best skill of all! Dream and keep dreaming. This was told by my own boss to keep looking for something I enjoy doing but at the same times need to make sense for my family and myself. I am person who enjoy to learn new things and except new challenges.
good,There are more twists and turns working here than a roller coaster.  If you have motion sickness then i would suggest that this boat ride is not for you.
good,"I had to wash my hands, grab a gown, hair net, booties for my shoes and gloves. This job is tedious because of the products I had to build and the steps it took. The difficult part is some stations where the product needed to be made needed more time but performance also counts on how fast you can get it down."
good,The company is just ok; nothing great but not awful.  Feel like everyone has just given up.  Feel like I have not progressed or regressed in any area.
good,Ambiente tranquilo sin mucha novedad.  Se realiza el trabajo bajo supervision.
good,A typical day at work and no development plan for mid-level employee. The most enjoyable part of the job is the production people/ worker who is energetic and friendly.
good,"Fun fast work environment, lots of daily deadlines. Fast paced with great salary and competitive pay for most positions.  You have the ability to advance if you put in the work and prove yourself."
good,Our division of St. Jude made great products that tremendously improved the standard of life for those who could afford to purchase our medical devices.
good,Mycket team bildning.Ibland var det stressigt när vi hade en deadline då allt skulle vara klart för leverans.
good,"It is like be on the train, fast pace work a lond hour to work bud have a good benefit dental, heal plant, 401K and vacation paid,good culture dont have a stron GMP process."
good,"must be multitask co workers not share knowledge employees not listen by human resources.not good comunnication between management and employees,and no balance with the workload"
good,"At this job, you are assembling pacemakers in a factory setting. The hours are good. If you get first shift, you can work 7-3 m-f and are paid for your lunch time. It can be a difficult job at times though, as these are life saving products and they have to be assembled and tested very carefully and correctly. The pay is very low to start, and it takes a long time to get more. I met a lady who had been there for over 10 years and just now started making $15 an hour. This was a temp position for me. Great people though."
good,"The work was a lot of fun, I really enjoyed Soldering and all the traveling I had to do for training. My coworkers were a lot of fun and really great with getting me on track."
good,"Good company to work for. saves lives. The people are nice, I have nothing bad to say about this company. Its a big facility. There's another building across the street."
good,The employees and management team are very genuine and supportive. The culture is very positive and it is a fun environment. New ideas are encouraged and implemented.
good,It was a good job. Weeks went by fast. A lot of drama amoung the employees. Lots of diversity. Breaks are too quick. They hire you on after 3 months.
good,Had a lot of knowledgeable people that did what was needed of them to get the job done.  Also most people didn't mind working with the other departments.
good,"I like staying busy and learning any new job that was available."
good,"Responsible for answering service desk calls within the specified service levels. Coordinated service requests from initial input into Remedy system through completion of service. Performed software installations, system configuration, and troubleshooting.  Responsible system administration, including the demonstrated ability to provide work/lead direction to a team. Formal training inWindows XP and Client Architecture and working knowledge of the application of remote control software."
good,"Ok workplace.  Some people not so friendly.  Nice lunchroom."
good,I worked through a temp agency when I worked at St. Judes medical. I worked inside a clean room as an assembly worker. I worked with very small parts to make an angio seal device for hospitals.
good,I had been working 12 years during those years I learned assembling develops medical technology & services that focus on putting more control into the hand of those who treat cardiac or neurological patient. My co-workers and management were good.
good,"I enjoyed my work experience just didn't enjoy coming back to work on crutches, dropping my return to work notice on HR desk and ten minutes later ushered into a conference room and terminated.  They did send me home in a town car though."
good,"* Always busy chasing numbers...monthly/quarterly"
good,"I started at St. Jude after several years in aerospace and defense. Quite a culture shock, but, it was a growing company that still thought of itself as a small company, things like profit sharing, employee appreciation, stock options, generous training all made St. Jude one of the best places to work. As the company continued to grow and expand into new markets, the company changed and was now a even bigger company with less focus on employees and training."
good,"Some managers are excellent, but the company is under extreme pressure now with Medtronic getting condition full-body MRI approval and core values are buckling."
good,fun and frineddly place to work and realy good doctor and good staff
good,Professional place of work.
good,"The environment at St. Jude Medical is serious and down to business. Because of this, everything is fast paced and extremely deadline driven. The separation of work and compartmentalization is extreme at St. Jude Medical and it works for them. That being said, St. Jude Medical is a great place to learn a lot in a short amount of time as long as one is willing to challenge themselves and work through problems they have not encountered before. Although I was a co-op I felt the work I did was still important to the company and was not shortchanged at all or looked down upon because I was an intern."
good,Is a good enviroment for the acquire knowledge on the job area.
good,I work with a cable that goes to the heart i assembly some parts and weld the parts in a microscopic laser machine
good,"While I was there, it wasn't a fun place at all. You will be told to do quality job at the meeting and quantity at the work floor. I was so confusing."
good,"St. Jude medical is a very diverse work place with great employees. This company provides nice incentives such as, a fitness center for all employees, nice trails to walk during breaks, and a big cafeteria that is convenient to all."
good,"Company had a lot of good benefits and nice perks.  I liked my responsibilities but it depends on the department and the management.  Very clicky, but I guess a lot of places are that way."
good,"word in group., word under pressure and have my responsibilities up to date. have paper on time. happy the lidres with the lines, happy all person. lote vericar"
good,"St. Jude Medical is now Abbott.  Previous to the acquisition, employees enjoyed an open collaborative work environment where the work was challenging and rewarding.  Employees at all levels of the business worked together to get things done right--maintaining compliance and exceeding customer expectations.  There was a sense of ownership and responsibility.  As with any acquisition, change is ever present.  The hardest part of the job in the past two years is the introduction of multiple new systems as well as a new Quality hierarchy. Dictation of procedural direction without the applicable resources provided (to all locations) has made it particularly challenging to implement.  It is perceivable that with time, resources will be more evenly distributed, communication will improve across the organization, and policies and practices will become second nature.  The Liberty team maintains the Core Values instated years ago:  Quality, Commitment and Passion, Fun, Teamwork, Community, Integrity."
good,"very rewarding position, hours and pay were amazing, management was not. My cousin passed away while I was employed with this company, when I asked for time off for funeral and just time to grieve I was told that I could have two none paid days off, but that was it because my work should be my priority not the dead.. NOPE NOT EVEN KIND OF KIDDING."
good,"En typisk dag är att börja dagen med gruppmöte och går igenom verksamheten."
good,My co-workers were great but the position was not for me. It was too tedious and I felt like there was no where I could advance.
good,"Friendly co-workers,  good health and dental benefits. Company has cut a lot of jobs recently causing the morale to go down."
good,Good place to work however there is a lot of turnover thus affecting workload.
good,I learned that teamwork built on a sturdy environment. I managed myself around people whom I worked with and time. I enjoyed working on the product. My typical day at work was flexible.
good,St. Jude its a good place for working. The culture and people are great. Is a company that if you do not have studies is very difficult to obtain a good position.
good,"The hardest part of the job was to visual inspecting devices, parts/assemblies of foreign materials because you can see through the eyes only microscope. The most enjoyable part of the job is if you finish your work on time as a team."
good,"my work is very important for the company even for company patient. because that is about patient life."
good,"The works and co-workers are good, somehow I do not like to perform all the work with my hands at all time."
good,"I like to share with my family during my days off or holidays. I like to visit movie theaters, beaches, mountain. I practice mountain bike and athletics. I have had a great work relationship with people in charge. I'm try to get strong and clear communication with co-workers to get commitment form them."
good,I give St Jude an overall rating of 3.5. It is a fast moving IT department with very limited resources. You need to be able to joggle multiple projects and priorities at all times depending on the ever-changing business requirements.
good,"Working at St. Jude Medical, I have learned a lot about the medical device industry. I have come to enjoy the greatness of making devices that can save lives. But at the location I worked at, I did not like my management team. Due to the fact that I worked for two different Production Leads, I was stretch very thin and cross-trained in many positions which I had no issue with. Although I was able to complete tasks for both teams, the leads did not have good communication which led to misunderstandings and unnecessary panic at times. The hardest part of the job was definitely the lack of communication between leads and their employees. There were a lot of employees who would have enough productive work for half the day while there were a handful of operators who had to be extremely productive the entire week to complete their tasks. Another hard thing about this workplace is how sly they are to making experienced employees train employees with more seniority and then promotes the senior employees into the trainer of those respective positions, which is completely unjust to all of the experienced employees who work so hard to learn and perfect their techniques for their position."
good,Assembly line. Trained and worked in multiple stations when completing medical device. Hours worked were Monday - Thursday from 4:30 pm to 2:30 am.
good,I have experienced a lot working here and have learned a lot over the years.  It has been a challenging at time but paid on in the long run with the accomplishments that were achieved buy the team.
good,microscopic laser welding.
good,"The work inviroment is really good everyone gets along, its always busy, work is good, get to learn something new everyday, there is always a challenge."
good,"I don't  do much working  for this person he is very nice understanding person and likes to do everything for himself, I just watching  him, making sure he  takes his  medication and make sure he  uses his oxygen .. he likes to be very active , but is not able  for to much time, he gets very light headed at times , so I help him up , and to and from wherever he need to go . I sometimes have to remind him I am there to help him, but he is so used to doing everything for himself , very independent .  I like his family they are very nice to me."
good,I enjoyed working at St. Jude.  The people were really great to work with.  I worked in the complaints department and on trending notebooks.  I also started working with a new group that was obtained by St. Jude.
good,typical day is passdown from the previous shift.Go to assigned stations.Self directed teams.Management is hands on.work place culture includes an Activities committee.
good,SJM has where I worked has macro management and strong support team.  My supervisor gave me most of the tools to do my daily tasks.  I got to do and learned almost everything about the project that I was working on. I love my work there.  I wish Saint Jude Medical hire me full time there.
good,"It used to be a fun place to work. The atmosphere is heavy and unhappy. In part to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Hopefully they will be able to turn the company around positively again. I learned a lot about our product and its function. A regular day would have 200+ calls per hour, but since the phone system changed to be answered by an automated attendant, that went away. Hence the lay offs."
good,"a fine place to work, I had a good manager but expectations were not very realistic, they value the work but not so much room or tools for improvement. company is downsizing more than ever since they started manufacturing in Malaysia."
good,"It's easy to be proud of what we do at this site. Through Employee Appreciation celebrations, patients with our devices have visited and shared stories of the miracles our products provide. We have a great team, comprised of the most diverse and talented engineers, scientists and business professionals. The continued expansion to a global platform has afforded opportunities to learn something new each day."
good,"The project was a short gig to fix a system that was not completed by another programmer that left.  The manager was basically hands off for most of the project, so had to work with business user of system.   Offices are nice for the most part.  Nothing going on in immediate area outside of office park.  Project was interesting as I had to analyze and improve a system without documentation. Also had to program something I have not done before so interesting to learn to ways to solve business need."
good,A lot of works but the salary is low.  The manager can talk easily especially in religion related.  They considering and respecting the religion of each employee. A lot of things can learn.
good,i love my job there because anyone at my job was friendly helpful kind we was always a great term worker ..management was so good to me i can't really
good,"St. Jude was a good company. I did not interview there. They purchased Tharatec while I was employed at Thoratec. "
good,"I worked here for about 2.5 years, it was a company that was very financially motivated. I felt many of us worked without clear direction or unity - our corporate communication meetings were all one direction - them telling us what we need to do to improve in the market. Was hard to stand out or get noticed for anything you were able to accomplish and improve."
good,En resumen St. Jude se dedica a la fabricación de aparatos médicos como marcapasos y neuromoduladores. Los operadores aprenden la metodología detrás de la creación de dichos productos. Una gerencia muy atenta y consciente de los problemas de los empleados. Hay un ambiente de productividad y compañerismo.
good,I like working there. I met a of nice people there and have party every month. They pay very well and always have over time. What I don't like is the hour.
good,"Na época, pensa no bem estar do funcionários, organizada, ambiente tranqüilo."
good,good job to work in. those require fast pace movement requires having a wire soldering certificate a nice decent job to make a living job pay those not increase very often.
good,"Saint Jude Medical is a great place to work for, great benefits.  Clean and neat. The salary was a little below average, so I had to move on and back to Kurt Manufacturing Company."
good,"i liked working at st jude medical, Abbott bought out  the company and down sized the work force. thats the reason I am no longer working there. But I did enjoy my time at St.Jude Medical."
good,Great organization with great mission. I enjoyed working with the team and learned new skills. I would defiantly would like to work for this company again.
good,some days are stressful due to the pace of that particular day. Great team players and very clean and comfortable work environment. only downside is dealing with rude patients.
good,"Recently acquired by Abbott pharmaceuticals, Large clinical team with very talented individuals. Large volume of clinical trials covering many therapeutic areas."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with but the work we performed was based on contracts. "
good,"a typical day at work for me is pretty fast paced and always on demand. I work as a packager and in a warehouse facility. I enjoy my job because I like how friendly my co workers are, team work is always a great thing when it comes to jobs like these. I'm very people orientated, and love working with others. I love learning new things and challenging myself. sometimes it gets frustrating to be the best I can be when I feel like I don't get praise for my hard work, and getting under pay for working so hard, yet I never give up and I will continue to work as hard, to the best of my ability."
good,"Great technology "
good,"I worked for SJM full time from 1995 to 2004 and the culture has stayed the same, hard working but trying to have fun at work. I have worked for some of the other large med device company's and would rate SJM as the best. Would like more consistency on how contractors are converted to full time."
good,Interesting projects that keeps you busy all day with meetings and customers. Fun place to work. Colleagues are wonderful.
good,Panera Bread is a great and fun place to work at. There are a lot of opportunities to move up the ladder.
good,"Although I was not a full-time employee (I was a 'contractor' hired to work on a project with a fixed deadline), the project leaders were full-time employees who were excellent mentors who genuinely tried to help me (and the other contractors like myself) succeed."
good,Good company but changes strategy too often and so employees loose focus with constant management changes.
good,This was a very productive work place. I enjoyed my co-workers.
good,Like-minded coworkers. Easy to work with. Proud of making devices that save lives.
good,"I have enjoyed learning about St. Jude Medical's product and systems. I received training in SAP (ECC/CRM) which has been invaluable. I have also learned how to process credits/debits for accounting and have been able to work with purchasing teams. It has been a very well-rounded position giving me the opportunity to work with a large sales team to enter medical billing, work with different facilities, and assist sales reps and regional directors with anything they need to help their month ends go smooth."
good,Cut backs and reorganization provided inadiquate resources for trial expectations.
good,it's a good company with lack of professional management at the time I worked with them. They offer a very good benefit plans. the workplace was a little bit  stressful.
good,"I have enjoyed working at St. Jude.  St. Jude is my second family.  My typical day working is review what patients are coming in and assessing their needs.  I have the responsibility of setting up their treatment tray, taking photos of wounds, and transcribing the clinicians findings.  I also keep track of our inventory and keeping our treatment rooms stocked with wound care supplies. I also make appointments, answer telephone calls, and process payments."
good,"I love my job, I love the implants, and I love the customers and the patients, but it is all coming down to contracting which takes my ability to earn."
good,"No job security. Changes appear to be arbitrary at times. Good equipment to work with, but there appeared to be very little emphasis on continued education. The technology was also getting a little antiquated."
good,Very busy on a daily basis. Learned many business applications from many different areas of the business.  Very hands on applications.  Best part are the employees.  Great to work with.  Daily pressure to make quotas.  Satisfaction  knowing what you do makes a different in somebody's life.

good,empresa muito boa de se trabalhar. me proporcionou otimo aprendizado da lingua inglesa e sobre rigoroso controle de qualidade.
good,The engineers at St Jude Medical are all nice and helpful people. The company is large and things are very departmentalized. Everything takes longer than you'd expect because every step has to go through multiple departments to be up to the standard operating procedures. This can make work very unexciting.
good,"I really enjoyed working at St. Jude NMD, they had great benefits and the facility was very nice. I learned allot from the people i worked with and the users i supported."
good,I was involved with CAPA and validation project. User friendly management where project distribution and timeline practices were well thought and achievable. The most challenging portion of my project was to repudiate  inspection plan and update procedures.
good,Contractors are treated very well here. Great management and great focus on the mission. This fast pace environment and focus on the quality of your work. The company environment requires that you do it right the first time. The training was fast paced and focused on you learning your job very well so that mistakes are minimal. Management is easy to work with and are willing to listen to employees. They are willing to take time to train people correctly. Employees are encourage to ask questions and grow in thier knowledge of this business. I was very impressed with the fast and intensive training. Work output was monitored for quality and quanity. I worked with very smart young people and this was refreshing to be a part of  a great company. I would highly recommend this company.
good,"I worked for St Jude for roughly 3 years.  People were great and supportive.  It was a revenue driven company, cost was secondary.  Consequently, overspending was rampant."
good,Good work environment with very smart people developing and driving products. Certain roles provided limited growth as most projects only require a certain number of people with various skill sets.
good,St. Jude good place to work recently sold to abbott. I have been working there almost four years. Temp to permanent. We are building the heart monitoring devices.I recommend every one for a such great company to working with.
good,"Worked with top physicians, hospitals, and health systems. St. Jude invests in cutting-edge technology so it is never a question as to whether the products are relevant."
good,"The company has evolved over the past six years. They have become more corporate centric. Some aspects of the centricity are very good, but the attitudes towards employees has suffered. There is less employee appreciation. They have become more concerned with being a business, which mean more job security."
good,"Work with production to get products done on time."

good,St. Jude Medical is a great company but the Plano office has been and is continuing to go through a lot of layoffs.
good,"The salaries at St. Jude were the best I had in my career, and the benefits were good.  Most of the managers I worked for there were competent and good.  My only problem was the way they treated employees who got laid off.  They would notify them suddenly, put them in a room for an hour and kick them out, sometimes with very little time to get their stuff from their offices.  That showed a lack of respect to me of the employees.  A lot of pressure there, at least in my job.  Otherwise a good company."
good,ambiente onde o funcionario é valorizado e tratado como ser humano.
good,This has been one of my favorite places to work in my career timeline. You work with people that are mostly happy with their jobs and company goal oriented. Hard to hate a job where you help invent items that save peoples lives.
good,"They gave me my first job and allowed me to be an independent engineer.  I think they got the better end of the deal with me, but that's expected at entry level.  They noticed my talents and promoted me after 1.5 years, which was only questioned by HR since that is not standard."
good,"Answering high call volume of technical support calls "
good,"An average day at work meant high-volume requests of varying topics. Our team supported the Americas Division (US, Latin America, and Canada) and handled the process of employment starting with on boarding, through employment agreements for a competitive industry, and eventually employee terminations including Reduction in Forces, Resignations, and Policy Violations."
good,St Jude was a fast growing innovative organization that was in the midst of a multi-year SAP single instance implementation around the world.  As a member of that team I had the opportunity to work in many places with a diverse set of cultures.  Very fast pace and rewarding.
good,"Fast paced environment at times."
good,I Wish they didn't relocate to another state. Loved working for this company. I actually loved my job. I learned a lot from the people and this company. I wouldn't be where I am today.
good,"Everyone is normally in a good mood and easy to talk to. Communication barriers in the department that I work for are not an issue and neither has it been with other departments. Management in some areas could learn to loosen up in order to allow their employees to maximize their full potential and abilities. Other than that, compensation is decent, the people are great, the company is solid and there's a cafeteria if you happen to forget that morning to bring your lunch."
good,"They do hire allot of permatemps, for general workers but hey work is work, I still rank them better than the lot. They at least seem to sort of try and treat the lot of their workers like regular workers."
good,"I would work for  St Jude again, but always try to be prepared for the position to be relocated somewhere within the U.S. or offshore."

good,"I worked for St. Jude Medical and provided support for 3D mapping and ablative procedures.  Worked mostly in Fort Wayne however I was pulled occasionally to Indinapolis to cover cases at Community North Hospital because I was 'Liked""  Eventhough there were other freed up individuals that could have done the procedure and lived within a 30 minute drive, I was called down to cover the case covering 220 miles in one day to do the case because I was ""liked"""

good,"Management is flexible when and how you put in your hours for work. There is ample opportunities to advance within the company, but you are not compensated well when you are promoted. There is also no type of bonuses program. The benefits are excellent though."
good,"On a daily basis we were required to gown up before entering the clean room. Once inside we had to log in to our tablets that had our work order, next we had to perform line clearance and get our work order ready to work on. I worked on bond around. In doing bond around I learned how to have more patience, how to pay very close attention to even the smallest detail,and I learned how to use my time. Management team had many changes several times in the 6 months I was there and their own procedure was not followed. Unfortunately, their communication was lost at times when changes were being made. I was in two different lines in St Jude and my coworkers were very helpful in the transition. The most difficult part of the job was a certain catheter that required more detail and more control of the adhesive, if not performed right it could reject the catheter. I enjoyed working with the microscope and enjoyed doing bond around."
good,"Overall, what I have learned at St. Jude Medical is team work, the quality of an assembly and how to do their paper works. At St. Jude, working with my co-workers was very nice. We cooperated as a team very well and we manage to get the job done and right with few mistakes, but we learned from our mistakes though. A day at St. Jude would be just working until break time and a little talking to co-workers here and there. The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain the good parts of the assembly because quality and quantity is very important to the job assignment. My most enjoyable part of the job was that I get to learned and experience many new things such as the components, paper works, and the peoples at Dt. Jude Medical."

I was able to participate in different areas of the company and learn how the entire process worked together, from receiving the raw material to the finished product. Management was great because they wanted their employees to understand how their job was important for the outcome of the product. I also got to see how change affects people in different ways  but at the end change can also help improve the  flow of a process."

good,Working at St. Jude Medical was a really good job for me. I didn't intend to leave. It was super fun and I loved working with the people there. We did a lot of fun company parties and lunches. The only down fall there was a HUGE miscommunication with the Manager and the temp agency that was onsite. I was supposed to be hired on full time by the manager of that department but the temp agency had other ideas leaving me jobless.

A typical day may not always be typical. My days could consist of managing my territory, conversing with physicians to grow business, market my products, and develop relationships. In a clinical setting I monitored patient devices and communicated with physicians.
