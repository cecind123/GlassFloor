rating,review
bad,"The company does not care about their employees at all.  Every contract they take more away from their employees. Every contract the union allows it to happen.  The pay is not worth the years taken off your life from chemical exposure. The health insurance is horrible. 40 years ago it was the place to work, it is nothing like a that now. Ppg Delaware is a shining example of corporate greed and neglecting to take care of their employees."
bad,The Absolutely worst place to work at.They hire a lot of Convicts and when things go wrong they only believe one side of the story.And they hire a lot of people with no life and miserable people that lie so much and want to make your life miserable as well.They don’t even do background checks they only hire weed heads and drunk people.
bad,I would go in and have a good day every day work was great everyday I loved my job and the job loved me I did my best until i was done with the job. And now I'm moving on... to something big and better
bad,"Management is a joke, they literally lie to you. Hours are ridiculous. Overtime never stops. The entire place is a joke. Management doesn’t care because they aren’t out on the floor. They go home, while you are stuck working overtime."
bad,"Stores short staffed. Equipment broken and out dated. New equipment doesn’t work properly  spectrometer barley gets you in the color family. The box stores can do better and quicker matches. Corporate will not allow stores to stock adequate quantities of product, therefore very few orders can be filled completely and on time.  Do to drivers being short deliveries are often late.  Store managers and below are treated horrible"
bad,They never let you have an actual break. You work 7 days a week every day. If another shift needed an extra worker they expected you to stay and if you didnt they would count it as a point. Ive worked as much as 16 hour shifts there back to back . not a good company at all.
bad,This place is a joke. Upper management is horrible. They discriminate against women. Male customers treat women disrespectful. It's the customers over the employees.
bad,"The place is run by the union employees what ever they say goes."
bad,"24/7 workweek"
bad,"No advancement,  no raises ever,."
bad,Solo te contratan si tienes familiares trabajando ahi.
bad,very poor pay for very hard work.They are a bad employer for this reason. I have nothing more to say but don't work there .Executives clearly don't care about employees!!
bad,This is one of the worst places I've ever had the misfortune of working at. I hope that it closes and there are no lives lost this place is a death trap and catastrophe waiting to happen.
bad,"The absolute worst place I have ever worked in my entire life. Everything about this location was just terrible....from the supervisors who would curse employees on a daily basis to upper management who constantly turned a blind eye to this... this company is all about numbers, employees don't mean squat to them. I would rather be homeless and sleep on the street than work here ever again. I know some people who would sit in their car and cry at the thought of coming in to work. I gave a score of 1 star or a zero on everything, only because leaving a negative number wasn't an option. Do yourself a favor and stay far far away!"
bad,"The management always favored there friends..never worked them hard."
bad,The management is clicking dont last long at all no room for advancement some of the lowest pay I have ever seen from a manufacturing facility. The hours are swings forced work over 12 hours somtimes 16 hours a day forced supervisiors yelling at you litterly for doing your job I always had to have the union by my side and rule books and union books in my hand. The union stewards were to scared to stand up for union employees alllowing the company to take advantage of the union employee pay is the poorest I have evwr seen few dollars above minimum wage for starters top out at 14 really bites when I worked next to guys who have been there 30 years making the same pay as them and there under the old contract benifits so it was better they cut there pay so much it was in real
bad,"i  worked  in the warehouse at birstall for 15 years when i started the place was brilliant to work at , the job is fine the lads on the shop floor are great but its the 2 warehouse managers in charge now  are a disgrace and have ruined everything about the job"
bad,"Never enough help and poor human resource management ,fast pace hard work for little pay. Terrible insurance and at a costly price. I would not recommend this job."
bad,"if you like serving customers, mixing paint, driving stoctaking, puting stock away, banking an basically everything whilst management sit on there fat backsides doing nothing then join up! p.s prepare to take the blame for f everthing!"
bad,"The whole place is full of bullys, from the directors, human resources and all management. If you try to stick up for yourself you will be forced out. Be warned. Avoid at all costs. Worst place I have ever worked"
bad,Expected you to do an obscene amount of work with not enough time to do it. Expected you to know how to do certain tasks with no prior experience and did not train well enough.
bad,Horrible place to work. They don't care about you and your fellow works don't care. It has a 2 tier pay system so people doing the same work get up to 10 dollars less for doing the same job.  Union has no strength or balls to stand up for the employees.  Turn around there is crazy.  You work with chemicals that will and will kill you and they don't care .
bad,Ppg was very difficult to work there but it gets easier plus the managers where very rude I would never go back and never recommend someone to go work there
bad,"bad environment, corporate people do not have any connection with the customers, stores or the sales people. The company has no direction. Huge disconnect from higher ups to the people on the street."
bad,Not a good place to work communication was horrible and they waistedalot of paint on miss matches. Not a good working environment.ppg.no longer is a good paint store.go to lowes or home depot.
bad,Avoid this organisation with their unqualified and unethical management. Local managers and area managers are cheaply promoted way beyond their abilities.
bad,"This is very fast place, the line moves 12 feet per minute and loaded with heavy and hot car parts. You work at the line which is about 6 feet from the oven.I am very lucky to drive forklift but I still feel the heat and sweat all the day. You have to drink liquid like a fish and you get 3 breaks, two 10 minutes paid and 30 minutes lunch un paid. The break is not enough for me and this company needs to hire more people. People quit because the pay is not enough for this job. The temps get $15 an hour but many people quit after a day or two, and some after few hours. "
bad,A lot of drama and a lot of stress Understaffed and overworked and underpaid rules  don’t apply to everyone Just to Some This company Is dis organized disfuctional  There’s no On hands  training watch a video take a quiz pass your ready get on the line On this job you don’t just get paid for the one you’re doing Do you have to do whatever other job that they might need you on besides your own and still only get that one pad
bad,un sito dove regna l.anarchia ttti fanno qello che vogliono tranne le ditte esterne che sono costrette a tutti gli abusi. anche quelli riguardanti la sicurezza  due nomi su tutti ienco massimo e orazio pandolfi
bad,Undesirable work cleaning up room where you spray paint coating on metal tubes. You have to wear a mask and suit to protect yourself from harmful fumes. Management practices favoritism by promising conversion but fails to deliver. If pump breaks down you lose hours from work and cannot rely on PPG for wages during downtime.
bad,Management has no empathy toward it's employees. They are unreasonable and irrational and HR supports this culture. Sales are low priority. Pay is low Priority. No matching 401k. Insurance is horrible. I dropped vision and dental because there is no benefit. There is no recognition for accomplishments.
bad,This company sold out to the Chinese and they are no longer in good standing with the community. I don't reccommend this company as it exsist today.It shut down all operations excepy one and very few people work there.
bad,"Micro management.  They hate sales people.  Worst sales job I've ever had.  They change comp plan every 3-6 months to minimize paying you.  "
bad,boring not godd at all they are not fail and do picks and favoritism mangment is poor the job is real easy going home was the best part of day and they have you dirt5y
bad,"Company doesn't care about it's employees, only cares about the shareholders.  Poor management,  not a good environment for sales,  they micromanage your work.  You have to do things their way and if you do it their way your sales will decline."
bad,This is probably the worst place I’ve ever worked. The work environment was terribly unprofessional. The Manager was the worst manager I’ve ever seen. Employees lack maturity and a sense of leadership. The corporate side is ran by very inexperienced people who have no clue how run or even manage a business.
bad,"Fear,  uncertainty, and doubt.  Everyone I knew there wanted to get out.  Management never looks past their metrics.  Not a happy place.  The worst part of the job was the constant surveillance.  Management literally (I know what literally means) stands there watching you most of the time.  You get the stick not the carrot."
bad,"I worked here for 6 months and it is horrible.  Long work hours, unrealistic expectations, harsh chemicals to deal with and people get fired for the stupidest reason. Huge turn over. Glad I quit . Now I make more money working for a huge game company with free lunches."
bad,Horrible place to work all around unless you once worked for Heinz or you are a favorite. I would NOT recommend this company to anyone!!!! Very stressful place to be and way over worked.
bad,I didn't feel safe at all there .I jus wanna feel safe and comfortable n all work environments management didn't. Care bout the work space needs work.
bad,"they take full advantage of you.  as soon as you start working there they pretty much throw you to the wolves.  when you are trained, you are trained by someone who doesnt really know what they are doing either."
bad,the job was not hard but ever day you can be moved to different place or shift that was hard to keep a schedule with my doc. and my wife to do things .the boss was never to be found when you need him and you had to wait a long time for stuff also you cant help someone if they are not in your area or you can get a wright up i did not like that it someone need help we should be able to help them .
bad,Lack   communication. Manager thinks he is safe and do what ever he wants. Been call to work of ethics 2 times and all he got was a slap on the wrist.
bad,No management at all. Been there seven years and they demoted me and took 5$ an hour out of my pay. Its currently a union shop and they are trying to destroy it.  Bosses are idiots.. If you speak your mind you get in trouble
bad,The management was draconic and often targeted employees for blame instead of trying to fix the problem. This tactic often pleased upper management as they could deflect and blame lower level employees for problems that start at the top.The good and well respected employees are leaving at a record rate(i.e. greater than 25% turnover).
bad,I  worked with temp agency GCA for PPG. The work was easy but the environment was terrible. The plant is so dirty and full of fiberglass everywhere. You can tell the fiberglass dust is years old and all they do is sweep floors and keep the machines cleaned. You also have to beg for PPE. Pay was also not good considering the long hours of exposure to fiberglass and mandatory 60hr/week overtime. The PPG direct hires were getting paid almost twice as much as the Temps for pretty much the same work. This plant has a very high turnover which is easily fixable by having either partime crew or 8hr shifts instead of rotating 2 12hr days and 2 12hr nights.
bad,Horrible company to work for. They treat there employees wrong and there is a lot racism against blacks. I wouldn't suggest anyone to work for them.
bad,"too bad I was hoping that this was my opportunity to "
bad,They don't care about you or your family. They just want you there even if the roads are covered with ice. It's more important that you be at work instead of thinking about your safety first.
bad,I loved working there but there is no forgiveness. Everyone throws everyone under the bus and do not work there. WASTE OF TIME.
bad,"Breaking your back while constantly be fed the lie that you will be moved to a full time position, Being asked to work weekends constantly without overtime as a part time worker for 12 dollars while the full time workers are making 38 dollars an hour or more on weekends. You will be treated like garbage here. The bosses are clueless on how the picking systems work.  During the interview you will be told you have to sign a 90 day contract that you can be fired at anytime for no reason and you will be fired around the 87th day. You will be paying a 38 dollar union fee every 3 weeks for a union that will do nothing to protect you. About a week before you are going to lose your job new workers will be brought in and you will train them. You will be training them for your job. You will then be fired over the phone by the secretary who works there. The guys working in the warehouse are all very friendly and nice. There are guys who have been there part time for 5 years who are still being lead on about promises of being made full time employees and of a magical third shift thats going to be added that never will. This is a corrupt company. Avoid this position it sounds great that you will be making 12 dollars an hour part time and will be moved to full time but it will never happen."
bad,"Slow warehouse, managers were not effective, short lunch breaks"
bad,PPG has a poor work life balance. I worked as many as 80 hours per week and still was not appreciated.
bad,"This company are only interested in maximum profit for as little staff as the can legally have to run the place"
bad,The people was great but the job and hours are terrible. hard to have an outside life for kids.
bad,Very little growth and bonus kept dwindling down. Not Applicable
bad,"employer bad news. stay away! poor training, lack of back up for the employees"
bad,The management and my team members had no support in anything. They was set in their was and won't welcome new hires they don't follow ppg store policies. Will never recomend anyone to work at the location I did. They can't match paint colors.
bad,Pay is decent.but the benifits are very expensive! your on probation for 6 months and look for anything to get rid of you! if they cant they start making stuff up!They let thier abusive supervisors get away with  everythingThey discriminate against women and new hires!You will be svreamed at degraded and belittled in front of other co-workers and if you go to H.R ...The 2 faced lady in there will tell everyone wha7t you went in and talked about and then you get retailiated against!Hostile and toxic work inviroment! Stay away!!
bad,"Management for delivery Driver was a joke.  Always talking down to his driver's.  He constantly took days off, and worked mostly from home.  Terrible leader."
bad,"Management ignored problems, ceilings leaked a lot, and no advancement. Moved on to another company and it is much better and they treat employees well unlike PPG."
bad,"The female lead in bldg 2 was very hard to work with..."
bad,"A typical day starts out by doing daily financials and getting orders ready for delivery. The rest of the day is spent attending to customers and answering emails. I learned that in PPG that the ""good ol'  boy"" mentality still exists. To be promoted, you need to throw other employees under the bus and let regional management walk all over you. The management is the market I work in is very toxic and turnover is extremely high. The hardest part of the job is dealing with upper management. The only enjoyable aspect of the job is the hours. The less time you spend there, the better you are."
bad,After I was called back to work from FMLA a week early when my son was born I was sat down by a global strategy director. He told me I need to have more face time at work and with a new born I have to make a choice if I am going to be a family man or an advance my career at PPG man. This was all while working 10+ hour days. I was also denied a vacation day that was initially approved to spend time with my brother who was home on his once a year military leave. This is a company that does not care if you have a family or are involved in anything outside of the company. If you want balance and you want your kids to not be scared of you when you return from work find another company to work for because this is not the one. This is one of those “this is the way it is because it’s always been done this way and we won’t change it” companies.
bad,Managers don’t run facilities subordinates do. If you and the key floor personnel don’t get along or are not buddy buddy you won’t last long there period.
bad,Manager was bipolar and immature. Not a real leader. Very hypocritical toward customers and employees. Very hard to get on with company. Insurance wasn't worth taking out of small check. Got yelled at for having overtime but was forced to come in early and help stay over and close. Was so fed up I just quit this was not the business they claimed it would be
bad,"Wanna feel miserable at work? if so this is the place to work. 50 hours a week to get paid what other companies pay for 40 hours. Upper management is clueless all around. I Had a great boss until they ran him off. They ask you to work 8 hours on a Saturday and 8 out of every 12 Saturdays. For those people with families kids, spouses etc how awesome right? Micromanaging at its finest. They even GPS track the sales reps now all meanwhile complaining about why sales are bad. Maybe its because we all hate our job? Funny how they continually say familys #1 but yet the Saturdays and micro management has determined that's a lie. Literally selling yourself on the street has more career advancement opportunity."
bad,This job has potential to be a good job but the current plant manager is just so sorry that he don't care. Then the union invest time into getting people fired. Then the racist supervisor chew tobacco while at work. Just a sad place to work.
bad,"Very unsafe conditions, Upper management is very uneducated about day to day operations, Very high turn over rate, Equiptment is very old and poorly maintained. Lack of communication between department. Overall hostile place to work with extremely low employee morale."
bad,"I gave up a good job for PPG, not a great job but it was a good for what turns out to be the most dead end job ive ever had!"
bad,"The best way to get a full-time job with PPG is to be related to someone that works there. This company offers little room for growth and doesn't care about its employees. Executives fly across North America in a private company jet while the company cuts the employee workforce. "
bad,"Worst manager I have ever experienced. The manager is a bully  and treats females differently. If your face doesn’t fit then she will bully you until you leave  will make tour life miserable. Driving expectations are ridiculous, expects a 45mile journey through cities to take 20minutes etc   Avoid Falkirk branch at all costs"
bad,"For a large company, only 20% across nation is women. They are sexist. Then men make inappropriate comments and gestures. Management believes the men over you and they all stick together and lie. What women are in the company, are shady as heck! They don't support each other."
bad,"Only one supervisor was worth anything. The one day he wasn't there, racks were falling off the line. Told the nearest supervisor. She disregarded the situation then the line broke two minutes later."
bad,"In short.. HR controls the progression of employees, and seem to have more power than the plant manager himself. When someone is up for an operations job based on seniority, if HR have a problem with that person they’ll just not cover the job and/or hire people with a ptech degree ( since ptechs overrule seniority) so that the ppl with seniority would be at a stand still."
bad,They horrible the manager was a Micro manager she didn't know how to talk to you. Neither did my Supervisor. The Moral was low. They walk around and try to find any reason to fire you. Our HR was in another State. It was a horrible place to work.Get rid off the Manager and the Supervisor and start over.
bad,"The PPG Cleveland site is run by a political agenda and has underlying ""couples"" who maintain social as well as business relationships and use their combined power to make others miserable.  If you are not management you are nothing, ""worthless"". I was told a 2 week medical break counted against my performance."
bad,"PPG doesn't hire  for the people  the contract you temporarly so they drage you on hoping you will become a fulltime PPG employee but after 3 months they decide to let you go,  my boss was  a good guy it wasn't his fault  it was his  boss   that had no idea what was going on"
bad,This place does not investigate situations through they are unfair mistreats employees not enough vacation poor management all the way around. staff not compliant with company rules.
bad,"Pay is low. Upper management doesn't care about anything as long as they're making money. They're slowly destroying the company through new rules and programs that are ""proven"" to work. Co workers are great, but that's about it. This company doesn't recognize knowledge or skills. They'll easily hire someone with no experience to run a store rather than promote someone from within that knows what they are doing. The people that run PPG are delusional if they think they will last like this."
bad,The're downsizing the wrong people. It should be the C Suite getting cut not the people on the streets who have no support from above. Just keep moving the good ol boy to different divisions instead of firing them. See how its going to turn out for the other divisions. No vision run away!!!
bad,"bad schedule, bad pay, bad management. the job requires technical know-how and decision making, often physical labor. however the employees are not adequately compensated for their knowledge and abilities"
bad,Have to pay very close attention to the fiberglass. Make sure your putting the correct fiberglass into the right oven. Scanner the barcode to show who entered the fiberglass.
bad,"There is no communication,management does not communicate with the supervisors/employees.I learn how to supervise more than 30+employees,co-workers were great we worked with each other to get the job done.Working 7days a week onto of swing shift."
bad,When I first applied it was for a full time position but after the interview he said it was part time I was lied to several times about getting hired full time so I wouldn't look for another job. I was told I was being forced to resign because I couldn't work more than two days a week.
bad,"New employees are at a pays scale that is 1/2   the senoir employees. Once qualifield forced OT causes new employees to call in to have a life and then are fired threw the point system. GOOD JOB FOR SINGLES WITH NO LIFE."
bad,Worked here for a number of years as a temp and got a full time job everything was going great untill I got stitched up from people who let's says loved the manager to bits and got sacked over a bit of paperwork yet people there nowadays have life threatening incidents on fork trucks and fires etc and still remain. Awful company
bad,"Inefficient processes-no interest in improvement order process"
bad,Would not recommend PPG as a long term career especially at store level. Unrealistic demands put forth by leadership disinterested in the well being of employees. Good for short term employment as a stepping stone onto something better.
bad,Low pay labor that makes you start out in a man power pool. Union job that allows guys to be lazy once they become permanent while man power pool guys have to work there butts off. Can’t go home until you are relieved as well as rotating shifts. Definitely not enjoyable if you like having a social life. I was told there would be at least a two year wait to become permanent. Even guys that are on workmen’s comp have seniority over you. Working hard does not pay off here Only gives you more responsibility for the same low pay.
bad,Management priority was not consistent to values toward customers and employees. This change when the company management were filled with inexperience managers with no prior experience in the industry. It cause a massive turmoil in work environment and business results. Associates with years of experience were being eliminated.
bad,No clear training procedures. employees are not kind to new comers specially from different ethnic backgrounds. Super messy workspace and no one follows procedures.
bad,The work itself is not bad. The way employees are treated make it an unpleasant place to work. Favoritism is common. Managers pit coworkers against each other and then avt shocked when people don't get along. Managers and coworkers routinely yell at others. Taking credit for other people's work is common place.
bad,"Bad hours, every week you're on a different schedule. Generally supposed to work an 8 hour shift but nobody shows up and calls off so you're forced to work 16 hour shifts to cover. Management is bad, they never come around, when they do and you express an issue, they take days to get back to you or flat out forget and it goes unsolved. Co workers regularly disappear and leave you stranded to do multiple people's jobs at once with no discipline for it. The training is by far the worst, I was put in one spot then moved two days after and then put back on the previous spot by my self with no help."
bad,"Never stop searching for a new job, even if you have just started. Management restricts advancement and career changes. Raises are below inflation and vacation time is scarce until 10 years of working."
bad,"Job was not as described, management had little or no idea what engagement was and or how to achieve it, it was basically a disciplined driven blame culture with no foresight on how best to increase productivity by developing and valuing the staff on all levels."
bad,"Professionals need not apply. Local managers make up the rules as they go along and area supervisors are fresh out college. They don't have a clue what they are looking at. Work culture is more like a High School peer group. The common workers are ok but if the peer group or supervisor don't like you, they will find a way to get rid of you. Hardest part of the job wasn't the job at all, it was all the politics. The most enjoyable part was leaving PPG for a better company. What I learned was that it takes about a year to figure out that PPG was not a place for any career path. Corporate seems to be oblivious to problems there."
bad,"No home life balance we work 12 hour days and on Saturdays 6 hours. They just gave us Sundays to ourselves!!!! Wow. "
bad,"It starts at 10.50. If you are looking for ""just a job"" go there. It's swing shift and when you become qualified they will force you when they can. The company doesn't care about you and the union doesn't care either."
bad,"I would never recommend anyone working at PPG. To give some idea as to the atmosphere, my manager was fired about a month after I left due to racist comments he made. It is a deeply unpleasant place to work."
bad,"Worst job of my entire career. Hard labor, fast paced, very dirty and understaffed. They cant keep people and won't hire to replace the ones that leave so you are expected to do the job of 2 people. Great place if you are in your 20s or 30s, have no kids and no life. They work 12 hours a day 6 days a week."
bad,"Management was awful, that is the reason myself and almost all of the full-time staff left. Hours and paid time off were nice, health insurance was very expensive and not good."
bad,Es buena en cuestión de ambiente laboral sólo el detalle de que no hay descanso
bad,"typical day was always reaction never worked for a company that let things slide till last moment at expense of customers and then played the blame game.no one in management on above can possibly have a mirror in the house/apt cause they cannot feel good about who,s looking back"
bad,"Good hours, low pay. Do a lot and sell alot for no extra compensation. Raises are very rare"
bad,This place is based on bullying each other  favoritism . You can't really talk to no one there . People stealing from lockers . Being body shamed by other employee...
bad,"There is very little engagement in R&D and production.  PPG pays as little as possible for salaries, but other benefits like PTO help.  The culture itself in the company feels toxic and it feels like there is no room to move up with a bachelor's degree."
bad,"I experienced age discrimination by one of the managers. At first I thought I was imagining it, but I had two other people on my team tell me that they have been discriminated against too. I went to HR and reported it. The HR rep said that she was aware. Aware and they never did anything about it. I sought employment elsewhere and couldn’t be happier."
bad,Was a great company. New management is destroying the company culture and slowing down operations. they are currently replacing long time employees with new lower paid employees. You will not get any career advancement opportunities. If there is a higher position they will hire someone that doesn't work for thew company and half the time they have no experience with the industry. nothing is good about this place
bad,Worked a typical weekday 8 hours.  Worked taking orders through incoming calls and faxed orders.  Very minimal training learned on the fly.  Management worked their way into their positions from starting on the bottom.  They had no management skills.  PPG tries to have a positive workplace culture.  The hardest part of the job was you could never get caught up.  If you produce the work given you would only find more.  They are an international company that still worked out of outlook and were very backward in technology.  I enjoyed my co workers.
bad,"Lack of accurate training, managers can't be trusted, expected to use own car for banking and no money paid back for petrol. Doesn't matter how hard you work or how accurate you are if your face don't fit you don't pass your probation."
bad,I worked here and it sucks management is terrible. They act like they dont know what happened to the people they fire who do their jobs. Never work here worst workplace enviorment ever
bad,There are unrealistic goals for the salesman and little to upward mobility. management does not set clear goals with way too much oversite. 100% cold calling.
bad,"1.Promoted by favoritism not by performance."
bad,The company is overall good but when it comes to staff it is rarely a chance to show what you are capable of because you constantly have to worry about the Head people.
bad,Management is clueless of the market conditions and does not give enough praised to the employees. most co-worker have a low moral and no desire to help others. the hardest part is the lack of human resources ability in the part of management. Meeting clients and providing a good customer service was the best part of the job.
bad,"The shipping Department work great together, We made sure our jobs were done effectively. Sent shipments out in a timely manner, communication with the production team on what we needed that day to ship."
bad,I worked her for 2 years as a team leader and was probably the worst place I have ever worked in my life to date. I was given promises of progression and support which were never provided during my time. The management within the company are all bone-idle and have no idea how to run a company and treat staff. If you question there ideas you will be pushed out in anyway they can.
bad,Great job.  You work hard.  Good pay and Benefits.  Management has horrible people skills.  No HR on sight.  So no one to help with any problems that come up.  Good old boys club.  If you are not part of it you will be treated differently.
bad,I liked the hours most of all.It was a relaxed place to work with friendly people.  It was very simple work.  They could have paid a little more but it wasn't nothing to complain about.
bad,No Comment on this job literally wouldn't matter either way!! If you have other option in employment take them. It was a waste of time but a good job experience to add to the resume
bad,The job pays pretty well. However there is no team work and the management doesn't care about the employees you are just a body to them. You will take work home with you as it is fiberglass work.
bad,"From top to bottom an overall good organization. My negative comments relate directly to the Aurora location in which these positions are available. PPG can not get ANYONE internally to voluntarily relocate to Aurora and they groom supervisor just for these type of opportunities. The Aurora location is operated like a unionized workshop HOWEVER it is not union; the employee handbook is a localized handbook meaning each location has it's own handbook and it comes off like a union contract. The vast majority of the employees in the Aurora location are good natured, productive employees; with that being said there is a CORE group that are apposed to change and corporate and Human Resources will ultimately back the employees! The forklift operators current compensation is about 16 - 18 an hour, and there are absolutely no productivity standards and more importantly THEY DON'T WANT THEM!!! The two supervisors on 1st and 2nd shift can barely stand one another long enough to be in the same room together, so it created such a hostile work environment. One is VERY STANDOFFISH, to the point where if you walked in the shipping office to have a conversation with him for anything he would talk to you with his back turned while never acknowledging your presence. The 2nd shift supervisor is far more concerned about being ""liked"" than any other factor in running the business. ONE OF THE WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY MANAGEMENT CAREER!!!!!"
bad,"The work experience at PPG is very imaginative. Their are different processes of the auto glass manufacturing at the Creighton facility in Pennsylvania.The raw materials are processed and then conformed to a bending procedure. The hardest experience for me, was the milling operation. The glass went through a convection process that required a large degree of sensible heat. The gratifying experience was when the finished product went through the quality department for shipping."
bad,If you can kiss  and grass ya get to keep ya job.....and pray that ya never sick coz ya gone in a heartbeat. Supervisors talk down to ya.well some do....it's like being in the army.....actually army less forceful
bad,"If there was a 0 on the rating scale it would be 0."
bad,"I will be persuing a charge of wrongful termination against PPG. they yell at you back in the warehouse, there is hardly any safety awareness, almost got killed by a forktruck..."
bad,"PPG boasts that they have tuition reimbursement after 6 months. I’m an absolute nightmare to even get the paperwork from anyone. After about 5 weeks I finally got the papers needed. Then only reimburse tuition for degrees that have to deal directly with the company and they only pay for classes that have something to do with glass manufacturing. "
bad,"Learned a lot in my time there. Great people, cool products. Wish they had better growth potential"
bad,"I was horribly underpaid at PPG. I didn’t realize how bad it was until after leaving. The pay was so little that I could hardly keep up with my bills.The management was terrible and snobby, it felt like I was working with a bunch of high schoolers. I was having health issues while working there because of the stress and amount of overtime I put in to keep up. There was no room for growth which was the ultimate reas reason I left- and leaving was the best"
bad,"At the time of my employment, there was no allowing for being hired on as a technician doing the job I was doing. The position is very entry level, but allows for learning and building skills. The people in the facility were great. The corporate culture was not great however. As a contract worker there, I felt like a second class citizen. I was only able to afford working there because I was living at home and still on my parent's insurance. As a person with a  Bachelor's degree, or a liberal arts degree, I had a few credits different than the chemist I was working under, but I was treated as much less than them. I would never go back and work there, however I am very thankful for the experience I gained."
bad,"I was in my territory for over 9 years with PPG and a total of 30 years with multiple companies. 104 of us were cut and positions were eliminated and most were over the age of 50. I grew my territory but didn’t play politics. When I was let go my territory was at 120% to budget with a huge growth year to come.  They released me because they knew they were going to be paying a good amount of bonus money. They replaced me with someone half my age and half my salary and a quarter of my knowledge. I worked in the AF division and applied to other divisions and was blocked by my immediate supervisor because he couldn’t afford to lose me. "
bad,A typical day at PPG  for me is working my butt off and not being recognized. We work 13 days on and 1 day off. Scheduled 12s. Poor health insurance. The only part I enjoy working at PPG is the people I work with. You're working pipeliner hours but not getting paid or treated like you should be. It's a very fast paced environment even though they rarely have enough raw material to complete orders and we get punished for it.
bad,"j’étais intérimaire donc je suis pas resté longtemps."
bad,"If you are thinking about working here save yourself from pain."
bad,Terrible management with no knowledge in the coatings world!!!
bad,Good place to work however poor safety record. Very little control of the day to day production schedule. Extremely short on employees and hard to keep good employees
bad,they only care about productivity not safety. you get hurt they will cover it up and let you go. supervision will not let you move up. they would rather take someone off the street that only stay for a little while bc they move on to better pay.
bad,"PPG does not give annual raises and their Bonus program is very difficult to achieve. They do not fully trust their Store Managers to make decisions necessary to accomplish set goals. All too often the goals set are not carefully reviewed, planned or thought out which allows for them to be unreasonable. The stores are always understaffed making the enviroment very stressful. Although every business's goal is to make a profit, the lengths they are willing to go to achieve this can portray a lack of integrity and honesty."
bad,required too many hours for work. sent to Home Depot stores over an hour away from home.making for a 12+ hour day. went from salary 40 hours a week to 50 hour week at same pay.
bad,"Work days consist of 2 15 minute breaks and 1 30 minute lunch.  You will get no time off working here and will often get forced to work and extra 4 hours and the end of every shift.  Most people make around 70k a year but that is with working 12 hour shifts most days and working every single Saturday and every other Sunday.  This is a union job so there is no room to make more money at all, management is terrible and you are extremely underpaid for the types of health dangers you are exposed to."
bad,I put in 20 years of my life to Porter Paints. PPG took over and ran the company into the ground. Cheapened the product and raised prices. Finally they closed the plant because there were not enough sales so they had to make more money by getting rid of good people. About 6 months before the announced closing said there were no plans to close.
bad,Should be a great job but management does not know what they are doing. Do not do the pm work to keep plant functioning and do not valve workers or maintenance. Their gallop poll says it all.
bad,"Lousy, upper management "
bad,Dark place to work but the lighting is ok;/ Managment is from Porta Rico not the USA. Get your numbers and you get a slap on the back. Keep looking elsewhere
bad,sans plus. Vivable mais aucun effet personnel. Pourrait etre plus convivial
bad,Retail territory sales representative is a joke. It is basically a retail level stockboy job with the added pressure of sales and training KPI. Local supervisor in Dallas is a horrible leader.  The corporate office won't spend money on advertising and brandname awareness. They are incorrectly led to believe that they are too big to need to advertise. They don't want feedback from the front line sales team.
bad,The corporate office personnel for National Account Brands fails daily to build effective business relationships with their National Distributor counterparts. This is exactly why they lost the Lowes account and the Home Depot Account is down in sales year over year. The Sales Teams in the field can only be so successful if the corporate office is not successful building relationships and selling in new National Product opportunities or National Sales Promotions.
bad,"Lack of supervision."
bad,"With such a huge global presence at first glance PPG seems like an opportunity to advance a career, but within a few months you'll realize you've been indexed. Unless you're buddies with the right people, you're not going anywhere no matter how good you are. Furthermore, they hire outside more than inside for management and the higher pay positions: usually someone the management knew or a place they worked. I have a college degree, many years of customer and sales experience and still couldn't advance by working diligent and asking for the advancement. The company pays so little that it's hard for even a store manager (also over worked at 12 hr days) to survive on the salary. The equipment and stores are so dated and needing repair that you'll need to work around it because the management is reluctant to replace or repair it. Stores are run with as minimal employees as humanly possible (1-3 per store average) which means you will be swamped and overworked making the little pay not worth it: especially when you are worried about covering your monthly basic bills. If someone calls in, you're in for a rough day. Despite being constantly praised for good work I was paid .24 cents for my one and only raise in a year ($12.24/hr). Advancement to make higher pay is also kept slow. You'll find you can take a test to make a .50 cent raise, but you can't take the next test (.50 cents) for 6 months. If you don't pass the test, you can't take it again. You'll be asked/demanded to cover shifts at a store far away from you costing more for the gas than you can afford: this can happen mid-shift"
bad,"This place is crazy, 12 hour work shifts and 6 day work weeks, only to be looked over and under appreciated by managers and above. Pay is good thats the only compelling thing."
bad,"the benefits package was solid and the compensation was fair, however it is a dynamic work environment with a large company that can be hard to where you fit."
bad,"Ik ben niet tevreden, nu kan ik hier een heel negatief verhaal neer zetten. Maar dat is persoonlijk, wat ik vind vind een ander niet."
bad,"No comment at this time.  Take your own risk, if you join the PPG team."
bad,I would not work for PPG again.  sales are expected to continue grow when the corporation is unwilling to invest in advertising and the things needed to help the store grow
bad,It is a union job so slackers get rewarded while the ones that work hard and want progress get punished with more work. Some management will step on the back of your neck in order to get a step ahead and make themselves look better.
bad,Went through a staffing agency.  During interview I was told that there were many chances to move up into the company.  About 3 months into the job the same manager told me that I would never move up as the new work culture is to hire through staffing agencies to keep the cost down.  A guy that I worked with did obtain employment under PPG but had to work 6 years as a temp.
bad,"Working fast paced on an assembly line trying to produce daily production. Learned how to become a leader and work as a team. The management wqs great, family like environment. Even though the pay sucked the hours were good because you were able to be home with your family. Some of the workers were great people to work with until they started bringing in new peoplework,becauze o"
bad,"As each year rolled round, every trip into that chemically induced despot took 10 minutes. Those were the worst 10 minutes of each and every day. I thought of several reasons why NOT to go to work that day."
bad,PPG is undergoing a so-called transformation but most who work there cannot tell you what leadership is transforming it into other than a Hunger Games free-for-all. Workloads have doubled in the last 5 years and promotions have slowed as well as pay raises. Work at PPG only if you need to acquire experience to find a longer term and more prosperous position elsewhere.
bad,"Poor management and no long term plans for growth."
bad,I started as an order picker at the warehouse. I loved the job. They asked me to fill in at the plant. Then didnt want to let me come back to the warehouse cause no one else wanted to work at the plant so they stuck me there and then fired me 2 weeks before Christmas cause I told them I did not want to work at the plant. That is how management works if they dont get their way the throw a fit and fire you.
bad,"Temporary position with promise of hire.  Extended my contract several times than terminated me when I got close to a year. Good atmosphere, co-workers were uppity, wear jeans ."
bad,Worked for Denver PPG plant. I enjoyed the work and kept busy. Co-workers were helpful and nice. The supervisor was very abusive to temps. Would humilate and berate you for mistakes. Left there in tears everyday. I would have rather had a male supervisor than female. She was very abusive plain and simple. She was 400 lbs and too lazy to empty her own office trash. It would be good with the right supervisor there. My experience was awful from the treatment I received there.
bad,"If you're looking for temp work and don't mind the awful smell of chemicals till you find something else, then you'll do okay here."
bad,"PPG is a place to easily advance due to the high turnover, most people leave within a year due to being underpaid and over worked. There is no consistency with this company."
bad,"Not the best experience I've had in retail. If you enjoy heavy workloads for lesser pay, than this job is the one for you. It had some good moments, but overall wasn't the place for me."
bad,"Very nice manager, lacks in supervisors being professional. Very rude people, always drama, and the head manage is very rude to everyone. It's like you signed up for High school all over again."
bad,"PPG can offer a great job, but no longer a career. PPG makes some great products but unfortunately has poor leadership.  Each department has their own set of goals which do not align across the organization.  They compete against one another versus collaborate.  The old school way of thinking is unwelcoming to new recruits and existing employees - rigid work schedules because if you are not in your chair you are not working mentality and telecommuting being offered but frowned upon in most departments."
bad,"Would not recommend to anyone. Cant leave the premesis for lunch, the cafeteria was overpriced and the work conditions were hazardous. management was rude and were unproffesional as far as training was concerned."
bad,Hands down the most disfunctional place I have ever been apart of.  The managment only focus on today and not about making tomorrow better.  The things I was sold on to get me there never came and seemed to get worse by the day.
bad,"Most of the employees there were production workers and they were very overworked. Mandatory overtime.  Company morale was absolutely horrible."
bad,"Typical day involves sampling coated flat glass product, adjusting machine to keep coating within quality specs, troubleshooting problems and fixing same as they may occur, as well as aiding Maintenance in problem identification. Daily checklist of machine temps., flows.and potential problems done everyday, also. Weekends are devoted to opening up coating machine to do weekly repairs/replacement of parts in this high maintenance machine. Also assisting machine operator, and performing the Operator job in his absence is required, as well as building of machine components as necessary."
bad,"Account Management"
bad,PPG can offer a stressful environment.  People are well motivated and care about the quality being produced.  Technology is advanced and research is supported.
bad,"Culture when I started there was fair. My department had a caustic environment. Long time to get promoted. Only fair recognition for job skills. Management was supportive at one time and easy to work with but at the end of my career there management was unfriendly, not supportive. Very hostile environment during my last two years there due to a new very poor manager."
bad,Frustrated with lack of Management and training. The person who was to train me kept pushing me off; stated he had to learn on his own. Manager claimed I lied about getting trained. He was never around to observe.
bad,Typical job where they overwork you as much as they can with minimal pay and benefits. This is a job where you will learn skills that will never be applicable in any other job.
bad,"Literally do not want you to stay. They rotate your shift, tons of overtime, low pay, less than 1 percent chance advancement. managers that do what they need to do. Not a career this is a gap filler."
bad,"Between the hours and the work that was required, I did not enjoy working here. The pay was okay and the management was okay and I made some friends there but was ultimately laid off with a large group of people."
bad,Great benefits but management is very unorganized. There is no training matrix or procedures in place. You pretty much figure out n your own how to do day to day task. Majority of the facility is new employees including your direct supervisor. So its rather difficult to really get the help you need when upper management is being trained themselves.
bad,"From the top down, this company is the poorest managed and the least focused I have ever worked for and I've worked for seven Fortune 500 companies over the past 40 years. Products are first rate, but they fall short in every other aspect and intentionally maintain an evaluation system that makes it easy and convenient to terminate someone whenever they feel like it. In the time I was there, two and a half years, I saw more turnover in the sales force than any place I've been."
bad,Very odd sales organization that focused strictly on the competition and not the partnership with the big box.  Management did not really care but were quick to threaten.  The culture was toxic for the most part.  The most enjoyable part about the job was the freedom.
bad,"Company requires 50 hours of work per week while not paying for the first hour of drive time during your AM and PM commute. Most stores are well over an hour away so a standard 10-hour day turns into 12-hours and your 50 hour work week turns into 60 hours. When you break down your pay based off a 60-hour work week the compensation is poor in comparison to industry standards. "
bad,"aucune perspective d'avenir"
bad,Upper management SUCKS!!!! The company values production over employees safety.  NO direction or responsiblity from upper management.  Impliment cost cutting ideas (not cost savings) knowing that it would directly affect lower level employees but this was ignored when brought up.  The plant manager takes no responsibility nor does he have the knowledge base to run a plant.  No leadership skills
bad,"PPG Chicago AKA Spraylat is by far the worse out there. Management does not know how to use their people. Drilling them to the ground making do things that they dont want to do. Reviews are always behind.QC Department is very disfunctional as well. You have an Old Lady running the department that doesnt know anything other than pushing a mouse button. The Team Leader is a Joke, bending the rules and using employees needs to his advantage. The Plant Manager with lack of leadership to its finest.  The union employees is what makes this place somewhat fun."
bad,"La empresa fue mal manejada y finalmente quebró."
bad,"Start early, finish late, culture of mistrust & fear for ones job, constant stream of people being retrenched and others taking there role with a different title."
bad,"Poor, unskilled management on many levels. Confused or absent corporate culture. Grows through acquisition then eliminates the part of the company they acquired that made that company worth acquiring. Retains personal who are detrimental to growth."
bad,"O processo ainda tem um longo período de amadurecimento."
bad,Positive change is genuinely needed from management in order for more positive growth.
bad,Got work order . Setup in work area. Learned to operate mills. Most co-workers were helpful.Hardest part was setup. Completing a batch of paint.
bad,"Just when you think things are gaining momentum, corpo will throw fire into a pool of gasoline. Management often listens to respond instead of listening to understand. Out of touch especially within architectural. Huge potential for growth, but so many managers just want to please their managers."
bad,3rd shift work day for forklift driver begins at 10pm. Ends at 6:30am. Duties included loading and unloading the line.  Cleanup was also required as needed
bad,"The management is terrible! Paint Plant and Plant Manager don't care about anyone but themselves. I've worked here for many years and I have never seen the moral as bad as it is now. This used to be such a good place to work, its a shame that its gotten so bad. The Union does as much as they can to help the situation."
bad,The job is stressful but the actual issue is management inconsistency and unrealistic expectations for paint. Over promising delivery and pushing the customer representatives on why something was not done when a stock shortage is the problem.
bad,"Job is great. The hours suck, 3rd shift, and family to work time is terrible; 10+ hour shifts. Enjoy the work, management is bad and creates a nearly unworkable culture."
bad,"Poor management , poor working environment, high employee turnover, dangerous place to work, pay was good and benefits were good, equipment old and outdated"
bad,"It is a fast paste job. "
bad,"Manipulation de produits toxiques,charges lourdes, mauvaise ambiance, manque de respect...."
bad,"Check the mail, greet vendors and provide conduct a training if necessary."
bad,"The culture is sad. I've seen hard working young individuals give up on trying to stand out because they only get abused. The running joke is the only reward you earn for good work, is more work. Going above and beyond doesn't get you recognized or favors. The harder management sees you working, your suddenly doing 2 to 3 jobs while others stand around and get 10% of the work done they are expected to. Management is non-existent. There is no repercussion for turning in a ticket without any work done, they simply laugh and hand it over to the next shift. Again, if you want to earn a decent check without a degree it is a great place (and heck, you can stand around all day, sometimes with management). Benefits are nice and you walk in the door with 3 weeks vacation. Works to your favor to do the bare minimum."
bad,Not very up to date and disrespectful workers. Work your butt off and not show anything for it. Bad work environment and lazy coworkers that will not help enough when busy and did not train fast enough.
bad,"The culture is the most cut throat I've experienced in my entire career. HR culture and procurement culture is the worst of all. No racial diversity, however lots of women. Which at PPG is not a good thing because what you are left with is a bunch of high school like mean girls, clicks and bullies. There are some good leaders in the company but very view in HR. Culture used to be positive and progressive but not anymore. I think if you work for PPG outside of the corporate location in Pittsburgh, the company is probably still an ok place to work but at the corporate location in pittsburgh or in Cranberry , the environment is awful."
bad,"Workplace culture is horrible. Upper management gives no support and will offer no assistance when needed.  Upper management also believes they are better than the people below them and talk down to them. Its all about the bottom line and not the people working for them. Threatens your job all the time. You have two or three bosses to answer to. DM calls you to ask about sales then the control store manager calls you to talk about it also asking the same questions. Its very much like ""Office Space.""  Moral is at its lowest in years. Stores are run with little help and experience stops after the manager. No initiative for associates to get better or care about the job. The most enjoyable part of the day was going home"
bad,"Most of the people you meet are very nice. The closer you get to management, the more you start to realize how much unnecessary drama there is. Everyone talks behind each others' backs. They will not let you know if you are going to be let go or give you a heads up. They will just end your contract (I was a contractor) without warning and derail your future. Good co-workers, bad management."
bad,"Get Dress at work in uniform meet with supervisor get assignment for day."
bad,The Fairburn location has the worst management in charge. In no way should you expect management to have your back at all. This site is not union and there is no HR dept on site. They do things very shady at this location Be Very Aware. This site is full of temps with extensive backgrounds.
bad,No interest in change of the status quo. There is really no work-life balance. The pay and benefits are good. But there is a need total culture remake.
bad,A lot of off shift work.  Madatory overtime. Working with chemicals. Can be very dirty. Company is run solely by accountants in Pittsburgh. Hard to get any local support.
bad,"Is not a secure place to work, you can be doing fine, going over sales budget, them, they decide to reduce expenses, and that’s it, they laid you off, them the hire young guy, with no experience for 1/2 price"
bad,My last job was as PC Support Analyst.  I loved my supervisor and coworkers.  PPG had a trial period of changing supervisors around.  My speculation is they wanted to try different approach.  Ended up back my original (wonderful) supervisor as there were too many complaints about the new supervisor.  New supervisor loved to micro-manager and did not deal with employees fairly.  Very stressful time.
bad,I worked very hard there and the manager showed up late everyday and didn't give you credit for all the work you put in. They will lay you off in a minute if they don't like you.
bad,"quieren que trabajes horas extras gratis, si se pierde equipo  te lo quieren descontar de tu nomina"
bad,"Was once a thriving and impressive company, but poor management and their choice to consistently choose degrees over experience and talent is reaping consequences on the quality of their paint and their ability to meet customer specifications."
bad,A decent place to work but the salary is low. I like the people but upper management is afraid to make decisions and the process is slow. Claim to be leading edge but they follow.
bad,"Most technicians are hired on as temporary employees. It can take anywhere from two to six years to be hired on. They claim to place employee safety first, however don't fix safety issues when they arrive. Instead, they terminate the employee responsible."
bad,"Initially, learned a lot about different apps/systems."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,Good Company to work for but in financial distress. It was a better company to work for in past years but has fallen on bad times due to poor leadership.
bad,The company has turned into a cut throat cost cutting machine and is only concerned about cutting costs and people.  I.T. services are being outsourced to Europe and Malaysia and local employees are being let go to support this strategy.
bad,A typical day at ppg would be very long and wasn't much to do as i was working there the business was closing down. My time working there i learned how to work in a warehouse environment.
bad,This is a very dusty environment that requires a lot of physical labor. The union mandated breaks are for your safety and should be utilized that way.
bad,"PPG was a good company to work for a few years ago. Following the acquisition of Glidden Professional, the company culture drastically changed. PPG motivates their employees with fear and makes unrealistic sales goals in an effort to cut down on commission and bonus payouts."
bad,"For 33 years I did about every job in the plant.  I also worked in a Lab, developing custom colors for OEM.  "
bad,"My history with PPG Industries was an enjoyable one for the first 26 years.  In 2003, I took a position within the company that was life changing.  The management was not fair to anyone who did not have a four year degree and we were treated like second class citizens.  Though I had been a loyal employee and rather enjoyed my employment with PPG during those 26 years, this last department squelched my creativity and one by one, the jobs of those without degrees, were eliminated."
bad,No training for your position and then berated when you ask a question. Employees were all very long-term but the rudest group of people I've ever had as co-workers. The worst place I've worked.
bad,"Global leader, a good company with high economical power; however, Turkish management team is terrible and terrible and terrible! Very low skilled without humanistic emotions are managing the country and unfortunately their work in Turkey getting less and less. Turnover ratio for 2018 is over 55% in all levels!!! I am very sad about it..."
bad,"Not a fun place to work right now, growing pains! The people in the office are super!"
bad,"The job is hard, physically.  10 years ago I loved my job but I feel that it's too much for me now. It is hard to advance in this company and I am as far as I can go. I like the people and will miss them."
bad,I worked here for near on 3 years and it isn't a bad job at all. The work can sometimes get tedious but its a good salary for what you do. The management however I found to be quite rude and there was a lot of victimization involving mostly temporary staff. They speak down to you at times like you are completely worthless and this really did not help the morale.
bad,"If you are a woman I would recommend looking elsewhere as this can be a vary inappropriate job from the types of customers you deal with to the company itself being very male dominated & degrading towards woman. In my area we only had 1 woman working for the company and everyone was always talking about her in an inappropriate manner. If you are not ""one of the boys"" I would recommend staying away !"
bad,this is a company i would never want to work for.  This company loves to make people wear more hats with less money and its crazy.  you work crazy hours
bad,"The on the floor training was done by employee that the supervisor though did the best job. The employee would perform the task while you taking notes. The next day you were expected to perform the job yourself. My trainer wasn't patience at all, they keep saying they couldn't train me because I was left handed. Which I found this to be offensive. When asking a question to get a better understanding of the process, they would just take over the task and do it themselves instead of showing/explaining. There seems to be no guidelines/structure for training process.  "
bad,"I worked at a retail Dulux paints store. It was great under Akzonobel. PPG gutted the company of most of what made it a good place to work. Decent part-time job, fun coworkers, faceless upper management."
bad,Rule and policies are well balanced and enforced equally. Very nice and clean environment. A1 security system in places for the company and its employees.
bad,I felt the training was inefficient. The hardest part of the job was learning the software system. I don't feel like I've been able to use the things I learned in college.
bad,"Work is constant and frustrating because there are uneducated people working above you and around you. Bad business decisions directly affect you in ways such as mandatory overtime at the last minute, losing weekends, or just being slammed with unnecessary work because everyone around you is screwing up and just trying to cover their tracks. Senior people here are lazy and often screw things up and refuse to learn the modern technology resulting in bad products and repeat testing. The people making product here are inaccurate and DO NOT care about precision which also results in bad products and repeat testing. Management often approves faulty paint just to make timelines. None of the supervisors talk to each other so they micro manage different tasks in different ways across multiple shifts. Resulting in confusion, frustration and overall negligence of work activities because workers don't know what is the correct way to do their jobs."
bad,"Empresa multinacional com visão global, líder no segmento de tinta automotivo entre várias outra tecnologias, entre as 100 melhores para se trabalhar no mundo."
bad,"PPG coatings has terrible IT. The chrome book and cloud applications rival a family members middle school applications. "
bad,Terrible environment to work in. Management is out of touch with employment opportunities in the area and pay rate for skilled labor employees. Salary employees are spoiled
bad,"The people I worked with made the job, we were a family. Long hours, a lot of mandatory O/T. I once worked 30 days straight, with 68 hours a week for the month. The company only cares about making money for shareholders. Employee welfare is of no concern really."
bad,it was a good job great for people who like fast paced jobs because itll definitely make you work hard but its a typical job not very hard just need to tighten up on management
bad,"Management WILL get you fired if they don't like you. Depending on where you work, I didn't work everywhere in that place. But the places I did work was pretty bad. It's management vs. Employees. Teamwork there is pretty good and if you work with good people it won't be so bad. But it's like being in high school again."
bad,"Not a temperature controlled job."
bad,The customers were loyal and great. Corperate came in & bought the dealer I worked for and destoryed my entire 12 years of building a customer base of loyality . I  stuck with it another 3 years & couldnt do anymore.
bad,maintenance on all types of equipment learned about different types of equipment management just wanted you to get the job done co-workers were great hardest part was the heat and cold not alot of enjoyable times
bad,No job security is the only downfall to this job. The people and management are nice and helpful. The work is fairly easy. You can get out of entry level fairly quick and it's a set schedule.
bad,Not so good in the supervisor Roll  He was very or didn’t have respect towards me. Told Hr about it and they put the blame  on me and on the training. Lol
good,"I was a supervisor of temp workers at PPG Wichita Falls. I Supervised the temp workers in the Tempering department, Then I went to the shipping department. When I was injured, the company doctor said I needed a CT scan but the temp agency (Staff Management) fought their own company doctor's decision. Just a warning. If Staff Management is in charge of temp services at PPG in you're area, DO NOT RISK IT!!! "
good,Paint business is a hard business to be apart of. The work environment is fine but it’s the being managed from long distances over via text mostly was difficult
good,Every position within this company is micromanaged. Corporate dictates to managers how stores are to be ran. A lot of people with very little experience trying to run a company they don’t know much about
good,I liked the job but no room for advancement. People seem to get “promotions” based off of relationships with management not for hard work. The dept I was in got a lot of responsibility but no pat increase for e erythinh we did
good,"Empresa com bom pacote de benefícios, porém muito instável e com  poucas oportunidades de crescimento."
good,Management doesn't listen to employees about safety issues. No consistency between shifts. Due to errors on management and quality employees get mandatory overtime with short notice.
good,"Racism, sabotage, and none to barely any overtime. No room or chances for potential advancements, very strict work environment and no quality equipment to work with."
good,"Unrealistic and unreachable goal expectations"

good,Not a bad company  to be a part of. Wages are somewhat lower than  others. But they are one on the very  few places  that pay you a monthly  bonus. That is what will keep most employees  around.
good,A culture of always fearing the future of one's job. They don't promote from within. They bring in outsiders who don't know the business and plop them into management positions. Insane.
good,A lot of broken promises by management . Work hours can be better as far as the 12 hour shifts and how meny days in a row. People in charge of departments that never worked in that field.
good,"It's an alright place to work if you fit it's fast paced culture. They are very big on attention to detail and getting everything correct on the first check and balance, No room for errors whatsoever, as a bench technician writing input codes for their proprietary software, you get a lot placed in your lap including; setting up and shipping out touch screens and computers, getting computers ready to ship out, handing computers that came back from the paint shop broke, cleaning your area, stress testing computers, fixing computers, putting computer asset tags in an excel sheet, getting laptops ready, testing out scales and scanners, sending out refurbished computers to logistics to ship to paint shops. All this has to be done in the course of 8 hours. You have to lift a lot of stuff 40 pounds and over and it's a fast pace environment so you will sweat a lot and exhausted. Do not apply if you want to work at your own pace"
good,"PPG could be an incredible company to work for, in my division I have had the opportunity to meet great people in my clients business. There is always something to do, and at the end of the day you can derive personal satisfaction from the work you do"
good,The best part about this job is the customers and your co workers.
good,"yes a great place to work but once qualified into a new role there is very limited chances to put the new talets to good use , more like a tick in the box roleplay."
good,"You would have to get used to to sound of glass breaking, some employees were cool."
good,It’s not a terrible company to work for but there is a lot of forced overtime. As to were there are many people who have to work a minimum of six days per week and they are allowed to force you 12 hours per shift ever single one of those days if they so choose. So in my mind if you want to be sure you have family time don’t recommend this job.
good,"The work is fast paced and a lot of heaven lifting, you have to wear a respirator most of the time due to the dust in the air. Didnt have enough  help to properly staff the lines for the speed they wanted them to run at."
good,"Good place to work. "
good,Managers should be required to take diversity classes and management.  The pay is great if you dont mind working 2nd and 3rd shift in a hot warehouse.
good,Low pay. They expect a lot out of employees for what they pay. Yearly raises are below inflation. Insurance goes up every year. For the most part the company is an average place to work
good,Changes within the company leadership and core values no longer make this company a place where one can find a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment.
good,Ppg was a great place to work it gave me a opportunity to get the work experience that I needed and I would recommend anyone who is seeking work to give it a try.
good,Very shady way of manufacturing. We were forced to work overtime and management treated us poorly. The pay was decent but there was no advancement opportunities.
good,"It is very hard to get promoted. PPG likes to go outside the company for hiring.  "
good,PPG as a whole is a great company to work for. But the manager at this plant has lost all of the respect of the employees by not flowing the rules that PPG as a company has set and that the manager said are going to be followed. As soon a someone test or breaks those rules a meeting is called and all have to sign again stating that we agree to follow the rules. The ones that follow the rules and are hard working have no problems with following rules. But the one that break or test the rules never get disciplined. This is a real respect and morale killer.
good,"I was an agency worker here for over a year and felt that the agency are not treated grately. It was understood that the shift patterns would be erratic, but on more than once occasion had my rota changed without notice. Full timers where given a letter of thanks and a cash incentive for extra work done whilst some referb was being done, the agency that did that same amount of work didn't even receive a verbal thank you and was told because it was not performance related we were not entitled. On the subject of perfomance related, everyone received a letter stating that the site had reached its targets to obtain a decent performance bonus, but had to be employed at a certain date to gain the bonus. Some of the released by the company coincidentally before this date even thought they had been there the whole period of time to obtain the bonus. Would certainly not recommend PPG Industries in Stowmaket."
good,"My job was simply to make sure the customer was happy with our product. I was also responsible for checking temperature and viscosity of out paints. I learned the different aspects of how a car is made and the quality checks that go on, before a car is assembled and shipped. "
good,PPG wasn't a bad place when I first got there. With the continues changes in management. Things began to changes around the plant. It began to be less about the workers.
good,"you get there before 7:45 for the pre-shift meeting, start shift at 8, and basically you pack fiberglass for 12 hours... the hardest parts are when you have to make-up for someone not pulling their weight and getting fiberglass stuck in your hands.... the best part of the day is when you clock out...lol."
good,Fast pace. No managemant support. Very unfriendly. I do not wnts to review this company.
good,"PPG was a good place to gain laboratory experience.  Learned how to make, spray, and test paint.  Co-workers were great and I enjoyed going to work"
good,"Not a bad place to work, but monetary compensation is way below standard of living. The billion dollar company should be ashamed to offer so little to employees that are loyal."
good,"The Store Group manager was not a good person, he was in a sense bi-polar. I have had many other SGMs with my time with PPG and the last one was the worst... they go off of the ""good old boy"" way of hiring... who knows who instead of who is qualified. If you mention to anyone about feeling uncomfortable or other items that shouldn't be happening in the work place they do not do anything about it. The benefits were fantastic but they"
good,I would not recommend a contract position with this company. There is a severe lack of benefits and no real opportunity to get hired on. Days are often very boring as you are given a lot of busy work.
good,"Working in a store for PPG is like getting screamed at by toddlers aka customers and sales reps all day while trying to balance spinning plates on your head. You will sweat, you will get screamed at in foreign languages. You will have to barter and listen to complaints about things you have no control over all while having several orders to mix and get done before that customer gets to the store and starts screaming. Busy season is unbareable but winter is generally slower and less crazed. We mark time by how many Summers we have been through. Be prepared to spill your blood, sweat, and tears for the Company and get rewarded by getting screamed at! "
good,"Such physical work for peanuts work your butt off for what?"
good,Overall a decent company with competitive pay.  But the Cleveland site specifically is poorly managed.  They talk safety but don't enforce it.  Can't decide what shift production labor and management will be working - flipping for the second time in 5 years.  They also don't enforce discipline - slackers get a free ride.
good,We have went from working 8 hour days and working typically 6 days a week with mandatory overtime to a 12 hour structure that gives a good life work balance but because they either haven't or can't hire enough people to cover shifts we are going to be forced into more mandatory overtime.  Safety is only a thing unless it impedes production then they tend to bypass what are safety department says we are suppose to do.
good,"Many areas need improvement:"
good,PPG demands you follow their rules.  I was able to travel but they have cut way back on travel in Automotive.  Recently they decided to cut back on management and reorganize the division.
good,"for the most part it was ok because i was working along someone i was fairly comfortable with but as far as managment goes, there was a lot of sabotage and poor communication on their end for whatever reason."
good,Great company with inner issues with management. Everything seems to work on the good ol'boy system and about how long you have been there. There isn't any support for newer management because of the lack of leadership.
good,"PPG is a good place to work until you get promoted. Then upper management gives you vague and unclear directives and expectations. When you ask for help from upper management on job tasks and responsibilities you get disciplined. Upper management shows very little interest in boosting morale of the employees and can be condescending at times. I have heard that not all departments are like this and each department works very independently from each other, so it could be hit or miss on whether or not you will be treated poorly by your manager. Coworkers are great for the most part and the work load is reasonable. You won't be bored, but you won't be overwhelmed everyday either. There is a solid divide between the unionized production workers and the salaried employees so moving up into any kind of management will force you to understand both sets of rules and regulations and that can get tiresome at times."
good,"The work environment was a very hostile place to bring in new customers and to expect them to return. We had enough trouble trying to retain our current customers. The job depended largely on the manager to maintain relationships with the customers, and that was never done."
good,"I learned how fiberglass was made .I also learned what they made out of fiberglass. It`s not that bad of a place to work for. They had catering sometimes. The best part was when your set was running you got to sit down. The worst part was getting glass all over you. Management was good. Sometime it gets nasty, but that`s where housekeeping comes in."
good,I learned every job in that place but made the same pay as a new hire learning just one job after their 2 year top pay. No advancement at all. Plan to get covered in fiberglass if you can't hand wind.
good,Its a ok job if you can handle working constantly and getting burned.. Fiberglass getting everywhere and embedded in your skin.. Benefits are awesome pay is good..
good,"Employees try to have fun while working management does everything they can to change that. Supervisor's are idiots and don't know how to schedule anything."
good,I worke here for about two years as a Labeler/Packer. It was actually a pretty good job but the management is horrible. Other people might see it differently.
good,Management does not care about employees.  Minimal advancement opportunities unless you are willing to relocate.  Always looking to reduce headcount to drive profit instead of top line growth.
good,"The fiberglass plant is an alright place to work. The schedule is all over the place, the management are either terrific or terrible. It is about 50/50. The people are in the same category with the management. It is a typical factory job.  Some of the benefits and pay are nice, however, do not expect and paid time off to be sick or with your family unless you take your few vacation days."
good,Chaos! Management doesn't know anything day to day. Calls in the middle of the night. No benefits offered. There is no job security because everyone is fair game to the lies.
good,"Worked here almost a decade,learned every aspect of the place... new management came in and cleaned house.. if you got a chance to vote union   do it asap.. vote for management that know the process,that are employee friendly and not just a yes man... Mojave plant is probably the worst plant to work for.. so much politics,rules change when there in favor of getting the job done.. not by the book.So much material is bad,yet the customers have yet to be notified.. this plant is a joke."
good,"Parole period of 700 hr.s"
good,They were not open to new ideas on how to better serve the employees and their company. Very conservative and stuck in their ways. The job was ok.
good,"PPG is a very good place of employment for an individual that is new to the workforce. There was very little on the job training, just enough to get the job done."
good,They paid well the drug test was hair follicle and depending on department you in you might have to work 12 hours 7 days a week . Work balance with being at home is rough
good,Supervisors act like they dont know their staff is not working so that they dont stir things up and fly under the radar. So they can retire soon. Then give most of the work to one employee. Really professional.
good,Most meetings are done when you are punched out. No OT most of the time. You work 6 days a week to make 40 hrs a week. Only rest Sundays most of the time. Only good thing about that job is the free food.
good,They expect you to know everything when you are hired and are not willing to teach you even if you express interest in wanting to learn more. Very gossipy and unprofessional at times.
good,"This use to be a much larger plant than it is now.  It isn't what it use to be, in the time I have been there it's had a high turn over rate.  It's almost impossible to get rid of people who don't work."
good,Company is terminating operations in the US and moving jobs to Mexico.  The work was great but the way they told us we were losing our jobs was not great.
good,"I had some less than stellar management. Everyone seemed to be in a bad mood all the time, some of the employees were very hostile in other departments."
good,Schedule usually 12 hour shifts with plenty of breaks depending on the department. Some departments are extremely hot and others are slow and makes for a long night
good,I left ppg involuntary I believe management and hr could have been better and fair I am ready to move on to my next employment and out ppg behind me as I move on to new and better things anything I been through I take as learning experience whether I felt it or was fair or not.
good,company and union did not have a good relationship. too much forced overtime being worked. no family life. 50 miles from home. very unclean place to work.
good,"I felt PPG is a very competitive place to work. If you do not mind long hours and a hot environment, this is the job for you. they offer many different job listings to fit any job your skills set you eligible for. The uniform is a one piece flame retardant boiler suit, safety goggles, a respirator, and a hard hat. In the summer heat, this is close to unbearable."
good,was a good place to work  just not very secure never knew if you were gonna be there from one day to another  other then that it was  ok was busy most of the time but then was dead no work but always picked up
good,good place to eat and work. long hours and you don't know what time youre going to get off at night. As long as you are the at two oclock. coworkers are ok but some can be nasty
good,"Empresa de grande porta porém pouco inovadora."
good,"PPG is a diverse company, there are good spots to work and less-good.  Architectural Coatings in the USA is not desirable, here the leadership is poor, compensation is over-managed resulting is very poor employee engagement.  Even employee discounts are at above customer pricing, imagine that in today's culture.  Don't look for PPG to inject any tax savings into employee comp."
good,"Would be great place to work if management knew what they were doing. Verbal threats and abuse seem to be allowed from supervision. As mentioned above, no corrective action other than termination. And since the rules change every day, its hard to do you're job with someone constantly waiting for you to mess up.HR complaints go unanswered for months. Other than that, the fellow workers on the floor are great people, pay isn't bad, and there is always something to do to kill time. The rewards program isn't real bad, but the way it works almost makes the teamwork effort obsolete."
good,"you have to work 6 days a week when you are short staffed, which is all the time. They don't have enough help and get on you when sales are slow. Making hours longer now and open 7 days a week with small staff."
good,"PPG was a decent place to work. It was relatively clean and the work was not that demanding. There were different expectations for different people. This did not matter to me, because I went there to work. I am not and have never ben afraid to work."
good,Good job for temporary income but not ideal for growth. Administration does not play the necessary role in getting results and is not held accountable enough.
good,Decent place to work interesting enough depending on how deeply you enjoy chemistry. Advancement and benefits could be better but average for current job market.
good,"Best job i ever had. A disgruntled employee lied and got me caught up in it and i got fired. Management is out to constantly pick at the employees. When you need representation, you are on your own. HR is out for themselves only ,and going higher up to corporate was no use they just agreed with local HR instead of doing their own investigation as they promised tp do."
good,ppg is a good place to work overall local managers were always good to me and fair but upper managers were at a loss as to what a paint store should be
good,Demonstrate companies products for acceptance in industrial applications. Solve technical application problems and train local operators
good,"typical day of loading and unloading glass onto trailers, looking for cracks in the glass and not to break the product while loading or unloading."
good,"Most days PPG was a productive place to work.Sometimes there would be some undue downtime due to a certain product that was being ran.You were cross trained on different jobs ,so you were not always doing the same job every day.Management could use more polishing,not the greatest communicators to everyone.Co-workers are great to work with.They try to get together at times to do activities.The hardest part of the job was working overtime and saturdays when it made mandatory."
good,e uma empresa rasuavel de se trabalhar tem bons padrao desegurança nao tem oportunidade de crescimento etc
good,"If you are a manager, you have it made for quite some time. If you have a complaint or need assistance to help solve a management problem, nothing is ever done. You can talk until you are blue in the face. You are simply considered a whiner. Causes a stressful work environment. Same people get promoted. Management does not overwork. There are too many middle managers who simply throw their weight around."
good,"ensure all oee screens are turned on and updated , check emails, team lists order containers for machines and lids , check with control room that we have enough product to fill required orders if not reorder and fill containers of product thats available and inform planning of any change in prodution run. have daily briefing with staff to ensure they understand targets set for each machine and what machine and product there filling. check machine checklist are filled in and that all machines have signed onto oee and are inputting the correct data. do any return to work interviews that need doing that day and take to HR .ensure health and safety is adhered to and carry out any health and safty checks that require doing .carry out any investigations that are requsted .by manager or risk assesments , montior no smoking polices in toilets ."
good,"My job is one that, once you get in there and work everything seems to balance out. The key is remembering to not let a little set back frustrate you and to remain patient."
good,The workplace moral has deteriorated rapidly over the last 4 years
good,"A typical day at work was visiting stores, answering 100's of emails and delegating tasks to the management team. My co-worker was the Regional Sales manager and together we ran the market consisting of 68 Store employees and 21 Sales reps."
good,A typical day can include processing invoices for payment. Processing check requests. I will do wire payments and journal entries as well for foreign payments.
good,"PPG was a decent place to work but there where issues with management being upfront and truthful. There is to much favoritism and to much of the work load ended up on the good workers. Pay was OK, benefits where OK, paid time off was really good (3 weeks vacation as soon as you are hired in) but in the end it was not enough to keep me there as an employee."
good,"No communication between management and workers, always having to pick up the slack of other shifts, NO team work at all and an unsafe work environment, Always ended up working on our days off because of line crashes amongst other problems. "
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is that everyone has to participate to make the workload balanced. If someone is being very lazy it creates more work for the next person causing somebody to go home extremely tired.
good,"New management constantly micromanaging everyone regardless of the years of experience within the position. to many reports. I enjoyed meeting new clients, helping them grow from a small one man show to having 5 or more employees."
good,"How much you like work at PPG really depends on which group you work in. It is a very big plant, with lots of workers. Work life balance is again dependent on which group you work for. And how well that group is doing. "
good,I had no issues working for PPG until my final month there. Without any prior warning my work assignments dwindled to almost nothing and my contract was terminated despite being told during the hiring process that I would receive a 2 week notice before any termination would occur.
good,"contrôle des commandes"
good,There seems to be no communication between the boss and employee I am looking for a better place to work I work on night shift and the hours are horrible I have to work from 8:30pm to 7:00am I don’t get to spend very much time with my family
good,no job security. poorly managed from corporate office.  travel was ok but mostly job is on your own with no supervision.  big perk was company car with paid gas.
good,"to much weekend work"
good,"I enjoyed working for PP&G on the whole.  The pay was less than desirable for the amount of work/hours put in, but I did enjoy the people and learning a new industry."
good,"Executive management was poor, creating a lot of turmoil and angst in the sales group.  PPG Corp is a very good company, our division was a problem.  I had many fantastic years with PPG, unfortunately the last few were under new management.  The new management had a different view of our business, contrary to what was needed."
good,"Large company having difficulty acquiring new business opportunities in North America due to size, market position and flattening of the manufacturing cycle."
good,"A nondescript factory job that pays well particularly when working "
good,"The people are good, but there seems to be a lack of planning, more reactionary, than I have seen anywhere.  I believe timing is part of it, seems to be a lot of flux."
good,The job was not a hard job to do. there was no room for advancement within the company. wherever you started at is where you were.
good,To much gossip no teamwork the boss and supervisor didnt take action when should have been co-workers hardly work was alway on phone i was the only one that was taking the job serious
good,"I enjoy the aspects of my actually job. Unfortunately the enviornment is horrible. After five years of hard work there is still little to no consideration for a promotion. All the company cares about is if you have a PhD. If so, you can get promoted in a year and a half. If not, don't hold your breath. The only way for someone without a PhD to move up is to jump around which is unfortunate when you actually like your daily work."
good,it is a high pace with the best in class fiber glass in and around the world. i worked my why from the shop floor to the crew trainer after 5 years and learned a lot about lean manufacturing i.e 5s. we work with hot glass and work to high standards.
good,Everyday you wear a uniform that is real thick and heavy so in the summer it makes it very hot and in some jobs you are working in over 100 degree temperatures.  Also in most jobs you are working with hazardous chemicals and pigment that can be very dangerous to ones health.
good,A typical day at ppg its always stressful because the management sucks and management blames you for every mistake they that accrued. My co-workers or pretty cool guys we all get along fine its just we have two leads no one likes.
good,Part of a self directed team that was not kept in the loop very often and poorly communicated with. Stability in assigned goals and expectations was difficult to manage daily workload.
good,Managed operations of 7 company owned retail/contractor stores. Enjoyed training associates and watching them grow and succeed in their roles.
good,"I was considered high potential after my first year at PPG.  I was promoted twice in the first 4 years.  I got stuck in a job that has almost zero upward movement with a manager who has not promoted any kind of personal development in her employees.  I've been doing this job for 4 years and have learned that it's very difficult to move up from here.  I did some internal networking to try and get my name out there and express my concern for the lack of interest in employee development, and absolutely no one listened.  "
good,PPG was a fun place to work with exciting project but an older workforce with very little salary increases or options for advancement.  They are aiming to be a coatings company in the paint race to the bottom.
good,i was hired through a temp service GCA. worked there for 9 months for they let me go. overall the job is good other than the management. alot of drama with females. 9.00 is not alot of money to be making a hour to put up with this kinda job. but you can use this job as a stepping stone to getting a better job.
good,"typical factory job with interesting social life,hard working co-workers and enlightening experience."
good,"I'm probably one of the few fellas that'll have the experience to say I've gone abroad to work in a US company. I was the only American working for this particular location. Had it not been mismanaged, I might have had a permanent job. The CS Manager based out of Belgium could not stop the Belgium-initiated in-fighting between Poland CS center and Belgium's CS center. Due to that, Poland's office lost the UK Market to Belgium, who couldn't handle it on their own. that led to my displacement to first the Eastern European market, and later the Middle Eastern market. I didn't mind, but the instability was a little tough to swallow. "
good,"Great job that keeps you very busy and has many different tasks to learn. Management is pretty good and the co-workers are easy to get along with. Hardest  part of the job is getting their, enjoy being at work, due to good working environment"
good,"corporate envirenment. very strict, motivted by money and labels there employees as such"
good,Great team oriented management focuses on production rather than team morale but overall good job. Air conditioning in summer and winter. Building needs updated lab needs organized
good,"I didn't think, It could be worst after Kite, but yes."
good,PPG is an excellent place to start out and will allow you to better yourself with a reimbursement program if you want to have a better career. Some people make the job bad could be much better. But that could be any other job
good,"The job itself was a cool place to work for, you could make your own salary with all of the overtime available. Only thing I would say is that qualified people were often overlooked for job advancements and given to someone fresh off the street with no experience."
good,"I've enjoyed working at PPG. It's a conservative company but currently isn't in the right direction. I have a lot to be thankful for, but it's time for me to move."
good,But not the best by far. Management shows favoritism.  Started as a temp to hire. Waites 2 and a half years and was still a temp while others who came in after me were hired in.  Reason for leaving was favoritism to other employees.
good,"PPG used to be a great company to work for, but they got greedy. They offered a retirement package to their senior/ experienced workers and hired a bunch of new people at a much lower wage."
good,"Great company to work for if your in real need of a decent paying job. Pay is not bad, also the atmosphere is mainly Spanish speaking individuals. Benefits are also pretty good compared to most other companies."
good,Work 40+ hours a week. Learned how to mix and fill batches of paint. Management doesn't care enough for the care of the department or their workers. The culture is of many. The hardest part of the job is hoping that your equipment works well so that you can finish your batch. The most enjoyable part of the job is the overtime.
good,"Many great people work at this company.  However management is risk and mistake averse.  Safety and financial obligations aside (and these are non-negotiable as a MUST to adhere to in the culture - and rightly so), there is not a lot of room for innovation, thinking outside the box, and taking charge to get things done."
good,"If you are willing to put int he time on sales call and cold calls this job is for you, you will learn customer service skills along with architectural coatings knowledge.this company is a team atmosphere and all involved are willing to help you succeed."
good,"Great Company and culture but pays on the low end of the industry, while demanding similar work commitments. management quality is sporadic based on location."
good,A typical work day is overall okay but when the work slows down you are to be rotated off which means you may not get a full 40 hour week check even after they told us we would get 40 hours a week.
good,"A Typical work day is pretty smooth, you learn how to interact with others that your around daily"
good,Company has good benefits and work to life balance is less than it should be.   The management has expectations that make it difficulty to achieve goals in the field.
good,"I got into PPG shortly after graduating college. I worked my way up from a low-level job to a mid-level job and was very happy with the way my career was progressing. However, in my current position, I found that my opportunities for growth were starting to go away and I now feel that my career path is starting to stagnate. Some managers I've worked with have been very effective while others have no business being managers. Typical office politics also seems to dominate who gets certain promotions. However, that is not to say that PPG is a bad company. The benefits were good for someone fresh out of college and I don't mind the job that I do. I would say that if you know the right people, PPG would be a very good place to develop your career. If you're not looking to play the game, then PPG is a good place to build your skills, but you might want to look at other companies if you wish to make the next step in your career."
good,"good place to work, but poor management."
good,"The company is pretty good to work for and has very competitive benefits.  However additional training has no baring on your advancement. And salary and bonus structure is mainly effected by the business unit and your specific team.  Job security is low and there is a lot of turnover.  It will take a miracle for anyone under age 55 to make it over the 30 year hump here.  Stay long enough to soak up as much training as you can and look elsewhere that actually offers job security."
good,"I don't feel that just because you have a degree that makes you management material.  Moral is pretty low at times.  A typical day is processing vendor payments, answering phone calls and emails. Obtaining needed information for invoice processing."
good,It was an ok place to work then it went down hill. My co-wokers are friendly people and willing to help you out no matter what. Sometimes it was hard to do the work because all of your material might not be there and its been times where you would wait 30 minutes to a couple of hours to get your stuff.
good,"Empresa de tecnologia de ponta em químicos."
good,Hardworking environment with high pressure but good team collaboration and many opportunisties for learning and gaining experience.
good,Company is too big.  Too much of a corporate atmosphere.  At a sales meeting they actually showed a slide that demonstrated how they saved money one year by not giving raises and cutting starting salaries for sales reps.  Managers seem like they don't care about employees just the bottom line.  Not a family atmosphere.
good,Had to deal with very dangerous chemicals. Lots of walking. Cameras everywhere so be careful they get you for anything. The management has changed recently so I might gotten better for the employees.
good,I DID NOT CARE FOR IT. All I did was spray panels boring. tbhewhiohjeriohtreiowhyerjhgknkerjngkndgkvht834jt843ht843h8uyh395hreiugdjsnknmkjfdnmsklnkl43hijht48hugehughurghnunoqijhreiuthuhiqhjiqohjuiorehuir
good,"They are a good employer, the only problem is that the leaders are not mentors they just micro manage and that it. untill you miss plan and you are in a personal improvement plan and you are out"
good,"always a new challenge everyday, pretty much busy all the time.  Need more information from the operators on how the equiptment went down to make it easier to trouble shoot."
good,"Replenishing stock on shelves "
good,"I encounter a long but productive day at work. I have learned more ways to increase my time management skills. My co-workers are active hard workers. The hardest part of my job is working the 2 overnight shifts and having to drive 30 miles home afterwards. Also being drafted to work whether your able to or not. However, the most enjoyable part of my job is the learning the very different work ethic."
good,"Most of my co-workers are my age which made the transition from school to industry a lot easier.  There was unfortunately a large ratio of full-timers to contractors with people rarely getting hired into the company even though they had been working for the company for several years.  This was a little discouraging.  There was no where to move up to other than full time, so the growth opportunities were essentially non-existent.  However, I learned the importance of communication in a research setting and how to work with a large range of different personality types and backgrounds."
good,"Learned good management skills and time management, reduce cost in all aspects of plant operations. Coworkers are very good people that deserve more pay to be perfectionist. Old equipment and breakdowns. Never a dull moment"
good,"I did not like the way the boss had lied to me about m,y position, he told me i was going to get paid $13/hr and i never saw it. And would put me in other departments, instead of working in my department."
good,"PPG industries is a productive work place, with a set, unusual shift pattern, working Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Thursday, Friday. work patterns are 2 weeks working on days and the following 2 weeks on nights. All shifts are 6:30 - 6:30. since starting at PPG I have been shown the basics of packaging and shipping pallets, the co-workers are good to get along with and very helpful with new starters. The easiest part of the job is that there is nothing that you cant do, because if you are struggling, the team will always lend a hand. The hardest part of the job is finding the pace of the job when you first start."
good,"Always a full and busy day. Many a day turn into overtime to get the daily demand met. "
good,"During the buy out between AkzoNobel and PPG, PPG kept their sales force and got rid of most of the AkzoNobel dba Glidden sales force."
good,"A typical day of work consists of operating either a packer or running the stacking cranes. I have learned a lot when dealing with heavy machinery. The management is usually in tune and responsive. There are hectic days when people are running around wild but they always get it figured out in a timely manner. My co-workers are very helpful and great to work with. The hardest part of the job is the swing shift schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job is you can get a lot of opportunities with fork lifts, pack trucks, and other heavy machinery."
good,"My co-workers are great but they do not pay attention to the workload they give their employees.  ""Do more with Less"" is the approach for PPG."
good,Good company to work for. More and more duties are being pushed onto the field people to complete as the company gets more lean.
good,"It is a good place to work, but very fast pasted with harsh work environments."
good,"Good place to work, friendly workplace environment. The job is much easy so just need to follow SOP. The company does not provide any benefits and does not have much opportunity to grow"
good,the pay is good is the only good thing i can say about it that's positive. they often flip flop on OT and no one is on the same page. anyone thats been there in upper management can get you fired if they don't get along with you or like you. yo have a few good people there but they will always side with the majority.
good,Well paying job for a company on this part of the state. Company pays a lot of attention to health and safety of their employees . One big draw back for some one looking to move up in the company . A lot of employees have been with the company 10-20 even 30 years. So little chance of advancement .
good,Office is closing and jobs are going to Mexico. This used to be a great job. I enjoyed my time there. The pay was good and the benefits were excellent.
good,"Tutti molto disponibili a insegnare il lavoro"
good,I really didn't like that job like that but It paid the bills that I needed to be paid .... I was a very hard worker then  they let all of the temp people go
good,It was just a stressful place to work. I was there on time every day but the managers were always to busy to guide anyone. I wanted to keep working there but the sort was over
good,Ppg is a great place to work. They teach you fundamentals. They work environment is safe. Friendly people and great opportunities. They help you grow an provide you with the skills to succeed.
good,The company and benefits were outstanding. The management was not good at all....everyone thought they were the boss.  It would have been a perfect forever job if they could have gotten their act together.
good,"A very productive and promising day/week can be assured; however, it's sometimes questionable and predictable as to dependable leadership support. I would not rely on mere leadership support but to accountable team members and/or senior partners when deemed necessary."
good,"Good benefits, low pay. A lot of childish people in the work place that are poorly supervised and not held accountable for their actions. No sense of urgency from people."
good,"Was a fun place to work, very intense. Became very stressful. No formal training , learn as you go. New processes and software changing at a quick rate."
good,"It is a great corporation, but the management need to be more professional from top to the bottom , they hiring people with no experience or not education ."
good,"nothing special about working here.  Very stable, but they didn't pay very well for HVAC Maintenance.  401k was a good match at 6%.  Benefits were ok as well."
good,I worked as a temp when I was hired on for a P/T position where I worked my tail off lifting heavy paint labels. I had a car accident and was going through a divorce so I was very stressed out and I believe that is why they let me go with no warning and no explanation.
good,Went for group orientation. It was obvious who was getting hired. The leader of the orientation interaction was mostly with whom was going to be hired.  Back luck for me. Went at wrong group. Got a email before I got home saying I didn't get the job. Can get a job if timing is right. Color of skin helps too.
good,"This is a great opportunity. I just couldn't get my mental time clock to get used to shift work hours. Training is provided and in depth, so you KNOW what your doing."
good,"Every day started out with receiving daily work load assignment from shift lead   10 hour day, including Saturdays  .  heavy lifting, must be able to stand for entire shift"
good,Typical day consisted of delivering gallons of paint to customers. It was nice being able to be outside and working at your own pace. This was a fun job that always kept you busy.
good,"It can be a great place to retire.  Long time works still have great benefits, however people are getting much more from the outside.  PPG is very cliqish and if you are not on the inside your out."
good,"Good company to work for, goals are set forth and they can be achieved .quarterly bonuses are paid three weeks after the quarter is over and all numbers are in ."
good,It's a good place to work for and you get payed pretty good. If you like making money then this the place for you to work at. Fiber glass gets quite annoying
good,Working at ppg was fun just time to find something news. Had lots of fun and learned a lot about powder paint. The hardest part was making the paint right. The easiest part was packing it all away
good,Bom ambiente de trabalhomas sem perspectiva de crescimento
good,I worked for PPG as a Winder Operator. This is a very fast pace and demanding job. It is not a job for anyone that is lazy and wants something simple. Every day is not the same. This place can be what you make it. It also depend on what you can withstand. If you have been there a long time you will have much easier jobs. You must work your way up.
good,The work environment was stressful.   I enjoyed the contacts I made with people in the plant.  I was fortunate to be able to work the hours I worked an be close to home.
good,very easy and laid back working environment. Typical day at work consisted of stripping down and buffing parts. ensuring the quality of the product for our customer was a top priority
good,jobs are easy to learn. must be able to to concentrate on details especially type of cans drums etc.be strong enough to pull large pots of paint which can be daunting as this could be onto different levels.
good,It is an interesting place to work. It definitely can help you build your character. It is not for the soft hearted. You will learn what it really means to work for a corporate company.
good,"It was family owned great place to work for, but there's really no room to advance, and the pay is kinda lacking for the work, but it is a great entry level place to learn a dying trade."
good,"Although nobody was misleading, it was disappointing still that after a year of satisfactory work, there were absolutely no chances for me to grow in my career."
good,This is a great company to work for if you can get in a permant position. There is always something to do. Everyone on the staff is very friendly and willing to help everyone. They are very much focused on the safety of every employe. They are willing to help everyone advance personally.
good,"Como todas as empresas em que eu trabalhei existem os prós e os contras, os problemas são sempre similares, tem um bom plano de saúde, paga em dia, colegas agradáveis e de fácil relacionamento, precisa melhorar o restaurante, a mudança contante no foco é o maior problema"
good,"Ok job, there could have been a few changes for some new workers that started at the plant. Should have been more knowledge giving to new hires on things to do and how to prepare things."
good,"The job is fun when the busy season occurs, meeting new people and connecting with them everyday. Offering advice and picking out colors for paint, restocking color centers, downstocking product, and training associates on product. Hardest part of the job is staying focused when the stores are not busy."
good,I worked with the people that were like my family. We worked together as a team and that was the key to our success. We supported each other in each task. Work together when the problem arise and trying to solve it as a team. I love the group of the people that i am working with. The hardest part of the gob was when we a part that had to be completed yesterday. Still our team try to finish it as fast and safe as possible sometime we worked 12 hrs shift !!
good,a typical work day here is sort of fast paced but it is never anything too hard. the hardest part of the job is working with the faulty equipment it can sometimes be a hassle when trying to train someone my co-workers are easy to get along with
good,Great opportunities and a professional place to work - decent understanding managers and oftentimes a relaxed environment which helped the sales reps get more done
good,"We analyze samples for root cause analysis, defect analysis and troubleshoot problems that can occur in the manufacturing process. A plethora of information was learned about the different types of coatings that are used in our everyday lives. The hardest part of the job was meeting the demands of management and customer satisfaction; large customer base and high expectations. The best part of the job was the use of the equipment and the critical thinking that was required in order to perform the job on a day-to-day basis."
good,"Work day depends on what shift you work"
good,Working through challenges that will enable the company to become more profitable.The management is very broad-based.
good,"het werk was afwisselend"
good,Uma empresa com cultura americana mediana.Boa para se trabalhar com beneficios comuns a todas
good,"Run sales, inventory and forecast daily to create production schedule for 3 plants.  Cover 8 distribution centers including Canada and Puerto Rico.  Review demand and allocation for over 200's skus including international orders."
good,"There was not a lot of down time during the day, you were either helping customers, making deliveries, or unloading trucks and stocking shelves."
good,Can be fun depending on the management. The atmosphere is that of accepting that they are second place which creates a defeatist attitude with many tenured employees.
good,"Lots of red tape and politics"
good,"I learned a lot about fiberglass, and the hours were great with four days on and four days off. I also got all the overtime I wanted."
good,"A typical day at work for  me started every morning about 6:30am, we would a safety meeting to discuss safety issues or concerns about the day before. I would then go to my work area and prepare my work area so that I may begin working. My job was to inspect the recliner brackets for defects. I would make sure there was no weld splatters, high welds, low welds, weld porosities, etc. I would take a 15 minute break at about 8, I would use that time to use the restroom or get something to drink if I needed to. I would take a lunch break about 10:30am and it was 45 minutes.  After lunch I would work on and complete the rest of my work by 2:15pm so that I may have time to clean my work area thoroughly before getting off at 2:45pm."
good,"Load and unload  truck at repaints, new construction and store transfers. Good crew and supervisor,Hardest part is new homes and sandy lots."
good,this company would be great if you had the right management in place co-workers are great it's like a family atmosphere but the upper management have no clue about how to get employees to be productive moral is low around the company and no room for advancement
good,Went to work and did my job. Leaned how to drive forklift. Learned many new things. It was close to the house. The workers worked hard.
good,A typical day entails managing yourself while having the ability to accomplish your tasks in a safe and effective manner
good,"Co workers were nice, management seemed to be alright. Employees were very nice in general. Work environment was acceptable."
good,"There are a multitude of different business units and job functions within the company, but little work is done to give existing employees the tools they need to succeed.  Because most management has a 'right here, right now' attitude, I see a lot of very talented people use their skills to apply to higher-paying jobs outside of the company.  It is hard to get promoted, so many employees grow frustrated and do anything they can to get out."
good,Gained valuable experience as a first job after college. Was able to work with a few different research groups for collaborate projects. Overall experience was great.
good,cool job but hard work for little pay. staff was fun. but customers are very arogant.
good,"•	Organized, verified and coordinated clothes by color for shipping"
good,"It is a great place to work , if you want to progress slowly and have job security.    The compensation will be a little lower then competitors"
good,"Was working for Akzo Nobel when PPG acquired our Architectural Coatings business and moved it to their HQ in Pittsburgh, PA. Since only there one year it is difficult to answer this question other than to say, under the circumstances they made it a fair place to work. A typical day at work would have been to train the personnel from PA that were going to be needing to learn our systems, etc.in order to do the job. Which was also the hardest part of the job."
good,"A typical day at work is not a typical day at all.  In any one day I can be dealing with part time workers all the way up the chain to upper regional management, and end consumers with in my territory.  "
good,"A typical day is anything but typical. From day to day you are always working on something different.  You are always on your toes and always busy.  But when you need assistance someone is always around to help. We have a good team who is willing to help out any one of us.  I would say the hardest part of the job is keeping it all together, on the right track to meet that goal at the end of the day."
good,Pas d'avis car service Comptabilité délocalisé en République Tchèque
good,"I'm a contractor. I wish PPG would hire me. "
good,"Worked as a contractor for PPG.  PPG was ok.  Strange round about rules that they only tell you about when it pertains, rather than being up front.  Horrible temp/hire policies.  "
good,"After spending most of my adult life with this company I find myself under-stimulated, and my skills under-utilized. Multiple attempts to relocate within the company, to departments that will offer advancement, have failed. I enjoy my co-workers, and management staff, I just find myself wishing I were being challenged on a daily basis, and able to produce work that I can take pride in."
good,I worked in the Data Entry Dept. in the evenings.
good,"While this job was a great learning experience from the Environmental stand point the overall work place was slow moving. The company as a whole had a older average age which lead to odd generational gaps and differences in the work place when dealing with computers and technology. I had a great experience with my co-workers but due the age gap nothing really expanded beyond idle chatter. I think the hardest part of the job was keeping busy, I really wanted to working constantly but due to the lack of technology knowledge upper level management could not keep me busy."
good,"Very siloed organization. I saw the company bend over backwards to save people's jobs, and I saw arbitrary cuts. Not a lot of diversity for an international company."
good,"Good job. Good insurance. The downside is the low bonuses and uncertainty with a new company(Georgia gulf) taking over. The merger could be good, but could be bad. The two tier pay system is unreasonable as well. It's unfair to be working side by side and doing the same job as a guy that is making 8 dollars an hour more than you. Great group of hourly workers there, though."
good,Co-workers were easy to get along with and typical day was pulling orders then making the deliveries on time
good,They're looking to sell fiberglass division... not much growth opportunities or skilled management left.
good,"Supervised others, working with others, needs more shifts & people"
good,good people to work with and good benefits. ppg has a safe and well managed work place.
good,"enjoyed running the equipment,learned a lot about cutting equipment over the 25 years i ran the cutting line. management was good ,not great, hardest part of the job was trouble shooting.best part of the job was i was in charge of the quality of the product."
good,There were reasonable opportunities for advancement during my time at PPG. I enjoyed working for PPG. I was able to work with a good team that supported my decisions.
good,"The company overall is a good place to work. They are undergoing a culture change and leadership is not transparent. They do offer great benefits such as a car, laptop, and phone."
good,employees and management changed regularly no consistency I felt like that the company didn't care about their employees. just my opinion about the company though
good,"It was hard and rewarding work. It pushed you mentally and physically, but you always felt like you accomplished something atvthe end of the day. Upper-level management were out of touch and not concerned with the lower level employee's concerns or thoughts. But overall a good place to work."
good,I do not have anything to review about PPG. I was a contractor with them for three years. I only know what they expect from their contractors.  Management was usually helpful when you needed something.
good,The management sucks and the job can be difficult but the pay is good and makes you tough it out. This job takes good character and perspectives. Benefits are great
good,"Tem muito o que evoluir em termos de dinamismo,"
good,Loved my job there. Just poor management. Loved the work I did. The people were great to work with. Did a variety of work so made for a quick day. Management is under-experienced and doesn't back you up an corporate decisions.
good,As a Manager you are expected to pick up hours that your employees can not work and have no option if you were not able to pick up the hours. Very understaffed in the stores. Leads to a lot of stress. You have sick days but it is literally impossible to use one or the store wouldn't open.
good,The job itself is not difficult mentally but it does demand a certain level of physical activity. The benefits are decent and the pay is better than most places in my area.
good,"Great Work to person life balance. Company car, credit card, and phone. Not much control on payments, and inventory through the home center side. Great career to get experince."
good,Advance promised to employees after 18 months and some analysts were on the desk for 3+ years. The morality of work environment was poor as management did not consider employee feedback.
good,Years ago when PPG was a diverse company it seem to care more about its employees. Once it divested it seemed the care for employees dropped tremendously.
good,Fast paced production work good pay great benefits down side is fiber glass stabbing in hands and arms very hot and no smoking allowed.................
good,PPG was an a sleeping Giant 20 years ago. Today it's rank #1 or #2 World Largest Paints an Coatings Manufacturer. Very competitive culture. I developing many of my technical skills by the great management mentors when I was working with them.
good,"Responsible for opening and closing store.  Have to be responsible for delivery expectations of customers and needs.  I keep the workplace fun, but get the job done.  I like working with different customer and employee personalities, and hardest part is working with limited help and resources."
good,Repetitive work same every day .no time to think going round and round on a one person cell the  targets are getting harder on my feet all day for twelve hours a day team are ok some really good people striving to acheave the goals and tasks great feeling when you have given your all and see how far you have come from day 1 to we're your at now
good,"unorganized management, not enough on the job training, no room for growth. There is no role definition everyone is doing everything and it's confusing on who can help you with whatever problem you have. there is no structure for the employees everybody does what they want and site manager isn't concerned for employees"
good,"A typical day at Dulux runs from 9:30-6 (FT)"
good,"I worked three schedules of 8-4, 4-12 and midnights until 8 a.m."
good,"My day starts with environmental paperwork, making unit adjustments on foxboro, optimizing setpoints to other units rates of production. Helping shift supervisor in coordinating production rates for several units in Plant-B. The hardest part of my day is not being able to run my unit to its full potential because of too many inexperienced workers and maintenance budget."
good,Job is not stressful at all. Management doesn't care to reward employees. Raises rarely ever happen. Most in store employees are part time unless you're an assistant or store manager.
good,Had freedom to be creative and use my talents to bring maximum value to the awesome company...loved solving the challenges that were given to me...thankful to have been part of the team
good,"Swing shifts and mandated forced overtime, not much time for life outside of work. Terrible HR department but good floor management. Plenty of training, always someone around to direct questions to. Decent pay and ability to advance. Not the safest job but lots of safety training and PPE provided."
good,"PPG is a great employer when it comes to pay, benefits, and work schedule, however the quality reviews are designed to fail and are not consistent with the problem-solving methods that are preached to employees."
good,"Probably the best job i have ever had, but managment takes a little too much on what people say and that alone. If the pay wasnt as good as it was with the benefits given, i would see a major problem between the company management and the Union Employees"
good,"Typical :  Supply large commercial products.   "
good,"Great place to work and great for providing for your family. A great place to grow and expand, to learn new interesting job and procedures while preforming you job."
good,"Good pay, benefits, and paid time off for the industry standard. A few changes at the Cleveland Ohio site could return the site to the extremely good place to work of the past. Hourly work force was good for the most part and the supervisors worked together well to support each other and cover shifts for each other."
good,"Good work place, but HR department is not easily accessible.It used to be but now you have to do everything through the main branch. I had a problem with the HR department and my child's health insurance. I called and they were very rude to me. The managers in the company are pretty good and understanding, but sometimes the company policy restricts them from helping you out. I didn't like that we were never 100% sure that we had off a holiday as well."
good,They had out dated equipment which made the job hared than it should have been Plus half the time we didn't have the raw material we needed to complete the job or the right equipment.
good,"I enjoyed my time at PPG Industries. When I first started my career, the company was Porter Paints and was bought out by PPG Industries. About 2 years after the acquisition, PPG started closing stores and reducing staff. Many hard working employees were let go without notice."
good,"I learned how to doff, weigh and load packages onto trucks. On a typical day you'd come in and check your work station making sure it was clean. I enjoyed working alone."
good,"I really loved my job as a Sales Rep, The positives far out weighed any negatives. My managers were all excellent really treated everyone like a human being. Always able to get the point across with out making everyone feel terrible.."
good,"It is a professioal work environment with probably above average benefits. There are many groups that you have to work with scattered throughout the country to get a task doe, which can sometimes over complicate some things."
good,I've been at PPG for 15 years and they are being bought out and Their cutting a lot of our benefits and I'm not sure about the future of the company.  We work 12 hour swing shifts with two on call days.  I love my job but the company doesn't seem to care about their employees like they use to.
good,"They were an ok place to work.  They were a good opportunity for what it was.  It was not a bad place, it just was not what I was going to do for my career."
good,"typical day at work is monitoring the conveyor,making sure everything runs smoothly,better the production,more money the company makes,i believe in doing my job the best i know how,people were good to work with,i really don;t care for the split shift,"
good,difficultés du poste de responsable maintenance non reconnues

good,Excellent benefits going thru new management change for the better coming along far as productivity stand point. Different shifts to fit with your lifestyle hard to find good workers
good,Great management.  I am able to do my own work here on a daily basis.  The only problem is the pay. It is not high enough.
good,"The work environment is fast paced, the employees are friendly and work as a team. the hardest part of the jobs are the hours you have to work (3) 12hour shifts"
good,"Very good place to work, Good wages, based on nationwide averages. Very good benefits, Management very easy to work with. Could accept what extra responsibility you would like if available. PPG contracted the daily operations of our facility to LaSaint Logistics.We were terminated from PPG and would have to reapply with LaSaint LogisticsAt a 40% pay cut."
good,very clean and respectful place to work. a lot of interesting things to learn on a daily basis. management is very respectful in seem to actually care about their employees
good,overall good company but they don't give much salary for all the necessary knowledge. Otherwise they offer great work/private life balance. Good benefits
good,Small new department off site department. Good team with minimal training from corporate group that was being de-centralized. Team developed during system conversion.
good,Good job. Depends on what mixer you run. Your body can get a little tired after working long 12 hour shifts. Managment needs to figure out how to get everybody on the same page. All in all an alright job.
good,I enjoyed my time working at PPG and had a very good manager. clean and safe place to work and varied things to do from mixing and matching paint to deliveries of paint and paint supplies> I enjoed it very much
good,"Good place to work but the pay is a lot less than competitors. Also, they sell other brands in other stores, so you will be competing with your own brand. They have some good products coming out for Home Depot."
good,Great exposure to various departments as a Financial Trainee.  Lots of opportunity to travel and advance internally.  PPG offers many opportunities to develop.
good,"Good place to work, but not a completely honest management department. Good coworkers, clean plant, good benefits. Good rewards program, and end of the year bonuses."
good,Sample task not  difficult its all common knowledge laid back but the turn out rate was pretty bad but had a good environment with majority of co-workers
good,excelente empresa com bom ambiente de trabalho. criterios de avaliação não atende o nescessario.
good,"• work-life balance is great"
good,"Co-workers are good."
good,this is a very good company to work for but the swing shift is not good for my home life.
good,"The job okay, it's to many people who don't do there job. And it makes it hard for everyone else. Management don't do nothing about it. But the place has been sold so the new owners might be better"
good,if you want to be apart of a great family ppg would be good fit for you they care about the ones they have on there team. easy to talk to if you have things come up.

good,I enjoyed this job very much because it was a constant learning process.  Being in a plant was new to me and very interesting.
good,It was a good place to work. It has rough work hours though. 2 days and 2 nights. Really messed sleeping habits up. Really good pay and benefits. Management was sometimes understanding and there were some people that was hard to work with.
good,"A typical day at work for me, would be picking orders,staging,tagging "
good,"-A great manager who truly cares about the employees. "
good,Great place to work at. Helpful management and everybody gets along. Starting pay is lower than expected especially for the type of work is required and the equipment that is being used.
good,The commute was too much for me to keep the position but it was one that utilized many different chemical tests to ensure product stability. Very enjoyable.
good,"a  typical day consisted of  going  to  a meeting  and  being  told  the  product  that  was  being  ran  how  much  we  were  running an  hour  and  who  we  were  replacing  on  the  line.  the  most  enjoyable  part of  my  job  was  the  point  that  we  finished  a run  and  the  feeling  of  accomplishment that  came  with that. "
good,"Really smart people, a lot of opportunity for growth, always encouraged to be innovative, think big, and create something new. Competitive salary and benefits with other major tech companies. 100% self motivating work environment. "
good,"la compañía se a destacado por el excelente clima laborar y se preocupa demasiado por la seguridad de todos sus empleados, brindando siempre un apoyo a los mismos, siempre pensando en el futuro de las personas. por parte de la gerencia tiene una buena administración de los recurso y una gran preocupación por todos sus empleados"
good,Had a lot of free time. A lot of employees would come and go. Worked here at the age of 17 part time since i graduated early until i turned 18 to start full time employment
good,"It was full of lots of learning to communicate, time management, organization, and multi-tasking.  I had made a lot of friends and this job and it felt more like they were family.  Very stressful at times but isn't that life!"
good,"I rather not say for personal reasons it's a like any other company that exist,it pays you to do a job that's it no more ,no less, come to work do your job an leave."
good,"Fun enviroment. No room for advancement in my dept. People are very nice there, always a good laugh. I work dealers outside of Utah, so not alot of one on one with my customers."
good,"Could hire an outside source to do the same job. I work in ""social media,"" where there is no room to grow or really learn, easy hour job. Can hire someone outside ""hourly"" for less."
good,"I worked with glass, putting primer on and sending down line. I also did inspecting, making sure glass wasn't chipped and primer was in all the right spots. The people I worked with made the job better. It was an inviting workplace."
good,"Loved the job. Loved the Union. Rotation shift work, long hours. unpredictable shifts. Good pay due to Union. Lots of training available. Hard to have a regular life on production schedule.  You work for the money."
good,Uma boa empresa. Com chances de crescimento e trabalho fora do Brasil .
good,PPG is a good company to work for. However if your on the productive sat you're required to do a lot of overtime and a lot of weekends. Compensation for time is Adequate
good,I was a temp worker so I used my time there to learn how to drive a forklift better. The plant I was working with relocated they offered more money but it was too far for a daily commute.
good,Recommend. Work life balance depends on direct management. Target goals are only achievable every other year for bonus purposes. Good benefits. Database is not very efficient when preparing reports.
good,"PPG was sold and was shut done. The few months I got to work there was a good experience. The pay was good and the benefits were better than average. PPG was shut down and reopened as another company. We were told if we came back, there would be a substantial pay increase. There wasn't - 40 cents more per hour is not  substantial to me"
good,"I was a unit engineer where I was in charge of developing Management of changes, helping with capital projects, assisted in union work stoppage's and helped with day to day activities."
good,"I enjoy working at PPG they play a great role throughout the Pittsburgh area. They are extremely dedicated to their charitable activities and contributions. Although I don't mind working for them as an outside contractor, I would like the opportunity to actually be a full time PPG employee, they seem to hire most of their employees on this basis. It is difficult to fully appreciate your position when you are not confident that you have job security."
good,"Commercial Coatings"
good,good people to work with overall  been there for over a year i work very hard i just don't get any vacation time or health benefits and have come to the conclusion i deserve better
good,I was a Coatings Store Manager. I learned so much about the coatings industry in the 7 years I was there. my co-workers were awesome. The best part of the job was the relationships I built with my customers. Many of them became friends. The hardest part of the job was telling those same customers I could not make them happy based on the economic direction the company was taking.
good,"PPG was not a necessarily a ""fun"" place to work, however the hours were steady, the paycheck was consistent and it provided the means to provide for my family. I would recommend this company as the job is not hard, and was a decent work environment with friendly people."
good,"This is a very fast pace working environment, you are expected to get tasks done in a time frame no matter the work load. That was one of biggest issues with this company, no matter how big the truck or how big the order, the time limit remained the same. This created an unsafe work environment in my opinion because there are a lot of moving parts and you moving to fast takes your focus away from people and equipment around you."
good,"9 minutes at a time on any one topic, if you're lucky. My experience of late has been an anti-social group of employees. This I regard to stress on the job and a mass influx of young employees."
good,PPG- Well it was good place to work for til they voted for 12 hour shifts. Management sucked and so did the union. THey wouldnt let people in the union to go to the weekly union meetings unless you were management.
good,"PPG was always a place where people retired from after a long career.  Many came out of college and were developed and were encouraged to change jobs internally to gain good experience.  Times have changed.  In IT, this model no longer applies.  Jobs are being eliminated and sent offshore, leaving not only a gap in experience and loyalty, but also a lack of confidence in management that good hard working people have value, even when they are dedicated people who understand the business and want to remain loyal to the company.  These people are now a minority and being pushed out in favor of those with less people skills, loyalty, and dedication."
good,Management has went down hill over the past year not sure this location will survive. I need a job with opportunities for advancement. I like the people I work with but almost all management is now gone and working with skeleton crews in production also.
good,No two days the same with a wide and varied work load.
good,I enjoyed this job. I was given the opportunity to learn different positions. I would not have left if not laid off.
good,"entreprise avec de très bonnes conditions de travail, gestion très centralisée tant au niveau corporatif que local."
good,"They were not hiring permanent Administrative Support and I was told that after the first week of working there."
good,They were a ok place to work. the pay was low. they wanted you to start working on Saturdays.the stores did not want us there. Not sure if they trust there remote team members.
good,"My time there was very good.  The industry began to turn when I was leaving and new upper management was brought in having little to no experience with the auto industry.  Colleagues still there are not very happy currently, but things will come back....they always did. Overall, a great career choice for me."
good,"Good benefits, but easy to fall into cracks and not have your work be seen or appreciated. Day to day work was manageable, but implementing a new TMS was time consuming and not really sure if it is worth being there any longer as there is no career advancement."
good,"Rotating 12hr shifts (6-6), great benefits (a nicely loaded package), low pay (2 tier system), advancement opportunities (they post jobs in-house first), undereducated supervision (no minimum requirements)."
good,Company was changing drastically and acquiring a lot of businesses while I was there. Store personnel weren't the priority of upper management. Viewed as easily replaceable so I gave them the opportunity to replace me.
good,"On a typical day at work an occupational health nurse was responsible for 500+ employees health concerns.  Ranging from occupational illness & injuries, management of employees on sick leave & long term disability.  Screenings to include vision, hearing, respirator, health promotions.  The hardest part of my job was the workload, needing additional staff to fully accomplish set and required goals.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being there for the employees.  Being able to assist them and make a difference in their lives."
good,"1. Hours are good"
good,"нервотрепка из-за руководителя, остальное в среднем не плохо"
good,"Empresa voltada para os funcionários, ótimo clima, oportunidades de conhecer novas áreas e crescimento."

good,"o dia a dia é correria em função da correria, mas no geral, os colegas são prestativos, gerencia de facil acesso."
good,"I have been working in QC , technical service , supply chain, warehouse and sales departtment... get lots of training and well travelled around the world. I personally get great opportunities in PPG and so is most of the people that I have been working with.Generally speaking, it is a great company"
good,"Good place to work, overtime available, multiple shifts and no lay off’s occurred while I was employed there. Not much else to say about being employed there."
good,Debes de tener buena relacion con los supervisores para que te puedan promover
good,I enjoyed working for this company. The people were really professional and competent. I would work for them again. The plant I worked at was bought out by another company though.
good,smooth working place co worker cool easy to get the job done working and a clean enivoriment  i let how the hours is the pay is decent itb a must u be on time
good,"·	Reworked and closed containers of glass to prepare for shipping."
good,"The opportunities to progress through the company with more and more challenging assignments, in varying disciplines, has made PPG a wonderful place to work for over 20 years."
good,"Generic working experience that made moderate use of my skills. I was not challenged or pushed to any great extent here, and nothing was demanded beyond the normal working hours."
good,"Ambiente di lavoro stimolante e professionale basato sulla sicurezza."
good,Typical work day consisted of taking order for creating colored paint for delivery or pick up for customer. Learned how to properly mix paint. Loved the job
good,"Orders varied widely by customer demand, but always achieved our goal. 99% effective rating"
good,"Ensured the shop strand department ran effciently"
good,"Aanmaken database grondstoffen en producten voor de"
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, buen trato a los trabajadores"
good,I spent 44 years at PPG most of them rather rewarding The pace was a think on your feet pace. The atmosphere for most of my stay was a family type with close relationships. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the employees I had the privilege of supervising.
good,I truly enjoyed learning how to use the equipment they had was a fast paced environment and I enjoyed working with others. I liked how when I met quota they challenged me to make even more
good,Half of the job position is data collection and the other half is data entry work. I worked seond shift alone so I was self organized as long as I completed my weekly requirements.
good,I  would work there again if I had a chance to and also if I could get a little bit more of a pay increase. I'm maintenance supervisor the time was amazing and extremely kind to me as well as my fellow co-worker.
good,"PPG is one of the largest coatings manufacturers and distributors in the world. Based in the United States, it has thousands of retail locations worldwide and supplies many large Industrial markets with their products."
good,i left this position to move to another state. i enjoyed the people i worked for the and job that i did. relaxed environement and learned a lot of new things.
good,"I enjoyed my work and was allowed to work at my own pace with little to no interruption.  Managers were always available when needed.  The men were always paid more than the women.  There was, unfortunately, a ""good 'ol boy"" culture that was alive and well.  Dealing with this culture was the hardest part of the job.  I just enjoyed the work most of the time, when I felt like I was a necessary cog on the wheel.  I particularly enjoyed the interaction with the operations people when they brought samples to the lab.  I always learned something new about the products we made.  I helped me understand my job better."
good,"PPG as a whole is a place where individuals are empowered to perform tasks assigned in their own unique way. In my time there, I learned many valuable lessons about coworker interaction and gained a knowledge of human resources. The most difficult part involved with working at PPG was the lack of unity between different sectors of the company. The most enjoyable part of working for PPG was the interaction with perspective employees and the management of the current contractors."
good,"I decent place to work, Stressful job that demanded numerous working hours including 12 hour days and weekend. Demanding work environment that is stressful."
good,Very Stressful - did not have the staff needed for install of new computer system.  Management did not listen and this caused a lot of issues that resulted in a very unhappy workforce.
good,Great benefits with the company but you will work a lot of overtime. You start as second shift and have to work your way to 1st shift. The coworkers do not take new hires well.
good,"Buena filosofía de operación para atender al mercado Automotriz en el amplio mercado, aplicando Lean Manufacturing."
good,Manager was great at delegating tasks and assigning high impact projects for the interns. Interesting work that was very hands on and immersive. I was given a lot of responsibility for a three-month internship.
good,this is a good place t wok if you are just getting out of school and need experience the is a lot of growth opportunity here at this company. great friendly work environment
good,"My experience there was hindered by management of my area. He was concerned about his advancement only."
good,"buen ambiente con los compañeros , la empresa nos facilitaba el almuerzo, y media mañana o refrigerio"
good,"PPG is very dedicated to getting their employees trained."
good,"Empresa dedicada, respondable y eficaz que brinda un buen ambiente laboral a sus empleados,brindandoles la alimentacion en las ubicadciones de la misma para asi evitarle desplazamientos a los empleados."
good,Great Organization to work for. Awesome opportunity to to have a positive impact on day to day territory operations and build pertinent relationships within the industry and organization.
good,"The work is great, there is always something to do to burn the time. The employees you work with are great. They do classes every 2 weeks to keep us refreshed on procedures. The draw back is that you can get terminated for the simplest infraction. I was terminated for not locking the delivery drivers keys in the key lock box. I already put 2 chock block down on their wheels, pulled the air line and locked it,and secured the trailer with a giant trailer hook. keep in mind I already work 22 hours for the week and it was only 2 hours into Tuesday. Of course it was my fault I over looked the key box. lock out procedure for the inbound trailers are treat the same for lock out procedures on the production lines. All it took was this one time forgetting to lock they key box, after I already performed all the other safety procedures, to get me terminated, zero tolerance is no joke with this company."
good,"It was here that I learned the basics of a paint shop and how they operated.The customer was interested in the help that you had to offer, and once you knew the workings of the shop, it was easy to get going."
good,This is a great place to start a sales career. The benefits are great and the culture is even better. I think that it is the best paint company to work for of the three choices in this market.
good,"Apesar da gerência deixar a desejar, é uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar. Há bons benefícios e um ótimo ambiente de trabalho."
good,I have enjoyed and got opportunity to update my knowledge while working here.got opportunity to work on advanced topics in SAP.
good,It was a new experience and it was a challenge. I enjoyed it. It was fun learning how all different colors went into making a specific color for a customer
good,Good company to work for. Did not spend a lot of time here thought the work was kind of boring in the quality lad. Moved on to more of something that I was into.
good,"God arbejdsplads med gode kollegaer."
good,"PPG is a good place to work. Benefits are good and there is always a lot happening. There are a lot of people retiring in the next few years and this is creating a lot of opportunity for young people. "
good,A typical day of consists of doing work orders doing repairs as things break down. I've learned how to rebuild pumps operate a boiler some electrical and how to keep a chemical plant running.
good,"Good Place To Work & Learn More About Retail Business. Good Team, work culture in Pune. Effective Management. Some Issues with Salary."
good,Employees worked together as a team.  Management staff was very supportive and encouraged advancement within the organization.
good,Gratifying knowing that automotive coating that you made and filled for shipment will be on a car or truck in the near future.
good,Management was very supportive and flexible as I attended college for my degree.  Showed interest and support for my goals and desires on both professional and personal levels.
good,"This place gives me a bittersweet feeling in general. Great place to work if you can handle the rotating, swing schedule, the high pressure style of management, and specialized jobs, this is a great place to work."
good,"Very nice people to work with. Management changed quite often, and there was quite a few managers. Seemed like everything was very micromanaged. Things typically ran smoothly, and there was usually somebody to talk to about problems. Some managers were not familiar with all processes."
good,A typical day at work ranges with everything I do involving dealing with accounts/payments/invoices helping the store manager do the weekly reports and the monthly cps as well as other paper work.
good,"•	Input, organize, track, and file confidentiality agreements, insurance certificates, and purchase orders"
good,Pay is average for scope of abilities expected. Maintenance and production are divided. Can be asked to work in adverse environments. Supervision uses older mentality principles. Most coworkers are knowledgable and helpful.
good,"My day would start at 7am at the store location doing computer work, sage, price quotes.  That to be successful you need to continually be growing your business while maintaining the business that you currently have.  Management was hands on as long as you reached out to them.  My co-workers were the best, very friendly and supportive.  Juggling all the accounts I had over 300 accounts and growing.  The people by far was the best part of this job from co-workers to customers."
good,It was a great job but the only con was the heat. Regardless of the season it was boiling. The employees were decent and the work was hard.
good,A typical day at work includes rapid changes through the manufacturing processes that you have to adapt to change.
good,"A family physician's office with a large population of seniors as patients.  I really enjoyed interacting with them on a daily basis and serving them in a friendly, positive manner!"
good,PPG is a great place to work and a great company with excellent compensation and benefits. It is a hazardous environment and the chemicals can cause health problems.
good,"Trabalho extremamente rotineiro e no geral, muito tranquilo. Oferece aprendizado considerável. Gestores flexíveis, porém, desatualizados, precisando de reciclagem geral na área que atuam; alguns passivos em excesso, outros, centralizadores e com certa dose de autoritarismo e individualismo. Equipe de trabalho entrosada, com cooperatividade e relacionamento interpessoal evidentes. Deficiência na agilidade e apoio da equipe da Matriz quando surgem determinados problemas que a equipe da filial não pode resolver por não possuir autonomia. O ambiente de trabalho em geral (estrutura e espaço físico; pessoas) é muito agradável."
good,"A typical day at work starts early in a Home Depot store driving sales to contractors and DIY customers. I then train all associates in paint and stain related products, interact with store management and discuss sales plans and promotions. During my time at PPG paints I have learned about product launches, retail management, cost estimating, inventory control, merchandising and sales strategies. The management at PPG is autonomous and allows its sales force to work in a self directed manner. Our instruction comes via email and through a Sales Force Automated application on the computer. I normally work alone within the stores but interact with numerous managers / assistant managers within the Home Depot. The hardest part of the job is usually during product launches due to the vast amount of merchandising and resets required. The most enjoyable part of the job is the constant interaction with contractors and customers within the Home Depot."
good,The best part of working here were the great people that made up the organization.
good,"Working for this company have showed me the meaning of ""loyalty""."
good,PPG is a worldwide corporation that is very aggressive in its growth.
good,fantastic place to work but unfortunately was only a temporary assignment until union EBA was finalised
good,PPG people are great to work with. We provide tech support to Chrysler on PPG paint and supplies. Inventory supplies and test paint for viscoity to insure proper flow through robots. Also test units for apperances.
good,A typical day is a meeting in the morning then on to your day of work.
good,I enjoyed collaborating with members of the PPG team rationalizing spray polyurethane elastomer development
good,I worked there for years and once you get on a shift it is a long period before you can change shifts. I wasn't happy being stuck on 3rd shift with someone else that didn't know there job and was always trying to get out of work so they could sleep all night and make someone else do the work for them.
good,The training for this department was horrible.  No cohesive teamwork or collaboration at all.  Work load is unbalanced and management is unaware or doesn't seem concerned. Several individuals work too many hours and then take work home.  Orders should be entered by one rep and then checked by a second rep before release to production
good,"I worked at PPG in their glass division which no longer exists but I can tell you that PPG routinely was identified as one of the top 100 best managed companies in the world. That did not translate into generosity however, and I left PPG to get better pay."
good,Our plant seemed to be secure but PPG decided to shut down our plant and three other plants in this country.  My time there has been a learning experience with advancement opportunities.
good,"Not an awful place to work but to make a decent wage, you need to work a lot of overtime. Plenty of people work 16 hour shifts through the week. Benefits are getting worse, like most places right now. Management is usually pretty bad. The union has its benefits but they also have passed contracts that now allow 3 separate tiers of employees. So you will be making a lot less than others who do the same job. Hard to stay together as a union, when everyone is separated and already against each other."
good,"Good place to work. People very helpful and always present for work. "
good,The work at PPG was exciting.  The individual employees were great and management was very supportive.  It was a sad day when we had to close the factory in Louisville and I wish they would have offered alternative opportunities.
good,I worked on the service desk and it was supposed to be a job training program in addition to work but the service desk is overloaded with work and thus there is no time for the projects that are supposed to get you advancement.
good,"Aging Workplace culture which can be difficult at times if you are trying to improve systems. Overall, not a bad place to work if you can handle the pressure."
good,It was a nice experience nd everything was good it's just was a long drive for me Bc I loved the hours it was overall a good job was just too far to drive for the pay I was getting
good,Problem solving and troubleshooting paint process. Most of the concepts learned in the chemical engineering program I was able to apply to real circumstances in problem solving at Jefferson North Assembly Plant Paint Department
good,"Communication from top-tier management down wasn't always fantastic."
good,I was the delivery driver in this paint store. Being the only employee besides the manager required me to do much more than just driving the van. My store manager was a treat to work with and made coming to work an enjoyable experience most days. The hardest part of the job was the sometimes having to carry very heavy product to difficult customer locations. The best part of the job was being on the road most of the day and travelling the entire state. Another benefit was meeting and interacting with a wide variety pf professional contractors as well as regular homeowners.
good,they teach you alot and its stable work.you start off part time with the ability to become full time.the hardest part of the job was working 2nd shift.
good,I work with contractors/customers directly. Opening and closing of store responsibilities. I also do the inventory of the products. I have do product knowledge classes.
good,"As an apprentice my first priority was to become a master refinisher with automotive, commercial, and aircraft technology. Based at a Training Facility I assumed a role as a head instructor for teaching new and improved ways of maximizing waterborne and solvent paint techniques and technology. I had to continuously research company products inside and outside of the refinish devision and have a well rounded understanding of each. I accompanied different Territory Managers on product installs, technical calls, sales calls, and training weekly. I attended meetings to find solutions to refinish problems. I completed many sales tactic and leadership classes provided by the company with confident results."
good,"Typically 48 to 58 hour mandatory weeks."
good,"There are days that the labor is really easy and there are times that the machines are running poorly. My partner and I on the line have to sign off the paper work to make sure that we are packaging the correct tubes, lids and product. The hardest part of the job is working in the summer because it gets really hot inside the warehouse and during the winter it's just as bad as the weather outside. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting off of work for me but to be honest working with someone that has a sense of humor."
good,"The work work you do, the more you get out of it. Although working with fumes 9-10 hours a day is not ideal. Which is normal since almost every store has 2 people in it."
good,"12 hr shift I had assigned duties and also assisted other employees with there duties. I had more duties assigned that could done in 12hrs. I did those to the best of my knowledge for 11yrs, with no growth within the company . I retired in 2014."
good,"i was a temp at gca which works at PPG. I really liked this job and they pay great, IF you can get on permanent with PPG. I knew people who had been there 5 years and were still temps. "
good,Decent place to work pay is okay but not a lot of room to grow because it is a small plant.
good,"Veel terugkerende dagelijkse werkzaamheden"
good,"Higher management (financially and organizationally) seems to never make sense, and are always penny pinching. Innovate, innovate, innvoate, but don’t spend money!"
good,PPG distribution  was an outstanding beacon to the few who work there. With a small staff of about twenty people. Safety was top priority and the work was wonderful to do. The people where the best. Had they not closed I would have worked there even today.
good,"Focus missions change with management change every 3-5 years, instead of carrying over, which results in only mid-term plan. Senior management does what they think it's best at time, but it lacks in long-term plan."
good,"Working in PPG is productive and career advancement is good. However, not a marketing driven organization with old manufacturing mentality. Multinational objectives not translated locally"
good,PPG is an old company with ever changing visions to continuously compete with the current demand of technology. A great place to work and develop a professional career.
good,the shipping department is a fast pace environment.
good,"Good internship, I learned a lot about engineering and the professional workplace. Unfortunately interning with them does not seem to affect applying for full-time positions. I waited 3 months to hear back to find out they decided not to hire anyone."
good,this was a good place to start off any career other then there shift work. Since you had to work all 3 shifts in one month with working 7 days straight before getting a day off.
good,As an area supervisor we face a new challenge everyday. I myself have an open door policy because my employees problem are usually my problems. Within reason. I have grown as a supervisor under my new manager who has taught me to look at all sides of a situation before making a decision. My job can be very challenging from day to day because everyday is a new day when you are trying to improve your area efficiency while ensuring on time delivery to the next area. I like the challenge because it pushes me to be a better manager and think outside the box for better ways to get things accomplished without upsetting the integrity of our manufacturing goals.
good,"god lab experience. Not too fast paced most times, days can get a lil long but as long as work gets done its ok. good crew that worked together for 8 years. enjoyable."
good,"excelente lugar para trabajar y sobre todo para aprender, mucho apoyo y compañerismo así como retroalimentacion de conocimientos"
good,"Una empresa con bastantes retos profesionales, el sueldo y las prestaciones son excelentes."
good,Equilibrio vida pessoal e profissional. Pacote remuneração bom.
good,The plant that I worked at has shut down. At the time I worked at it the management was great and it was a good work environment. Could be loud at times.
good,"PPG is overall a good company to work for. The schedule is flexible with plenty of paid time off (vacation/holiday/sick), and good benefits. Lots of opportunities for community outreach and volunteering. No micromanagement, very self driven environment."
good,"Team leader for C crew is very unprofessional. The work environment is very easy and laid back, but coworkers bring in a lot of drama. the rotating shift can take a toll on someone who is not used to it."
good,As an operator you are paid very well and have great benefits. We used to have a lot of fun just talking and laughing in then control room when there was no work outside but then something changed a few years ago. A LARGE division rose up between some of the white operators and African American operators. It was very uncomfortable. I decided I did not care to work there any longer so I left after almost 20 years.
good,"PPG, which is now called Axiall, is a Union environment where personal advancement is not based on job performance but rather seniority. Your job is always in jeopardy based on contract negotiations which the negotiating committee seemed ill-equipped to handle the corporate side of the table. You work in a dangerous environment with dangerous products."
good,"Very stable traditional blue chip company. Compensation tended to be lower than market, so had to leave the company for real career growth. Traditional corporate culture that was starting to become more progressive when I left the company"
good,Long hours fast pace .need to improve there  Machines  high speed packing would brake down about 20 times or more a night the  conveyors  would always get stuck
good,"Good place to work, plenty of potential opportunities if you actively search out the opportunities. Best if you can get a mentor to guide you. Automotive industry can be stressful though."
good,"Es una empresa que valora la opinion de cualquier mienbro de la organización."
good,"Great entry level sales rep job. The job itself was pretty easy, however, the days were long. You had to work 8 hour days but didn't get paid for your driving time. Since the territory is over an hour in all directions, you could have 10-11 hour days every day almost. The company car and phone benefits were very nice! I'd say I had a pretty good experience EXCEPT the fact that a year after I joined, PPG laid off 1700 people...so I got laid off as well. We just had a terrible sales year. It sucked because they didn't lay off people for performance, but by easily absorbed territories.  Nonetheless, still not a bad gig. My complaints were with the fact that management didn't really award performance like a good sales company should. I'd recommend to a friend only with a solid backup plan in place. This company goes through hiring and layoff phases frequently from what I was told from senior reps."
good,"Great place to work for, very safety conscious, nine day fortnight, generous canteen facilities, staff discount card for decorative paints and supplies,"
good,"High volume of patients."
good,"Decent work environment"
good,"The benefits are all fine and dandy. They make sure we get 40 hours a week 99% of the year. Pay is decent for our location. But there is one thing that needs improvement! These days they call bucket days, they are like sick days. You start off with five days and only five days (40 hours).  You can't accumulate them, if you use a day of bucket hours (8 hours) it will take a whole year to earn that 8 hours back. It doesn't reset every year, which I think it should. They said sick days were abused from prior employees and that's why they went to this bucket system. Even when I had pneumonia, sinusitis, and bronchitis I still had to go to work so I wouldn't use what bucket days I had left. People actually get sick and you never know when it will hit. If we can just get 5 non-accumulative sick days a year, that would just top this company off in my book. If it's that bad then there should be a system to where we need to bring a doctor's note to utilize the sick days. Keeping the bucket days for family emergencies or other unexpected situation that may arise."
good,"Overall good place to work with good people. Benefits are good, and opportunity to advance, and opportunity to move within the company."
good,"A typical day at PPG would be loading my truck and making deliveries. I've learned PPG supplies paint for building, cars and homes. Management at PPG keeps their employees informed of the company's direction and the role we play. My co-workers have high work ethics and believe in getting the job in the most efficient way possible."
good,"Informeel bedrijf met veel vrijheid en eigen inbreng."
good,"Opened over 35 new powder coating distribution centers in the north Florida and south Georgia markets. The greatest challenge of this job was selling against very low poor quality powder vendors, again building that comfort level for the end user to use PPG powders."
good,"Overall slow in taking & implementing key business decisions."
good,A typical day at work started with a grid that tells us when samples of paint were due. We would take the pre-assembled folder and the gallon of paint and perform the appropriate tests. I learned how to mentally manage multiple tasks. My co-workers came from all ages and we mingled while we were working. It was a great balance. The hardest part of the job was getting the tests in the required specifications. The most enjoyable was being able to work by myself on my own time but also chat with co-workers.
good,"Fast Paced work environment, not a professional due to dealing with mostly paint contractors. I've learned how to work well others and alone."
good,"My mornings start early which works out just fine for me being a morning person, I come in i greet my co-workers with a smile in my voice which i think it makes for a great start to any day. I prioritize me work load and my day begins. i love working with my co-workers and getting the job done in a timely manner because for me time management is a key part in getting my job done timely and safely with safety being first. There is no hard part to my job, for me just getting the job done by all means is the most important part.The most enjoyable part of job is customer satisfaction."
good,"Average work day involves managing work force, solving maintenance issues, working with upper management to maintain production goals usually set for weekly and monthly time frames. Learning to manage multiple tasks going on at same time as well as looking ahead at 30 day goals. "
good,Great place to work. People are friendly and professionally driven. Atmosphere is competitive to the point of motivating. Strive for greatness and stress that the actions of everyone is what gets them there.
good,"It was a good company to work for. Good staff, management were good to you, co-workers always got along, they were very safety conscious"
good,"An average workday may involve any variety of sample preparation, testing, and analysis of industrial coatings for a wide variety of clients.  This also could include the daily stocking of supplies, and maintenance of equipment."
good,I enjoyed this job because of the interaction with customers. I enjoy selling!! The best part of this job was actually going to the customers job site and helping them determine what steps they needed to take to get the job done in a sufficient manor for both the painter and their client.
good,"Visitas a lojas, oficinas e concessionárias."
good,"This company was an excellent place to work while being locally owned. After being purchased by PPG industries, company lost its family values and local plant is being eliminated."
good,"Steady work, decent pay, opportunity to advance. Good working conditions, fair management"
good,"Forced weekends, decent pay, great benefits, very tiring, almost no advancement opportunities, extremely strict safety protocol, a lot of work place drama, great supervisors, do your thing and go home."

Regional management displays understanding of the satellite facilities and shows support for all needs and challenges. Majority of co-workers were true team players who shared in knowledge and accepted team members input to make operations better for all.

Most enjoyable part of my job was the strong relationships formed with long time customers and co-workers from all over the country.
good,"Overall a good company to work for.  Good pay, benefits, car allowance, spending allowance and a fun place to work.  Management was okay, depending on your location/manager.  Lots of competition in the industry, so you really have to network and grind."

good,"Being an auditor was a favorable change of pace for me, not desiring a micro-manager above me constantly, I was free to set my own schedule and plan accordingly with little to no oversight.

good,"Muy interesante para trabajar, empresa dinamica y ,muy demandante."
good,"Working a PPG was a decent experience. Each assigned job throughout the warehouse are repetitive. However, every worker is very important to the end goal of the company. For example if one section of the warehouse puts the wrong material in the barrels it could cause serious problems with the next patch of paint. It was estimated that 7 million dollars in products leaves the facility everyday."
good,"My time at PPG has given me knowledge and organizational skills. In the lab, the work day is constantly changing depending on project prioritization.

good,"Everyone who worked there were very hard working and motivated. The hardest part is standing twelve hours. The most enjoyable part would be the workers, talking to them and learning what they have to show you. The area I was in worked very fast paced and got the job done a huge majority of the time. the only thing I would want to change is to have more breaks but it isn't the company's fault people just stopped showing up because it's hard work."

good,"The PPG Corporate Office is located in Pittsburgh, PA.  The office I worked for was is Mooresville, NC (10 people).  We worked hard, both as a team and individually, to accomplish all of our goals.  Management changed several times over the years bringing new challenges and goals to the table.  A typical day at the office for me consisted of: assisting the field sales team with requests and questions, daily upkeep of the team roster, setting up new employees, keeping the office clean, ordering office supplies as needed, setting up meetings/conference calls, keep track of office equipment needs, assisting office staff, mailings/shipments, and overall running of the office.

good,ppg was a good place to work the pay was good with flexiable hours. the supervisors where fair and treated workers with the proper respect it takes to be successful in the work place.
good,PPG acquired Spraylat Corporation in 2012 and once they came on board they took care of us better than our previous employer they compensated us they encouraged us to seek education and job training to enhance our skill sets .

good,Almost everyone is great to work with. More than fair pay. Tons of benefits. Great health care and the car deals are very good as well. Overall is great place to work at.
good,"I very much enjoyed working for PPG Industries in my position. I was laid off at the time although my sales performance ranked in the top 10 in the nation.  Sales territory was reasonably large, yet manageable.  I had automony on the job to manage my territory as it pertained to business functions specific to local markets.  My Regional Manager was more of a mentor or coach as opposed to a supervisor.  He guided me in ways to help me improve but did not force me to manage my territory in a regimented way.  The formula was certainly successful!  Compensation was good, including base salary plus quarterly bonus/commission, (if earned based on sales goals) company car, gas card, medical/dental.  Base salary was a little low, but the quarterly bonus and company car made up for it. Only 45 hours per week maximum working time.  The toughest part of the job was completing all the monthly objectives in every location in a reasonable amount of time without going over the 45 hours per week."

good,"they have prescribed times that everything needs to be done in. sets of full packages and break out packages are timed separately. full packages need to be doffed tagged and put on a truck new tubes put on and wound back in, in 2 minutes, it is possible to have 10 positions to run 30 sets (2 or 3 packages per position) of full packages in an hour AND to have break out positions in the same hour, positions that break out are allowed 6 minute handling times, this isnt including pushing out full trucks and empty ones in, and keeping your work area clean. there is a little leeway given if the set is running bad but you would sill have to be within 2.5 minutes for full and 7 minutes for breakouts.its not really easy to make these goals, BUT even tho these time maximums are in place if another worker on another crew is making better numbers than what is required, you will be talked to about it.Well i'm 52 and the other 3 shifts were working 20 - 22 year olds on the set and they were in competition with each other. Even tho my handling times were within prescribed time limits i was told i would have to meet their times or i would get a reprimand. I think this was an idle threat, so the supervisor wouldnt look bad, but uncalled for as i was doing my job properly"
good,"Great place to work, management is friendly, great co workers, hard work, but rewarding, good pay, good hours, lots of overtime offered, close to home"

good,"Great place to work , pretty relaxing ,good management ,everyone is friendly and willing to help with anything. hardest part is trying not to make any mistakes, the best part was if you made a mistake it wasn't the end of the world."
good,"This job offers many opportunities for employment, however advancement inside the company is stymied by the fact that most the position are based upon tenure with the company rather than the type of employee you are and how hard you work. This fact is the biggest downside is have with the company. I feel advancement should be a reward for the type of employee you are, not just solely based on the amount of time you have worked there. This is still a good place to work if you are motivated and a hard worker."

Compensation/benefit is on the weak side and this often led to underqualified employees ones encountered at various project within the organization.
good,PPG è una grossa multinazionale americana che da la possibilità di trovarsi in un ambiente molto dinamico e ricco di sfaccettature.
good,"Everyone worked as a team to get the production we needed. Everyone came together to meet production and over come the numbers we needed, Very hot in warehouse but they bought fans in to cool us off"

The company has great benefits  and amazing culture but management does not honor that. Both the assistant manger and manager talks down to people. Why not choose to be positive and say POSITIVE things or not say anything at all. I can understand if someone makes a mistake or error on the job and you have to correct them but talking down about someones skin tone  or how they walk has nothing to do with the job. Calling someone ""stupid"" is not professional."

It is in growth mode and if you work hard you can advance and do well.  I think PPG is a world class company and will always respect and admire how well it is run at the top levels and the great people that make PPG successful.  If I could go back I would in a minute!  Don't always think the grass is greener on the other side because it usually isn't.  When you leave a company you are basically starting over and have to build relationships and prove yourself all over to a new set of people.  Unless you are in a really bad situation don't leave and at PPG you can advance and there are lots of opportunities if you work at it internally.

good,"While at PPG, I held several different positions.  The most recent position I held was in the Training Dept., where I coordinated paint technician classes that were held in our training centers across the US and Canada.  My job was demanding, but enjoyable, and I was generally busy all day.  My department consisted of 4 women, each of us being responsible for certain pieces of the process.  The hardest part of the job for me was shipping materials to class locations in a timely manner because classes often didn't fill up until a couple of days before the date and I was forced to use overnight shipping, which was expensive and affected our bottom line.  On the other hand, if one tries to estimate how many materials might be needed and ships them further in advance, the class is either larger than the quantity of materials, or excess materials needed to be shipped back to our office, which again cost the company.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me was speaking with customers and our own site managers about various topics."
