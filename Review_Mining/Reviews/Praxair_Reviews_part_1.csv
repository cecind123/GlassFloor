rating,review
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
bad,Management only cares about certain (friends) employees.He caters to them while he pushes others to work more and more. Company takes about safety but disgardes the amount of hours of work some Coworkers work over 70hrs weekly. Management is all about the money at whatever cost. Even when there are injuries they are ignored
bad,This job had liitle room for advancement. Laid off and pay was low with minimum overtime. I did learn a lot. I got to work in multiple areas. Picked up a lot of knowledge.
bad,"Worse company I have ever worked for, I worked at there oldmixon branch based in Weston super mare. You get dragged along with the understanding you'll have a contract at the end of it but trust me you won't you are just a number and you feel it too. Honestly would rather be out of work than work there. Leave well alone for your own dignity. No respect whatsoever, never any clear messages and you get lied to and threatened with your job continuosly."
bad,Practically forced to work overtime. Manager would want employees to work 7 days a week. It's a very stressful at times. No matter what you do it seems like it's not good enough for them.
bad,"Praxair is in a great industry, but mangement at the time I was there was very much a dictatorship.  No respect for employees and there was definitely a condescending frequent feeling that came from them."
bad,"Si tu aiment te faire suivre sur la route par des superviseurs incompétents et te faire donner des suspensions et lettres disciplinaires, c’est la place. Attends toi à te faire gueuler par des clients parce que les pauvres clients manquent de produit continuellement à cause de l’incompétence accrue des gestionnaires. Ne tombe accidentellement jamais sur la glace, ça va être ta faute et tu vas recevoir une discipline sérieusement et te faire dire que tu devais regarder où tu mets les pieds. Équipements de travail qui date de la deuxième guerre mondiale pour se sauver de l’argent et ta santé et sécurité n’est aucunement respectée. Ne porte jamais une plainte aux ressources humaines, l’arrogant de petit lardon prendra jamais ta part. Le favoritisme est vraiment leurs points fort. Si tu ressembles à Harry Potter et tu est prêt à te faire tâter sans rien dire. Bon ben bonne chance.."
bad,"If u like long hours and low pay for the industry, this job is right up your alley. You do get most weekends off, but the amount of work per employee is very high. Not enough drivers even when fully staffed. 60hr work weeks are over rated."
bad,"I have worked at new castle pa plant many years an have seen a steady decline in overall work atmosphere management only cares about month end figures they are very rude to employees, upper management  has no clue what goes on an the pay scale is horrible stay away from this place"
bad,I see a lot of discrimination.pay rate is unfair.co-workers that are there less time get paid more.co-workers taking long breaks and not punching out.
bad,Big discrimination issues with this company. Majority of the time is spet freely doing nothing without any super vision. Very dysfunctional and unorganized.
bad,This company is no longer in business. It was bought by Apria. I never worked at Apria so I am unable to give a current review on Apria's work environment and culture
bad,Bad place to work they tell you what you want to hear to get you in the door but they never come true hold you in the same spot the pay is bad they give you 5 cent raise
bad,"Sales management non-existent. Poor leadership, management and values. Would not recommend a position there. Home health division sold off."
bad,Nothing great to say. Upper management has no clue regarding the day to day operations. Decisions are made with solid information.
bad,"Good company to work. Good exposure, Management is also good. Enjoyed al lot in company. Co workers are very cooperative"
bad,"poor management, employees not treated well, a union would give workers more security and leverage"
bad,A company that preaches safety but doesn't back it up. The pay is at the low end of the industry.
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
bad,"Please have some respect for yourself before you think of applying, they only care about the bottom line not the employees or their safety.  "
bad,"Not what I was told it would be, they pretty much lie to you to get you in, and then they will try to change your schedule, They'll tell you that they don't work much ot, because they believe in a work/life balance but as soon as the end of the Month gets here you can expect to be in there the whole weekend. Management has no clue what's going on and they don't care as long as you are putting out parts for their bonus, this place pays like trash for everything you do. it's under tge watch of the FAA and they pay you like you're a bag boy, this a a skilled trade job that doesn't pay like it."
bad,Poor Managementpoor training. you are screamed at by customers on every call over 8 hours a day. VERY STRESSFUL JOB. someall  days ot allowed breaks due to high call volume.
bad,"Praxair Surface Technologies does not care about their employees, they continually eliminate positions and expect other people to pick up another full-time job on top of their full-time job.  Inexperienced upper management only care about making monthly sales, regardless of what it takes.  There were years that large numbers of people were laid off and the same month the upper management would drive in their new expensive sports cars, bragging they bought the car with cash from the bonus they just received.  "
bad,"They treat the temps horribly. Management is a joke. People walk around just to find things to tattle tale on others about. The only way to last there is to show up, ignore everyone (except make sure you're always auto in) and do not point out anything that's incorrect. Even then, if a supervisor dislikes you for whatever reason, they will set you up to get fired. And the branch, they make commission off sales then don't care if the customers ever pay. And they cry and whine if collections tries to get them to do their job. And collections takes so long to get invoices to people that they over charge in finance fees. Yet, don't try to write them off or you'll get a rude email. In fact, you'll get 2 rude email a week just for doing your job and maybe a third because your supervisor is having a power trip. And don't even think about talking to HR or anyone at work about your concerns or there will be retaliation. This is a terrible place to work, especially in Iowa. And the branch employees in California are the laziest ever."
bad,Hmm let's see.
bad,"I applied to the night shift position, as I was already employed at another job, the night shift seemed ideal."
bad,They let some people move around. Even through you have the same leadership and knowledge. I feel like they dont have faith in me and trust that I can do more then they let me.
bad,The company stand for good but the people that are in charge is greedy heartless and still work with the old American attitude . The people there do not believe in New blood but if u are connected from someone inside it do not matter what u know just wing it . the company could make much more money but the drivers milk the cow slow . but the driver's make sure they get paid in full t.They.
bad,Lets just say being told not to ask questions during group meetings and management is always right was the attitude. I had a manager once call impersonating me to find out if i needed to attend a court appearance. When asked about it he said oh well.
bad,"Very stressful work environment, driver cams, microphone to listen to everything you say in the cab. Collision mitigation system that will slam on your brakes for no reason at all.  Driver cam comes on all the time to record you, even if you didn’t do anything wrong.  The company is always right and the driver is always wrong. You never have the same truck and will be slip seating unless you are a team driver."
bad,"Working here is not the best but it's a job! Management is POOR, they expect you to do so much with not much/no training and without that many people! People are quitting everyday and we are currently,  severely,  understaffed but they keep telling the customer these unrealistic numbers of what we can produce. The pay is not the best for what they expect of you to do and the work load. They also play favorites! No incentives or bonuses. It's really not worth it, if you can avoid it."
bad,"Very Stressful work, Under pressure daily, Management very disorganized, Constantly being pushed to the limit which makes for a hostile work atmosphere."
bad,Too many reps in one target market.  Very little inside support to reps.  I was the last rep to be hired (other two were very tenured) and my territory was a waste.  It could have been split between the other two reps.
bad,"40 hrs guaranteed with benefits and 401K option and comparable pay.  Uniforms with laundering and work boots as well as personal protection equipment provided (safety glasses, hard hat, gloves)."
bad,Do not recommend this organization. Highly charged political environment based on who you know and who you please. Do not approve of management and eco
bad,Terrible management in grande prairie and the one that comes from Edmonton. Spineless support exspecially if you are hired on through manpower as they do not have to follow Canadian labour laws. Do not pay bills owed to private contracts when work was done with in house approval but not edmontons.
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
bad,"I Worked at the Location In Jessup, MD. It was beyond unprofessional and not a good place to work. I've had some bad jobs but this one topped them all, It's a mad house and I would not recommend it to anyone. Everyone working there is lazy and unprofessional from the plant managers up to the Managers (Including CEO and Big time Managers). The only good thing I can say was the Compensation was decent, but it wasn't worth working there and Overnight."
bad,"I don't recommend. Close-minded management, circle-type of culture, not open to change, not open to improvement, bad inter-personal relations with other BUs, really awful"
bad,I wake up every morning and drive to my air separation plants. I take readings and complete calibrations on various transmitters and analyzers. I would complete any preventive maintenance that would need to be completed in order to keep the plant operational.
bad,"After 35 years with this company, they decided to close our plant in Columbus and move nearly 3 hours away. They left us all hanging for a year until they finally gave us a date when they were closing. If not for the union, we would have gotten no decent severance. 3 years till retirement and now I am looking for another job. They worked us on mandatory overtime for nearly two years before deciding to move. After I left, my blood pressure returned to normal. I don not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,This is a fast paced environment where u have to train yourself on over 90% of the job.  Management and decisions are made out of Edmonton or the USA which leads to no support or idea how individual locations and branches are ran.  There are no job descriptions or training manuals on any position in this company.  The culture is not ideal and is not relevant to innovation or the current market.  Overall just disorganized and unsatisfactory as an employer.
bad,Management are like children. Lots of gossip and backstabbing. Borderline hostile work envirement. Managers have no clue about the process and have no people skills
bad,"Workers not appreciated, pay is low for the job expected on a daily and not enough workers. micromanaging is horrible and not much opportunity to grow into company. No bonuses."
bad,"If you like having 2 days off a month this is the place to be. It's not all bad the vacation time is good... but at what cost?  It's greed! Management, Safety & Engineering get weekends off because there are no issues on the weekends with any of that. RIGHT! Oh and you're expected to switch shifts every 3 months! What fun to shuffle your kids and family time around. So great.. This will be your life, forget about everything else."
bad,As a company they run very lean. There are not enough employees for they job. Too many people delegating work and not enough people doing the work....
bad,Two Plant Managers in 1 year ( and no Plant Manager now) two Quality Managers and no Quality Manager now. unrealistic production goals with the amount of production people.
bad,"Overall, the work isn't bad.  I enjoy the work, as well as the employees I work beside.  The pace is grueling(usually 6 or 7 days a week of work).  For the amount of work everyone produces each week, I feel there should be more time off for everyone.  But, management is concerned about receiving their bonuses throughout the year, so the more we produce, the better their bonuses will be.  The pay is decent if you're on an off shift(2nd or 3rd), but 1st shift is where the pay drops off.  If you need a job ASAP, I would apply."
bad,This was a good position when I first got there. they changed management and it has become very unbalanced. the new manager has an authoritarian complex. and plays favorites severely. and the higher she gets the worse it becomes.
bad,"En esta empresa me toco trabajar en un contrato de 6 meses con posibilidad a empleo permanente, pero por cuestiones personales tales como el embarazo de mi esposa me vi forzado a tomar los días de incapacidad por paternidad lo cual me afecto en mi contrato y no lo renovaron, ya que al Gerente Regional de ventas de Chihuahua no le pareció que tomara mis días correspondientes como lo dice la Ley Federal de Trabajo y las políticas de esta empresa, Yo seguí los lineamientos de esta empresa para tomar estos días tales como avisar al Jefe Directo y al Departamento de RH para lo cual accedieron pero al regreso de este derecho el Jefe Regional inicio con hostigamientos y malos tratos tales como amenazas a no renovar mi contrato y que lo que hice no fue etico ni de nivel profesional."
bad,"Seems good for the first year, then you notice and feel everyone starting to back stab u and hang you out to dry, no training but lots of innapropriate mess when you mess up: staff in ptbo are all winers and not in it for the love of the clients. "
bad,"Management does not listen to its employees and us only concerned that the job gets done, even if it is unsafe for the employees or cuts corners to save costs."
bad,"-No training"
bad,"We work 8 hour swing shifts but the plant is always understaffed so there's overtime every week and you live at the place. You will never see your family and the mangers don't care. They think it's funny. Everyone here is miserable and always in a bad mood. Everyone gossips about each other and there is lots of backstabbing. There is a union that does nothing for you but take money from your check every month. The nonunion workers have better benefits and schedule and get treated better. The management knows nothing about the place and can't do your job. You get no training. But then you get yelled at, belittled, and talked about when you don't know what to do by the people the managers tell you are there to help you. But the managers couldn't step in and do your job and they should know how to. All they do is talk about people behind their backs and create conflicts between everyone. This place is like a bad high school. The managers are immature and act like children. The pay is good but everything else here is terrible. Don't get sucked in by the pay. It's not worth it. There are openings because everyone wants to leave and people are jumping ship at the first chance. This job sucks the life out of you, ruins your family life, and isn't worth it. I regret the day I took this job and left one where I was treated like an adult by good people."
bad,"working under the cameras and daily tracking devices, being exposed to chemicals and air particulates. The real safety is in the ones that you bring for yourself, they preach a good game, but when you call a time out then you're on there radar and then the write ups begin. You'll never be recognized for doing anything well and if an internal job opening comes, you'll never be considered. Just keep you head down and do the minimum and you'll make it."
bad,Went through Three different managers in 9 months.  All drivers very unhappy with job. Company doesn't treat you well lots of corporate people telling you how to do your job but they have no idea about the job.
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
bad,"If you want to have a life, don't drive for this company. They push you to go past DoT hours. They preach safety but don't actually care and if you don't do something because it's unsafe they hold it against you. It's a union shop but the steward is in with management so nothing gets fixed when problems are brought to their attention."
bad,"Poor wages, bad management and generally low moral across the whole work place. Little chance of progression in the company and wages do not match up against other aerospace companies."
bad,"untrustworthy, unreliable, poor mgt, does not follow guidlines, breaks wcb regs"
bad,"York location is ran by 2 miserable managers, who are so anti-driver that it makes everyone feel like they’re always in the wrong.you never saw HR. When their was a problem, and you try to address it, it’s always the Drivers fault! Would be such a better place to work if they would just get rid of the poor managers! And the routes are a joke! You could be a top driver with all the seniority and still be treated like a back up driver. And you can’t take vacation when you want! Unless you are the first and second dri"
bad,Praxair is a great place to make a bunch of money. very stressful and unethical managment. Stayed there for many years till i decided to make the leap without a safety net
bad,"manager hard to work for      turn over  is a lot   ( drivers, inside store)        manager did not pay me 3 overtime  hours that I work  but payed me  straight  time.  quit after that"
bad,"Horrible management.  Working here is like being in high school still, management picks and chooses who can do what they want and who can't.  The attendance policy is a joke"
bad,"Awful place to work.  Management can't see the forest through the trees.  The company refuses to invest in technology and systems so everything is patched together.  Most co-workers would have been fired at any other company.  They show up for work, but that is about it.  They do the same job they've had for years, but can't deviate or understand new methods.  Managers are not really managers - they just do what they are told.  Zero thinking outside the box.  Very much a good old boy mentality of upper management. Incredibly cheap on bonuses for exempt population, (non-exempts get nothing), but they somehow find the money to reward executives even in down times. Amazed the company makes a nickel it's so poorly run.  The company has a reputation as a revolving door in the area.  I've never seen anything like it."
bad,"good working environment, you can grow depends on your interest."
bad,"Low raises even for the best of employees. Benefits and incentives have all but disappeared over the years including profit sharing, lunches, Christmas bonuses even during soaring company profits. Corporate rules with an iron fist so local management have their hands tied. They do not care about their employees. Hard workers get worked even harder whiles the slackers get left alone. Rating and pay raises do not reflect how hard you work. Its a who you know place."
bad,Worked in the hospital/ clinic setting met many patients with all kinds of illness.  Friendly and flexible place to work.
bad,"It is a very busy work environment, that is fast-paced."
bad,Drama filled working with chemists usually started by one in particular. The management is horrible. Productivity is high. Safety is low. Compensation is low.
bad,If you love your life and your family I don’t recommend working for this company. It’s a terrible place to work and management is horrible.  Don’t even bother applying..
bad,I did not feel that anything that I did was valued with that company. They were more worried about the bottom line than the employees that were out there making things happen.
bad,pretty good new management. health insurance is ok. pay is ok. Really heavy work moving liquid containers and cylinders. first raise worked out to be 1% and health insurance went up more than my raise
bad,"the company has great benefits and good chances for advancement. A typical work day is very busy and hectic and there are a lot of things going on at once. "
bad,"Un dia de pruebas y metas por cumplir,aprendi a ser persistente,dinamico,extrovertido  si miedo ala negacion o frustacion,excelente equipo de trabajo con las herramientas adecuadas para llegar ala meta,mis colegas bien , en lo suyo ,problemas con las entregas por horario,juntas imprevistas o citas fuera de horario de trabajo,pertenecer y aprender a estar en una empresa lider en el mercado,la relacion comercial que capte asi como el conocimiento de areas nuevas de oportunidad"
bad,No room for advancement if they dont like u too much favortism certain ppl are allowed to come to work intoxicated and nothing is done about it the pay ia horrible doe the work tjst uou do
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
bad,"If you're not from a certain family or your face doesn't fit there is zero job security. "
bad,Relaxed atmosphere but way too low on the pay scale. Good stepping stone for other plants. Praxair definitely need to increase the pay for the talent. Do NOT work here if you want respect and proper compensation. McDonald's would be better.
bad,"Typical day at work consists of shipping, receiving, stocking, answering phones, taking orders, loading cylinders, serving walk-in  customers in Spanish/English, bagging dry ice for shipment, selling hardgoods"
bad,keinerlei Unterstützung bei der Durchsetzung der gestellten Aufgaben . Verhinderung bzw Blockierung der Zielsetzung durch die Mitarbeiter .
bad,Es una muy buena empresa en cuanto a prestaciones salarios muy malos y jefes de lo peor solo buscan bonos para ellos mismos esclavizando al trabajador
bad,"They do not value their employees at all, There is no appreciation. They want your loyalty to them but give none in return. Its a job but don't expect to grow your position thru hard work."
bad,Relocated to another state for this new position only to have to resign 6 months later. Work scedule was 7 days a week/on call status. I was never properly trained for the position I was hired for.
bad,"Prior to 2014 it was a great company and a good place to work.   Business was good, growth was there however the Sr Leadership staff has had its share of struggles however they struggle with internal alignment within there own staff.  The decision making process has slowed and the quality of the decision regarding growth avenues, or to effectively prioritized direction has strategy declined."
bad,Falta de profesionalismo en Gral falta de ingenieria regular
bad,"Low pay, long hours, hard work, and did I mention long hours. You will be required to work right up to your legal DOT limit. 12-14 hour days are the norm. Management is a complete joke with every possible task being put on the drivers. Mandatory weekends, because management completely makes a cluster of the work week. Layovers are a part of the job and you will be the low man in a union bond... Need I say more. I equate my 10 months there similar to a prison sentence.. 10 months of hard labor."
bad,Would be a great job if they paid right like the other plants they have our bonus wasnt right. They took away from our raise to make a little 100 dollars bonus and try to convince us that we are making more when other plants get anywhere from 250 to 350 dollars a month bonus
bad,"Praxair was a good place to work until they decided this division was not needed anymore. They treated us as cast always, having the division managed by someone from another country. This person showed no interest in the plant in Orangeburg Ny and seemed to spend dollars overseas first."
bad,"Poor management, High turnover. There was no upper management on-site and it was difficult to speak with management directly. Didn't listen to the employees."
bad,the company is a criticize only and you are watched by camera and electronic tracking device. I've driven over 1 millions accident free miles and received no recognition.
bad,"Overall the work is not all that difficult to do. They can be very good at training if you are shadowing the right employee. Where the problems arise is what is expected of you. They have mandatory overtime, sometimes resulting in a six day work week. Usually you have a minimum of a 10 hour day, although some positions work on a 12 on 12 of rotating schedule. I even had a manager one time try to convince me to give up my one and only day off for the week in order to come in and work. They claim to be a company focused on safety, and that is true, until it becomes a burden on production. For the amount of time we work, the conditions we work in and the general area of the plant, they do not compensate their employees enough, in my opinion."
bad,"Sales quotas are not unreasonable, but criteria for achievement is tricky. You can get all the accounts in the world and not get any credit if they do not meet a high dollar minimum or other criteria."
bad,"daily logs"
bad,The company shows no compassion for employees or customers. Everyone passes the buck and never follows up to ensure customers are satisfied. The culture and environment is toxic. Management is oblivious to how the company is run and rules are created and implied when and if it benefits management. I would never recommend anyone beginning a career with Praxair. One would think it was a prestigious and respectable employer to work for however a week in and you will see for yourself.
bad,"Twenty-five years behind the times. No thought for future growth. Prospect for millennials, nonexistent. Profitability and growth based on price increases and acquisitions. Field sales personnel order takers only. Upper Management ineffective, not capable of seeing the forest for the trees. Needs complete overhaul."
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
bad,"Surface finish GE Blades. The job is very easy, I enjoy the people I work with. Management is poor, a lot of favoritism, only two days off a month no ""family time""."
bad,"This company cuts people for no reason with no warning.  We were told there would be no more cuts this year, and two months later, they cut my job.  They acquired me from another company and didn't like my pay scale, here today gone tomorrow.   They don't care if you do a great job and take good care of people.  Management is all about money!.  They preach Integrity but they don't show any."
bad,"Culture is ok, management is a joke. Very immature, childish, high school like atmosphere."
bad,Very poor communication and expectations and conflicting directions. The management has little knowledge of what is actually happening in the field and so has expectations based on what they THINK is a reality.
bad,"Good pay long hrs,average shift 12-14hrs. Plan on working nights weekends for 15yrs+ as you'll have to climb the Seniority Ladder. If you don't have a family or wife or life it's a good gig benefits ok at best."
bad,"Understaffed, overworked and burnt out employees, incompetent management in constant peeing contest with each other, abudent lack of communication and no real trainers or training program. Most of the long term employees just seem to be waiting it out til retirement in a year or 2 so they don't lose there pensions."
bad,"Cut throat job.  Every man out for themselves.  Tally tell for everything.  Even when in training, the two trainers keep you with them to keep getting trainers pay.  Micro management company.  14 hours manditory work.  Use your two legs and Run, Run quick away."
bad,". Cannot balance personal and work life"
bad,"I was well supported until sales decreased for three months.  Then, there were large layoffs at the plant in Indianapolis.  Many people were laid off.  It was a short term solution and destroyed the technical abilities of the company."
bad,"I have been working in a wire room. Winding of wire into spools. Work begins with using the fork truck to bring down wire raw material from the suppliers skid and rolling the wire reel onto a pay-off of a machine. The wire is threaded through a pulley, straighteners, lube and felts. The winding process begins. The spooled wire is weighed at the end of the winding process. Boxing is done on the work bench. "
bad,Low salary across the board and insurance cost continue to rise all while upper management in only focused on making record profits.
bad,I was here for about a year and it was constant about getting chewed out for not doing something his way or getting asked to deliver stuff you didn’t have making your hazmat wrong which is highly illegal.
bad,Es buena empresa para trabajar y según tu desarrollo te pueden ir subiendo de puesto.
bad,"Enjoyed working with my coworkers operating machines the hardest part was all of the overtime no time to spend with family, had good benefits and good location"
bad,"This company continually puts pressure on to produce with very negative methods.....one of the things that bothered me terribly, was the constant vulgar language, even by upper management, in sales meetings as well as the every day life and business operations of our retail stores. Non-producers were allowed to routinely do nothing in the office daily, when they should have been outside making sales calls, promoting the company's products and services. Not a very enjoyable place to work....much favoritism shown to certain groups and individual employees.Would not recommend this employer to anyone as far as a secure place to work. Territory Manager's Commission plan very difficult to understand and make decent money."
bad,"it wasn't the worst place I worked, but there was room to improve. the hours and the workload were on the heavy side, however the work environment was fairly relaxed for the most part"
bad,"My job was enjoyable in the beginning when management seemed concerned with employee work/life balance and teamwork.  Unfortunately for me, that is no longer the case.  Lack of support and team work creates a negative workplace culture.  This is why I'm looking for other opportunities."
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
bad,"There are opportunities to excel, but management does not promote a diversity of opinions.  Culture is extremely ""old school"" and you are expected to dedicate whatever is necessary to the company.  Attitudes are rigid and if you do not conform to the ideal they like, you are dismissed"
bad,"Constant kaos , can't plan ahead driving all over the place for no reason. don't listen to employees."
bad,If you like monotony and selfish and lazy co-workers then Praxair is the place for you. The compensation is pretty good.
bad,"Good to work if you have a nice pair of boobs, and if you want to perved at, form the management side ! Worst management EVER !!!"
bad,The training was not good there was a lot of favoritism or should i say if you was not in the click kinda reminded you of high school. people was put in management that didn't know what they was doing.
bad,"Praxair in their core gas division is an amazing organization to work for. Great leadership, objective, passion, and drive. But as a non-core business, the electronics division lacks direction. Sadly under current management and circumstances, any future success has disappeared over the horizon.  "
bad,"Overall in my 7 years experience I have worked with great colleagues, managed hard working teams. It was a great company for the first 5+ years, due to the recent management changes and merger conversations the priority became the dollar value of the business which was done with poor management. There was an extreme lack of respect for employees by management and suspect business practices that was not aligned with ethical behavior I accept. I was preparing to leave Praxair but I was part of several layoffs across the business. I did leave on good terms and am eligible for rehire."
bad,"An average day at Praxair started in the office with paperwork.  We were responsible for getting corrections made to incorrect paperwork provided to us by doctors offices.  I would also maintain existing relationships with cardiologists, pulmonologists, general practitioners and hospitals in my territory, as well as working to find new clients.  Main products sold were, oxygen, cpap's, bipap's and misc. durable medical equipment. I had 4 managers in the 3 yrs I worked there, so the work environment changed many times.  From this I learned mostly, how to work with different management styles.  There was always someone to go to for help when needed though.  There are many competing companies in this market so always being in front of clients was key. I enjoyed working with the office staff at the physicians offices."
bad,Mid line management does not take responsibility for issues they create. Wok long hours with little recognition.  company is soon to be merged with another company.
bad,"Corporate America politics is worsened by its internal exposures in south america.  Over the years, a lot of SA employees were transferred to US corporate office under the name of training, but they all took the opportunity as a convenient vehicle of immigration.  They limited other US based employees career advancement opportunities as well as nurtured a sort of mafia type of corporate culture.  The management turned to blind to this trend for the sake of their strong presence in South America."
bad,"What really marked my experience in this company is the way they treat there loyal and hard working employes. "
bad,"A clicky environment with some strong personalities. If your face fits you will be alright and get an easy ride. It is a corporate company who relies heavily on the experience of a few and I think they are wrong in doing so."
bad,"Management is all bobble-heads, and does not support you on matters, and all of them are bean counters that's the bottom line for them and make cuts after cuts till they have you call them for every little thing and then if you need something to complete a job they tell you NO! so tell me how are you to work under these conditions, Plus they think you should not have a life after work, your on call 24/7 and they treat you just like number and not a person. After 37 years, there is life after Praxair. If I had to do it all over again, I think I would have taken a different job"
bad,"Great place to work, if you love high stress work place, with little or no praise for achievements."
bad,Negative work environment atmosphere where employees unable to perform their roles
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
bad,"You will work days, afternoons and midnights (rotate weekly). A feeling of jetlag all the time. Going back to school is very difficult on this shift as well as having a social life with family and friends. Union takes your money and is of little help to the worker (sad). Top management and top union officials make side deals that you may be unaware of."
bad,They turned a great job into an awful job. People can plot against you to management and turn things against you. So disappointed in this company. It really hurts me to say it.
bad,"Pay isn’t what it should be. Won’t hire new workers, so current workers do double the work. Speak safety but only care about there turn over numbers! This place when I started was a decent job. Didn’t have to be overworked. Now, they overwork the heck out of the employees. They don’t care or show interest in awarding workers when they do good. And lie out of their teeth. There is room for advancement but the company doesn’t want to give the workers the opportunity to advance."
bad,"Typical day starts at 5:30 am and ends at 5:30 pm.  I learned JDE and a multitude of other cheaply priced web based programs the company builds it's infrastructure on.  The highest management tier is completely blind to ground floor operation and what is required to provide customer service, like trust, and integrity. Workplace culture is fair for over-strain people trying to be nice to each other. The hardest part of my job was the ""more with less"" syndrome and the countless disappointments suffered by good customers at a companies greedy whims. The best part of the customer service industry are the people you meet and get to know and build relationships with."
bad,work a lot of hours 7 days a week low pay almost no advancement but good vacation time off flexible with time off for personal reason and good benefits
bad,the job is horrible the day to day is just working loading your truck but the product isn't right and you have deal with a lot of unhappy customers that has issues that you cant even help  sloved situtations  and the co workers don't really care about other folks just them selves
bad,Praxair is management heavy. Double the work with less results. Lower pay. Work life is very good. Coworkers some are very easygoing but most are judgement if you do not fall into the click.
bad,"travail sous pression "
bad,"tres encouragent comme environnement de travail,jouvial et tres familialle"
bad,Upper management expects more from you with less resources. Get used to it or find a different job. Heath benefits get worse and more expensive every year. Some good people work here which makes it tough to see how morale continues to worsen.
bad,This company is a family owned business and no room for career advancement.. The work is very repetitive no room for errors or change
bad,fair job if you like doing the same thing every day for life. Physical labor required thru out. Dirty enviorment
bad,Work is fine as long as you suck up and don't contradict management.
bad,"Don't expect much. Profit comes first, employees and customers come last. Way behind the curve on tech, only recently upgraded to Outlook. Management was a joke, openly black listing folks from promotion or job opportunities. HR was a joke. Benifits weren't great and they cut them back when I was there. Your coworkers are good though, even though they refuse to leave."
bad,Got to work 8-5 mon through friday. they werent necassarily excited for overt time hours. Getting to converse with people and get to know the customers was the best part.
bad,"Praxair is a good company but they refuse to pay what the job is worth.  They make promises of raises but always find reasons as to why no one get them, (Praxair Economy)."
bad,"Position is very fast paced and does not require a college degree. Reviews about the nepotism within Logistics department are very much true and MGT has a hand on when planners can leave logistics for other departments...after the 2 year position minimum. Found that the job was very empowering but also very stressful. Would not recommend position if you are young and would like to ascend the corporate ladder within Praxair because there is very little growth from Logistics. Benefits are alright but not industry leading and pay is very good for people who do not have a college degree. On the plus side you have opportunity to pay for additional time off to have a total of 4 weeks vacation first year. Due to industry there is a rotating schedule and 3 shifts. Would work for this company again but not within logistics, because of the nature of work, schedule and very little opportunity for growth from department."
bad,"This job was very interesting.  I handled day to day operations consisting of audits of cylinders, merchandise, safety procedures.  The other most important thing was the culture based company, that consisted entirely around safety.  This job never felt complicated, because it was challenging and enjoyable.  The most enjoyable part of the job was customer service, and interaction with the public as well as employees."
bad,"What can I say. It was a tough job to do. Sometimes working for a huge company is not a plus. All the Billions of dollars this company makes,and it was like pulling teeth to 20/Hr. and they were always complaining our overtime but still wanted all stops to be done."
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
bad,"I have worked for the company for 5 years. As the time goes by, benefits get more expensive and coverage declines. Review and raise system is in need of repair. Veteran employees receive very little pay increases every year while newer employees get higher increases. We get very little time off. We are lucky to get 2-3 days off a month. Management could care less how much we work because they don't have to work weekends. They just sit back and collect bonuses for all the work we get done and we get absolutely nothing in return. Company does NOT take care of its employees."
bad,"My experience was that my Supervisor had just been promoted to her position and was trying to learn her new responsibilites. She had no time to train me and I was therefore pushed off on a ""temp"" who had been w/the company for a while, but she did not want to dedicate the time it would really take to walk a new person through the intricate details of the job. it would've caused her to get behind in her work, so I was taught a little then left swinging in the wind when the boss would ask me about something she thought I should know and it would be something I hadn't been taught or ever mentioned to me. The knowledge one needed of Medicare criteria alone was staggering. The environment was downright hostile!  I was overwhelmed from week one and tried to muddle my way through for 7 months then finally quit!"
bad,"Plant manager and his side kick were never at work. The technology was way behind the times. There is no capital investment in this place. When they do invest it, the project is worthless and usually directed from corporate 700 miles away. Do not count on the bonuses they offer."
bad,"Praxair use to be a great company but over the years they have cut all perks and cut staff so much that its constantly too much for one person to do but you have to do it anyway. no one helps each other, its everyone for themselves. local management is really good, hands get tied by head office on how to run the branch. work is days monday to friday, start time is pretty flexible if you need it to be. Most people are good to get along with, but there is some that make working there as miserable as it can be, always complaining and not getting the work done, or undoing the work you did because they don't want you to make them look bad."
bad,I was let go the day before I was completely unionized. The job I was hired for had a grumpy old man and his brother running the shop floor and litteraly did anything in his power to sabotage people. I had moved around and done numerous other jobs in the place yet still was thrown under the bus. This place is a joke and the management is a mess. The shop has very out-dated equipment and zero training.
bad,Unorginized no leadership they figure out things as they go and it takes them about three and some times four times before they figure it out and spend a lot of money wasted to figure out the smallest problems
bad,The local office i worked in was filled with great people. It was a sales position.
bad,"Due to mismanaging everything, this company went belly up and was bought out by another horrible home healthcare company."
bad,Be prepared to never spend time at home anymore.........figure it out on your own... little to no training offered. Will make you feel like you are family and then cut bait and latch up to a new ship so darn fast. Horrible health insurance with only high deductible plans offered. Unfair reviews.
bad,They preach safety first...but that's only as long as it doesn't effect the profit margins they have practices in place that are not policy and if you violate these practices you are thrown under the bus
bad,Es una buena empresa solo que contratan a mucho personal por medio de otra empresa para evadir las prestaciones lo cual le quita lo interesante..
bad,"A typical work day is very fast work on a coating line, and working with a helpful time assembly air plane parts together, the hardest part of my job was we received one day off a month."
good,"I would say Thanks to Big Mike W. He took a chance and trained me and gave me a chance to prove myself."
good,"Hardest part of this job was the lack of support from supervisors. The deception that they give you on a daily basis. "
good,they keep employees to a two man/woman store. Lots of problems because the software is out of date. Customers are constantly upset. No commission in an extremely sales driven environment.
good,they just as easily hire someone new than worry about making your quality of life easier. They only care about profits and are losing employees to the competitors
good,Typical day of fielding 40 phone calls and dealing with the fact that most people can't and wont perform their job functions and having to accept that management will not do anything about it. Any accusations brought against you are taken as fact. It was hard dealing with all the personalities. Most enjoyable was the flexibility of my schedule.
good,"Fun is dream , if dream comes true means fun comes into ASU field , no gigs only married uncles , frustated life style which leads to lazy ness,"
good,"Praxair as a company, as a whole, is a good company to work for. The culture at PST is not as good. Lots of rushing to get things done with less care about methods or consistency of product. Lots of concern for safety of the employees, which is very good. Less concern about their workforce or quality. The company can't and won't offer competitive pay rates to bring the workforce to aerospace standards."
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
good,"No work at beginning of month then expected to work 27/7 last week of month.Shifts are 6 till 2 and 2 till 10 with early finish on Friday."
good,"Eight to Five, limited access due to a hosted configuration.  Management sold me on some points which did not transpire."
good,Ritmi stressanti  paga medio bassa richiesta continua ore straordinari ambiente lavoro arretrato con molto poca nuova tecnologia  dopo colloquio molto cordiale pretendono molto e sono poco disponibili per miglioramenti lavorativi
good,First off benefits are absolute garbage for as large of a company as praxair. Management typically doesn’t have a clue on how to run or operate most operations. There is such a wide variety of jobs which allows movement within the company if you get bored. Starting pay is typically garbage but plenty of options to increase your pay.
good,Management has become more focused on bottom line vs customer relationships. More short term vs long term focus. Also have been aging out and moving to younger employees. Benefit package not on par with other more progressive companies.
good,"it was just a place to work not a career"
good,Bachelors can do work here ig they stretch them to an optimum level.You need to work hard for the sucess and also need good relation with the line management.
good,"Industrial production facility, producing and distributing compressed gases to North Texas."
good,money is good.. keeps you away from home 75% of the time. every worker is just another pawn on a chess board. Very decent starter job but expect nothing more than a good paycheck
good,"Mildly toxic due to management not involving ALL employees in adequate process training and indulging in favoritism."
good,"Was great working place, great people. Doing the work have customers there orders on tine was a wonderful feeling. I also enjoyed running the machines  with the plasma torch"
good,"Management at the Paris location is not where it needs to be. Coworkers are great, however those working under management are not treated fairly or with respect. Could certainly see the company location being more productive with a change in management, as things do not get done as efficiently as they can."
good,"The change in management was very stressful.  It was a difficult environment to work in.  The hardest part of the job was the drive to and from work. and also, the changes in management constantly.  The management not knowing what the department did."
good,I work minimal  63 hrs a week very tired dont get to see my family that much we told them we need more people but they refused to give us some one to help us so
good,Personnel at the technician/supervisory level were great to work with.  Upper management were very bad with micromanagement.  Not well diversed company in the southern areas.
good,"Praxair, Inc. offers many challenges to any professional, The employees on the business side tend to have an intolerant view of the IT department and Praxair's decision to move the Help Desk to offshore has raised other issues. The upcoming Merger with Linde products (Of Germany) has raised some concerns but overall it is a rewarding and unique work experience."
good,"It was just a temp position but I had a great experience with all of the employees.  The salary, was not too bad considering the recruiting agency takes a percentage of your hourly wage. During the winter is was a terrible commute due to the flooding and the roads have lots of pot holes."
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
good,"I have, with some managers, to explore various aspects of many projects that allowed me to obtain deeper understanding of the subject processes.  While working in the R&D center, I was able to assist a multitude of individual projects and earned an excellent reputation."
good,"Multinacional com foco voltado exclusivo a área técnica apresentado poucas opções para crescimento na área administrativa."
good,"I loved the daily duties I had to do. I also loved fix things & work on quality.  I also worked really hard to get my daily numbers up & I did meet quantity standards quite often, but the manager only focused on the days I didn't. I also didn't get monthly reviews & when I finally did I got 3 or 4 months worth at once.  Never once did anyone come to me when they found an error I made, so they could show me & help me fix the error or keep from making another error.  There was not consistency or structure with the team or the rules or procedure changes that the supervisor tried to put into place.  I have worked with much better supervisors."
good,Overall a good company to work for. Safety is preached upon and is mostly enforced as needed. The pay scale is low for this area even for gas plants. They took away bonus system to lower level employees.
good,Praxair is a good company to gain experience in the Industrial Gas production industry. 
good,"Praxair pays drivers competitively, but they promise advancements and other perks but back out when it comes down to actually doing them."
good,Good place if you are a salesperson.  Technical experts are not treated well.  I was in a technical role and then was moved into sales.  The goal for the sales area in which I was place was 100x greater than the current market.
good,"The hardest parts of the job:"
good,Hired for one thing. And they have me doing something else since I got hired I ask what's going on and management can't give a answer. Very  unorganised and play games.
good,Great job if you dont get injured on the job. If you dont go back to work in 6 months after an injury you'll be fired. Which happened to me. You'll put on alot of hours driving and delivering hazmat gases. Management was changing constantly.
good,Worked there for one year. First job out of college. Was not that bad. Didn’t have a lot of direction.  This was the beginning of my safety career. I found a tank outside that was leaking gas. Reported to the manager. I enjoyed this job.
good,Working at Praxair was a learning experience for many reasons. It is a great plant to start at and use as a stepping stone. The annual merit raise program is arbitrary and unfair.
good,"Work life/home balance is an area of opportunity for Praxair.  Overall management is very knowledgeable about product and taking care of customer needs. "
good,"Praxair is committed to safety of its employees and to customer satisfaction, however does not hold very high regard for employee workload. A typical work week consists of Monday-Saturday with every other Sunday off, which does not make for a very good work-life balance."
good,The typical work day would consist of meetings with fellow technicians via FaceTime . Review our work orders and wrap up any paperwork . If we didn't have work orders then we would go to our customer sites and do annual inspections.
good,"Okay place, many staff are burnt out from lack of staff, employee turn around, there is always a problem and reason to work short staff. Many instances where they had time and warning to hire/train another employee."
good,its a place where everything can change tomorrow.  No set policies and culture in place.  Low paid and over worked.  Very high turn over.  ok for starters but no good in the long run
good,"To remain competitive Praxair tries to hire the best for the lowest pay possible, which doesn't work out well. The average new hire stays around 3 to 5 years, obtaining their skills to be applied at other companies which offer better pay, vacation, and / or benefits.  Operators are required to be on-call or standby on their off time without pay. Vacation time is limited to only certain months. There is little opportunity for advancement.  Frequent schedule changes and/or shift changes are common. Local mgmt often has it's hands tied by offsite mgmt or mgmt out of New York."
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
good,Over 50% travel required. Large territories. Long term contracting required. I learned something new everyday. The worst part of the job was being away from home.
good,Me ha brindado crecimiento profesional y preparación para afrontar nuevos retos
good,"This is the perfect environment to work in as a young engineer. The exposure is amazing. However, it is extremely demanding. That is why they do a great job of compensating their employees."
good,"Resent changes in how we get paid puts a strain on family life, and time off. The local management is decent put has their hands tied when it comes the things that matter."
good,"Si bien Praxair Argentina es una empresa multinacional, líder en el mercado de gases especiales y medicinales, hoy por hoy no cuenta con incentivos para sus empleados en capacitaciones, promoción a otros puestos, jefes que les cuesta ser lideres, faltos de tecnología y recursos en la parte administrativa y comunicación. Fue un desafió para mi entrar en una empresa de renombre ya que siempre trabaje en pymes. Aprendí a manejar un gran volumen de información y presión, con un amable ambiente laboral entre compañeros y fuerte presencia sindical"
good,A lean approach to employement regarding the philosiphy of hiring tems and a high rate of turn over.  Services provided were needed and essential but staff lacked leadership
good,"Good work environment, therefore it made coming to work enjoyable. Challenging at times, which helped a lot with furthering problem solving skills. Co-workers and the management were understanding and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I was able to help others and see the big smiles on their family members faces when they received beds, wheelchairs, commodes et cetera. However, lack of man power has been an issue."
good,"Good experience on gases specially on hazardous gases, which gave awareness to work in dangerous zones with selection of specific tools for specific area."
good,"Typical day includes processing W-4 and State forms and direct deposits for employee's. Calculating adjustments to pay."
good,"I have acquired an inside knowledge of above and beyond costumer service skills. I also learned many industry related skills such as msds, osha compliance, confined space entry and gas and chemical segregation. Although Praxair is a large company and industry leader, it has limited growth and therefore not the company for me to make a career to retire from."
good,Not much to say other than not really a good company to work for. They say one thing but end up doing something else.
good,"While Praxair is a solid company, and very reputable in this industry, they have shifted their mentality in a very short amount of time from ""good employees provide good work with good results for the customers"" to the idea that ""we can lead the industry by being in the middle of the pack so long as profits stay high"". The company amazingly makes record profits routinely, and they do so with one of the surprisingly safest records in the industry, considering the amount of employee turnover they have. Yet with all that cash rolling in, employees have difficulties in procuring basic items like printer paper and chairs. Management from the top down emphasizes the most useless things in an attempt to catch up with all the other corporate jargon and junk that other companies provide. Middle level management is terrified of losing their jobs, scared to make any kind of meaningful decision, and most are only focused on how to get promoted, not on how to make Praxair the best company it can be. That being said, I appreciate the opportunity to work there, as this is a great company with good benefits and pay for people with the right skills. Unfortunately, this company finds people with the right skills, and then either uses them mercilessly until they quit or forces them to leave because they find these people to not be ""team players"". The hardest part of your job here is not the day to day grind, which is actually quite easy for most competent employees; it is the constant search every day for the ""company line"" just so you know where to put your toes before they get chopped off as"
good,There was significant management changeover at the location and in all ranks within Manufacturing and HR.  The culture has now changed and I do not know how the plant would be to work at today.
good,"The company is very safety driven, holds each employee accountable for their own tasks and responsibilities. Management in specific departments could use some help"
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
good,"Praxair is a decent company to work for but like all businesses it has flaws.The benefits Praxair offers are good, but the work life balance is very challenging."
good,For the most part enjoyed working there but didn't feel they treated their long term employees fairly.  Was laid off after 18 yrs and told could come back as an entry level employee.
good,Job duties were rather segregated/streamlined - you put your time in got your work done & offered assistance where needed. Expanded my knowledge in Excel and Access once the opportunity was presented. Workplace culture was good people were friendly!
good,"Es buena en la cacpacitacion dentro de la empresa,"
good,"Not a bad place to work but they treat their workers like numbers not like people. You are just a means to an end, no one want to do their jobs. If you want something done, you have to do it yourself, took weeks for management to get a part in so we can do our job."
good,Good company but very cut-throat/corporate. No feeling of a family culture. Very fake people.. Interesting products that cover a big market segment and because of that good industry to be in long term.
good,Safety culture get it done but quit as possible hardest part of job is the added stress placed on driver day to day the enjoyable part is the self acomplishment of being able to finish and return home safe
good,"Good work/life balance.  Not much opportunity for advancement, everyone's been there for 20+ years.  Low turnover until Sales dip...3rd round of layoffs in 4 years."
good,Its ok place to work.  Super secret on pay structure.  Pay is to dependent on the supervisor and no reasonable explanation of how the pay band is structured
good,"Ambiente creado para el desarrollo de aplicaciones técnicas, existió la posibilidad de implementar nuevas áreas de negocio como el retail."
good,"a good company , but less salary and work load is high"
good,I learned different duties at each location I had not worked as an administrative assistant before and I learned different duties example auditing cylinders that were used to deliver to customers and customers that came to the store as well.
good,learn safety first. good working condition. the most enjoyable part of the job was the co workers. learn a lot about aircraft engine parts machining.
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, mas o salário não é compatível com todas as competências que o profissional tem que ter"
good,"Actively seeking employment in a position that requires dedication, challenge and will also utilize my education, experience and skills and Planning, Procurement, Materials Management and Vendor Management in a Manufacturing industry to benefit the organization & self development."
good,"Hourly pay only apply when ur not driving! Miles are a hit n miss, pending on customers need. While under staff u will get the miles n maybe hrs but it’s not consistent nor even guaranteed that what’s been given won’t change within the time u make it to work. Dispatch changes routes 24/7 base on customer needs. Management will tell u anything..... to get u in the door. Great co-workers but need more then great that"
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
good,"Difficult to advance, unless you have family higher up, or you are one of the ""clique"" people. Good, intelligent, solid, and independent workers (and thinkers) are not looked upon as the asset that they should be considered."
good,"The dispatchers are clueless and will try to force you to do tours you dont have time for. Going union was a terrible thing to do but the older guys here are afraid of change so they brought in a organization to hide behind, there's also about 4 or 5 drivers that still have jobs here because of the union, not because they did anything wrong and the union fought for their jobs but because they're lazy and cant do their jobs correctly The Curtis bay plant has a clueless distribution supervisor who doesn't know what he is doing the majority of the time, definitely a real ""yes man"". He tells guys they'll make 85k+ to get them in the door but won't tell them that they have to be in the drivers seat 70 hours a week to get it."
good,Alot of favoritism going seems like only the poeple they want to move do so regardless of how much other people have worked harder for it..they (managment at all levels) praise the lazy and punish the hard worker...lack of communication..
good,Leader in their industry but touch marketplace and pricing is too high compared to competitiion.   Competsation is very hard to achive.  Benefits are good and work life balance is good.
good,"The job its self isn't bad ya learn a lot an get good experience with it being a small plant. The management is pretty good an co workers are good to work with. The job is very under paid due to staffing,work load and running 2 units an working the outside job for the amount of wages an pay pregression"
good,"Your dispatch was multiple stops and for 14 hours a day. Tractors have camaras with audio so you have no privacy. Vacation time was only granted on a Monday - Friday basis, which only the top 3 to 5 drivers held. All the rest of the drivers worked weekends and you would have to work no matter what. You work a rotation schedule which is usually a night shift. The drivers where the best to work with and very helpful."
good,The training for the job duties can get better. Not all employees are friendly or social and they don't have good communication between employees. Over all theyake me feel like I didn't belong there.
good,"A great job at first,  corporate creep and micro management have ruined one of the best jobs, places to work. Very unfortunate as I like most of the people I work with and do enjoy the actual work."
good,"Overall the company is a good place to work. Certain departments are great to work for, others are a challenge. The positive is there is a lot of opportunity to grow as this is a large company."
good,"Had many opportunities for advancement.  Opportunity to learn many aspects of business if you are motivated.  Manager level positions especially in engineering have been too stagnant (same people and ideas are stale and effecting worker productivity), which in my opinion, made it a less enjoyable place to work at last couple years.  People in eng management positions that shouldn't be as well."
good,"worked there 21 years was terminated over drivecam (arbitration in process)7 to ten years ago company started changing policies are more important than safety and all new managers are puppets for the company.benefits have gone to trash money is decent but out of 22 people at my facility in fla,15 hate the job that should tell you what you need to know about praxair"
good,"Lots of politics, it can help or break you! You have to look deeply into growth opportunities if you are young professional."
good,"My Designation is Technical Support Engineer."
good,"I enjoyed the work, something different every day."
good,Praxair is a great company as a whole. Working as a remote plant operator has pros and cons. Be aware of what you are getting into. Ask about the work-life balance and the on-call demands. They can be quite overwhelming at times.
good,Work life balance is not good.  Logistics required to start on second or third shirt.  Logistics Position is said to be entry level but then once in that position its hard to get our and there will be several times where logistics associates are unable to leave the position because they are always short staffed
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
good,"Very political from medium management level and up."
good,"Creo que Praxair es una empresa de origen muy buena, pero que debería monitorear más profundamente el traslado de todas sus buenas  intenciones  y costumbres a  Sudamérica para que toda la empresa sea globalmente sustentable en le tiempo."
good,"Get trucks out in morning, do safety meetings, plan for the production personal. Order the product from other locations. Route trucks in the afternoon."
good,"Customer contact, delivery reports and sales forecast, daily. Management only interested in sales, to achieve target on a monthly basis, Hardest part of the job is not know when parts will be delivered and predicting a sales forecast. Most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction, delivering parts on time and with good quality."
good,Very selective in identifying and working on projects. Great cross functional teams. Senior management sets examples in managing resources.
good,Was a good place to work.  Learned many things and contributed very much to selling our products.
good,"•	Plan, direct, or coordinate all administrative supportive services."
good,"Time is flexible based on your manager. While there is always the potential to get a micro-manager, clock-watching is not the norm. You end up working more than your fair share of hours anyway."
good,I have learnt many things how to monitoring when gas is passing from one plant to an other through the help of computer software.
good,"Es una empresa que se ubica en la franja media, no es la mejor, no es la peor."
good,Company is focus on sales and growth.  Need to have skills in Territory Management.  Contract  Negotiations is definitely a plus.  Company vehicle provided.
good,"It's a nice place, but if your wanting to make an actual difference in what your designing....keep looking.  The benefits are good as the company is so large, but the time I actually spent using my own knowledge and capabilities was very minimum."
good,working with this company was an good experience. individuals have the chance to become apart of a team. Also  will get to learn new and different processes.
good,"I like the job itself,  we rotate jobs daily so you don’t get bored.  We are constantly learning something new.  We are only scheduled 14 days out the month, so while the hourly pay is good it doesn’t cover my monthly expenses at home. Many people there are working two jobs.  Management seems to be unorganized and are so focused on the customer they don’t know what’s going on with the employees."
good,De lo mejor en el ambiente laboral y con los compañeros
good,"Una gran empresa con pocas oportunidades para crecer profesionalmente, solo un porcentaje mínimo lo hace, creo que necesitan voltear a la plantilla que tienen en vez de contratar a externos para los puestos clave"
good,"It was a good learning experience. the job culture can be a bit skewered. If you weren't ""in"" the group, was treated like an outcast. Job favors those who are a part of the group."
good,Procedimentos diários rotineiros. Empresa que preza muito pela segurança.
good,Management is somewhat of a clique protecting a few managers of low skill level. I believe the company was working hard to improve quality of mid level managers. For me an interesting experience working with many different outside companies.
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
good,This is a decent company to work for. The employees are friendly and willing to help each other. Some room for advancement. Challenging but repetitive tasks.
good,"It is a 24/7 365 operation.  They provide uniforms, PPE training. Medical, Dental, vision, legal, short term disability and Long term disability, 401K with company match up to 5%."
good,It was a long commute to work but the day went by fast. The management was good.  Good co-workers.  Bay area routes were a little rough on days.  Good place to work for.
good,"Praxair Surface Technologies is a subsidiary or Linde PLC. "
good,"My employment at Praxair spanned almost 8 years. I worked in a couple different departments, in a couple different business units within the company. If you work in any kind of support role i.e. Logistics, Customer Service, IT etc. You will be under enormous pressure to produce and work under pressure. Management will indiscriminately increase workload and responsibilities on you. There is a ton of turnover in the logistics group. Generally, logistics is where many employees start there careers at Praxair. The company is VERY top heavy. I felt like I was in the movie "" Office Space"", due to having 5 different managers of different levels telling me what I need to be doing. Most of Management is incorrigible, and some are on power trips. Upper management get bonuses and profit sharing. If you're an engineer or scientist, you are treated much better than most other types of employees, They are essentially catered to. Pay is good and competitive throughout the company. Benefits are mediocre to subpar. They have a pension and 401k. In summary, it's not a terrible place to work, and it's not the best place, either. If you want to make pretty good money, and don't mind dealing with a good amount of various forms of detritus day to day, then Praxair may be for you."
good,It’s an ok job and I’ve made many friends. I feel I have more knowledge than most of the management so it gets frustrating. Because you handle a lot of hazardous materials there is lots of training
good,I am not willing to review any company that I work/have worked for.  I find both reading and submitting reviews to be a waste of time as I never know who is telling the truth.
good,working 12 hour shifts goes by quickly because once you are qualified you are the only operator on shift.  There are maintenance and management members on plant during the day but night shifts are only the operator.
good,"Casual work environment but very stressful, a lot of office clicks, and pressure to turn out high volume with little regard to quality."
good,Seems that positions are capped no room to grown unless you move to a different group. The plus is having the opportunity to travel and learn the process.
good,"Una buena empresa pero descuida al personal, exigen muchas horas de trabajo"
good,"Go to work"
good,"Standard schedule and paid time off are nice along with plenty of holidays. Pretty easy work just repetitive, very strict as far as standards which is good to a degree but it does get in the way when you're short handed"
good,"Lack of suffocate local support to complete all daily duties,  Daily need to balance sales counter support and management duties led to a stressful work environment."
good,"Great team at Praxair, company really takes safety seriously; some of the people are concerned about the upcoming merger; there probably will be cuts for redundant positions."
good,They find every way to reduce commission payout and assign accounts with AR issues without notifying the sales people which is negative on commission.
good,"the company does not like to pay there employee there very slow at solving problems as of Jan 12 i have been working for two city delivery drivers while other out on injury Praxair moto would be just keep doing more work. culture is everyone seems not happy they keep taking stuff away like 20 year bonus, 6 week holiday, banked time no incentives to work for the company"
good,Some locations are remote so you may be a long way from civilization.  You would be working alone sometimes and that can be stressful for some people.
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
good,"Being in logistics this was very fast paced, you hard to learn on the go and be able to find a solution on the spot. Managers were rarely available being on second shift and the training was very short lived."
good,Too much cursing going on in the meetings.  Not respectable to workers and others.  Minimal information and a lot of redo because they shot from the hip a lot and tried to skirt standard industry practice.
good,En la empresa existe buen ambiente laboral y mucho trabajo en equipo.
good,"Requires a lot of time and data entry, not enough support personnel.  Very low morale around much of company. Many dissatisfied, much turnover.  Management not adequately involved in these needs."
good,Lo mas dificil es la mala comunicacion. capacitacion negada a los empleados.
good,una empresa q tienes q sacar lo mejor de ti mismo para q solo te llamen 3 meses al año.

good,It was a good company to work for I gained a lot of expierence in different fields while working there.................................................
good,If I would of gotten to work for this company longer I'm sure it would of been a good company to work for.  They bought out Mittler Supply which is where I was working.
good,The overall company is a great place but the healthcare division was eliminated - would work for them again as they do value their employees.  Culture is good.
good,They focus more on money then they do on customer service. Pay is low for the job and not very good benefits. Atmosphere is very poor for their employees.
good,It is a fast pace work environment with good benefits.  The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I was able to help someone or some company improve their quality of life.  I enjoy working with my co-workers and they are mostly willing to lend a helping hand.  The hardest part of my job is my workload however I am accustomed to the fast paced work environment.
good,"This company gave me a good start in this field. Everyday was a good day to learn about production. While at the facility in Roseville, the staff and management was very nice and a good mixture of personalities. My job wasn't hard at either the Pittsburg plant nor Roseville, I looked to changes jobs because management was going through lots of difficult changes-it became unstable."
good,"Buena experiencia, buena relacion con los trabajadores y con el establecimiento en general."
good,"Nice people to work with, management is understanding to work/personnel issue. A person needs to have to good eye for detail when making labels for cylinders. The hardest part of the day is making sure which cylinder get certain paperwork."

good,"Praxair brought in new hires from across the country, as they needed to fill  ELD Field Technician positions across the country. Two weeks into training, they let everyone go, saying the business has changed. That was it."
good,"sehr abwechslungsreicher Job, kaum Weiterbildungsmöglichkeiten, gute Bezahlung, nette hilfsbereite Kollegen. Lange Einarbeitungszeit erforderlich."
good,"Wonderful Experience.  Very knowledgeable atmosphere.  What more does Indeed need me to say to just get past this point.  It was great, wonderful, and stupendous."
good,The reason for the 3 star rating is leadership....Too many people in the office within 3 to 1 year of retirement just trying to lay low and not try get involved with any projects they don't have to.

good,Solid company with tons of resources.  Views capital investment more important than people investment.
good,"Productive and fun workplace"
good,"Lean work enviroment"
good,"A typical day starts at 6am. Since the plant operates three shifts, sometimes you walk in and it can be hectic or it can be quiet, it all depends if the lab tech on the night shift was able to keep up with the work. I can go in and start processing cylinders with gas or analyzing batches for purity or composition. Sometimes I start the day with data entry and acms work orders. Management is very safety conscious and we hold training almost every week. The hardest part of the job is that orders for specialized mixes come in on a daily basis almost hourly and it's a difficult task to keep up with but we do. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I make an effort to learn something new every day."
good,"Fill high pressure 2, 3 and 4 component mixtures to specified orders for each customer. Responsible to evaluate the cylinders, ensure they are suitable for filling. Once completion of the filling, correctly roll cylinders to mix gases, then complete the process by submitting the cylinders, along with proper documentation to the lab for analysis. Overall quality passing rate of cylinders is 90%."

good,"Management was nice but never around (I got hired at the time of managerial change)  "
good,"Long days, great people in the plant, company is great to work for and the healthcare they provide is great. Plant is a bit on the young side as far as personal."
good,"long time ago, but fun. Good field personnel to work with. Had a great and productive time overseas and also loved working out of Buffalo, NY. But not in the winter time."
good,"Praxair is a decent company to work for but like all businesses it has flaws. The work force within Praxair is aging which helps the younger generation move up. The benefits Praxair offers are wonderful, but the work life balance is hard. Branch Managers can expect 50+ hours a week and still be behind. Upper management stalls and does not make decisions even close to quickly."
good,"having everyone there to do the jobs, always learning something nwe are different every day, Management needed to communicate better so that you wouldn't have to do there job for them. the culture was all walks of life people all seems to get along good, the hardest is understanding what the management was wanting to do for each shift on all 3 shift, Knowing that your shift did a great job every day, going home with out any complaints on your shift ,"
good,The General Manager is excellent.  I have learned a lot about creating a unique product through this industry and for that I am grateful.  I have been able to grow professionally under knowledgeable leaders.
good,Great job and pay after 17 years. Good benefit package. Insurance  is average. Management could be a lot better caring for fill room staff. Hours are great. Weekends off.
good,"I loved most of the people I worked with. There were a lot of dedicated hard working people committed to excellence at the company. After 2009 things changed and a serious policy of micromanagement started but never ended. Most jobs, especially management, were piled on with responsibilities. While the benefits were great, there was not a policy of flexible scheduling. Most managers had multiple sites possible hours apart and very little staff or support. I eventually chose my family and life over medium pay for maximum effort. Also... although they say otherwise, they are not a diversity minded company. At least not in the field"
good,Praxair is a company filled with very talented people.  It provides individuals with the opportunity to create value and impact the business in a positive fashion.

good,Typical day at Praxair consisted of inspecting incoming and outing material. Learned a lot about the aerospace industry. Management treats workers fair. Although expecting much from under staff workers. Workplace culture is pretty fast paced. Hardest part of the job was balancing work hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing the work I did was important to the aerospace industry.
good,Good working environment but stressful. Some travel involved. Very fast pace but good help from coworkers when needed. The manager during my time there was demoted for not being cut throat with his subordinates.
good,"Delivery of CO2 to hospitals and other facilities. "
good,"El área para la que laboré, área de negocios NITROPET, servicios a la industria petrolera con la comercialización de nitrógeno líquido. Trabajo de campo 100%."
good,Praxair is a company that I was fortunate enough to work for for many years. I had the opportunity to meet and work with people from various cultural and academic backgrounds and learn from them.
good,Praxair is a good place to work for. Work home balance is can be difficult as some positions are 24/7 operations. You must maintain a good relationship with management in order to excel.
good,Praxair is a very large welding supply company who pays well and has good benefits but I don't like the hours and the management doesn't communicate very well with the employees. Work from 5:30 a.m. until route is finish and really with the winter months it is very physical to move cylinders in ice and snow. I enjoy and get along very well with my co-workers
good,Overall good company to work for.  Did not agree on some of managements decision making.
good,"Buen sueldo."
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "

good,Hard to advance on your work alone. Seems less you put in further you will advance.Invested almost 5 yrs in company dont see options for advancement currently
good,"The job itself includes forming a daily trucking plan based on customer inventory levels. This is a fast paced job and the day goes by quickly. There is constant phone calls and changes being made to the plan. The actual job is challenging and interesting. The management culture is not ok. There is severe nepotism in this department. If you have no relation to anyone and/or no close relationships with anyone in upper management do not expect to move up, even if highly skilled, good reviews, etc."
good,Good company any poor management salary above the basic dirt work..  And target can be unreallistic quite often.  Shifts changed at managers descesion
good,"As long as you are willing to dedicate your personal life to the job and give them your weekends, vacations and your time off.

good,"Starting at Praxair was initially great. The pay to start for a 18 year old was great for most but as a mother and wife was not enough unless you worked overtime, which in EVPVD I rarely got more than 2 days off a month. Work VS Life balance was hard. The management was horrible. After verbally and written concerns of a particular employee clearly not working which in return was effecting our progress in work each day they thought it was a good idea to call me into the office with said employee which in return made that employee mad.  This employee proceeded to get in face and threaten me with no repercussions. After this and many other problems I decided to leave. They have decent pay and had plenty of ways to work up in the company, great benefits as well but if you are a talkative person and don't like working alone I would not recommend this job for you."
good,It was great to see the amount of work that we did daily. It always seemed to be new and exciting. My coworkers are helpful and good at communicating.
good,"A typical day:  Working on the manufacturing would be a typical day, working with older technologies in the aerospace industry."

good,Work schedule has driven me away along with poor management.  I really like what I do and have learned a lot in my time here.  The hiring in the last 3-4 years for maintenance technicians has been terrible.  Enforcement of company policy has been poor and management has not followed up on some of the policies that are in place.

good,A lot of push to grow the business which means a lot of work for employees.  Downsizing and increased growth means people wear multiple hats yet carry the same if not more workload than before.

good,Part time employee for the past 7 years. Work as a security guard. This is a perfect part time job for some extra money. People are fun to work with and out side activities as well.

good,Good opportunity to learn documentation required for FDA approval. Stressful at times when the plant would have problems. Develop more robust systems to prevent common problems.
good,"Very  good place to work. It is a pretty demanding job that is fast pace for the most part. The company is very lean, therefore the plants may only have a handful of people on site any given day. It is a very large company and does have opportunities for growth and movement if desired. Also provides a lot of on the job training and additional training if interested."

good,"typical day at work, hours would vary from day to day, Plant manager and coworkers all worked toggther to get the job done for following days orders. Some days I would drive 300 plus miles delivering dryice, other days would watch pressures and make dryice or do maintance on machines as needed.. At the end of each day me and coworker cleaned and secured building."
good,"Good company overall, pays well and seems concerned for employees welfare, safety and training. Praxair runs real real lean which cuts deep into your life outside of work."
good,Typical 12 hour work day
good,Enjoyed working forpraxair would work there again. Enjoyed being there with other co workers. The hardest part was winter time outside on the forklift.
good,This job requires lot of working overtime and it also requires a lot on the safety side as well so mentally and physically you have to bring your a game day in and day out
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Praxair.  My manager was a great guy with many hats and overall fun people to work with.  I would recommend working here, no doubt."
good,I would say that the Praxair is high on standards and would always gives you opportunity to implement something new as well as learn. It has a very friendly atmosphere. People work here for long years and this could be a con for fast growth up the ladder. Promotions are mostly for sales people and others see a average phase of the promotions. Special achievements are very well recognised and awarded .
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
good,"A great place to work with flexible hours and good pay. They provide a company vehicle and good benefits with a competitive salary. I enjoy the people I work with, for the most oat they are there to help you succeed."
good,Great overall work place. Safety is definitely first priority and the company safety culture is unmatched. However the managers seem very hard to work with. A lot of egos and lack of cohesion and communication. Not a good team feeling.
good,mostly fun easy going there are a few hiccups now and then you just have to work together and get through them. It's all about getting it done for the customer and making them happy.
good,"Praxair is a good company.  Strong safety culture, decent management, good opportunities, good compensation.  Their travel policy could use some work (lots of paperwork, no credit for travel/work over weekends).  I had a good time and if the travel had been better I would still be there."
good,Precisa melhorar as possibilidades de job rotation e planos de efetivação dos estagiários.
good,"Nice job, kind supervisors and guide the employee."
good,"Work culture as well as safety culture is quite good."
good,"Typical day at work was to enter 'jobs' into record keeping book, then complete the project according to client's instructions. "
good,"La empresa es muy bueno excepto por por los colaboradores (Jefes Directos) no tienen manera de pedir las cosas, se comportan muy prepotentes y hacen el trabajo muy complicado, los Horarios son muy variables hasta salir a ciertas horas de la madrugada,despedidas injustificadas de colaboradores de ahi en mas muy buenas prestaciones y beneficios."
good,I would love to have an opportunity to be a full time employee of praxair. I could easily see myself in maintenance. One of the advantages to work ing at praxair would be the fact that they're do close to my home.
good,You will get good understanding of how corporate system works in a big Non IT organization. Good work life balance. The company stresses heavily on safety which I think is required for any company.
good,Tied to a phone and had scheduled breaks and lunch. had to find co workers to cover your shift if you wanted to take a vacation day. breaks and lunches are timed only have half hour lunch and customer service management is terrible. but advancement in company is good
good,"Praxair was the owner, HCS was the DBA.  It was a wonderful job and I was cross trained on all departments.  Outstanding education and training was provided."
good,"Three work was enjoyable as were the people.  Little chance of promotion or pay increases unless you move departments.  Management is so buried they don't notice those not productive,  therefore, strong employees get burnt out."
good,Variety of business groups that make up one of the nations largest air separation companies.   Plant/industrial manufacturing and remote engineering groups help to maintain a world class reputation.
good,"Plant manager micromanages to the point that employees don't feel the need to go above and beyond.  Employees are given an ""average"" rating regardless of their lack of initiative or their consistent acts of going above and beyond, there is not incentive to do more than the minimum."
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
good,"Work for the KPAs"
good,"Working with praxair is great place but job security they will not see for you anything about your family, simply they will send to home"
good,Large company that allows you to work on complicated issues with independence to grow yourself. Work is demanding while you are there but it is nice that you do not have to bring the stress home with you.
good,"This is not to be confused with Praxair (Gas division), a highly standardized corporation. This is its Industrial and Aeronautical coating division Praxair Surface technologies. It has the same core values and mission, bu not the same management, guideline, and leadership root."
good,Praxair is one of the best company to work where the safety is followed by every employee. Zero tolerance to safety.Safety Principles are very strong and no exceptions for deviations.
good,"Was a DME supply company...that served the current community of Sumter, SC and its surrounding areas and counties. great co-workers and excellent customer service."
good,"Praxair was my first ""real job"" out of college. I learned so much about their business and built relationships with many co workers over the last year. The pay is outstanding for a starting position and it challenges you every single day."

good,"my time here was a long 7 years doing all kinds of things until being made redundent in july 2013, dont get me wrong im not upset about this becouse my time there was both sweet and sour..."
good,Praxair is a great company to work for.  I obtained all my Project Coordinating experience through Praxair.  Working on Project Teams with other professionals always gave me an opportunity to learn more about managing project teams in construction from proposal phase to construction.  
good,"prep parts for metalic coating, cleaned out power filters, promoted to strip-room tech where i was tasked with the removal of coating from tooling, parts and jigs.  repaired tooling."
good,"Worked there for two years,  wouldn't leave except because of the long commute. "
good,Installed pipe daily
good,"Praxair, Inc. was a great place to learn about the compressed gas distribution industry. There was an abundance of federal, state, and industry regulations and rules to be mindful of while performing my duties. I would deliver liquid CO2 that customers used in the carbonation of various consumer drinks. Our area was large and spread out in two states, Missouri & Illinois, so there were many, many customers to provide with our services. Management would do there best to help us out with solutions to onsite issues, but because of the physical distance some routes were from the plant, it was on us to problem solve and work independently. I learned a great deal working at Praxair."
good,Job takes a lot of time out of your family life. It allows for you to have money to spend. Still a good job to have but it used to be a lot better though.

good,". Relaxed workplace "
good,"Working at Praxair was fun and you learn a lot especially with people around you that have ton of experience for being in the industry. Benefits are great and you get paid time off. The down side is you are over worked and given lots of work and responsibilities that go beyond your job description. Praxair is also extremely hesitant to hire people, unless you are a driver. There is favoritism also involved unfortunately."
good,"Great company benefit plan, decent work area, to much of a mix in operations, personnel and management interference. Moral throughout the location was poor with only peer friendliness and cooperation. Pay structure was very appropriate. Workload and workable hours were comfortable, weekends off as a rule if required to do a road trip company vehicle and reasonable meal expenses were covered. All necessary safety and or educational/required certification was company supplied. Annual and semi-annual ""Safety"" Meetings involved all associated sites and involved a ""Breakfast Meeting"" at a local Hotel Conference Room, however the agenda was the same with the same script and finger pointing of course applied by respective managers/departments whom of course, are infallible-godly!! Overall workplace is tolerable."
good,"Empresa que forma ingenieros en diferentes especialidades."
good,"Good place to work, but with most big companies hard to get recognized for hard work/ethic. Minimal advancement for blue collar workers, good shifts/pay, clean work. Can be dangerous if you're not focused on tasks at hand."
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabajo, buena empresa, buenas prestaciones, sueldo promedio"
good,I maintained and operated a number of air separation plants in central and western NY.  I drove about 40k miles per year in this position.  My personal management was always top shelf and the work culture was excellent with help always available by phone or computer.  I would recommend this company to anyone looking for work.  The one drawback in my position was that no job is permanent as all jobs depend on keeping the contracts with the customers in a very competitive field.
good,Working with a great bunch of people over the course of my 32 years I learned there is nothing better then making sure our customers were happy with the experience they had with our services and doing nothing short making sure this happened
good,"This is truly a professional place that requires diligent people who understand the importance of safety on and off the job. Continuous training for all staff throughout your career there. The organization does not like unions, and the corporation would like to be union free. The wages are standard for the industry, benifits are decent."

good,Very efficient company. Hard working employees. Very safety focused. Stable and consistent presence in Western NY. Comprehensive benefit package for full-time employees.
good,"I enjoyed who I worked with and the actual job itself. I started out working as a Service Technician and then moved into the office. Working on the road was very fulfilling, although sometimes crazy busy...but sometimes sad too. Working closely with your clientele, in this case, your patients, who  most were suffering from a terminal illness, was hard. You would see good days and bad for them. Picking up their equipment due to their passing, was extremely difficult."
good,One thing I learned in this company is to cover yourself. Everybody put responsibility on each other. For HSR work is pretty heavy. Though job security is there.
good,Good place to work but long hours. Lot to learn and many chances to grow quickly. Managers are really nice and help you learn and progress. Praxair is very lean so you will have lots to do.

While there was some cross-learning with the compressed gas industry...specifically the fire shop chemicals...this was a higher learning about chemicals. Much of it was fascinating to me. I really enjoyed the cross-section of employees, as each of us brought our own experiences to the workplace. "

HR is good at promoting from within and the culture is only as good as you make it, mine is great.  the work life balance is the hardest part because of the delivery schedules. job security is very nice and I enjoy knowing there is always something to do and learn 24 hours a day at Praxair"

Meetings allow for the opportunity to connect with other locations to see how we can all work together to help each other  meet the demands of the customers in their area.  sometimes that means the plant will send a driver to a branch location at a certain time of the day to ensure that a customer who is coming to pick up an order at the store has exactly the gas they need for their welding/industrial needs."

TONS of training, kind of redundant for any experienced TRUCK DRIVER. Not much driving about it and way too much cylinder wrestling loading your own truck, delivering route (which is a bear) unloading full cylinders, reloading empty cylinders, and repeat at every stop.... end of day is the same unload empties and go home. The manager could really care less how, what or where you go or do as hes very busy being short staffed. Beware"

good,"Typical 12-hour work day involved all plant  operations, the hardest part of the job would be the rotating work schedule."
good,"A typical day for me at Praxair is to first check any emails that may have messages that I may need to forward or pass on to my peers in the office. After that is taken care of, I begin calling our customers who place weekly orders with us to ask them if they need any air sent to them for the current week. Typically once that is done, I start filing any papers that need filing, I answer the main telephone line, I welcome customers into the office, and I basically assist anyone who is in need of any help. From the time that I started working at Praxair, I have learned what the ""business world"" is really like. It taught me how to have patience (whether it be on the phone or face to face with my coworkers), and it also taught me how to balance multiple tasks on my plate at once. The management here is somewhat poor - although it is a well ran company, the management at Praxair include a few people who could very easily put their jobs in danger just by the way they communicate with our customers and the language that they use in the office. The hardest part of my job was definitely learning how the office runs - meaning what is acceptable, what is not, and how things are ran here in general in regards to deadlines, and how the day goes as a whole. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to meet new people - I am a very outgoing person who loves to talk to new people so it is a great experience for me."

However it does feel like a ""rush to wait"" kind of career. If something breaks you scramble to get whatever broke fixed as fast and safe as possible. This entails driving out to said location where the problem resides. Sometimes through ""swamp land"" or in the middle of nowhere. "
