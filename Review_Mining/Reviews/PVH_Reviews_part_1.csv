rating,review
bad,The overal experince was ok working there the only problem for was that there were too much internal politics that really got to me in the end I really did not care anymore about my work.
bad,"This company claims to provide great benefits and care for their employees. Their once competitive benefits are becoming less so. They will make you feel guilty for taking any personal days or time off you're entitled to. I was expecting a place that would encourage growth, but they barely set aside time for training. I was met with sighs and eye rolls when I asked any questions during my 6 months training period. While people smiled to your face, the entire HR department would be talking badly about other employees behind their backs. It was truly an uninspiring, emotionally draining and toxic work environment. with an At first I was surprised to hear that there was an almost 70% turnover rate among millennials, but soon I found myself applying to other companies myself. Would not recommend. If you have another option, you're better off staying away from PVH."
bad,Supervisor was unprofessional and sneaky. One of the supervisor would micro manage people when not doing her own job. The manager would befriend co-workers and pick favorites. Hired to many temps just to let everyone go. Still a high turnover on employee’s. Would not recommend anyone to make PVH a career.
bad,"Poor company culture, ethics, and no concern for employee quality of life. I would not recommend this company to anyone, Management shows biases, favoritism, and racial tendencies."
bad,A typical day at work would be either we would work the whole full eight hours or they would send us home within. I've learned how to be on time for work. The management of this company was horrible and childish. They are very unorganized and don't take their positions seriously. The workplace culture is everyone is treated fairly. There is no hard part of the job. This job is really a get in and out the type of job. The most enjoyable part of the job is clocking out.
bad,"Now let me start by saying if I could give this company a big fat 0 I definitely would. "
bad,I would not recommend this company at all.  Management are a bunch of racist bullies.  The pay is terrible and work life balance is at its worse.  Horrible work environment. Benefit package is ok.
bad,"There were no benefits, no vacation time, advancement was practically impossible. paid barely above minimum wage for a manager position, it took almost 3 months to get my direct deposit to go through and there was no option for a paper check so you were forced to use their card that charged you a ridiculous fee everytime you swiped it, checked your balance at an ATM, called to check the balance, or used an ATM (on top of whatever fee the ATM charged you). if you were not considered full time and ended up working full-time hours by picking up shifts or staying late when asked, you got in trouble. not for going over 40 hours, but for working more than 32 hours when you weren't full time."
bad,"Terrible company to work for.  No payroll to process hundreds of boxes of shipment, working alone for up to 5 hours with no bathroom access, absolutely unorganized upper management, archaic technology, repetitive and elementary email communications, on the fly poor decisions by corporate, no need to continue.    Rude and unprofessional Vice President"
bad,I is a good place to work it would be better if they did not do bank hours and cost you your your points if they fall below a certain number. Overall i guess its ok
bad,"Honestly this company has the worst managers who treat their employees with no respect whatsoever. Out of the 14 manager the company has only 4 or 3 that are professional unlike the others, no hours , pay is low and most of the shifts they give out are 4 or 5 hr shifts. I just regret that i spent 2 yrs of my life sucking up to most of the managers."
bad,"Don't batch scan on inventory day. You'll get canned, However I saw my own managers and other employees batch scanning and they didn't get fired. Accountability sucks."
bad,I didn't like it horrible experience but needed money. We did a lot of stuff they worked us like slaves had a lot of over time but all In all I really disliked the experience.
bad,The temp was ridiculous. Always sending me home when the work got slow. I always stayed late to help others out. The pay was good it was just temp let u go without warning.
bad,this job is like any other job there will be some good days and there will be some bad days. but with this job you van learn how to increase in selling merchandise. The management team is okay some of the co-workers are okay. The hardest part of the job will be trying to recover the store when it had been destroyed by customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make customers happy.
bad,"Manually pushing/pulling pallets, inventory, packing product, wrapping pallet product."
bad,Very productive environment I loved working for this company was sad to leave when they closed it doors.
bad,"I care not to reply to this request about the company."
bad,"The worst place to work. Overwhelming amount of work with unfair compensation. Extremely physically demanding and very stressful every day. Never ending tasking. Lots of pressure from corporate."
bad,The company is all about bringing in new talent....its run by the GSC team that are all employed by who they know from their past lives - all british snobs that do nothing but talk the talk.  They want people that can speak and do power point presentations but dont actually do the job.  If you are under 25 and a suck up - this is the place to be.
bad,"You have to report super early just to get your hours. For 8 hours you are standing on your feet folding CK clothes. You are not allowed to do much talking or leaning on the table. you only get one 30 min break, which you have to eat fast and leave 5 mins before your break is over. If the lunch bell rings before you are back to your station, you are immediately fired. very limited restroom breaks. and you will go home early a lot. meaning, getting 40 hours is difficult."
bad,I did not have a good experience with this company.  Management was poor.  HR was clueless.  There is a tremendous amount of favoritism.  Promotions are handed out like raffle tickets.  I never witnessed a promotion received based on knowledge and work ethic.
bad,"Job itself is simple, atmosphere is ok, but the company itself is a joke. I've learned that the most important and frequent aspect of my job is corporate visit prep. Higher ups don't believe in creating new positions to suit the needs of their stores or offsites. Downsizing and gutting as much payroll as they can has been their philosophy over the past few years, which if you ask me, is odd for a company that netted 572 million USD in 2015."
bad,"Enjoyed my job until I was promised to move up and instead got let go due to ""budget issues"". Told hours would increase instead they declined to PART TIME! Customer service department is too fragile if you're looking for security. Be careful, lot of sharks here."
bad,"A typical day at work - Everyone who goes above and beyond their job requirements, and who actually care about doing a good job (Doing their job, and picking up the slack of those who only do their basic job requirements, stand around and talk and only pick out the good work to improve their numbers) gets written up for not getting out as many numbers as those who cheat, and are treated very poorly from the first time their numbers go down, whether it be due to helping others with their jobs and questions or taking care of things no one else will."
bad,"Young people are working, have no respect for temporary workers. If tell them ""Good morning"" they will look other way, and walk away. Gossiping about co workers , always main subject. I felt very sad, working as temp. I had talked about this to my reporting manager, she was nice and she liked my work also. But not able to offer me permenant job. I left that job .becausturned"
bad,"Management was the most unsympathetic and dictatorial that I have ever had the displeasure of working for. Unless management has changed, don’t work here."
bad,"The customers are especially horrible, the pay was no where near what I deserved for the crazy amount of work and responsibility I carried. I was always the one who showed up on time and never missed my shift and I was more punished for it because of the irresponsible people who didn’t show up for theirs."
bad,"I would not recommend PVH to anyone. At least not using my impression. This place has the potential to be an amazing work environment, however due to the very young immature management team the lack of respect and maturity levels are high. Employees are NOT treated equally nor ethically. PVH needs a thorough cleansing of upper management and needs the employee relation structure refined and re-created."
bad,"Very long working hours, no advancement opportunities. No learning opportunities if you have more than 5 years of planning experience. "
bad,"Well I'm going to be completely honest I work here through a temp agency and we (temps) are treated like slaves while the permanent employees do barely nothing! Temps get no recognition there either, overall its an okay start until you can find a better job some people told me they've been there a year and they have yet to become permanent. And it's like high school there too so it's best to keep to yourself that's all I got lol good luck!"
bad,"I was very disappointed with my employment experience with PVH. This company has good benefits, however that is the only positive thing I can find to say about them."
bad,"Bad management"
bad,PVH  Forklift operator Management sucks. They push you and expect to much from individuals. They are VERY RUDE. Have to call Operation Assistant for everything even to go to the bathroom. The Union sucks pay dues every week  and they do not protect you from getting fired.
bad,Retail in itself is a job you have to desire or you won't like it. The store wasn't bad retail just wasnt my strong suite and I wasn't getting paid enough.
bad,PVH have you working in the heat they want you to work yourself to the Bone for little to no pay some of the management was good but most of the management suck it was a kiss butt job there was no respect it's all about what the manager says It's the final word
bad,I work for a contracted employee that works out of PVH so I don't get to experience all the perks of working for PVH.
bad,"The job is a ok place to work for the job security & benefits, but wear & tear on the body management not up to part, no fair treatment amongst other workers..."
bad,alright place to work if you like getting written up for production when there is no such thing as production in the company and union book.     A lot of lazy supervisors
bad,Work life balance and upper management were terrible. No room for growth within the company and no feedback when asked. Generally they disregard all associates and management feedback.
bad,"Team mate was really bad. Lots of incorrect information passsed to HQ and had a hard time to work."
bad,"I worked as a temporary employee at PVH. and all ""temps"" were treated like garbage by the ""full timers"". I was sexually harassed by a full time maintenance man. I took this issue to HR 3 TIMES, to no avail. Nothing was done.  it felt like a slap in the face. This is a horrible place to work."
bad,PVH fue una oportunidad de aprendizaje en el campo del servicio al cliente. Aprendí estrategias de venta y como atender a personas según sus necesidades.
bad,They treat their temps very badly. We will be working out butts while making $10 an hour and the full timers standing around doing nothing making $17 an hour. If enough full time people sign up for OT they dont even let temps work. Full timers got a $500 bonus for them doing nothing while people who dont want to work or cant work and or 3rd shift has to stay temps. So temps who have been there 2 years get no pay raises or a $500 bonus.
bad,"A Typical work day is riding a walkie around picking up pallets and dropping them to correct locations. I have learned part of the pkms system, management is very young and clueless to alot of situations, the hardest part is having to ask a supervisor something and they don't have a clue, the enjoyable part of the job is just riding around the building on a walkie."
bad,"Been working here for a year and its my first job from what i learned the people suck, the management is terrible, little pay, overwhelling at times, a lot of drama"
bad,"This place is a joke, do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. There's next to no training and hardly anyone knows what's going on. You're expected to just know what to do without being told or trained by a manager. The other stock associates do the ""training"" which consisted of just aimlessly walking around or giving very generalized directions.  When you inevitably mess up because of the lack of direction or because no one actually knows what's going on you get yelled at and treated like an idiot. I've worked in stock for years and have never seen such a terribly run warehouse. Everyone hates it there but won't say anything, but it's clear from the attitude of the other employees."
bad,"PVH is known for hiring employees and having them to come in for work and telling them at the door that they are not needed. I really think it would be helpful to know this before hand instead of having employees travel for no reason and not offer them the 4 hours of pay which is suppose d to be given by law. Management at PVH are very rude and show great amounts of favoritism. Permanent employees are very rude. Working conditions are extremely poor. Sometimes there is no air or the right materials to work with but employees are being punished for this.Overall, I would not work at PVH or advise anyone else to work there if your attempting to have a career."
bad,"No matter how long you work in some department upper management finds it necessary to micromanage. They don't want you building relationships with others in the company. No comradery  between departments but rather competition, and throwing others under the bus even though we all work for the same company."
bad,The benefits are amazing at PVH.  You can't find a better 401K or health insurance plan anywhere.  They also offer employees 3 weeks of vacation per year after being with the company for 90 days.  Most of the coworkers I have had are amazing.  The one concern I have about the company is that the leadership is lacking with most supervisors/management being right out of college and not having experience.  They also tend to lead through fear instead of empowering their employees.
bad,"Nice choice for my first job. I learned many things about cash handling and what to always look for in currency. The hardest part of the job is of course the language barriers with the customers but, that is no problem for me."
bad,This job never had enough to do. Scheduled for 10 hour shifts and most of the time we were sent home early due to lack of work. Other times we literally swept the floor for 10 hours straight. They only hired people on full-time that other employees liked.
bad,"This job was exciting to me because of my love for retail and the luxury client, although the ethic in my district seem to have no balance or structure to support healthy growth in the work place."
bad,"This place gives bountiful discounts along with other brands that fall under PVH Corp.. It might be the biggest benefit that you can get from working here. Though discounts are great, it is not enough to make up for the effort that you put in. You are going to be bossed around by hypocrites. This place is always short in staff, so be ready to be working all over the departments. Schedule is never made in accoradance to your availability."
bad,"Human Resources at PVH is a department that stifles its employees.  A focus of most Human Resources departments is continuing to be a revolving door of new associates rather than cultivate and reward those who perform.  Recognition in the form of titles, incentives, and advancement is scarce, and the reasoning behind those decisions are often, ""But we have always done it this way."""
bad,"I enjoyed working in retail and working for this company.  However, the upper management was stressful.  Also, the hours at times would not be available and there was no room for advancement."
bad,"People are unorganized, and managers do absolutely nothing but walk around all day. People like to gang up on the new people. They have fights, and it is full of drama."
bad,"PVH Presented a great opportunity for me, which is essentially the reason I left Verizon.  The promise of a great work life balance, and high base pay were very attractive to me, as these were my priorities being a single dad of two boys."
bad,"Process payroll for employee count of 1500 on a weekly and semi-monthly basis"
bad,Its retail clothing....You check store goals and provide assistance to cutomers
bad,Union labor company that makes employees take a break.  I did not enjoy working for this employer.
bad,"Great People, tough hours, little room for advancement. Over the last decade, PVH Corp. (""PVH"") has made several acquisitions that have redefined the identity, performance and long-term growth potential of the Company – first with the acquisition of Calvin Klein in 2003, then with the addition of Tommy Hilfiger in 2010, and most recently with our February 2013 acquisition of The Warnaco Group, Inc. (""Warnaco""). Through these transformative acquisitions, we have secured our position as one of the largest branded lifestyle apparel companies in the world, with a diversified portfolio of iconic lifestyle apparel brands, led by Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger."
bad,The environment was not the most ideal. There was a ton of politics and favoritism but there were a few great people there. Business is doing well and supports the growth of their employees.
bad,If you're looking for good money as a permanent employee PVH is fair with the wages. PVH has poor management and lack of communication between OA's. The hardest part about PVH is dealing with the OA's.
bad,Everyone was stuck up and this job isn't meant for teenagers because the elders will single you out and knit pick at everything you do till they fire you for false accuzations.
bad,"Avoid working at the warehouse at all costs. Manager is sneaky, liar, womanizer, drug dealer. He will do anything he can to advance his own personal interests."
bad,"The lack of upper managent and corporate acknowledgement when a job is well done needs improvement. The structure of bonuses was restructured to make it nearly impossibe to get a bonus.The fact that asistant managers are not able to bonus with managers is a slap in the face,seeing that asistant managers are just as responsible as the manager.It is true that moving up is difficult because the managers are so stable.Your typical week consist of floorsets,markdowns,customer service,answereing e-mails from upper managment,keeping track of sales,sending out special orders and processing over 100 + boxes of new shipment .If it is June or January you would be preparing for inventory and being responsible for yours as well as the other 4 sister store inventories. The company works you hard and barley acknowledges your hard work. There is little incentive to working for PVH unless you are a manager. You can stay at an asistant level for years and years."
bad,not friendly management and assiocate dont no how to take to people. No 401k . Poor Union representive. Poor business like work atomshpere. Will not reference
bad,"PVH is a great company but the advancement within the company is very political.  No all leaders are required that same level of education or qualification and do to this, there are many leaders that do not how to interact and like to micro manage."
bad,My over all work experience at Pvh its a good job but not enough work hrs for temp services in the Tk department nor benefits! It’s a really easy job but got to be good on your feet.
bad,"Opening/ closing procedures including banking."
bad,"The hiring process is extensive and varies from online exams, in person exams and multiple one - on - one interviews. After being hired there is a two-week training by an individual whom may or may not work in your department. You may learn the basics but not really everything you need to fully complete the job. You will have to be a fast learner and be comfortable with reaching out for assistance. There are daily start-up meetings before your shift in order to let all associates know what the work is for the day. Typically some of this information was elaborated and would change immediately after start-up. Management was hard to communicate with if you weren't able to explain why the department did not reach their target (goal). Recommendations were not freely accepted with ease but rather taken as an insult that someone in management did not know their job. Lunch breaks were fairly short and was monitored closely by management watching the arrival path to ensure everyone walked to their department on-time. Sometimes you were watched from around corners to ensure you were doing your job and interacting appropriately. Honestly, the only good things about the establishment are being fed during meetings and training ( we had to arrive early before shift) as well as the awards given for participating in healthy habits (exercise, etc)."
bad,The pay was great but you have to be watchful every second of the minute while there. It was pleasant to work there but you definitely know what you're doing because the company is shipping warehouse and if you don't get it after so long they will walk you to the door.
bad,"The Company has great opportunities for advancement and they also have awesome benefits. I've learned no matter the circumstance, an operation must proceed."
bad,"I was overall manager of a two store chain within a division. Not limited to: hiring, recruiting and training. payroll, Loss Prevention, Visual Standards ect."
bad,"azienda leader nel mercato dell`abbiaglimento"
bad,mangement needs more training they lack a sense of how to communicate with employees sometimes which can be very counter productive to the work experience
bad,This should be considered a temporary job. Very well pay but hours may vary. Short breaks but paid. Comfortable clothing but hot temperatures. Always on your feet.
bad,"During my time a pvh I had a young manager whose life imploded around him. I know he was going through a tough time, but it made for a terrible working environment."
bad,"Terrible job "
bad,A typical day at work would consist of long hours of standing and walking while packaging items to assigned boxes. Management is not professional in any sense.
bad,"I worked as a overnight stock associate for a few weeks until I was disrespected by the ""assistant manager"" when she called me a dummy to another co worker smh"
bad,"I worked as a payroll coordinator for 2 years from 2012-2014 and saw many employees fired due to the head of the dept's discretion. You can work hard, give your blood sweat and tears and in the end it is not appreciated. This dept. has the reputation that does not recognize the value of their staff due to poor leadership. Company perks are great...find a job at PVH in a different department."
bad,"The job consists of folding, restocking, and helping customers. Lots of responsibility and the work is manually hard for minimum pay, with no pay raises."
bad,"Open the store and registers, check the emails, prioritize tasks according to importance and set time frames for them to be done. Supervising and ensuring our staff are happy and giving them tasks to complete, making sure the shop floor is as full of merchandise as possible in order to make our daily goals enhancing the whole corporate yearly goal. Making sure the customers are content, able to find the products they need and leave the shop happy."
bad,Very easy job. I just wished it wasn't no first come first serve job because you come from a temp  service. Hours was great just not a big fan about everyone sharing the same badge.
bad,"I love working at PVH just not able to devote to a 3rd shift right now. This company has great benefits, holiday pay, 401 k, and really takes care of their employees."
bad,"It is a Good place to work. Great pay and benefits. Rules and Management not all ways on same page, but the workers are great!"
good,"It is a fast pace work environment, but had poor management at the time. Great learning experience and constantly moving. Positive employees, but management needs work."
good,"Management and customer service. shipment, inventories, coached and trained new staff.Sales, sales, sales"
good,right now not a good time to work there since there's a lot of reorg and upper mgmt are only interested in cutting people and don't care about the workload of the rest.
good,"My work day can be very busy consisting of multiple projects.  The first thing I do is gather all the necessary paper work for my many daily reports, download all photos taken by our Quality Control Department, open all worksheets then go through new email and correspond as needed.  "
good,"Tolle Kollegen, super Kantine. Leider langsame Prozesse"
good,"Very little training recieved, not truly sure if who my actual supervisor was. Only break is a 30 minute lunch break that we have to click out for. Never sure if what you will be doing"
good,"weekends are no fun, the store gets very messed up and you cant leave till the store is tidy. the managers are not the nicest but coworkers are very nice and fun to talk to. this job teaches you how to speak to and help customers, it also trains you to be organized and timely."
good,"Lieu de travail très agréable, politique du groupe américaine, opportunités de développement possible."
good,"Once you tap out your pay at that job, the supervisors will do anything in their power to fire you. It's almost like they want to stop paying you once you have reached the tap out pay amount. Barely get raises and sometimes the work environment is not worth the pay. Management talks to people how ever they feel and some of those people at PVH are racists and sexist."
good,This position is not recommended if you have children under 18. No set schedule. 1 weekend a month off but not garunteed. Work holidays 3-4 saturdays a month.
good,Phillip Van Heusen is a productive company but not very easy to grow there. There is no 401K plan in the warehouse but is for the company.
good,-spoke with buyers on a regular basis to discuss business and opportunities
good,Tough to get anything done with all the politics. If it wasn't the right person's idea then even a good idea wouldn't get any traction. Had to jump through hoops to get anything done.
good,"stressful environment, can be a lot better. upper management is often intense and very high on micro managing each department on a min to min bases through out a 8 to 10 hour shift."
good,"The general culture is fantastic at PVH, but when the going gets tough for a location or store there is little to no support. There is no room for advancement unless you are young, and have no ties to your area, such as kids.  Advancement is only for those who can be relocated."
good,"É uma boa empresa, ainda precisa melhorar questão de plano de carreira e benefícios."
good,They could have worked on giving out more hours and not waiting until we got to work to tell us that they didn't need us for that day. I was a very hard worker and very good on my job and what I do as well.
good,This job is an entry level position. I will recommended for a college student looking to make extra cash while attending college. The hours are flexible.
good,"It was a really nice job, always help your costumers and make sure they have everything they need. My co-workers were always fun people to work with, we always made sure we did everything we needed to do  we were Always nice to everyone. I loved the job but I honestly decided to leave because I had a baby, so I'm now looking for a work at home job. Thank you."
good,Temps get no love. They are required to pull the most weight and work harder for less money. 8.65 to be exact. While fulltime gets paid 12.50 plus and they stand around and talk while they watch you work.  Plenty of promises to get a fulltime assessment while i waited 6 months past the date they promised the assessment to go full time would be.
good,"good  place to work, nice co-workers, different job every day, learned to be flexible and able to learn many jobs, not much more to say"
good,"-Replenish the floor, paper work"
good,I didn't stay with this company long enough to gain anything from them.  I had a contract position (temp).
good,A typical day at work is very busy with email and issuing purchase orders to the overseas factories.
good,Overall a great place to work and enjoyed the atmosphere.Great mangement teams in place and provides a fair salary andexcellent benefits to all its employees.
good,"The people you work with make this job fun. Management is really poor , they can be bullies sometimes. You either stick it out or leave. I left. Hours are very poor. You have to fight for a raise but rarely will it actually go through."
good,"Most employees are temps, easily replaced and schedule unpredictable. It takes over a year maybe 2 to reach full time. Until then you work through a staffing agency and hope you stay out of TK."
good,A typical workday at PVH forklift driver consist of daily task taking orders from the recieving docks to the case pulls and finally dropping them in the case racks for storage or shipping docks for deliveries. I am apart of a 5 man trainer crew who help associated with day to day troubleshooting procedures or new hire training of an specific equipment. The training includes associate paperwork which has to be submitted in order for the associate to be certified.
good,"I personally think that that company did not care about the employees, they care more about money more than anything. The employees did care about their patients they was first."
good,"Operating power material handling equipment to accurately select and palletize loads Moving pallets by hand, hand truck, electric pallet jack, or manual pallet jack Packaging merchandise for shipment  Shrink wrapping goods for loading onto trailers. Finding stock and merchandise in the warehouse. Ensuring that the correct labels are on all stored pallets. Routinely cleaning all warehouse areas and containers.

Using computer equipment to generate labels.  Stocking incoming orders onto shelves.  Loading merchandise onto trucks. Loading and unloading containers and trucks. Organising stock in the warehouse.Most Management was nice and very kind.The hardest part of the job adapting to the new rules and policies that they changed everyday at any giving time.The best part of the job was my co workers.They was very easy to work with and very easy going."
good,"I would go throughout the warehouse filling various orders. While driving different pieces of equipment including cherry picker, power jack, sit-down, turret."
good,you know how a lot of employers pay you DOE? well unfortunately this company does not...you could have years and years of experience but you will only get paid the starting wage of that position...turn over rate is very high for this reason. In my location we deal with a ton of Canadians and they expect you to bend over backwards for them.
good,"Typical retail job, helping customers with clothes, register, and lots of cleaning"
good,Management- not accountable for their actions. They often tend to blame others for their mistakes  & mismanagement.  When you work there ask why they’ve had so many great people leave the company.
good,My experience with PVH was not that good. I went through a temp agency. Some of the people there looks at us as if we are dirt on the bottom of their shoe. I don’t want to say the company is bad. Because I’ve been told the benefits are worth it. But the employees forgot they were once at the bottom too. Stop treating us differently from the PVH crew. We are all there for the same reason. To make a living. No need to belittle anyone. But the temps do get the short end of the stick sometimes.
good,"Lo staff è composto da persone valide , poca possibilità nella crescita all'interno del brand"
good,"Was a full time and the job provided greatly. The task are fast paced and keep you busy, and overtime is offered regularly; however, the mismanagement from the office and the extremely poor treatment of their Temporaries is appalling. These guys work just as hard if not harder then the Full Times and are walked over and treated like comment dirt by the company. Their ""we'll just replace you easily if you leave"" attitude is morally bad. They claim to be a good hearted Christian Company but lack the values one should have. If you can get right into Full Time then by all means work here, it's fine. If you're offered a temporary position here with a chance of hire go somewhere else. It isn't worth your time as most temporaries are kept that way no matter how dedicated, hard working, and consistent you are."
good,"Answer emails, work on excel spreadsheet, speak to vendors and PVH associates, meetings with manager and team members. Working on a survey for the vendors that work for PVH"
good,"Pvh is a good company to work for if you can tolerate bad management and inconsistency, they dont care about employers as indivisuals. Pay is average but raises are not fair."
good,"When i started there in 2001 they were a $600 million dollar company when i left they were 9 billion and you could see the difference. In the end of my career they didn't care about people just bottom lines and i was in management so i saw it at that level. It was sad what they became. They were great to me for over 10 years and it was an awesome place to work. I have lifelong friends from their. But then they brought in a different management who just cared about bottom lines and not the employees, it was sad but part of life. Great place and I learned a lot and owe them a lot. If your looking for a short term job they are the place to be , they have let go all the people with experience and anyone who had any tenure there. Very Sad. I must also preface this i made my bonus 13 out of 14 years there so we knew how to make money and this isn't sour grapes, all my bosses have long been let go. I wish them luck"
good,My short time as Floor Supervisor was alright.  I was at a smaller store with not many employees  and the store manager at the time was not easy to get along with at all.
good,PVH is a great company. many strong minded people put their thought together to make a better work place. as far as management it could be a lot better.
good,"I developed various skills while working at van heusen and was somewhat of a jack of all trades. I was responsible for sales, setting up floor sets, redoing price points, overseeing the stockroom and being a cashier. I enjoyed the people I worked with as well as the management."
good,"Azienda di moda marchio conosciuto a livello mondiale, ambiente giovane e dinamico, ho imparato tantissimo sulla contabilità."
good,"This is My Honest experience. When I first went to work it was a Wonderful place. I felt honored. Management was Spectacular. I enjoyed going to work but as management changed I noticed the company did as well. I felt it became very political. I FELT one of the new members of management was showing GREAT favoritism. It created much animosity in the workplace. People I knew couldn't take it anymore therefore they retired early or quit. I myself allowed it to encourage my early dismissal. Things continued to worsen with even more new management due to the elimination of the perks that made PVH a Wonderful place to work. I can Honestly say MANY people continue their employment due to lack of options in the area and or length of time they have invested. New management spends so much money and time in preaching 5 Core Values but my opinion doesn't practice them. I feel to save the company and make it better management needs to be held accountable fort their actions or therefore lack of. But for the money and benefits, Yes, I recommend it."
good,"for the most part PVH was for me a Great place to work."
good,"The pay structure is very good. After the initial pay, you get a raise every 90  days until you top out.Equipment is good and they keep it in good repair.It is very fast paced. Management's main function is to follow you around. usually you have to watch out for HR people and supervisors from different shifts,especially the last 30 min of your shift. Lunch was the only brake.it was 35 min and you were not allowed to leave early and you are not allowed to return late. It is a union shop but not that strong,"
good,É stata una bella esperienza ma mi aspettavo di più.
good,"My day consisted of customer service, stocking apparel, resetting the floor as directed by the office management. Nice place to work to learn multi-tasking and how to deal with retail"
good,"Overall PVH Corp. is a great company, in the past 3 years the company culture has change from a family and caring to a global corporation."
good,they pay good for a warehouse job and the work is the easiest job I ever had. .but most of the management is young.. like in their early 20. coming straight out of of college and they are very prejudice. If you get a job here you will definitely looking for work after a year because that when they re looking to fire you for No reason
good,Very friendly and warm work environment.  Not a very good place to work if you would like to advance within.  Learn all you can and take what you learn to another company if your expectation is to grow your career.

good,"It's a good place to work. But its definitely WORK. ""There is no such thing as nothing to do"" is one of the managers favorite things to say. Flexible hours. Sales associate is good position for somebody in school needing PT job for extra money for fun activities."

good,"It was a great company hands down, the fault was my own. My actions were the reason that got me terminated from this establishment, they are a reliable and great company."

From the cubic feet of trailers to the billing of Drivers.  I also learned the different shipping methods.  PVH is a fast paced invironment.  The hardest part working with PVH was the miscommunication between shifts and management.  Miscommunication caused a lot of errors.  the people that I directly worked with, and the company discounts"
good,Typically I scan clothes and put them in boxes all day while either helping tape or with totes. They have a plethora of rules to follow and usually do not like people conversing. The hours are nice and they are pretty flexible if you need to take a day off.
good,"It's ok, good place to work if you're trying to get your foot in the door. It's an ok environment. It's more for a newbie to the workforce."
good,"Senior managers do not really care about their workers, too busy trying to make their bonus. They don't pay their employees well."
good,"PVH is a great place to work for."
good,When start up of shift we do exercises to stretch and get our blood flowing. We retrieve our RF guns and get our pod labels and go to our designated shoots. we scan a shoot and begin to scan product from the shoot and pack it into cartons to be shipped to customers
good,"The corporate benefits are such as paid holidays and vacation time. The company makes it very hard to move to the next level, and people tend to hire friends rather than who is the best candidate."
good,"The job has very nice people that work there, but the work is stressful and repetitive. At this job i learned to cooperate with others in a work environment."
good,"A typical work day is busy.  Lots of meeting at my level.  I worked there for 15 years, business side people are very good and reasonable."

good,"This was my first job and it was a great start. I worked in the outlet mall in Johnson Creek and it was a learning experience. I had to go through a lot of training but when I was finally done it was nice. We had a lot of co worker bonding time when we had little work parties. My favorite part would have to be my other co workers, we got a long great and when the store wasn't busy we would talk about anything! It was great."
good,Worked embarkation and debarkation in galveston port. Learned alot about travel documentation and requirements.
good,A typical day of work may consist of working a 10 hour shift. I was able to development leadership skills through this work experience. The most enjoyable part of the job is the associates. There are numerous hardworking associates who are willing to put forth their best effort under the right management.
good,A typical day at pvh would be arriving at a macys store. working in the stockroom fixing and organizing merchandise. Going to the floor and doing the same.

good,"The managers and supervisors do not know how to talk to their employees, they do not listen to their employees. The union here is weak, they submit to the company."
good,The building and work environment has been incredibly depressing to me and I would not recommend anyone with either anxiety or depression to apply here. That aside it is great pay and benefits. Although you wont be able to do anything more than manual labor here without a high school degree or GED.
good,"PVH is a good company to work for overall. A typical day at PVH includes lifting, picking, packing, sorting, and loading merchandise in a timely manner. The hardest part about the job is trying to stay busy when the work load is low."
good,"Factory environment with multiple departments and could be reassigned to any based on work load for the day. Management could care less , more about what you could do"
good,"Para ser mi primer trabajo en este país fue muy fácil adaptarme, aprendí inglés y mis compañeros me enseñaron a manejar todo lo que tiene que ver con el depósito, hacia las órdenes para las tiendas , ordenábamos la mercancía en el almacén, llegó un momento donde el incremento salarial no era mucho y no me daban las 40 horas completas. Teníamos el beneficio de comprar en las tiendas con descuentos"
good,"Stable company with great benefits and lots of opportunity for mobility. "
good,"Good place to work if you like working in a fast pace setting, good place to work if your in school, staff very friendly and supportive, you can learn to drive a forklift and communication is a big part of the workplace culture"
good,The job is easy I'd you work hard but expect if an male to move around a lot. It gets very boring in many areas and plan on being on your feet for hours.
good,The company is with a Union and the benefits are great. The environment is a typical work place environment. Managements basically do their job while not covered under union
good,Management needs A LOT of help the high position they are the less empathy they have. Besides management not bad occasional mishaps like any job they seem to pick favorites
good,I was a packer for them and I enjoyed my job. I was a temp at the time and want to one day go through the door. It was a good experience and I wouldn't mind doing it again.
good,"I didn't know what to expect going into work, we were sometimes sent to different departments, there was unfortunately a lot of drama in our department that I did not approve of, if made to work on other side of building had to expect to take 5-8 minutes out of 30 minute lunch break due to walking travel. On top of clocking in with card, you had to sign in your name & attend role call. (It was too much)"
good,On a typical day you would either open the store and make sure all paper work from the previous day was done and check your overnight emails. As management you would count register drawers and make sure any and all supplies that might be needed for the day were available to the incoming staff. The co-workers where the best one could ask for. They made the work fun and brightened up your day.

good,"Some days run smoothly with a constant flow of work, some days get stressful with providing a constant workflow. Ive learned all areas in my department with in 6 months to better help my employees meet their daily goals. Ive also learned how wave and depal release are important in timing on a daily bases, and how other departments corresponded with my department and how consistent communication with those departments helps us stay above our daily goal. The most enjoyable part of my day is how happy and upbeat my associates are on a day to day basis which i feel provides us with the ability to stay on task"
good,Trying for promotion for a long time but they seem to always have a reason to not give one. They would rather hire young people who have never seen the inside of a warehouse than hire people who knows the company. Management does not communicate between shifts. They have their favorites on who can do what.
good,Pvh is a good company to work for but the environment is not so good.  The management team needs better knowledge on how to manage and treat the workers there
good,"It is a great company which takes care of their employees.  Great benefits and for the most part, down to Earth people work at PVH.  Senior Level Executives are approachable and understanding."
good,A typical work day would consist of a lot of moving around from department to department to find work. I learned how to properly stack boxes and which palate(s) not to use. The management can be quite stressful at times. But if you can get through it then you can handle everything else. The hardest part of the job is when the work starts to thin out.
good,"Very relaxed with the exception of quarter and year end. Management styles differ between departments. Department that I was in when I first started was more of my style (relaxed) however when I moved to a different department, the job was very toxic and tense. Workplace is fun and the benefits are great."
good,Only spent a short period of time as a freelancer to the art dept. Culture was very corporate but everyone seemed happy to be there. Work life balance existed in their environment
good,"A day at PVH consisted of permanent and temps. Starting off with signing in to your assigned department ad completing the task differentiating between the forklift, unpacking and folding clothes, scanning and finding the designated area for particular items. Learning the job is easy, moving up depends on our dedication an consistency. Management is efficient and up to par. The workpace is a safety and supervised place. The hardest part is having unexpectedly to do a other unknowingly task. The most enjoyable were the flexible shifts."
good,It's fast paced and Upper Management expects a lot with a little payroll.  It is challenging but I have learned more with this company then any other.  They invest in their employees.
good,"The part I enjoyed the most was been on the sales floor, taking care of the customer and making complete sales."

good,"During my years of employment, I have witnessed the company grow as a whole entity as well as experience first hand a huge DC growth for the company in this region. A typical day at work involves teamwork, as well as working individually to complete daily tasks. I have learned in my tenure with PVH how to go over and beyond in order to satisfy not only management but also customers in the retail sector. The work place is a very clean environment and has a fast to upbeat tempo of completing tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to enjoy coworkers during the work day as well as during employee events held outside of work hours."
good,"Flexible with hours, not stringent in terms of time, work life balance really good. Management is competent and looking to grow the company through acquisition."
good,It is a great job for young people if you like having a lot of time off. They hire management with no experience. Get place to work
good,"Its a good company with great benefits,flexible overtime, nice workplace, always worried about their employees health, further more way up the company"
good,"Check in and see what job you will be working for the day once you finish you go to a different section of the building, lean how to separate clothes for each company"
good,"Had been a successful career for 18 + Years. "
good,"I typically worked everyday only got one or two days off a week. I was working as a retail salesman, I worked the cash registers I opened and closed the stores sometimes. I helped with the shipping from the warehouse to the stores. I was always interacting with the customers to make some sales. My co-workers were amazing I got along well with everybody. The hardest part was to manage everything when it was during the holiday season and the most enjoyable part was being there in general I love to work."
good,Great benefits and compensation. Productive and strong company culture. Constantly evolving with the market to ensure the success of the company and it's employees.
good,Great first job. Management will work with your other responsibilities. Discounts are a huge plus. Mostly cannot give you a lot of hours so if you do not need to work often perfect job.
good,"This job was an okay job but it’s not enough pay or hours and there is very POOR management in the Tinton Falls location . If they gain a whole new management , the store would be just fine . Too much drama for a job that only pays 10.00 as a sales lead ..:"
good,PVH is a very awesome place to work at. The pay is great. Very job is not by production. Also they have great benefita such as dental and medical. Plus we also receive a discount on he clothes we send out.
good,"Good job, not fair with temporary employees. Supervisors give preferences to new employees who arrive and they know each other. You need to get there early before your shift if you want to work, cuz sometimes send people home."
good,"I'm not a fan of badmouthing companies, but management has a tendency to act erratically and without purpose. Senior management results to threats and abusing mid-level manager and that behavior filters down to rank and file members. "
good,Inventory Control consisted of accurate counts to keep up with all inventory that was in stock at the warehouse. Stacking and Putting away all inventory in correct bays so the were able to be found and accurately shipped.
good,"Fresh new styles every season, neat displays, beautiful people from all walks of life came to shop here. The pay was lousy but you couldn't beat the environment. Worked with some pretty amazing people."
good,We work a8 HOUR shift and frame the time you start until the time you stop you work  because boxs were comeing down the line every minte and you had 3 trilers to load  and then next shift come in and take over. the enjoyable parts was going home.
good,"A normal day of driving an forklift ,with the freedom to  be yourself at work. Hours are great for whatever your life style is and really no pressure to do anything but a productive employee."
good,Warehousing company with very little potential for employee growth but overall not a bad place to work short-term. The job itself was not too stressful.
good,all this company thinks about is work. only 1 break for lunch.
good,The store manager dosen't promote canadents with in the store that have worked many years. Or push for better raise to deserving associates but still expects everyone to bend over backward for years and she takes advantage of the fact that they need there job. She retaliates by cutting hour if she decides she dosen't like you that week. Or even if you try to bring any concerns to her and she doesn't like it then you get no hours for that so no one trusts her. She puts all your business out to everyone else even if you come to her about a business concern cononal unprofessional and rude a.un
good,Company was great when I first started however there was a major restructuring which changed the culture.  I can't say anything bad about the company as there were great benefits.
good,This position was not hard work but hours were back and forth.  On slow weeks most recent hired employees were many times told to go home due to no work.
good,"PVH was a great place to work. Very motivating to be surrounded by people who love what they do. Senior leadership ensured everyone felt valued. There were some opportunities to learn and grow but most people are lifers, so not much room for upward mobility."
good,Very high number of footfall in the store. High amount to of deliveries being received weekly and a lot of new experiences dealing with different sort of customers.
good,"A typical day at work for me was to hurry and clock in,so I could get to a table and start unpacking boxes and pulling items out and making sure I have the right labels for them.Then 're packing them and getting them ready to shipped out.When there is work ,it might be a log day ,but I like to get the job done."
good,"Ik heb het een genot gevonden om bij PVH werkzaam te zijn.  Alles ademt fashion, de look and feel van het kantoor,  People's Place en de mensen die er werken. Ze komen uit alle windstreken en dat maakt het extra interessant."
good,"For the entire time that I was working there, I was constantly promised a higher position. Coming into the job, the manager herself told me that she was going to train me and another employee to move up right away. That was constantly said to me every other week. I would do workloads that I was not being well paid for. It was basically not within my paygrade needless to say. Although i enjoyed the other employees company, the management team never really let me know what my purpose was in the workplace. I was always doing everything, all over the store. Coming in at all hours of the day, doing my best to move up the ladder but never actually did because they didn't want to pay me more for the job i was doing."
good,"Learned a lot about sales, customer service, operations and management. Days were usually face paced and you always had something to do. Work place culture can get a little catty but when you get along with everyone can be great."
good,always something to do at work. can be busy on the weekends. the discount is good. management have been very good to me and the team. they do hire teenagers and they come and go.
good,"It takes a while for your body to get physically used to the job.  It is not hard, just repetitive and you will only get one 30 minute break out of an eight hour shift, so you have to pace yourself to keep your stamina.  I work as a temp so the pay is bad and you rarely get a full 40 hour week."

good,"Great introduction to customer service"
good,"My co-workers are great. They're the reason I've stayed so long working in the retail business. The hardest part of the job is the lack of hours and time to get things done. Oftentimes, the backroom is left very disorganized."
good,"a lot of work and stress, co-workers are nice, friendly work environment"
good,"I excel at producing through excellent communication, leadership and motivational skills. In addition, my strength at training and team building has resulted in positive results in sales and margin. "
good,"Sometimes I can go to work and the day will be a breeze, no arguements, alot of work, managers are calm, HR rep. will come on the floor to fix any problems or paperwork that needs to be done. But alot of other days I can walk in an someone is having a arguement right after work starts. The managers would be semi afraid of eachother where if another manager is in the wrong, the other manager will lie or keep quiet. The HR rep. will take notes of what he needs to fix and won't fix it, but he says he did. If documents need to be changed or remaining hours are being asked for he will do some not all."

good,In my time at PHV I enjoyed working for a company with a sense of social responsibility. Many of the great benefits employees enjoy are relating to community service and helping worthy causes.

good,Oversee implementation and quality control of SOP’s. Produce weekly shipment and efficiency reports to Manager of Operations.
good,"PVH's culture has been in transition for the past few years. They are at the forefront of HR business practices and I look forward to seeing them continue to lead the way.

Their learning and development initiatives are top notch and taken advantage of by a majority of associates."
good,The desire to be permanent  working Temp to Hire. I have experience with Management Back and Front Office Regional Management Shipping and Receiving Packing Shipping
good,I loved working for this company seems like they care a lot about making a great person out of you. Wish they had more to offer for part time students. You do get rewarded from time to time and every year you have the chance to get a higher raise. Overall the company is fine they choose their management wisely(sometimes).
good,"So many of the people have a passion and commitment for what they do, it is inspiring. Outside of a few that make it unhealthy at times, it is truly a driven  culture to work within and one in which you learn at a very fast pace. You can know that when you walk away you will be a better leader and so much stronger from the experience."

Keeping items (clothing) neat and tidy for buying customers, being able to handle customer questions regarding items or even tourism spots in the nearby area. Small store, but the coworker environment is very friendly and fun. Toughest part of the job was cleaning up at the end of the shift to prep the store for business for the following day."

good,"The IT department is very competitive.  If you do not agree with the CIO or she does not like you then you are out.  Yes sir kind of culture.  PVH management is not open of new ideas, must be a yes boss kind of attitude to work in IT.  Overall company is good but lots of polities between departments which effects everyone.  Very stress full environment."

My hardest part getting employee to work consistently and have a managers on board with enforcing rules. My customers gave me great joy and reaching goals."

good,I packed clothes into boxes for shipping. Learned how to use a gladiator/telzon. Also worked in induction learning the computer system for putting clothes onto trays that drop the clothes down to shipping. I loved my co workers and all the raises they give. Good benefits. The hardest part I guess would be that there was not very good communication between the managers. We were told how to do something differently from each manager. I really enjoyed the people I worked with though and having good insurance and the pay was good.
good,management needs work on how to communicate with the associates
good,Great friendly atmosphere to work in on store level but for many workers they showed little to know loyalty. Pay was not on the level it should of been.
good,Huge company with a lot of advancement opportuntities due to the large diversity of brands and job functions. There are a lot of management years. Employees generally dont leave unless they are asked to
good,I really enjoyed working for the company but I want to work for my self eventually. While there I was on the safety committee also I train new hire and temps .
good,"PVH is a nice place to work. Great benefits and perks with working with the company. Management is overall is okay, but they can use some improvement with communication with the associates."
good,Good company to work for. Great perks. Good benefits. Summer hours. Casual dress code. Friendly coworkers. In house cafe with reduced lunch costs & seating.
good,It was ok working here. I mostly miss the pay and the medical benefits. They top almost any job I have ever had when it comes to benefits. Full coverage no deductible.

good,"Overall a great place to work with amazing people and product! I learned a lot about sales,  customer service, and organization while working there!!!"
good,"for me since I worked in different retail stores this company I rated 8 out of ten. If I have a chance to go back again I will, love my work and the employees around me. Very good teamwork."
good,"The best part about retail is that no 2 days are ever the same.  PVH is a company that has a ton of opportunity for motivated associates.  It is a fast-paced and demanding culture that is not too corporate but sufficiently professional."
good,PVH  was a place where you could work and make some relationships with some good people.The management team there were decent. I had an reasonable experience working there.
good,Good benefits. Excellent corporate culture. Enjoyed job very much. PTO was liberal and began with three weeks vacation plus 12 holidays. I would recommend PVH.

good,Great company to work for. Lots of opportunities to grow your business. There website provide tools and training. Great benefits. Flexible hours.  Best part was meeting some amazing people.
good,"Co-workers are the best thing about the company. Open positions, including management, fill according to the friends and family network and advancement opportunities are rarely based on merit or actual qualifications. My initial impression of PVH was positive. After five years I am seeking employment elsewhere."
good,"Typical retail, with the exception of employee appreciation by upper leadership which was phenomenal. Salaried position required some OT."
good,A typical day at PV consist of scanning designer undergarments and having them shipped out. I learned how to use a handheld scanning gun and learning how to maneuver through it and knowing its different functions. The management could be better. I love the older coworkers because they do not keep up drama. The most enjoyable part of the job is break time.
good,"Great group of peers, and generally departments work together for overall building success.  Still relatively new operation and is still learning how to properly plan and execute."
good,Very busy and always something to keep you busy. Never a dull moment. On the run constantly to get done what needed to be done on schedule without getting behind. Everyone was always friendly and once they learned that I was there to get my job done in an efficient manner they were more willing to help me by keeping me informed in the case that I got busy with something else. I stayed busy with a schedule that I created myself to get my job done as promptly and efficiently as possible. The hardest part of the job to get done was keeping up with what had to be done next. The most enjoyable part of this job was my coworkers and getting to know them. Also I enjoyed doing my job well enough and being complimented.
good,Fast paced to work. Enjoy working with co-workers and trying to have fun while working and helping customers. Learn to multi-task and finish the priorities on time. I have learn from some of my Co-Managers the things I haven't learn and on how to handle things by myself. The most enjoyable part of the job is your having fun and meeting new people and making new friends. Helping customers and giving them a great impression.
good,"PVH Corp is a great company to work for.  They have incredible benefits that some companies don't offer anymore like a pension plan.  For me, working in an office wasn't exciting enough.  I didn't get to interact with my co-workers a lot and our direct supervisors didn't seem interested in our advancement in the department.  The hardest part of my job was not going insane when I had no work do."
good,I loved working for p.v.h but it wasn't secure after the fiscal year end production got slow and my assignment eventually was ended
good,As a merchandise coordinator for PVH my job was all about the product. Making sure all stock was out and looking fresh. Working with managment of different dept. stores for placement and branding opportunities. Ensured best practices were in place. I enjoy seeing a beautiful and lucrative shop at the end of the day.
good,"Large corporation. Structured, corporate environment"
good,I think this place gave me a great idea of how to provide customer service to others since there were a lot of people who would come to the store on a daily basis. The other employees were cool and friendly as well and the boss wasn't too much of a stickler on your schedule. A fairly flexible place to work and decent income.
good,"Working for PVH is great to be at everyday, the people are wonderful and they really have amazing work culture that I cannot stress enough, work balance that is unmatched with weekends off. If you happen to work on the Wholesale side as oppose to the retail side of things. Also within PVH the umbrella you have Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage Brands so if you are thinking about applying for a job you can apply thru the list of what I gave you."
good,I loved working at PVH Corp it was a wonderful experience and if I ever get the Chance I would love to go back. It’s a fast past office environment where you are on the computer & phones all day. It definitely gets easier the more you do it and the employees are more than helpful.
good,My views of PVH are they contract /outsource and I dont agree with the fact they are not hiring permanent staff from these outsourcing as much as they should or often as they should.
good,"This is a good company to get your foot in the door to put on your resume.  My time was short there, but I'm sure if I had a good experience, I would have advanced my career at that company.  I had a short experience here, but during the time I was there it did not have the correct management and staff."
good,"The varies positions is fast pace and stressful at times because of management. The benefits are not the best because you pay for Vision, Medical, Dental and there is no PTO."

good,"Mon expérience chez Tommy Hilfiger est différente chaque jour lorsque je me présente à a mon poste de travail. J'ai beaucoup appris et grandit au sein la de compagnie PVH. Le management est un peu complexe, on est alentour de 45 employés tout au courant de la journée. L'ambiance de travail est très dynamique. On est une entreprise très ethnique et on partage les idées des différentes cultures. Mon poste comme lead des caisses et parfois très difficile car notre clientèle est très demandante. Ce qui est  très agréable de mon poste est l'approche au client au courant de la transaction de ses achats."

good,"I learned how to sensor clothes, how to do inventory, returns and exchanges and floor sets. There is always something to do besides customer service. There is nothing difficult about this job except when we have a visit, we need to have the store ready. It is a teamwork job so everyone has to finish their duties on time. The only bad part of working there are the hours. Not enough hours to pay for bills."
good,"hard working atmosphere with intelligent co-workers.  very structured when it comes to job responsibilites; most people only concern themselves with there immediate job responsibility.  ""Big picture"" thinking is only used in upper-managment. Overall a good place to work."
good,PVH maintains fast paced working environment with highly qualified results driven professionals.
good,Everyday is filled with tasks to complete and people to help. There are tools and people all around you to help you succeed and learn your business. The upper management is readily available to both give and get information from. My co-workers are like family and we are all there to help one another succeed. The hardest part of the job is sometimes completing said tasks within the time frames due to payroll and amount of tasks given at once. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers and and leaving with pride on how your store looks.
good,Focus on doing a productive day of work and doing a good job to the best of my ability.
good,hours are rather demanding with nights and weekends

I was treated like I was apart of the team and learned so much from my coworkers. I couldn’t have ask for a better first internship and I’m grateful for the time I spent and knowledge I gain at PVH.
good,Stay busy and do your job then you want have any worries at pvh. The supervisor stay on you they micromanage a lot do stay busy at all times. The work isn't hard at all.
good,PVH has incredible benefits but the pay in Jonesville was on the lower side. There were a lot of females in the Supervisor and Team Leader ranks but only 1 in senior management when I started. When I left 2 1/2 years later there were only 2 compared to 11 males. PVH is strong on promotion from within and encourages ambitious employees to obtain their bachelor degrees to advance.

good,"Unfortunately, I wasn't with the company for long.  I enjoyed the concern they had for proper health and safety. Before each shift we gathered for some light stretching and communication of the days goals. The crew and management was very helpful in training."
good,"Was a credit intern, did the same thing every day. Very little in terms of career advancement and the group was rather mundane. Good experience though"
good,"During this job I enjoyed my surroundings but I dislike management standards.The work was fairly easy to most, but there was times when we did not have work."
good,Phillips Van Heusen is an excellent company to work for. I would recommend them to anyone that enjoys retail management and customer service. They invest in the training of their employees.

My co-workers were mostly sales associates that worked on the sales floor. They helped me transfer the merchandise that I processed to the sales floor.

good,PVH Corp is a company with a lot of moving parts.  As a supervisor you are given the task of handling a lot of responsibilities simultaneously while working in an union environment.  The management team is team oriented and the associates are willing to help for the most part.  The most challenging part of the job is handling over 50 associates in three different departments at once.

Your experience will likely be determined by how your professional desires/goals are met and by your relationship with your manager.  Every dept is different.  My day varies.

I've learned a lot about special handling in this job. Co-workers are very nice and reliable to their work. The hadest part of the job is standing up on concrete all day and we have mandatory overtime on Saturdays and/or Sundays which I don't like very much. This job is overall very fun and a good place to work at"
good,"Non-stop at register and cleaning up and fixing mechandise."
good,"I have been with the company for 7 years, and I could say I have gain experience in management. My supervisors are willing to take time to teach processes that will benefit the company and of course myself. "
good,A typical day at work basically consists of filling out paperwork and answering employee questions. I learned what the daily activities of lower management are like in addition to how a distribution plant works. The culture is very laid-back and easygoing with overall morally good people in leadership positions. The hardest part of the job is working with new employees who may not have much work experience. The most enjoyable part of the job was conflict management and helping employees that were down on their luck succeed.
good,I had family issues and if I didn’t have to leave then I would still be there. Great environment and never lacked amusement even on the worse days. I enjoyed the people.

good,on a daily basis I  had to make sure all the task that were given to me was complete before my shift was over. Making sure our my area was clean for the next shift.  The management here was great willing to teach you and help you with any questions you had.  I learned how to work with others and everybody's different personalities. The job wasn't hard since I have a lot of experience in warehouses. The enjoyable part was getting to meet new employees and making new friends.it was a great place to work but Sadly the company had to relocate to another state.

good,they need to consider the temps more they act like its ok not to give temps any hours we have bills also not only permanent people many times we drive to Pvh just to be sent back home
good,"I really enjoyed working for DSW. They strive to care for their workers and their customers alike. They have many programs and rewards for their employees and they have a great motto and guidelines in order to make you job the best one! I learned a lot about designer brands and shoes. This position set me up to be successful at Athleta. They taught me how to keep asking questions to get the customer involved. They were organized on the floor, so putting out inventory was a snap. The hardest part of the job was keeping the clearance area clean and making sure that every shoe had a mate. I just wish the managers actually cared as much as the company wanted them to. The general manager always on edge and became anxious and overwhelmed very quickly. Also, It was hard to approach my managers easily with issues or concerns. Some managers had to be ""in the right mood"" or you would get a negative answer and sometimes smart remarks. They have a great plan they just need to figure out how to execute it. I also wish that the company didn't encourage micromanagement.It was really hard to do anything on my own. I felt like my managers would watch my every move.  Overall, I really enjoyed working here and was sad to leave."
good,I love my job. What a fun and exciting company to work for!!! All of the management team have been very helpful in my time here. I have learned a lot about the company and my role in HR

good,the management team I worked under was great. They insured you were properly prepared to do the job they needed done. The only issue I had with the staff was the associates were younger and didn't realize the importance of coming to work with a mindset to get the job done.
good,"Good company, good environment, good people. Great benefits, Good organization. Excellent products. They are really committed  to employees. Great experience."
good,"i been working for PVH for the last 5 years and I am still a current employee ,the company offer a great environment where a fun and professionalism can match together in a typical day at work  ."
good,I would not work here. the benefits are great but everybody has that line where enough is enough. It seems like the goal is for everyone to stab each other in the back.
good,Senior management is playing catch up in a world that changed many years ago from a tech point of view.  Dept vary.  Would highly recommend working here.
good,"I enjoyed working there. endless possibilities. Great people, easy to learn job skills, but always something to do. Very family oriented. Always someone willing to help teach you."

good,A very fast paced environment. Work together as a team. Learn how different customers processed their orders and how they want to receive their products in a timely manner. Great co-workers to work with. The hardest part of the job would be when there's a lot of orders to be shipped out at the same time with the little time that was assigned. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people that come from different environments than yours. Also getting to move around the building and learning new jobs. It's a new adventure.

good,"A typical day at PVH - Tommy Hilfiger would be at least two (2) associates opening the store and starting shipment. We would put all of the product onto bakers racks and proceed to fill the sales floor. Once the sales floor was full, we would prepare to open the store for business with our shift kick off meeting. A lead sales associate or manager would read off numbers for the previous day and how they compared to our projected sales from the corporate office. We would talk about things that could help us throughout the day i.e. greeting customers, helping each other on the sales floor, answer any and all questions from customers. After the store would open, every hour on the hour a manager or lead associate would read off our current sales for the store and how we can do better! The hardest part of this job for me would be keeping up with the constantly changing markdowns and promotions set up by the company. Once the store closes we would straighten the entire store back to TH Company Standard and if there were markdowns or new promotions for product we would stay until everything was priced correctly. One associate would stay with the closing manager to finish the paperwork for EOD."

good,I have never worked at any other establishment before like this one.  I loved waking up in the morning knowing that this is where I get to go for work.  The head technician was a great mentor and co-worker.  Even the users who computers I needed to go fix were great people and most remembered me by name. Some even asked for me specifically to fix there problems.  I never thought I could learn so much in that short amount of time.
