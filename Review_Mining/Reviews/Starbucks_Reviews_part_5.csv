Working with my fellow partners is always enjoyable since we always work as a team. And are always ready to help each other. My SM are always there for me be it work or personal matters. Could not ask for a better work environment.
good,"Work with great people, flexible hours, and an awesome experience. I learned to work as a team. One of the hardest things working here was opening, the location I worked at opened at 4am so I had to be there at 3:30. I also enjoyed the morning rush, always kept me on my toes and definitely kept me awake during my shift. Also coming home after every shift because the smell of coffee."
good,"I worked at one of the busiest Starbucks' in Ottawa, where in a given half hour during peak hours, in excess of 60-80 customers served would be customary. As such, when you are responsible for making all of their drinks, the job is stressful. The job has further taught me how to cope with stress and it is for it that I may mostly attribute my ability to multi-task to the extent that I now may. Under such conditions, working in close proximity to the other staff members, you grow close to the other employees and I can consider most of them good friends to me now. The best part of the job is working with such amazing people and the probability of encountering so many great people in a given day."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks was always fast paced, which I loved. I was always dealing with customers, making sure they were satisfied and happy and willing to always come back into our store. I worked with a team to make sure the store was up to code always. We considered eachother partners rather than coworkers which created an amazing work culture. I would say the hardest part of the job sometimes was keeping up with the large rushes of customers, but as a team we always got it done!"
good,"Best company I have ever worked for, it broke my heart when I no longer needed a second job. This company really knows how to take care of their employees. My only complaint would be I wish they paid a little more, but considering all the free stuff you get along with part time benefits, it's completely worth it. Starbucks for life!!"

good,"A typical day at work is fun and fast-paced! Management has always been awesome, they really just want you to succeed in whatever you do and move up in the company if youd like! The workplace culture is so inclusive, you wont work there long without making friends!

good,I think starbucks is a great company to work for because they really work with you and I feel like they really care about their workers. I love the benefits they give and I just love the all around feeling of the job.

good,"A Starbucks team is like a second family which makes it a fun atmosphere. I learned to come out of my shell and become more confident. The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting new people and knowing you made somebody else's day better. I think the hardest part about this job is sometimes personalities clash and customer complaints about things that are out of your control, for example where the menu is located in the drive-thru, not having certain ingredients for the so called Starbucks secret menu, not serving enough gluten free pastries and lunch items, and the most hard thing is leaving a company that actually cares for their employees."

Even though it is such a commercial brand type of service, Starbucks still manage to make itself stand out like a local coffee shop by building that bonding between you and the community. We have such colorful and unique clique of staff and that really helps to reassure to them that each and every location is different in our own way."

good,"Basically, a typical day at work consist of me coming in and making sure everything is in its right place. What's more, I check in with the previous supervisor to find out any additional information they may have for me before he/she departs. For example, they let me know who needs breaks and who has already had them. Transitioning from a barista to a supervisor really helped put my leadership skills into play. I enjoy putting people in the right positions to be successful, because essentially when they perform well it means that we as upper management are performing well. I would say the hardest part of the job is feeling like you are setting your team up for success. Its sometimes hard to see if your are because you may be use to doing something one way but in reality change might be needed. Lastly, the most enjoyable part of the job is undoubtedly the different connections I have built with the customers. I love the people."

good,"I worked at UNR Student Union Starbucks from 9-1  Tuesdays and Thursdays during the fall and spring semesters only."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks usually consists of taking orders on the register, talking to customers and getting food. Cleaning is also a very important thing when it comes to this job. Working on drive through is another benefit, and working on ""Customer Support"", which is making sure the condiments are stocked, and all other supplies are stocked behind the bar and register. I have learned a lot at this facility. What is the most important? Patience. I have had to learn a great deal of patience with working this job, seeing as though some people can be indecisive. I have also learned about keeping a customer engaged in conversation when business is busy, and always knowing the customer is right!! My co-workers? They're amazing! working at this job actually feels like family. Everyone is very close, and it's always an honor to go in to work. I have never loved a job more than this one! The management here at this facility is very well done, and easy to follow. All jobs have their hardships, the one at Starbucks would be the rushes we get. It gets overwhelming sometimes with all the customers and having to do certain things, but it always pays off in the end when they leave with satisfaction and a smile. The most enjoyable part of the job has to be working so closely with the customers and getting to know people. I love being able to call people by their names! It's always an amazing feeling."

I was not getting paid for this job it was only volunteer work.  It was a great place to work and I learned that we all have needs and that we need to be there for each other. the hardest part was that no one else was willing to step up and volunteer for the position and we didn't have enough people to take turns. The most enjoyable part was to greet and meet new people as I served them their coffee.

Most enjoyable thing about Starbucks is the customers. Our customers are the best ever, they come to Starbucks on a daily basics just to see us. It's the best feeling and relationship ever."

good,"You get to meet so many great people, you learn how to work as a team regardless of personal conflicts. Management is very understanding, and will work with you if there is an issue with scheduling or an emergency. Most enjoyable part of my day is when its time to close, just kidding. Seriously, is when there is a customer that comes in that has never been to Starbucks and they ask you what is YOUR favorite drink or food, and you tell them and they trust you enough to give it a try and end up loving it!. Its gives me so much self satisfaction!"
good,"Working at Starbucks was stressful, invigorating, and adrenaline pumping. Literally the fastest paced job I have ever experienced, service with a smile and connecting with the customer was the goal; make the customer happy, bring them their order correctly and expeditiously, increasing sales and clientele. The team was great; very friendly and cooperative. New York being my birthplace the rush times were probably my favorite because everyone moved quickly, to see the skill and enjoyment in the work ethics of the team was incredible and impressive. Starbucks supports college students who work with the company with the college achievement plan which is great, we got tips on wednesday split amongst the team which was nice, and management was wonderful."
good,Working at Starbucks was a very fun place to work because it was very faced paced job. Learning all the drinks and how to make them was a challenge but i enjoyed it. So now that i go to Starbucks i know exactly was is in the drinks. All of my co workers were fun to work with.

Working at Starbucks has taught me how to deal with customers more effectively, how to be quick at my job, and always have a friendly face all the while building great relationships with my co-workers. This company has helped me on so many levels in both my professional and personal life. The one thing that makes my job the most difficult is when our inventory is low due to a shortage in the warehouse, This makes it difficult to serve our customers to the best of my ability and makes our customers unsatisfied. My favorite part of my job is that I've been given so many opportunities to advance my career and move up in the company. If you're ever looking for a job and see an opening, by all means pursue a job with Starbucks, you won't regret it."

The best part of my day is knowing that I affected a persons gloomy mood and changed it just a bit happier. This job has taught me a lot about the little things and how they can go a long way in changing the view of a single person. My managers and coworkers are some of the best people I have met. They all bring a unique side to our store and it is very refreshing that we all are not cookie cutter copies. They are very supportive and helpful even when it comes to furthering your education, meaning that you will not be working with them forever. This job does however have some difficulties in the aspect of the customers. There are times when you may have customers that no matter how much help you give them they will never be satisfied. It is difficult to just accept the fact that your smile and kindness will not always be received. I do find it to be stressful when we have a lot of customers and are low on staff because we want to make sure we have their drinks and food given to them in a timely manner. There are many benefits that the company gives and is work looking into."

Management is orderly and flexible.  Co-workers are like family.  Helping and caring for each other.  Hardest part of job is getting threw the lines of people during rush hour.  Most enjoyable, being genuine and friendly to the customers."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks can be very chaotic at times, but it has its good days too! The ideal is to go into the store and having all the tasks already done..but some days that isn't the case. It can be difficult to try and complete your opening, mid day and closing tasks while there's a line out the door, but if you have amazing partners on shift with you, it can be a breeze. I've learned a lot working for this company, I feel like I'm better at multitasking, and that my customer service has improved because that is one of Starbucks' main focal points. Working there for almost 4 years, I've seen my share of partners come and go. While it is sad to see people leave I love to meet and connect with the new partners my manager hires on, I've also seen managers come and go. While being difficult at times, it really is a great experience, having worked for 3 very different managers, I've learned things about the company I work for. The hardest part about the job is being understaffed, I believe it is very unprofessional to not show up to work, or NCNS(no call no show) as we call it. Having to run around frantic, keep the store clean and customers happy on a busy morning or evening can be challenging but if everyone comes together and gives 110% then we can come out on top. One of the most enjoyable parts of my job, is connecting with the customers. I've seen many faces, and taken many orders, and I still never get tired of making someones day just by filling up a cup or helping them find the perfect mug or new flavor of tea. The customers is what keeps the company going, and they"

good,Work within this industry was very fast paced and demanding.

good,"Working for Starbucks is very fun. You learn a lot about all the different types of coffee worldwide. You also learn what pastries pair well with what coffee drink. It is a very fast paced job. Definitely requires a lot of multitasking and knowing how to expedite is a major plus. I've learned that not all coffee taste the same. I've learned how to take an order while making a drink from the previous order. Management and the co-workers were great. It was a team-player job. The managers and supervisors are very hands-on when it comes to needed help or just learning how to do something. The hardest part of my job I would have to say was in the beginning, knowing how many pumps of flavor or sweetener would go in each drink depending on size and temperature ranging from hot to cold. The most enjoyable part was the job as a whole, learning about drinks, learning customers and how they like their drinks, having regulars that look for you mainly to make their drinks, thats always pleasing and my team, we made our job fun no matter how hectic it can get."

good,I loved working at Starbucks! My manager was very understanding and caring when it came to our frustrations and concerns. There was always a great flow of communication with all the employees.
good,"As soon as you walk through the door and behind the counter its all hands on deck. Customer lines during the morning into the afternoon are out the door. Customers where I work are not very patient so you must be fast and efficient or else you slow everything down. All Baristas work together, its a team effort. Eco audits are stressful but rewarding. Managers are all fantastic, only the hardest workers get into those positions. Co-workers will become your best friends even outside the store. When a customer shows appreciation by more than just a ""thank you"", that is what makes it meaningful. I love this job, hired when I was 16 years old and it has been the best decision."
good,"Starbucks has taught me many things over the years. The fast paced environment taught me time management. During those early morning rushes we need to be quick and efficient. Working there has also strengthened the way I work with others as a team.  As a supervisor I learned cash management, managing a team, as well as  handling inventory. The hardest part would have to be getting used to waking up at four a.m."

I loved talking to customers and it was so rewarding to recommend things and see how much they enjoyed it."
good,"I would say Starbucks taught me most of my customer service skills. On a daily basis I would have to handle unhappy customers and try to turn their frowns upside down.

You will always be working and on your feet during this job. However, I have never seen a company so strict on breaks as Starbucks. You will be given your breaks no matter what, even if it means that productivity will slow without you. Management is excellent and the benefits are outstanding! Unlimited beverages during your shift are included, as well as one free food market per shift. The hardest part of this job is definitely multi-tasking. You will be asked to do several things at once, while maintaining a positive appearance and interacting with guests. The most enjoyable part is definitely watching your guests leave satisfied, as well as being able to work with an outstanding team who in time become family."
good,"I had fun working here, as everyone treats each other like families. Sure, there are customers who are difficult to deal with however, we had our store manager to defend us if it really is not our fault.

You’re preparing delicious beverages in a highly paced environment, constantly running back and fourth, and throughout all of the orders you have to create a genuine relationship with the customers. I've learned how to deal with people in a berserk environment and in heated situations. The hardest part of the job is making sure everybody is on the same page and getting things done efficiently because we are a team. When one person slacks, it drops everybody back. The most enjoyable part of the job is making personal connections with our customers."

I like working with our team, working things out together as a team is the best because everyone looks up to us as a team. The hardest part of my job is explaining to customers, sometimes we have difficult times with what they ordered or we might of made a mistake but at the end we always make it right for them and try to content them.

I have worked with two different managers since I have been working with Starbucks and both of them have been awesome. While working here I have learned a great deal about the importance of every customer that walks through those doors. Their business not only keeps money in my pocket but most of them have become family. The hardest part about this job I would say is memorizing all the different drinks and knowing the sequence in which they are made. It took me almost three months to be able to make drinks and have them out the window or out to the cafe in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part is the friends i have made while working here. I honestly and truly love each and every one of my coworkers."

good,"This job was my favorite job I have ever had! You must work weekends and prepare to be really busy and learn to multi-task when attempting to maintain this job. However, the positive customer connections/ the pride from building skills with coffee and lattes/learning to work with your team...it makes it all worth it."

good,Wonderful atmosphere with amazing family-like relationship between coworkers/partners. I have never felt so much professionalism from managers along with genuine care and concern for each individual.
good,"Working at Starbucks required a lot of knowledge such as knowing the all the beverages and how to make them, being able to up sell to customers, and knowing all positions of the store and being able to work that position when ever it is given to you. Must be able to work as a team with co workers. Working under stress would be the hardest, but also the most enjoyable because once the rush is over, I felt very accomplished. I learned communication skills and how to deal with unhappy customers and make it right."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work! the benefits are great, the opportunities are innumerable!  My co-workers are really great people and wonderful to work with. Starbucks partners also get stock grants, and discounts on stocks.

good,"-kind of time working hours"
good,"Having a daily interaction with customers is the highlight of my day."
good,"I would come in, and be really excited to see all the other colleagues, which were more like friends then coworkers. You would learn new drinks, new techniques to make your job easier and serve people faster. Most people would find the multitasking and making drinks and putting people through being hard but its actually really easy when you get a good flow to the way you do it. Best part about the job is all the great people you get to know and people who become your regular customers and best friends."
good,"La empresa es muy buena, da muchas oportunidades de crecimiento, apoyan a los estudiantes y pagan muy bien, los horarios de trabajo son flexibles y te apoyan segun sean tus nececidades"

good,During my time here I worked part time. I helped in the office with tasks that needed to be done . I learned all that I could while there.
good,"This is a wonderful company to get started at. It is pretty easy to move up in the company if you put your mind to it. Of course it isn't all fun and games you do have to work but, the majority of the time the customers and coworkers make it all seem pretty easy. Now when you get busy it can get a little crazy but, you just have to breathe and tough it out."
good,I love working for the company. I worked for 5 years and wanted to do something different. Starbucks you are the best! I meet different guest and i learned how to actually make coffee.
good,"The most difficult part of the job occurs during training .This is  when you have to learn  about making a bevy of drinks. Soon though ,it becomes muscle memory and it gives you the greatest sense of accomplishment. Additionally, no other company enforces commitment to respect for each other and for the customer  . Starbuck's team members become your 2nd family. They are kind , caring, honest ..... working here brings out the best in everyone."
good,i love working at starbucks it is fun and my coworkers are the best and always people i can rely on. i learned so much from other and myself. we would multitask and kept up communication otherwise wed be lost.

good,"Los partners son empleados muy eficientes y eficaces, se puede contar con el apoyo de todos ellos en cualquier momento."
good,This was a great learning experience for me! I really enjoyed my time working with all of the customers. You really get to build a relationship with them and it became more than just a job. It was exciting to see who was going to come in and what they were going to order. It was also a challenge to see you could make the drinks faster while maintaining a conversation with you customer. I enjoyed the challenge and the atmosphere everyday.
good,I get to work 4:30 am 5-6 days a week. first 30 minutes I start to set everything up. By 6 am i should be completely finished with the set up right before it gets busy. I learned to work under pressure and adjust to waking up at 3 am so i can get to work on time. I love my co workers and the environment. The hardest part of the job is probably the fact that it is extremely busy  and being able to adjust to working so early. The most enjoyable part is giving customers their first coffee of the day and getting their day started.
good,Starbucks was an up-beat and busy environment. I enjoyed the fast paced work and friendliness of both my co-workers and customers. Learning to make all the drinks was an enjoyable experience and there was always something new to learn. Given the opportunity i would love to work here again.
good,"A great place to work. Happy people, and a great way to meet and connect with other people. This is a home not only for customers but also for the employees."

good,Get benefits even for part time partners. Really accommodating to your personal life schedule. Able to relocate/ transfer to locations all over canada which is super awesome if you plan on moving
good,"Starbucks gives you many great opportunity, including general skills development such as customer service, people skills and time management. Company is very organized and training is very easily followed. The hardest part of the job is time management, because you need to be able to manage your time properly whilst maintaining the quality of your work."
good,"Starbucks has been the best company I ever worked for, relocation has been difficult to find a home store in El Paso, but still believe it has been the best job and employer I ever had. Making a connection with customers, making their individualized/customized drink, creating some latte art at times, and calling out drink, and the best part is when the customer takes first zip and smile back at you because their drink meet their expectations. That for me is satisfaction, creating the perfect drink all the time for customers knowing they were satisfied. As far as working with other partners, being treated as equals as our supervisors to certain extent of course, made me feel comfortable, respected and heard if I had any concerns. Very flexible with scheduling, again perfect job specially if a student, Starbucks also offers to pay for college at ASU, and the counselors along with your store manager make sure neither work or school interfere with each other."
good,"I have enjoyed working part of the starbucks team where every day as a new challenge. The team is managed and coordinated well. All my co-workers are friendly and I get along with them all. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the challenges. However, one always can learn from mistakes and try ti improve themselves."

good,I made great friends there and the manger was down to earth. The manger make sure she understand every employees' problems and did her best to solve.
good,"Great place to work, I learned alot while with the company. they are always moving forward and they treat their employees very well."
good,"There was a lot of drama , things were well organized good management. Ive learned that no matter how much confusion you always have to solve it without a customer around and always make the customer happy. enjoyable part is making my customers happy a typical day at work is always a morning and lunch rush because its a military base."
good,"Starbucks is a blast! Your days working here are never dull! Every partner has a chance to make connections with customers by getting their name and memorizing their handcrafted beverages. I have learned many skills, from cash management/handling, to customer service, and everything in between. The hardest part of the job is handling rude customers, and learning new beverages. The best part of the job is making connections with people that you would've never met if you didn't work there."
good,It was a very good and rewarding job but it was at the airport which was very far away from my house. The people that I worked with including my bosses were all very friendly.
good,"Starbucks is a fast pace establishment who's objective is to distribute excellent quality in all aspects. Starbucks is corporately owned and offer benefits, especially to the college students that often work there."
good,The workplace was fun and it was nice to have benefits as a part time employee. Had a great time while working with starbucks.
good,Great company to work for with so many benefits that are top notch in the industry. Learned a lot about business here and a great job for someone in college looking to start their career.
good,"I love working for Starbucks, I feel that they have the best interest of their partners in mind when they make changes without it effecting the experience of the guest.  The management is willing to work with each person so they can contribute to the team t their highest level."
good,"all in all, Starbucks is a great company to work for. I am so happy with my manager, shift supervisors and co workers. Everyone is so easy to get along with, I very very rarely have any issues with my partners etc. Working with Starbucks doesn't really even feel like a job."
good,I've learned a lot of things at Starbucks specially the terms 'Lean thinking' and the 'just-say-yes philosophy' which helps me to do better in anything.
good,"My typical work day included making the customer have the best experience.  With quality service, I quickly made the customers drink and also made connections with them on another level.  Within this part of my day, I also prepared the store for the morning crew: sanitizing, cleaning and restocking the store."
good,"XA Starbucks gave me a chance to start someone else's day  with a smile. Coffee is a form of art. Starbucks encouraged us to be artiest, yet care about our art buyers. It is always great to have someone come back and say ""hey this Great""."
good,Customers are sometime hard to deal with but the perks of working at the job are more than worth it. Loved every second of it! My only complaint is their piercing and tattoo rule.
good,loved interacting with each customer as I prepared their custom drinks. all the employees were very energetic and always in a good mood which made going to work fun

good,"A typical day at work would consist of greeting customers, making cafe beverages, keeping the workplace very clean, and completing tasks quickly and efficiently. At Starbucks, I have learned to really appreciate a work environment where everybody is like family. Management was amazing and always made sure the employees were well taken care of. My coworkers were energetic individuals with fun and professional personalities that never created a dull moment. The hardest part about this job was seeing when a customer was unsatisfied, but that's okay; it gave us a chance to offer what we can in order to let them leave satisfied and it gave us a challenge. The most enjoyable part about this job was everything."
good,"I love working at Starbucks! meeting new people on a daily basis, and getting to know each customers name and what they order on a daily basis. Everyone is super sweet and caring. Management is fantastic! Whenever I had an issue she was quick to resolve it"
good,"The tasks required by the job isn't difficult or overwhelming at all. The environment was very fun, interactive, creative."
good,"A great place to work that always provided a fun and fast paced working environment. Was always given every opportunity to exceed within the company, especially in management. Learned many necessary skills that will be needed for my future career."
good,"A typical day at work was great over all. when our customers would enter Starbucks, I would greet them, take their order and make which ever coffee they ordered. My job was to clean the bathrooms, tables, make coffee and be a cashier. Every body in the work place was great and got along with everybody/ every customer and lastly everyone came to work doing what they were suppose to do."
good,"Best job ever! Great when it comes to scheduling, company helps you with education and through hard times. There is no other place I would want to work"

good,"we were all about the customers and keeping them satisfied."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for! I really enjoyed my time there and I learned a lot about great customer service.
good,"Starbucks itself is a wonderful company, however if you work in a Starbucks inside another store, for instance Kroger, you are held to the Starbucks standards, but you are paid grocery store wages. I opened, made drinks, worked the cash register, closed, cleaned, baked, etc. I was often responsible for training employees. Management was terrible because our managers were not Starbucks employees they were Kroger employees and were often rude or inappropriate. I quit because they refused me a small raise when it was my time to get one."
good,"Great company to work for.  Being in management was tough because you are part of coverage for your entire shift and it's tough to get your ""management"" stuff done, such as schedules, etc. Typically you work a 9 hour day and take your turn doing all the positions, register, bar, drive thru, etc. Was a great company to work for just did not like the structure in the stores."
good,It is very busy at work.I learned starbucks customer service values.Their setup of employees is great. It is essential to serve customer well. I loved my co-workers. They were supportive.
good,"I love my job. Everyday i make someones day with great customer service and a smile. I make drinks and brew coffee daily. I also prepare food for customers. I've learned patience and urgency. I learned how to deal with people from all walks of life. My co-workers make my job 10 times better. What am I without them. My manager leads by example with excellence. The hardest part of the job is dealing with people who haven't had their coffee yet. Sometimes you are the first person they talk to in the morning. The best part of the job is making a customers day, who wasn't having a great one."
good,"A typical day at work is incredibly busy and fast paced, which is an environment that I love. Management is top notch, my co-workers are excellent and enjoyable to work with. I've learned a lot about coffee from training and customer service just from every day interactions with regular and brand new customers. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the rushes, but that's also the part that makes the job the most interesting."
good,"Great Workplace and Fun, 8 Hour Shift will get you a half an hour break and two 10 minute breaks, Flexible schedule and flexible 4-8 hour shifts, 30 minute break, friendly co-workers, great customers and regulars to connect with, a feel good job, high speed and ability to make decisions under pressure, must be able to multi-task"
good,"Of all the places I have worked, nothing was more fun and enjoyable than working at Starbucks. Not only did I learn a lot about different types of recipes but I also got a chance to improve upon my customer services skills."
good,"its usually starts off slow and calm. Once peak comes which is a 2 hour window in which we get the most busiest, it is crazy. we are moving constantly and working very hard but also having fun while we are having conversations with our fellow customers. its never a boring day at work. My co workers are awesome! they are super enjoyable and bring a laugh and smile to me and our customers."
good,Great benefits and fast paced environment. If you like to get hand ons approach Starbucks is for you. If you like being part of the community Starbucks is the place to be!
good,Great benefits working for this company. Able to have longevity and make new friends. Teaches you outstanding customer service as well.
good,"Deploying several people into their strongest position. Fast paced, under pressuring eyes and difficult customers, yet making excellent hand crafted beverages to fill everyone's desires. Handling the issues of a store that becomes your home during an 8-9 hour shift. keeping your home clean, fast working efficiently and blissfully with everyone working together to get the customers what they came for, a happy environment to enjoy a cup of coffee in. the hardest part is when a customer is not adjusting to our happy environment, and we must deal with them and try our best to make them happy, but the best part, is when they see us work in such prominent manner, and they let us know how much they appreciate our work."
good,"Starbucks is by far an amazing company for a 1st job. It teaches you how to be nice and friendly to people. My team was amazing, we served up to 130 customers in a half hour. We had fun while doing what we loved."
good,"Mi aprendizaje dentro de la empresa ha sido muy bueno, para desarrollarme personalmente y adquirir capacidades como trabajo bajo presión, el conocimiento sobre la forma de trabajo de una organización y trabajo en equipo"
good,"They put their people first. This is one of the best companies to work for. I was there on a contract for a few months, and unfortunately it did not turn into a permanent position. I want to go back!"
good,"If you enjoy working at an extremely fast pace and find coffee shops in general to be a good environment, then Starbucks is definitely for you!  I am a barista and I typically open so that includes prepping the iced teas, running rinse cycle/ cleaning the espresso machines, brewing coffee and making backups (i.e. mocha, caramel bottle filling, stocking).  I am always there through morning peak hours on Fridays and we are a pretty busy drive through location so it gets wild in there.  Between 8-10 cars in drive and 8-12 people in the lobby ordering at the same time keeps all the partners on their toes!!  Really the only hard part of the job is to not let yourself get flustered.  It's easy to allow the customer to ramble their order off and be afraid to ask them to repeat a little slower.  If you can learn to kindly ask them to speak a little slower then you are golden!!"
good,"It was a lot of hard work but coworkers were fun and the company environment is friendly. There is also a lot of opportunities to grow because they promote from within. The cons about Starbucks honestly is that there's a lot of work, the hours were long, the pay is not that competitive, you are forced to go from different tasks. I enjoyed management, they provide employees with many benefits and are all for improving you as an employee in hopes that you further your career"
good,great job meet great peoplethere wish i can take it home with  me really had a great time working with the people i met havent meet another job family like my starbucks team
good,the staff was amazing very hard working group of people. the hours were flexible. all ways happy to go to work. the pay was great.
good,Being a barista is awesome and you get a lot of interaction with customers. It is very demanding at times and can sometimes be frustrating. But sometimes the customers can also be rewarding.
good,"Great place to work, good people high paced get to meet a number of people from all over. A place i would recommend any one working for."
good,I had great co-worker and manager at this location. they were very helpful in teaching me all about working at starbucks
good,"The work was very challenging, and my coworkers and I became like a well oiled machine. I enjoyed creating moments with customers that improved their day. I grew a lot as a person from working here."
good,"its always a joy to brighten customer's and other partner's day! it takes ALOT of team work and efficiency to carry out a typical day but its always great... even though you can advance quickly here you are treated equally and with respect no matter what position you have, and if you ever feel its unfair management strives to fix any issue one might have"
good,"Very employee friendly, a drug free environment. Career advancement internships. Employee benefits.Competitive pay."
good,"Open restaurant make sure all task are done, register, coffee, food stocking etc."
good,The energy was my favorite part about my job. No matter how early or how late you were there it was continuously fun and rewarding. I will forever remember starbucks as an amazing job opportunity
good,"I absolutely loved working at Starbucks, it was a licensed store but I'm glad that's where I learned everything from great girls and an amazing boss! I was always learning new things and I hope to get into a corporate store eventually. Unfortunately the grocery store my Starbucks was in closed, otherwise I'd still be there!"
good,"A typical day of work consists of a friendly greeting by the shift supervisor or manager and guests. After clocking in, I would get assigned a position for the day. My preferred position is working on bar. We also have customer support, responsible for stocking, cleaning and supporting everyone else in the store by assisting to their needs. We have a drive-thru in the particular store I work in. And then there is a register position, in charge of cash handling, gathering of food items and tending to the Point Of Sale."
good,A Typical Is Fun And Lots Of Energy And Having A fun Shift With Coworkers And Employees And Lots Of On the Job Training But A structure as well to accomplish Our common Business goal and compete all daily tasks I learned how to be a great team player listener and leading a fun but very productive shift as well as self  sufficiency and Great hospitality and Guest satisfaction. There really wasn't a hard part except when I had to terminate a friend that was hired but it went quite well than what was anticipated. Working with the different Guest and proving them with the best experience that can be delivered as well as working with wonderful staff and employees.
good,"From day one I knew Starbucks was going to be a company I loved working for. This company is constantly making changes to cater to the growing needs of customers and it's employees alike. To me, this company is more like a family than it is a business. Having worked as a borrowed partner for several stores, I can say there has not been one Starbucks that I have disliked working for and it is because of Starbucks dedication to it's company and it's customers that it makes me happy to be there."
good,"I love working at Starbucks, it's a really great place to work at with great people. A typical day at work usually consists of me making beverages, handling cash and customer service. I've learned how to work at a fast pace and provide the best customer service. I really enjoy my working with my co-workers, they are super nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job would have to be working fast because we are always busy. My favorite part of the job would have to be seeing my customers satisfied."

good,"I loved working here so much! everyone was fun and outgoing"
good,It a good place to work. It has good benefits and great discounts.I love the culture and the customer that come in to purchase coffee.
good,"A typical day is very fast paced, chaotic, but fun!, I have learned how to prepare beverages, at a very fast paced environment, I am Barista/trainer, I don't find any part of my job difficult, I rather enjoy the fast paced aspects of it, I enjoy seeing my regulars everyday, and knowing there drinks as they walk through the door at my store."
good,I got to learn a lot about communication with the people around me and customer service. I also learned a lot of leadership skills and how to work and build as a team.
good,THIS COMPANY IS GREAT COMPANY TO BUILD RESUME OR STAY WITH I would not left this company but I had to move away and there was no starbucks in the area i was moving to

good,I really enjoyed working foe Starbucks.  Every day at work was a social event.  Work life balance was wonderful.  Starbucks provides a lot of tools to help make your job easier.  Starbucks is always improving how routines are done.

Pleasure to have worked with a positive and assertive Manager that cares a lot about his employees and customers.
good,Its a fun place to work for and you get to meet so many different people a day and you lean so much for working there. I learned great social skills and making coffee like a pro. The people there are so willing to help you learn!!
good,The most enjoyable part about this job would have to be our regular customers. They were always nice and friendly and made sure that we knew that we were doing a good job and were appreciated. All anybody ever needs to know is that they are doing a good job at what they do.
good,So many great things about this place. This location is inside of a college so there are many great different people I interact with. Bosses are amazing and laid back. Fun to work. Flexible for my school schedule.
good,"Working at Starbucks more than a job is a life experience, you can learn how to treat customers, you are part of a team, which teaches you to have co-workers"
good,"Its a job that requires good costumer service and skills such as communication , working as a team and leadership skills"
good,"Es un buen lugar para trabajar, se crean buenas relaciones de trabajo y amistades con los clientes frecuentes. Siendo un empleado con hambre de crecimiento se capacita y da seguimineto a cada uno. los momentos de retos son cuando se esta corto de personal pero al ser los equipos unidos y con liderazgo se logra que los cuellos de botella fluyan con más rapidez y en conjunto con la experiencia de cada uno posicionándolos en los puntos donde son más hábiles. La parte mas divertida son las relaciones que se crean con los clientes más haya de solo prestar el servició."
good,"I worked three days every week and every time it was about three to four hours. I had experienced in making drinks and being a cashier. I also needed to cooperate with co-workers so that we can give over the drinks to customers. The hardest part in this job would be remembering each step of different drinks as well as learning how to do the register when I was being a cashier sometimes. "
good,"A typical day at work at Starbucks consist of a fast-paced but friendly environment, I learn something that helps me as a person, I learned to listen very attentive; since most of our costumers customise  their drinks to what they wish.  Management is great, my boss works with me as much as she cans. The hardest part of this job would be that you can get some back and shoulder pain. The most enjoyable part of this job is the friendly regular costumers, which we get to build a relationship with."
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company that really cares for their employees. They offer amazing health benefits, they offer a 401k and will even pay for your schooling. It's a fast and fun job that keeps you busy and enjoyable at the same time."
good,"A typical day for me at starbucks is busy and fast paced. I have learned so much about coffee, team work, and dealing with customers in a fast paced environment. My manager is fun to be around, easy going, and very understanding in emergency situations."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is a hectic, yet fun time. The morning shifts generally include a solid amount of people heading to work, as well as plenty of students heading to classes over as Sonoma State University. With so many people coming in and out of the store/ drive thru, it is important to always be focused and on task. I have learned how to deal with customers who are not pleased with their experience and make it right so that they are a returning customer. I have also learned how to work well with others in order to make our work environment most efficient. My manager has made a great effort to make my work schedule correlate with my school schedule which I am grateful for. My co-workers are mostly my peers which makes this job most enjoyable. There are several co-workers who are a little older and even they are enjoyable. The hardest part of the job would have to be keeping a solid attitude when work becomes hectic. Often times co-workers can become frustrated if it is busy, or if there is a rude customer. The key to avoiding a rough work day would have to be keeping a positive attitude. I enjoy going to work, because I get to see plenty of my friends as customers and I have great co-workers."
good,"Starbucks was definitely one of the most stressful jobs I've ever had. I gained a new level of respect for people that work in those high stress speed environments. Through teamwork all those obstacles are overcome, and corporate wants their employees to express their individuality. Working with co-workers of great diversity was a fun experience, and that positive attitude latched on to each and every customer. Knowing many customers by name taught me that there is no substitute for hospitality, and that now comes out in everything I do. Overall an A+."
good,"Awesome team to work with. Training in depth of all hot and cold drinks,from teas to lattes. And from frapuccinos throughout holiday season to non holiday, tasty recipes you can hold on to for a lifetime."
good,"Get a cup of coffee; go to the backroom to get myself ready for another day at the job; apply appropriate outerwear (apron, cap); clock-in; go onto the floor and communicate with the shift supervisor on what my duties will be that shift, respectively; fulfill my responsibilities as barista/cashier to my best abilities."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. From the first interview you really get a feel for the working environment and the type of person Starbucks employs. "
good,"A typical day at work is arriving at 5-7 in the morning, which is no problem, so i can still enjoy the rest of the day."
good,A typical day I would go in bust my butt for little kindness from people but that's okay because im there to make everything better I loved to make peoples days go great.
good,"loved it. first job i would have my kids work this place, taught me a lot. if i made more money i would still be there. loved my co workers and my managers"
good,This is a fantastic work environment! The management is very understanding about work/life/family balance. My coworkers are awesome. Sometimes the most demanding part of the job is standing for long periods of  time in one position bending and stretching.
good,"it was a fun and great work environment, had its ups and downs but it taught you about customer service and how to handle different situations. Making the drinks was pretty simple after you did it over and over."
good,Every 16 year old's dream is to work in a chocolate shop. Th management was fantastic because it was a family owned business. Flexible hours and lots of free chocolate but sadly it closed down.
good,"Great company to work for"
good,I loved working at Starbucks and worked there for a little over 4 years. If your a good worker its easy to be promoted to Shift Supervisor. I was a Shift Supervisor for the majority of the time at Starbucks and loved that role. Pay is just ok but this job is for college students and younger not for people trying to raise a family. They do offer good health benefits.
good,"A typical day of work was coming in to a crazy, hectic floor and trying to get it back on track. I've learned so many things along the way, how to successfully delegate, how to work well with others and how to be a leader. Management was more of the ""do this, do that"" type, while my fellow partners and I worked together as one unit to get the job done. The hardest part of the job was the up-sell, and this was only because we worked in a drive-thru, which made it difficult as the customer could not see the product we were attempting to push. But, as a team we worked together to get the best seller on the front lines. The most enjoyable part about working with Starbucks would have to be the partners. They were always accepting of everyone and helpful. Starbucks is a family, not just a work place."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful place to work for with great people and great benefits. I love being able to have that interaction with people every day and making someone day better by just a cup of coffee. Love working in a fast paced environment and the rush of people that come in for their daily caffeine. I've worked at three different stores now and every single one of them has made me feel like a part of their family and by the time I had to leave and move to another store, I considered them my family."
good,"was my first job, love it and advanced with the company very quickly, and value their employee and take care of them very well, worked there for long time and was great time"
good,Love SBUX to death and would do anything for the company! The pay and benefits are bar none some of the best in the industry. It all boils down to the store you work at and the manager!
good,My time working here was amazing. I loved being able to travel with the company. It was an amazing work experience. The hardest part about working for this company was the lack of organization.
good,"As I enter Into Starbucks my second week after training I remember I knew the three basic drinks I was training for. I've learned that 2 of the drinks were backwards and the other drink had a secret Ingredient In It. My manger was very cool! His main goal was to get the co workers to get together as a family instead of co workers. My co workers was cool. they wasn't what I expected but they was nice. There really wasn't no hard part about the job, As long as you pay attention and listen to the customers than there wasn't anything hard about the job. The most enjoyable thing I love about working at starbucks Is the drinks, I love to make them and I also love to take a break and drink them. Best drinks ever!!!"
good,Talk about a great company to work for and be apart of! This company is always succeeding at everything! I love starbucks company and will always be a fan as a former employee and a customer
good,"A typical day at work consist of coming in making sure that the store is stocked, clean and running effectively and efficiently. Running the shift and giving positive and reinforcing good coaching moments with my team members. Putting the customers first and not letting them leave the store unsatisfied. Maintaining a clean and well organized work environment. Ensure that all cash handling is upheld. The things that I learned while working for Starbucks is patients and how to be a good multi-tasker. How to be a good communicator and listener. Also stepping up and leading a team of excellent partners. Management is awesome. She is very hands on and a terrific leader when times are tough on the floor. I have the most upstanding and hard working co-workers. They will go up and above on making sure that the shift and my job are being executed. The hardest part about working at Starbucks is dealing with the high volume of customers. It can get very frustrating and intense. But overall it's a fantastic learning experience. The most enjoyable part is the customers. They are so loving and understanding. Which makes the job even more better!"
good,"Very fun and fast paced environment. A typical day depending on what time of the day you're working would start with brewing coffee and teas, restocking and keeping the store front clean. All while helping any guests that may walk in mixing a wide variety of drinks for them as well as heating food. Lastly leaving them with a smile! (:"
good,i personally loved the core values Starbucks instilled in there employees. I would return is the right position was available.
good,"With my time working for Starbucks ive learned so much about coffee, the company's resolve and goals. They taught me to give to the community and it will give in return. The staff was extremely kind and friendly. They encourage everyone to do their best while boosting your confidence with pins; which show your customers you enjoy working with them with leting the customer know what how you are (ex: Friendly, helpful, cooperative etc.etc)"

good,My typical day working at Starbucks is very fun for me i always have time to talk to each and every customers i have a lot of regulars that comes in everyday and i know their name and drink very well my customers leave with a smile as always. theirs nothing really hard about my job but the most enjoyable part about my job is i provide the best customer service to each and every customers and some customer comes to Starbucks just to visit me because i make their day.
good,Starbucks was by far my best experience as an employee. I was treated like a person and I generally enjoyed every day at work. It required some skill to keep up with the fast paced work environment but overall it was always fun.
good,Je leert snel en perfect handelen in een korte tijd. Het is elke dag hartstikke druk bij Starbucks + iedereen op het station heeft enorme haast. Dus het moet ook nog eens snel. Starbucks staat daarbij ook nog eens bekend om vriendelijkheid en perfectie en dat moeten we wel waarmaken.
good,"Probably the best experience as a job ever. Fun managers, absolutely amazing benefits. Co-workers became some of my best friends. The hardest part of the job was when someone who ordered off the Starbucks secret menu(not affiliated with Starbucks) and didn't know the recipe only the name. The most enjoyable part was the freedom. They hire some of the most interesting people. I felt like everyone there was talented in someway, and were blunt straightforward people."
good,"Starbucks is more than a job, it's a place where the atmosphere is always lighthearted, relaxing, and genuinely a joy to be in. The line between customers and employees I have never seen walked with such grace before."
good,Starbucks has a great culture and seeks to inspire and nurture the human spirit.  I love the flexibility and benefits at Starbucks.
good,It is a fun workplace and very flexible. The management is awesome as well as all the genuine and hard working employees!
good,"Friendly environment with outgoing co-workers. Everyone is treated like a family, it's not about competition, it's about how you grow as an individual. Nothing was difficult, everything was laid back and comfortable. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know customers, learning from them and gain relationships with them. This company is a success to people skills."
good,Amazing trainers and people to work with ! This company is well structured and definitely take care of their employees. They made work fun and exciting to come too.
good,"I love being a barista. It is a fast paced, and customer oriented. My favorite part is making drinks, but I also loved being able to work with customers building a relationship between them and the store. The hardest part for me is spelling people's names on their cups. With practice I've been getting better. My co-workers at Starbucks have all been awesome. I've really enjoyed my time at Starbucks."
good,"I love working with my customers, when my usual customers come in i already know what kind of coffee they want before they even tell me."
good,Over the 12 years I spent at Starbucks I was able to move up and grow with there needs. the staff was always friendly and helpful.
good,I believe that you tread others the way you want to be treated at all times. And my manger did this at all times. She has a golden heart and I was very sad that I had to leave. I learned from day one and loved to make all the drinks. the hardest part of the job was learning all the codes. But the longer you do it the faster you learn it. I had so much fun working there. Meeting new customer each and every day is just amazing. And knowing there order before they are able to order is just priceless.
good,"Starbucks has endless amounts of benefits, 401k, special partner perks and discounts, stock options. Always felt that I would have a job that allows time flexibility, job security, easily transfer locations and Starbucks has delivered."
good,The job did not require too much effort to maintain you position. The company was always looking to promote people within the company. there was a dress code that everyone abided by. my favorite part of the job was to interact with customers and connect with them on a personal level. the least favorite part of the job was mainting the inventory such as if we ran out of a product then we needed to call another store to request if they had extra product. There was a lot to learn but nothing was too difficult to grasp and comprehend. There was also a lot of computer work when one becomes a supervisor.
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for they have great training and are very flexible with scheduling people. they help you succeed in the areas that you need support in.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work because of the culture that the company have created for customers and partners. The company offers great benefits for partners that includes health coverage, 401k, college tuition, competitive pay, vacation & sick pay, food & coffee benefits just to name a few. This job have nurture me into a professional and positive individual with an emphasis of ""making the situation right"" for our customers and partners."
good,"I work at The Place Starbucks, in Milton Keynes. The staff are friendly, and basically we are one big family. "
good,A fun scene to work for and usually very busy which makes the work days go by faster. Benefits are great and the coffee is even better.

good,"It is a fun,friendly fast paced place to work.They offer great benefits and there is room for groth.They offer regular raises."
good,"Si pudiera regresar de nuevo seria una partner, ya no puedo, pero la verdad es que es un ambiente increible, la gente tiene una vibra hermosa, nunca estas solo, todos te apoyan en todo momento, la paga no es tan mala, pero tampoco tan buena, se compensa al fin de año con el aguinaldo y el fondo de ahorro. Juro es el mejor lugar para laborar!!!"
good,"This is an amazing place to work!!! There is always something new to learn and new people to meet. The employees and management team are what really make it an amazing place for both customer and employee. Everyone works together as a team, and are always willing to teach you something if you ask, The best part about working here is the creativity you get to put into everything you do, such as making the drinks. Also, everyone is considered a partner and not just any employee which automatically makes the work environment equal. In all honesty, there isn't much to make this job difficult, other than rush times where you have a lot to do in a short period of time, which can be stressful, and the odd customer who just needs a strong shot of espresso. I find the hardest part to be the training because there is a lot to learn, but that all comes with time. If you work well under stress, this would be the perfect place for you."
good,"Excelente empresa que tiene el control sobre el manejo del personal asi como del crecimiento dentro de cada tienda, trabajo equitatito y excelente sueldo lo cual me hacia producir un excelente trabajo"
good,Starbucks maintains a small family owned feel regardless of the how large the brand has gotten. Customers and employee alike growing with each other.
good,"Aprendí a tratar a los clientes, llevar una buena relación con los compañeros de trabajo, trabajar bajo presión"
good,Working here a Starbucks was my life. I enjoyed it and I got along with every single peer. I grew tremendously and learned so many values that were great for work purposes and at home purposes as well.
good,"I worked at Starbucks off and on for years, mostly as a part time employee for supplemental income. I think Starbucks is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. The products are consistent and company culture is made clear and reinforced. There is room for advancement and the benefits offered to employees are outstanding. I worked mornings, I spent the day making connections with customers, asking about their day, offering them a pleasant experience on their way to work or school. I was a barista and a trainer. I made drinks, took orders, trained new employees. Starbucks encourages team work and partnership amongst its employees and managers. Working there remains one of the greatest experiences of my working life."
good,fun place to work.great partners and customers.great benefits and its a high volume store.i love making coffee and connecting with customers.
good,"Perform opening-closing duties, handle cash, answer phones, solve customer problems in a timely manner, create coffee drinks to order, greet customers with a friendly smile, maintain a positive attitude throughout the day. I learned different management strategies, time efficiency, and how to work in a fast paced environment."
good,"The atmosphere at Starbucks is often referred to as the ""third place."" On any given day I'll walk into work and be greeted by regular customers and local folk before even entering the door. I've been a shift manager for nearly a year now and thoroughly enjoy working with such an amazing team. This company treats its' employees well; it is not often that there is a collectively bad day. I've learned to develop relationships with other management and partners in general. I've learned about coffee culture and its place in the world. I'm able to excel in a fast-paced environment, problem-solve, and am able to implement intrinsic models of success. Without such camaraderie, I'm not sure I'd keep coming back."
good,"I just want something else. but if I can't find anything else, I wouldn't hesitate for a second to go back."
good,I enjoyed my short time here. The other people who worked here were great to be around and very helpful. My bar manager was the absolute best.
good,I loved this job and was sad that after I had my baby I could no longer juggle the hours with a newborn and going to school full time.  My manager was such a pleasure to work under.
good,"If you like to work in a fast paced environment, then starbucks is the place for you. While having to maintain the well brought energy you have tasks you have to fulfill by the end of your work day. This place taught me where I needed to focus my attention and what I needed to prioritize."
good,"Going though college you think you know what experiences you need to get in order to land that perfect job. One of the most overlooked and under appreciated sectors is the service industry. A few years out of college Starbucks proved the perfect place for me to regain confidence. I used this opportunity to learn tricks of the trade from a very successful global corporation. Earning a promotion as supervisor means you get to be a part of store operations to learn things about management, sales, inventory control, promotions, labor, employee management, leadership, customer service, and crisis resolution. Watching how to do it right has helped set me back on the right path. Learning successful customer service strategies has also proved to be a big advantage no mater what industry I apply to."
good,"Great supervisor, helped me to be able to manage different projects my coworkers that i had i still keep in contact with them we again was one big family and we all had each other back"
good,"Fun work place with supportive management"
good,I had the most fun at Starbucks! Management kept things light and i got to know the regulars very well. I moved to different locations based on my skill set and helped where I could. I was looking forward to advancement as it came. Starbucks always gave you something to do and always kept up with the learning. We were never pressured or had complaints while working. I had so much fun and will never forget my experience working there.
good,A typical day at work would be prepping everything for when the store opens to make the drinks at Starbucks. Cleaning and restocking items were always a part of your day. I learned to be fast paced when there were a lot of guests. I also learned how to make all the drinks on the menu. There was a great team at Starbucks we all communicated with each other. There were never any arguments that i know of between all of us. My coworkers were very energetic and that would motivate me to work harder. We had fun but were professional at the same time.
good,"decent benefits to employees, should offer more growth to individual employees; offers free food and drink when you come in and are on breaks.  offers benes after 20 hours of work per week"
good,"Great work environment, lots of opportunity to move up in company, management is very supportive. easy to go to work, time fly's when you're having fun"
good,"The days flew by! I learned to work with so many personalities and got a chance to meet someone new everyday. My managers were great, everyone was always so welcoming. Everyone was a team player. The most enjoyable part of my day was seeing my frequent customers."
good,"starbucks was a very fast paced job, it was my favorite for the fact i was always moving around and getting to help customers when they came in. i loved to see the smile on there face"
good,the menu was very hard to learn at first because of such a limited time to train you were thrown to the wolves a little bit but in the end after you get the feel of things it gets reallly fun and the people are great
good,"I have always been a Starbucks coffee drinker, and was excited to get the chance to work for them. My co-workers are the best, they are like long time friends! Very team based, as in no one gets left behind, or you feel left out. It does get stressful, and super busy at times, but interacting with people, especially our regulars, and getting the chance to make their day is what I love most about Starbucks. One of the best companies in my book."
good,"Starbucks is an excellent company to work for. The best way I can summarize working there is you get what you put into it. If you work hard and want to grow in the company, you can, if you want to remain stable or in a secure position, you can also do that. It has always been a great job and I thoroughly enjoy it. I would say the hardest part of the job would be some customer relations, holidays can be rough, but overall no complaints. I think that they're an excellent company when it comes to benefits and a high standard of ethics and morals. My coworkers are some of my very best friends, we all have so much fun and all of us enjoy working for such a great company."
good,"Starting to prep coffee, food, and store cleanliness about half an hour before opening officially at 4:30 am. Daily routines involved cashier for both lobby and drive thru while keeping the flow fast and steady. Store cleanliness and customer service where definitely two of the most important key factors in a successful store. When customers had issues with custom drinks, I worked with them to find a solution to make them happy. Happy customers are more likely to return."
good,Working at Starbucks I learned a lot about working in a fast paced environment and learning a lot about customer service. I was trained for two weeks and from there was able to make any drink needed to be made at Starbucks. I am very well when it comes to multitasking and being able to work under stress.
good,"A typical day in my Starbucks could be describe this way : i usually work in the morning. we all know that all Starbucks in the US get really busy, but mine is located at the Dulles International Airport. It gets crazy busy. i'm mostly a cashier because i know how to take care of the customers very well. So my job pretty much consist of connecting with the customers, get there orders, communicate it to the current barista ( could be me too often) for him to make the drink.  I'm often doing that or on the bar making the drinks or outside taking care of everything else."
good,"I honestly love working at Starbucks and wouldn't trade this part-time college job for anything else. It has taught me so many life lessons and not only is this my place of work, but my second home. My co-workers are like my family and make every shift go by quick and smoothly. Starbucks really lives up to their values and mission statement."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks would consist of having great customer service, Positive attitude, being outgoing and extremely friendly. Working at Starbucks is an extremely fast pace environment that has you multitasking several other positions such as cleaning, warming pastries, making Delicious beverages and dealing with the cash register. I definitely learned how to satisfy customers needs, and make high quality beverages. Coworkers are always friendly and in a up beat mood. The most enjoyable part of my job is leaving my customers with a smile on their face and gaining new friendships with them every day."
good,"Responsibilities included providing excellent customer service on the shop floor. Ensured all stock, deliveries, replenishment and presentation of the store was in clean and in place for the store to run operations. Also responsible for till reconciliation and auditing of money. Practiced safe food handling procedures on a daily basis, my manager in Canada was a very good teacher and I learned many skills such as Training new members of staff till competency, customer service skills and product handling Also responsible for till reconciliation and auditing of money. The hardest job was the constant cleaning, the most enjoyable was talking to customers."
good,I've been at starbucks for 5 years but work love to go back working there someday. I've been there the longest. worked with the best co-workers and i've been though maybe 4-5 before i left at starbucks. but i learned alot from them.
good,"starbucks was a great palce to work. the people was always friendly and nice. The work place could have been a little better,but orther then that it was great."

good,"Very fun and outgoing place to work. Moved to NC to be closer to family.  I learned many aspects of the company and customer care.   The easiest part of my job was making drinks.  The hardest part of my job was leaving my friends, co-workers and my supervisor."
good,working for sartbucks was awsome. the managers were everyunderstanding with thier employee and they would work with your to make sure that you were understanding the meaning of the company.
good,"My days with Starbucks usually started quietly and diligently opening the store at 4 am.  I learned just about everything anyone would want to know about coffee and tea from multiple platforms both company inspired and by my own interest in order to support my influence with guests.  My coworkers were young creative people who were ambitious and positive.  The hardest part of my day was cleaning floors and drains often splattered with coffee grains.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with incredible, fun loving people."
good,Starbucks is number one if you want to work in corporate retail/food. All of the wonderful trappings of a great job. Be prepared to learn everything about coffee
good,I have worked at Starbucks for two years now and can honestly say i have learned and grown so much with this company. Would recommend to anyone looking to create great customer service and hardworking work ethic.
good,"Love the environment and coworkers. Always accommodating to schedule and trying to help each other out to accomplish goals set by cooperate. Hardest thing was during rush hour in the store, but when it was over it felt accomplished. too bad the store was one of the ones that they closed down."
good,Great company that cares about their partners. Provided a lot of customer service experience. We want to give our customers the best experience.
good,One of the best places to work if you have an up-beat positive attitude. Be goal orientated and you'll make you're way to the top in no time!
good,"In this company, I learned to mix and mingle with varieties of people, and learned how to treat them and cooperate with them. I have learned to handle individuals in a most polite and friendly ways. Also, I have learned to manage the team and the coworkers in a most efficient way. Along with the district managers, our management team was way beyond the level of excellence. We were always supporting each other, and were always trying to come up with the new ideas to make things better in the work environment. The hardest part of the job was the job itself. Since the job is person to person business, where we deal with the services, not the products, I always kept my smile on in order to make everyone around me happy. Although I am an exuberant smiley individual, I sometimes had hard times, and it was not easy to keep the smile up. However the most enjoyable part of the job is that I felt loved by the customers and coworkers as they always cared about me, which gave me an warmth of a home. Starbucks became my second family."
good,"No complaints! Loved my boss, too! Although, if you ever call in sick, its the end of the world... wish they would trust their employees a little more"
good,"There are no typical days, you can either be placed on register, customer support, or bar. customer support includes (but not limited to) stocking, cleaning, writing up orders, making coffee. If you are on bar that day, you make drinks to the customers specifications."
good,"Siempre llegaba al trabajo con muchas ganas de aprender algo nuevo, mis clientes eran lo que mas acababa de la empresa, mis amigos, que son tu segunda familia, lo mas difícil era el día de pedido ya que tenias que organizarte bien para que uno te comiera el tiempo y sacaras de break a tus empleados, lo que mas me gusto fue la parte de atención al cliente ya que los clientes eran nuestros amigos, iban a platicar con nosotros a saludarnos, y dejar conocer esa parte de los eso es lo mas hermoso de trabajar en una empresa si. en cuanto a mi gerencia era un poco estricto, pero siempre consentir a mis empleados entre mas ganas le echaran más los recompensaba yo como persona, y como jefe."
good,Evryday starts great providing great costumer experiences with the fact of having fun. Everyday is a challange but doesn't take it any less exciting.
good,"It's so much fun to be a barista! It is difficult to learn all of the drinks that the company makes, but it is possible. The training is fun and extensive and you will feel confident in your abilities with time. Normally you spend the day talking to customers, taking their orders, making their drinks, getting their food, handling money, and cleaning your area."
good,"It was a great experience because we are like a family there. I was able to do multi tasking, developed my customer connection, passion and self confidence."

It gets hard when a customer is giving you a hard time but you have to keep your composure and do everything possible to fix any misunderstanding and work with the customer.

My co workers were amazing in my first store. They were always willing to help, no matter how many times I asked the same question. The hardest part was waking up at 3 am to get to work at 5am to open! But I did it. Wide awake, and perky. To wake up all my customers with a fresh cup of coffee. Most enjoyable part- everything. But really just being able to work for such an amazing company."

You are filled with colorful coworkers who share the same goal of satisfying your customers and connecting with you customers The most hardest park of the job is building bonds with your everyday customers , some customers come into starbucks more than once a day everyday of the week it saddens me to see some of our regular customers adventure off to new cities or states . above all the most enjoyable part of the job is our customers you meet along the way from all different parts of the world there is a lot of travlers in this city and many have very interesting entertaining stories that remind how big the world is ."

Had friendly competitions within the store to see who can sell the most beans and the prizes would be varies gift cards to local restaurants.

Hardest part of the job was waking up for a 4am shift, but work it coming in for a tazo tea or refresher."

good,"1. Generally speaking, management is wonderful. Some stores aren't that way, but you'd have to be pretty unlucky to end up at one of those. 2. Company values are some you can appreciate too. Starbucks has an open coaching policy. Anyone can coach anyone on anything, and it is used as a helpful maneuver to remind partners of standards, etc. Most companies will use it as punishment, but Starbucks coaching"

My management team and co-workers were very close. There was only 5 of us who worked at this shop. The hardest part of this position was learning how to adhere to a routine, and once you learned the routine, everything else was a breeze. My most enjoyable aspect about this job, was learning about the product and conveying it out to the customers and making sure the customers had a great experience."

good,At Starbucks it was always busy so I moved from station to station depending on which needed the most attention. At Starbucks I learned how to lead and train the new employees. All the stations at Starbucks had a standard procedure that needed to be followed. As the trainer I made sure all the new employees knew what was expected of them. The hardest part about working at Starbucks was the bad management. We were always short a person and we were always busy so it made it a little challenging to do everything with only three employees. The most enjoyable part was seeing on the happy customers when they got their drinks because I knew I had made their day.

good,"A typical work day at Starbucks consisted of coming to work on time wearing a smile along with your required work attire, and upbeat attitude ready to greet and service customers. When I would arrive at 5am I would prep coffee and pastries. I would also make sure that the lobby and bathrooms were clean and that the whole store was stock and ready to open. At 5:30am (6:00am on Sundays) we would open the doors then the flow of customers would begin to come in, then my job varied from ringing up customers, to grabbing pastries, coffee, and even making drinks always with a smile and light conversation. In between customers or if the flow of the store was slow we would then stock or do our assigned weekly task.  I learned a lot when I worked for Starbucks. We would have seasonal meeting about events, products, and selling methods. We would also have regular coffee tastings, were we would invite the customers to share in on the experience. At Starbucks my co-workers were always supportive, helpful, knowledgeable, and willing to do what it took to accomplish all the goals that were put in place in order to give the customer the best experience. I love the management at this franchise because they all started out in the same position as I did, giving great advice as well as a sincere understanding of personal situations, and resources on how to handle them. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was interacting with different types of people in the community, building bonds and enjoying great coffee.  I would honestly say that the hardest part of my job was leaving at the end of"

good,Starbucks is one of the best places I have had the opportunity to work for. The shifts are very reasonable and flexible and range from 4-8 hours each. The health insurance benefits offered to employees is great! The most difficult part of being a barista is probably being able to multi-task. It requires quick and fast thinking in order to maintain good customer service. The most enjoyable part of being a barista is the relationships you develop with repeat customers. Making the drinks is also very fun!

I loved my time working with them and found that people who are hired constantly complain about working with them as for I wont ever complain or whine about it. but it's behind me now, I'm looking for Barista position's elsewhere."

good,"Starbucks worked not only with my personal life, but also helped me get through college while making a decent living. The best part of the job was getting to know the customers and Co-Workers and working together as a team. The most difficult part of the job was learning how to lead all of the different types of people that worked differently and had many different personality types."
good,"Working at Starbucks was really fun. You meet a lot of new people every day, and you also build relationships with people you have already met previously. The co workers were fun and everyone has an understanding for the job. I've learned a lot of patience while working for the company. You deal with less than perfect customers from time to time, and you learn how to satisfy them with ease. For the most part, it was a great job to learn the basic of fast service."

good,"A typical work day would consist of me taking time to fill the needs (make drinks) for the customers. I have learned that some jobs take time to master and others simply come naturally, for example serving was easy once I got the gist of it but making all those different kind of drink and remembering them all took time. But I will say, it was so challenging that it made things fun."

The hardest part of the job is having to keep up with the orders as I am cleaning the bar. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers as they enjoy their beverage.

good,"This was by far the best job I had when I was 18 years old, I was always busy, never bored or not doing anything, there was always something to do at work. I learned so much about dealing with all types of personalities working at Starbucks. Our management was amazing, always helpful and on top of everything, keeping us up to date with new merchandise and new techniques of doing things. Of course co-workers were awesome but like any other job, there are a few co-workers who were very pessimistic and hard to work with but I dealt with them because I am a people person and am very optimistic. The hardest part about working at Starbucks was learning how to make all beverages hot and cold to perfection and not forgetting my ingredients, and since I dislike coffee it was horrible when i had to taste the new dark roast, mild roast and decaf roast during meetings. The most enjoyable part of this job was learning about the coffee beans, because it was something new that I did not know about."
good,It was always fun going to work each day just because you never knew what would happen. My manager was fantastic and my co-workers were like my family. It is very fast paced and the customers were so friendly.

I learned how to keep ongoing relationships with each customer and creating new ones. Management was best described as the uplifting team leader that kept everyone focused and able to tackle any obstacles. Everyone was friendly, including the co-workers and the customers. Co-workers all had the same mentality of working together, probably what led our store from having the highest sales in the district. Hours are flexible and the job allows you to learn management and how the company itself works. The hardest part of the job was having the work multiple shifts because employees would randomly quit without any notices. I enjoyed every aspect of the job: from meeting all types of people, learning different starbucks drinks, and experiencing the accomplishments achieved through team effort."

I have learned to be punctual and dedicate myself to the job. Costumers are the foundation of any company and services should reflect their importance. Partners are fun to work with as well as professional, and intuitive, always willing to help improve. The most difficult part was remembering the various drink recipes and hundreds of seemingly endless combinations, but as time would progress it became routine.

A lot of your customers are regulars so seeing them everyday and talking to some of them are like family. Starbucks also treats its employees nice with all the benefits and in addition to our hourly wages, baristas and supervisor have the opportunity to make tips which are no less than a dollar an hour. Management is very approachable as long as you do your job and they are always willing to help and coach you to improve in the areas in which you are weak. Hardest part of my job would probably be just trying to remember tasks to do and finishing them within your timeframe. Once you get your routine down, its pretty much repetitive from there. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people you get to see daily if you are a sociable person."

These would include things like breaking down all items and sanitizing them, cleaning out the espresso and coffee machines, closing out tills, cleaning cafe and bathrooms.

good,"A Starbucks Coffee tem como principal objetivo, que já é exposto em sua visão, acolher, inspirar e nutrir o espírito humano, tanto de seus colaboradores quanto seus clientes. Desde o início, na minha atuação na área, senti-me incluído e respeitado no espaço profissional, sempre ouvindo aos mais antigos de casa e desenvolvendo habilidades. A partir da entrada na rede, desenvolvi maior adaptabilidade aos tipos de pessoas, seus gênios e humores, tratando cada cliente unica e exclusivamente, satisfazendo as necessidades com que chegara em loja. Trabalho em equipe, onde todos são um, baristas, coordenadores e gerentes com um único objetivo. As diferenças entre pessoas não está a margem do convívio trabalhista, mas aprendemos a lidar e nos tornar mais unidos em prol da companhia. As tarefas são satisfatórias demais, ver sorrisos e encantamento a cada bebida entregue ao cliente nos traz muita alegria, contudo, é necessário termos, também, de lidar com clientes pouco compreensivos ou até mesmo, exigentes ao extremo. A partir daí, posso lhes garantir, todos que vêm com boas intenções são acolhidos, bem recebidos e têm a oportunidade de se juntar e ser um partner."

Everyday was long lines hectic, the constant shuffle and cleaning because the college students always had something going on whether it be exam week when we were open 24/7 or just a typical weekday. I learned the difference between a macchiato and a latte, what coffee beans provide the most caffeine, and espresso shots do not go bad after 10 seconds if not mixed with milk. Management was very helpful and always around if needed. I really enjoyed this job, but unfortunately I had to move."
good,"The job to have when you want to balance, school, family, and a personal life.  Some shifts you do have to work early and late but very rewarding by meeting new and returning customers.  Starbucks will train you to make quality drinks, work the register, and put out the pastries."

The customers are friendly and sometimes there are problems that arise such as the rushes, drinks that go missing or wait times, We try everything in our will to make the person's experience a good one. This also includes remaking their drink until they are completely satisfied with it. Everyone who works at this store are friendly and knowledgeable people.

The hardest part of this job I would have to say is the high expectations of making everything faster and more efficient than it already is. "

good,"Great job, fun work environment, good benefits, good training program. Hardest part of the job is when you're first learning - lots of stuff to learn and takes a long time.

Similar to other forms of employment which I have held this job may seem irrelevant from the medical world but in truth has caused me to develop beneficial habits I commonly use on clinical units. These habits include remembering details which may seem irrelevant, being able to decipher orders through a chaotic din, and maintain a personable jovial demeanor throughout. These habits have proved useful on units in situations such as codes. Additionally I am able to remember multiple complex orders and complete them accurately at swift pace."

The hardest part about the job was the hours were never regular.  I could be closing the store one day and opening the next.  This meant I had about 3 hours of sleep which was very draining.
good,"I had a fantastic experience with Starbucks. While I was employed as an ASM in a high-volume café/drive-thru store, I enjoyed a fast-paced, challenging, positive, rewarding and fulfilling position. Starbucks, while ensuring their standards of business to maintain their Legendary customer service to each and every customer, vendor and fellow partner, really encouraged partner/supervisor initiative and welcomed new ideas courteously. The benefits are generous, and the company went out of their way to accommodate a healthy work/life balance. Even when I was separated from Starbucks, due to a company-wide major lay-off of 1400+ ASMs, I did not feel any angst or animosity as the conversation took place in a sincere, compassionate manner."

good,"Multi-tasking is the basic work here. Doing the cashiering, make espresso drinks, receiving and checking the deliveries of perishable items and other products, doing the inventories and reports for the day.

good,"Normally my day would start in the early morning hours. Upon arrival to the store, I would first, ensure that I am accompanied by one of my colleagues, since it was against the companies policy to carry out any business operation alone. When the store would open, I'd ensure that the closing shift did everything properly, would make notes in regards to what was, if anything substandard for a future discussion. Then I would start either, working on the pastry case or setting up the daily operation (till count, setting up of POS (point of sale systems)), this would entirely depend on the role assigned to me as a shift supervisor or a barista. Upon successful set up we would open the store and greet our regular morning crowd. Soon after we would be joined with another team member to deal with the morning rush. Once the rush would slow down, I'd start working on clerical/paperwork, eg. make an inventory, make an order for store supplies, post any new policy/messages from the head office on the store's notice board etc. in between the aforementioned errands, I was assigned the position of shift supervisor, I would oversee and ensure that the partners breaks are allocated and taken. Upon completion of my shift, as a shift supervisor, I would carry out a handover to the closing person and leave the store."

That’s what I love the most; I think it’s very important to set you employees’ up for success.  The most challenging part of the job is the holidays; the line would be out the door. There were times when we did not have enough supplies such as syrup, cups, cup holder etc. We always made a way to get through and make our customers’ happy. I love the fact that I was able to interact with my customers’ and participate in amazing events."

From the amount of seconds steaming the milk, to the specific design in the drink's topping. I really appreciate my managers' guidance and training. She was helped me learn and incorporate my own personal spin on things into my job. I couldn't have asked for better co-workers. They range from teens, peers my age, and others 30+. They all bring in their uniqueness and make work fun. The hardest part of the coffee business would have to be keeping calm and cool when a customer becomes difficult.

I was entrusted and in charge of opening the store and taking the deposits to the bank. However, my favorite thing to do at Starbucks was to be the cashier at the drive thru window. I think I met more people here during a day than I did anywhere else. My first focus and priority was to make sure that every customer had a wonderful experience by engaging them in conversation. If the customer seemed like they were in low spirits, I would always try to cheer them up. I am very good with people so it usually worked. In fact I got so good with customer service at this company that after a while I had a massive amount of customers that learned my work schedule and would come in to see only me because of the wonderful experience that they would receive. In the end I wanted to pursue bigger and better opportunities in the sales and marketing world which has treated me well.

good,"Really good job. Really enjoyed working, learned alot about people."
good,"A typical day at work for me at Starbucks would be waking up early to set up the store for the day, then tending to the early morning rush of customers headed to work. I learned how to multi-task and work very efficiently to meet the demand of such a high traffic store. My management was always very understanding and cooperative with scheduling. Everyone at Starbucks is a team player and we always helped each other out when needed. The most difficult part of the job was finding the time to do the necessary daily tasks in between customer service, but this also taught me great time management skills. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I got to work with. Everyone in the community would visit Starbucks and so I was introduced to just about everyone from all different walks of life."

good,"This company teaches me everything that I need for my degree and I owe a lot to them,"
good,"Typical day would be helping customers and making coffee in a swift and efficient manner. Have to clean every single day but also be able to make drinks quickly. Barista can be stressful, if you get stressed easily. The people that work there are like family. Everyone is nice to everyone and acts like everyone is their sister or brother. Management can be iffy. Each store should be ran the same way, but it is not. Each store manager is different. The hardest part of the job is maintaining store quality assurance while trying to get drinks out quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job is making the customer happy and seeing their face light up when you send them on their way with the perfect cup of coffee."

A typical day there was spent working with great people, and meeting exciting new customers as well as repeat customers. I learned a great deal about the importance of team work, and different kinds of coffee beans. For the most part the employees are expected to manage themselves through their shifts, and the management was very hands on teaching us new tactics and techniques. The hardest part of the job was working in the freezer that was below zero degrees, and the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers with their stories and rapport."
good,"A typical day at work would be punching in; gathering staff and delegating tasks throughout the shift and providing a safe environment while allowing breaks in between. "

good,"Great experience"
good,"Everything about working at Starbucks was an enjoyable experience. I really like the flexibility of the company and the strides taken to make the company bigger, efficient, and barista friendly after the initial mistake of allowing the company to grow too fast and crash. Benefits were amazing, hours are plentiful, and the culture is top-notch. The crafting of beverages is a competitive art among baristas and the culture of ""The Third Place"" is an excellent model for businesses in the service industry."

good,"Starbucks is one of the best companies out there for employment. Its dedication to its partners (employees) and customers is almost unrivaled in this society in my opinion. Speaking towards my goals, management has always been a serious consideration as I have pursued it. However, it is not a company on which I would base my primary income. "
good,I worked for this company a while ago and the only reason i left was because i needed more money to support my family. Other than that its a great compnat to work for.
good,I took the job at starbucks because I was told that it would be flexible around my school schedule. I am a single mother so I was looking for some to accommodate the hours that I wanted to work and I'm also a college student; so needless to say I have a lot going on at once. I'm glad I was hired on because it is an amazing place to work. Fast paced friendly environment. My co workers and managers are great. We are like one big family there.

good,Sometimes it can be a little crazy but you have great co-workers. Starbucks has great benefits for everybody.
good,Fun and inviting place to work with a high level of focus on customer service.
good,"I enjoyed my experience working for Starbucks Coffee! I learned so much on a personal level and professional level. Starbucks Coffee is such a high demanding job; therefore causing you to push all of your natural skills and abilities to the test. I honestly feel that once you work at Starbucks, you can now do any job out there in the market and become the best, because Starbucks inspires their partners to strive and love working hard all while having fun and learning."
good,It was a great experience working at starbucks. I had to cut it short due to the fact of overloading myself with too many credits in college. Lesson learned.

I learn a lot about making drinks, how the temperatures should be for food and drinks, how to deal with all types of personalities, how to check the orders/ paper work, how to handle large sums of cash. My co-workers and management is great. We all work so good together that way our day goes smoothly. There isn't any hard part about working at my job, unless you do not like staying for 8 hours straight. "
good,Starbucks culture provides an awesome opportunity to grow as you work. Advancement is always a possibility if you want it and they encourage advancement from within.  I loved the ability to work with such a diverse group of people and to work with the customers who would come in.  Every day was different and provided challenges that kept things exciting and original.
good,"Since I was the opener i had to make sure the store was open and stocked on time and well as handling all the cash for my shift. I learned so much at starbucks, especially enhancing my customer service skills. You tend to learn so much about coffee that you never knew but it helped us to describe it to our customers. My managemnt team was awesome, always worked with your schedule and your needs. All the co workers were great and fun to be around make my time here memorable. Honestly at the time the hardest part was having to wake up everyday at 3am yet it was always worth it at the end."
good,"I was employed by Starbucks Company for four years. They have been, by far, the best employer that I have worked for. My manager was exceptionally good at working around school schedules (I started there when I was in highschool), and he also was able to help me hone my customer service abilities, which resulted in me being able to sell more pounds of coffee than any other barista in our district."

I have learned how to get to know the customer, what they want and how to gain access to what they want. This allows for me to give excellent customer service and to exceed expectations for management as well as the customers themselves. I enjoy the great co-workers as well as the customers that I see everyday and find out bits and parts about them. Hardest part of the job would be trying to ensure that all customers are happy when they arrive as well as when they leave. This is not an easy task to please everyone. As long as you make all the effort possible to please the customer then you can be happy that whatever the outcome."
good,"Starbucks was the best job I have had. The company gives you all of the necessary tools and resources that you need to excel, benefits and pay are great, co-workers are like family and who doesn't love free coffee!"

A parte mais difícil é gerenciar pessoas que não estão na mesma vibração da equipe, e a parte mais agradável é o treinamento e a evolução que você diariamente nas pessoas."

The hardest part of the job would be the constant influx of customers, yet we all consider it a challenge and are not having as much fun on a slow day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people we meet on a daily basis and the connection we can make to those people who visit us daily, our regulars. And even the non regulars amaze us with the connections and stories, it's really wonderful."

At Starbucks, you will learn the importance of delivering world class customer service and genuine connection. While the company is a very professional company, the work atmosphere is a bit more laid-back. Even member of the upper management is on a first name basis with everyone.

good,"I was with Starbucks as a barista for only two years but, I carry things I learned on the job, with me everyday. In the time I was there they came out with their new recipe for their frappocuino, introduced VIA then flavored VIA, and really upgraded the food choices. I learned to connect more with the community and the people you sell a product to. The company was very concentrated on their customers and it was a part of the job to learn people's faces and their favorite beverage. Soon that little bit of interaction starts conversation and you start to get a real glimpse of the many people in the local community."

I've learned how to make connections with people by just making a memorable moment for someone. For the most part management is fine and my co-workers are even better. Great people and easy to get along with despite the different personalities. I can't think of anything hard about the job but it does become a bit overwhelming at times. I enjoy the job over all but hours are very low so that would be my reason for redirecting myself to a new company with more stability for me.
good,A typical day at work for me was opening the store. Setting everything up for the day (registers orders back up for the afternoon rush etc.) Making sure that the staff had their breaks in a timely manner. Doing the deposits and change orders if needed.

good,Prepare for opening and closing shifts.
good,"I have worked in the same location for 6 years. The people that I work with are amazing, and are always so encouraging. Every day we come in, and work as a cohesive unit. There are moments when, in the midst of absolute chaos, we can share jokes and laugh. We bring our customers in on what it is we are talking about, so that they don't feel neglected, but they feel included. We spend our time preparing and serving not just coffee, but an experience. It is our job to connect with the people we interact with. We ask them questions to try and identify how we can help them. Then we make recommendations based on what they tell us. For most people this exchange could take minutes, but for us it takes seconds. We do honestly love our regular customers, and we go out of our way in order to make those customers who may not be regulars, feel like they are. The most difficult aspect of this job can be the memorization and speed, but like all things it comes with time. My favorite part of this job is my interaction with customers and co-workers.
