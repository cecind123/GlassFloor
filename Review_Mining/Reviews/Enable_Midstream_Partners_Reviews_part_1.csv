bad,"In general the overall aspect of the company is good but there are many managers and directors that are hard to work for. Many are very much micromanagers. They promote work life balance but get on to you for being out with your kid. Promised many things during my interview and very little have been delivered on,"
bad,"ok"
bad,"Enable Midstream has poor communication regarding the direction of the company as a whole from the top down. This poor communication leads to uncertainty in the work place and a feeling of uneasiness throughout the offices. As a result, expectations are not clearly defined and the results intended are never met."
bad,"Enable is getting worse by the month. Execs are treated with white glove service, and are catered to in a way that keeps them from seeing any real idea of employee life. They can't make decisions and the result is that underlings have to scurry around at the last minute to make things right. The company is very IT driven. About a third of its non-field employees are in IT. You'd think IT would work perfectly. But it doesn't. Employees aren't held accountable for much, in IT or across the company. If you are the sort of person that feels personally responsible for quality work, you will burn yourself out for nothing. Raises and bonuses are fairly disconnected from actual performance. It is more about whose rear you are kissing. Enable listens to the squeaky wheels, so employees must spend time on non-strategic priorities to keep everyone happy even if 98% of the company isn't complaining. Enable recently moved into new office spaces with employees moving in waves. I'm didn't move before leaving, but the cubicles are laughably tiny, and mid-level managers with advanced degrees and supervisory responsibilities are being put into cubicles. Be sure to ask where you will office if you are looking at a job at Enable. There are no mentoring programs, no way to job shadow, no real professional development, and money to travel to conferences is only for special people. If your boss isn't willing to fight for you, there are very few opportunities. There is no support for remote work, and face time is required in the corporate office. Enable has a good benefits package and nice people overall,"
good,No Comment on this company as our Tulsa location was sadly and suddenly closed.  Enjoyed the different personalities I worked with and we had beautiful offices.
good,"New company, struggling.  Light at the end of the tunnel but with gas prices as they are, it's further away than I'd like.  At my current position, no room for advancement and pay raises are scarce."
good,"Made a major career move going to Enable and planned to make it my last move.  Within six months of making the move, there was a company wide 10% lay-off.  Corporate office decided to consolidate 3 states into one office in OKC.  So it came down to ""move to OKC or find another job"".  Its been more than a year since the lay-off and I'm still trying to find a job."
good,Really can put my talents in training to use here.  Good people in a relaxed environment.  Management has some lapses in judgment and policy.
good,"There is room for advancement if you made good work connections.  Training was sorely lacking and managers micromanaged constantly.  As with most O&G companies, layoffs are a common occurrence. The “big brother” aspect is unsettling as they track your movements entering/exiting every door and monitor your arrival and departure via parking garage too.  Office space is all cubicles and you are one of the lucky ones if you actually have a wall between yourself and your neighbor. Felt like I was in a fishbowl.  However the pay was very reasonable and the benefits/bonuses were very nice."
good,work is not hard but very routine. good 401 k and health benefits. pay is decent and competitive with market. day to day job duties are routine for the industry.
good,"great place to work, management is very hands on. The workplace culture is excellent. The most hardest part of the job is working in cubes. The most enjoyable is working with great people."
good,"Safety is key, Great atmosphere, Overall team spirit and willingness to promote moral for all employees. Location was perfect for a daily commute. All and All a great place to work."
good,"Good, stable midstream company with excellent benefits. Company out is conservative and stable compared to other oil & gas companies. However, IT department is abhorrent. Old blood want to keep their jobs and will not collaborate. If your a contractor, don't expect to get a job but expect to get pulled around on a possible full-time position."
good,The Company works with you to make sure you are trained in the correct procedures for your job. Its a business that you feel relaxed in doing your job.
good,"Great work life balance schedule, culture is great, always looking for team players, salary is competitive compared to peers, benefits are also great."
good,I worked with a great group of people. I was able to grow in my career from an entry level accountant to an Accounting Manager. My only reason for leaving was a family decision to move out of state.
good,Work life balance is great for me! I enjoy the location of my office and the vacation & sick time policy and having holidays off to spend with my family.
good,Learned a lot made great friends. Great work environment. Management attempted to create an environment where employees could receive backup and support.
good,"What I like most about this company is that it always provides chances to learn for employee's career development, such as group/department cross trainings, suppliers lunch & learn, etc.."
good,Very productive environment. Worked a lot with the Louisiana Commissioner and the President and CEO of CenturyTel. Lots of to learn every day. I enjoyed my co workers.
good,"Was a great company to work for before we merged to create Enable. Merger became basically a takeover and people from our legacy company took big layoffs, then mass office moves."
good,"Professional teams and good relations with co-workers with a balanced approach to work and home relations."
good,"Ability to work independently and make practical decisions to improve processes. I learned all aspects of the natural gas industry. I was given many opportunities to travel to field locations to observe operations at  meter sites. Many training opportunities provided over the years to include Microsoft Office, Gas Measurement specific software and self improvement training classes. Great culture of teamwork and common goals. Management has improved over the years. Most stressful part of the job was the end of month deadlines, potential problems that were out of the control of field technicians or office analysts but it was a good challenge to face, work through and meet the deadlines. Enjoyed my co-workers and my job."
good,Awesome environment that offer room for professional growth. My typical day at work begins at 6:00am and ends 5:30pm.  Management offers lots of flexibility and teams do not get bogged down with over analysis of processes.
good,"- Check ticketing system for work orders/tickets to be resolved for the day."
good,"Great leadership and culture.  Good work life balance.  The company invests in their employees.  Co-workers treat each other with respect and has a family feel."
good,Great company with a great culture.  Enable Midstream is a growing company and really appreciates hard work.  There's a great work/life balance and very good benefits.
good,"Only worked there for 9 months, not much to give a review on.  They were in a transition when I was there from Enogex to Enable Midstream.  Many changes were taking place at that time with employees, management and merging with Centerpoint."
good,"The Company went through some very challenging Financial Times while I was there. Bullish CEO took over and righted the Company very quickly without ""Corporate Speak"", he was truly engaged in making the Company a great place to work. I miss my coworkers and management team I worked with. Only reason I left was a fairly substantial promotion."
good,"Enjoyed working there only reason for leaving gas was depleting great bunch of co workers all got along real good, each employee would help out or work for you if days needed off"
good,Great place to work I just dont like OKC too much traffic. I support field ops on Telecom and that is all driving job thru the city and out to the country the job is fantastic its based out of OKC if that was rural far from the big city it would be great.
good,I started in one position and they gave me opportunity to learn more.  The advancements were very tight but they always allowed you to continue to learn and add to you skill set.  I only knew upstream oil located in Canada to Midstream Gas in Lower 48.  I was not able to learn new skills but also learn from other departments about their contribution to the system.
good,"Excellent company.  The people are very friendly, easy to work with and make a good team.  Programs and goals and objectives are solid."
