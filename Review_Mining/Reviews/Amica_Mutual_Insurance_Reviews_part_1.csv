bad,"I was basically an administrative assistant for a regional office.  The office politics and turnover were horrendous.  The management was condescending and verbally abusive to employees. They were looking to hire in as many 20-somethings as possible in order to reduce their overall health plan costs and to pay less in wages.  I saw a long-term employee with the highest sales volume of the whole department put on a ""performance improvement plan' after returning from major surgery (high medical costs), and she was beleaguered until they eventually pressured her out of her job.  My salary level was pitiful, but I stayed on as I had been told I would have promotion possibilities, which never happened.  The management resented I was taking CPCU courses when I was in a support staff position, when they couldn't even get milennial sales agents to take them.  There were biting bugs in the carpeting of the office suite and several employees broke out in rashes from it.  I had a medical issue that was costly, and suddenly nothing I did was right and employees I had formerly gotten along with were giving me attitudes.  The company advertises itself as being so conscientious, but it works its employees like slaves and its management is disrespectful and manipulative.  Also, their systems when I were there were terribly behind the times and constantly malfunctioning."
bad,Not a great company to work for.  It’s all about numbers and not the people.  It’s all about the money and not caring about people.   Not enough job training as well to do the job right
bad,"Micromanagement. Micromanagement.  Micromanagement.  Micromanagement.  Micromanagement.  Micromanagement.  "
bad,"Overworked, underpaid! Micromanage at its finest! Management have no compassion for employees, they’re heartless souls. They make it impossible to grow within & will find reason not to give you yearly raises. This branch is awful! You will have great co workers but will have to answer to the wardens, I warned you! Employees who have work 10+ year leave the company, this says a lot"
bad,"I've never worked for worse people.  The account managers are fresh out of college with no real world experience.  Moving up is impossible, unless you want to uproot your family.  Stay away from this call center job.  0 out of 10."
bad,"Work Life balance sucks, you are expected to work holidays while the top dogs sit at home with their families and forget time ½ that isn’t offered. If there is bad weather back east where majority of their policies are held, get ready to work 10 hour shift days and again no time ½ like other companies offer. They will work you to the bone and if you aren’t like by your boss or coworkers for whatever reason don’t expect a raise or an opportunity for advancement. I know people who had been there for ten plus years whose title had never changed not even once from a level I, II or III.  "
bad,"Office environment was very immature and dramatic. Management was terrible. Good job to start insurance and get licensed but I would not stay long term. Pay sucks, health insurance was good though. Meetings are pointless and unproductive. People cheat the system and get away with it. I would not recommend it."
bad,"A typical day at work is frustratiing because you are taking complex insurance calls and the  young managers come in after a 7 week training program and know nothing. They can't help you. The turnover is high  due to lack of training. One manager has been there 18 years from this program and she can't answer a simple question. They come around screaming to get on the phone when you can't get help with anything."
bad,"Good place to work that's fast paced so your day is over before you know it, great benefits, nice, supportive colleagues & comfortable environment. Sales incentives, many extras like company BBQ etc... The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers. The hardest part of the job was ""not enough time to do it all"""
bad,"Welcome to Amica, where the pay is barely enough, the training is terrible,where anyone who's been there longer than 5 yrs is on a power/ego trip, most of the people will smile in your face and laugh at you behind your back , where there's never a right answer so everything is wrong and where diversity is non-existent. Oh and since there is no HR department on site, good luck trying to address any of your concerns!"
bad,"Englewood Colorado office is the worst place I have EVER worked. Management CLAIMS open door policy, but make the decisions together behind closed doors. I tried to talk to the director and was told she would not talk to me without my supervisor present. I was having terrible issues with my supervisor. She did though have private meetings with my supervisor and called me in to her office with both of them there to berated me."
bad,Don't go. low pay.Nothing nice to say so I'd rather not say anything at all.
bad,"When you are walked in for an interview, the management has already warned the employees, and they walk round with fake smiles like an office full of Stepford Wives. Once hired, you are dissuaded from asking any questions ever, and expected to be fast and flawless, like a machine I was placed with an inexperienced manager who did not do her weekly coachings (2 in a little over 3 months time), who was verbally abusive on multiple occasions to me and other team members and illegally forced us to work through breaks and lunches on a regular basis. In the end, this manager committed fraud by altering several of my clients' files, and attempted to blame it on me. There are many perks offered by the company, but they are only available to the favorites of management. This includes free certifications classes, days off to volunteer, and birthday celebrations."
bad,Amica is a call center atmosphere with not much room for advancement and very low pay.
bad,"I was happy with my job at Amica for the first few years; however, things grew worse as time went on. Amica's philosophy seems to be to obtain as many new policyholders and the associated premiums as they can, but never hire more claims reps to handle the increased claims that are generated with all those new policyholders. You are expected to be logged into the phones ALL DAY with one half day per week of ""diary"" time, which is the only time you ever get to do your work uninterrupted by constant phone calls. And because you have way too many claims files to handle, you are expected to do 10 hours of work in a 7.5 hour workday. It can't be done! There are strict time constraints in place. New bookings must be done the same day. Payments must be made within 2 days of receiving the appropriate documentation. And if you don't meet these time requirements, it reflects badly on your reviews. So there's absolutely no way to win! They just keep giving you more and more claims and expect you to get everything done according to their time table, which is impossible! Also, there is definitely favoritism. Some reps are never bothered to go to classes or get their certifications in order to get promoted. Others are required to study (at home, unpaid), take the tests and get their certifications. I was constantly stressed and overworked; underpaid as well. I even cried on my way home from work on numerous occasions! So if you're in the insurance claims business, I would stay away from working at Amica and try to get in somewhere else. Maybe another company's work ethic and treatment of their"
bad,"Amica is a very ""old school"" type environment. It has only been in the last 10 years that they stopped requiring all men to wear suits and ties an all women to wear dresses and hose in the call center."
bad,"This company stresses its family environment and even suggests recommending friends and family to apply. However, management does not care most of the time, you wont see much advancement, managers are mainly newly graduated college students so if you were hired in as a rep you wont be able to get a management opportunity for years and years and thats even just a maybe. The company is so stressed on amount of calls you take and numbers."
bad,"In a typical work day you can expect a lot of routine inbound calls. Amica's expectations of you are relatively clear. You are provided the necessary resources to complete your tasks for most of what you do. Employees are usually thanked or critiqued according to their individual metric performance. I say ""thanked"" because verbal acknowledgements are the norm, however merit increases for performance are not provided often above and beyond the annual cost of living increase. You're initially hired at a nice wage but unfortunately you'll stay there. Good luck trying to advance in the company from any of the call centers unless you're hired in as management - in that case you'll serve your 2 years and advance immediately to a comfortable career in the good ole boys club (women included). Once hired as an entry level worker you stay there. On the other hand you enjoy a nice benefit package with just about every benefit you could ever ask for. The benefit package gets a bit less spectacular every few years unfortunately. When I was first hired the best part of the job was the nice ""family"" atmosphere between employees. Eight years ago the job was nice because the office was more relaxed and a comfortable place to work, a place where employees were free to simply do their jobs. Employees enjoyed each other and had a generally nice time during their respective shifts. Unfortunately over the last 8 years the constant management turnover has turned the office into a footstool for inexperienced trainee supervisors/managers to learn the trade before jumping ship for better waters. Management"
bad,The company offers a wide range of training products to allow employees to stay informed. They provide in-house CE courses and allow employees time to complete CE courses as needed.
bad,"High stress job with a good amount of benefits.  Company provides a lot for their workers, but does not offer a suitable salary for the work that is expected. It is common to work over 50 hours per week for this job."
bad,Not conducive to professional growth and development. I would not recommend it.
bad,"Great work/life balance, salary needs improvement, conservative work culture, great benefits. High claims volume results to heavy workload. Must be willing to relocate to advance."
good,"this company is hit or miss. When I started we were doing really well, but  there have been several cut backs in benefits. Upward mobility has been cut in half."
good,Very intense and detail oriented work. But great on the job training
good,Enjoyed the people and the culture that was portrayed but there was no work life balance at all. Worked all the time and the claims were never ending.
good,The culture and the people are great. There is little work life balance. We have so much to complete in so little time. There is little opportunity for advancement. The hardest part of the job is the crazy work load. Th management is nice but they expect way to much.
good,Office politics takes place here alot. You're either part of the cool and wanted group or you are not. Job was too stressful plus my childcare plans changed.
good,"The management structure and work/life balance are not the best features of this job. They have high expectations with low employee support. They try to have a positive outlook for the employees, but it ends up feeling hollow. The employees were nice people but you could tell the stress of the job had gotten to most of them"
good,I worked at Amica for 4 years in their Account Management program.  I got a great education on the fundamentals of insurance as well as a general understanding of how to manage people.  However the amount of responsibilities compared to the compensation and hours required was no longer acceptable and went elsewhere for better work/life balance.  Advice to management is to set schedules for management and don't bog down with too many responsibilities in the beginning to overwhelm new hires.
good,"This is not the job for free spirits or creative thinkers. Upper management truly does want you to be successful, but is very limited in how they feel you can achieve it. Very old school company who is facing a lot of challenges attracting the millennial generation. Coming out of college you get a lot of authority, however it takes a lot of time before you can more into an upper management position. I would say if you are someone who is task oriented and doesn't mind taking on the day to day bs of small office life- stick with the company, the benefits are awesome. I just couldn't do it."
good,"Amica has been around for over 100 years, they still hold some conservative. (ex. men can not have ears pierced and women are not permitted to have anything within sight pierced other than one earring in each ear)  In a CSR position it is extremely high pressured and very stressful position. However, if you commit to the position it does pay off. Lot opportunity to earn a lot of income, decent base pay, great benefits."
good,"Bilingual representatives are underpaid and undervalued. Management is lax in nature and the only feedback you get is at the end of the month when its time to discuss your production. You either make it, or you slowly get pushed out."
good,"Not a bad place to work. Could be more advanced technologically, training is lacking. Solid pay and benefits. Would recommend to people looking for a job."
good,"Amica offers relatively poor pay by industry standards. However, the work hours and benefits were good. Unrealistic expectations from management. They provide excellent service to customers though."
good,"High tempo job, calls never stop coming, you have meet call standards to hit bonus structure. Senior management doesn't get to know you but there is room for movement within the company."
good,"Opportunities: No appetite for risk or process improvements, extremely political, poor salary compensation compared with industry (however excellent benefits), small organization leads to minimal cross-functional job opportunities.  No Strategic opportunities. "
good,I learned that the job I thought I was going to perusing wasn't anything I had imagine beforehand. working and dealing with insurance is beyond harder than I thought.
good,"No la doy porque no fué nada positiva. "
good,Enjoyed my tenure at Amica and had great learning. Amica is a technology driven company and focuses on new methods to set a good example.
good,"The phone would start ringing at 8:00 and never stop. You are required to answer every single call, if you don't it will harm your production reports. To go to the bathroom you need to log off your phone. There was an extreme amount of turnover and a massive exodus around the same time I left. You will work with mostly women and some of them extremely catty! They do try hard to make it more ""team oriented"" but meetings and pep talks can only do so much. I think if they paid better that would have helped. Management could be very invading and micromanagement was the style du jour. Benefits are great, but they are pricey. They did offer a pretty decent amount of vacation and time off though! I learned alot working for them. I don't regret it. I also met alot of great people who I'll know the rest of my life!"
good,"Providing superior work ethic and administrative service to management, sales team while multi tasking in resolving customer account issue. Providing stability in office flow, assist sales team with account resolution & maintenace while maintaining individual queues & rating system. Distribute client request to team members based on request and detail of account request."
good,Hands down the most comprehensive and best training I've ever had.  The people are so accommodating and friendly.  Great health benefits and vacation. Terrible salary! There is a very low ceiling with no room for growth unless you are willing to relocate every 2-3 yrs.
good,"This was my first job out of college and I did get a variety of experience because I worked in several departments while I was there. Some managers were better than others, and most employees were easy to get along with."
good,"It was okay working for Amica, they have decent benefits and it is easy to move up in the company."
good,I was made an asst. supervisor within a year of my employment. Handles auto and homeowner claims.
good,"This job really helped me with dealing with and adapting to an atmosphere with more of a high-paced job with a lot of unhappy customers that were clearly uninformed and unhappy with the decisions they made when signing up for such an important aspect in their life (i.e. insurance) or having a misunderstanding, sometimes argument, with other representatives."
good,"A typical day at work we involve making calls, meetings with insurers and claimants, conducting negotiations, investigating claims, and a lot of reports. I learned a lot about working with people after a traumatic loss, as well as being their source of hope and comfort at a time when they have absolutely know idea what the next step is going to be. Management for the most part is supportive, however as they rise through the ranks I believe they can lose sight of reality when it comes to the everyday job and work load. Co-workers are supportive and helpful with advice and ideas. You can always call on your co-worker if help is needed. The hardest part of my job was working with unruly insurers or claimants. They most enjoyable part is closing a claim knowing the client is happy and satisfied with the service."
good,"Great first job out of college. Good training program with an opportunity to relocate anywhere in the country.  "
good,"My role was unique in that I maintained a top level of production while educating coworkers in skills to make them top level producers. In addition to that, I am a functional specialist who insures the office is operating efficiently. I enjoy the competitive environment while being apart of a team. Management is there to support the underwriting aspect while listening to ideas that increase new business."
good,"The representative position here is a good one for someone that needs something stable and is fine with customer support. The benefits are great and the company really shows care for its people in every way except competitive pay. The company culture is positive and dedicated to employee health and happiness. Sadly, that does not change the fundamental fact that the position is a glorified call center representative."
good,Most of the supervisors they hire are kids fresh out of college with little to no management experience.
good,"Good company, good benefits. Great if you're looking for non-commission position. Underwriting and marketing changes caused many sales rep/managers to leave, policies are very hard to sell because premiums are 2-5 times more expensive than competitors. "
good,"ok place to work, could be better. call center environment where half of the people are not very ethical or friendly. very cliquish environment with drama."
good,The company highly values work-life balance. I've received a lot of support from my local manager and direct supervisor in continuing education and career growth.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"Good place to work overall. Good benefits.  Very stressful and high workload. Perks are good, : company car, work from home."
good,This company has good benefits and decent pay. Management is OK. The team leaders are helpful on most days. Upper management can be indecisive.
good,I loved this job. I liked the staff and the autonomy. I loved how management instilled trust into their staff to make decisions and resolve issues with minimum input. Wonderful place to work.
good,Fast paced call center focused on customer service with great opportunities to advance.
good,Workload can be daunting. Need to hire more help soon. High stress level can be annoying. management  try to ne team players.
good,I was a top producer for many years.  Two times certified in integrity selling. I was very successful but did not want a management position I would have taken a salary decrease for but I needed more. This lead me to a new career path.
good,"Started there in Word Processing right out high school and from 1980 to 2003 worked in word processing, working my way up to supervisor.  After that, they moved Word Process Dept. to our home office in Providence, so I was moved to Administrative Assistant.  Very challenging; receptionist work, reports for claims manager, attendance records, maintaining records for all office machinery/computers, tech work for office systems, mail room,  coordinate parties, cook-outs for office functions, etc.. very much a multi-tasking job."
good,"Great office with great people. Hours are not flexible at all, always hiring for night shift but not days. "
good,"J'ai acquit des compétences qui me serve toujours, j'ai quitte cette AMICA suite a la vente de l'entreprise par le petit fils du créateur."
good,"Mukava, arvostettu työnantaja. Työkalut ( ohjelmat ) hyvät"
good,A typical day come be consuming with lots of file work.  However it makes the day go by fast and  you learn something new each day.  I have not done insurance before as you can review my resume but it is very informative and it allows me to explain and understand the need for insurance.  My co- workers are workers. Although the work flow can become a lot in different times of the season it is still enjoyable speaking to great customers and being able to assist.  No challenges can make ones job boring.  Well this is not Amica by far.
good,"The company and management are great, and is a rewarding company to work for. However, in order to move up at all in the company or jump positions you must generally be willing to relocate. "
good,"The company definitely values customer service above all else.  Employees are encouraged to be their best and given regular feedback and encouragement.   BUT work-life balance is not great.  Employees who have personal/health issues are considered ""not dependable"" and are prevented from raises/advancement regardless of the reasons for those issues or how much they contribute when they a"
good,AMs should all be on the same page. One will approve something and the next won’t. Often mislead with reviews. Also people who are making clear mistakes are somehow given more leeway than people who are working hard.
good,"They will train you to be the best representative possible. Managers are overall very caring and helpful. The benefits are fair, but the pay is lower than industry standard and it takes a long time to get a promotion. It can be both stressful and rewarding working with customers in a call center environment. Your time on and off a phone call is constantly monitored for productivity. Expect to work swing shift and every weekend, which can be very difficult when you have kids."
good,"This is a great company to work for, but would recommend it as a starter job in the insurance industry because they are the lowest paying company that I know if,  Most paid $8-12K more a year for the same position."
good,Loved working with the residents of this place. There was a lot of drama amongst the staff that I tend to try to stay away from. The manager that was there when I was there was part of that drama.
good,"Working here at Amica I can say that this job is a completely unique experience. The training seems a bit long on paper but it feels ridiculously short in practice. I wish the transition between training and being on a full team was a bit gentler. You have a lot of fun here and it feels really close knit (depending on what side claims or sales and client services). "
good,"Co workers were very friendly and genuine, they make you feel part of the team and you never felt left out, it was a happy workplace and i like the company."
good,"A typical day at work is spent phone bound, expected to handle 20-25 calls daily. "
good,Great place to work. Everyone willing to help new agents. Great benefits package. Assistance with licence attainment. Not much room for advancement.
good,"Stable company with a long history in the New England area. Professional and great customer service between both the employees and the customers. They offered and often paid for continuous education, training and industry trends through seminars and meetings."
good,Wonderful company to work for. The management and staff are friendly and supportive. Definitely a multi task type of job. Customer service is a key component to working for this company.
good,"Amica is a great place to work if you are really interested in the insurance industry. A very sateady company, with an amazing work enviroment and filosophy."
good,"Amica cares a lot about it's employees, they are willing to be flexible and work with you for training. Most training is done on the job and hands-on through job shadows, etc. "
good,This position requires a lot of competition and the ability to withstand constructive criticism. If you don't make sales quotas then you can expect a meeting with management who will tell you that you need to improve or find another position.
good,"Amica takes the time to train and teach you how to become a personal insurance agent rather than be just another insurance producer.  Typically each day was the same, answering inbound calls and helping current insureds as well as new customers.  The other co-workers were very nice and very helpful, I have made a lot of friends within the company.  The difficult part of this job was that each day was the exact same thing and there is very little chance in moving up in the company also the new managers are usually straight out of college and know very little about insurance and have had little experience speaking with customers.  As the company grows I feel they are losing focus of what makes them stand apart from other carriers.  I did learn a lot in regards to insurance and would recommend Amica to my friends and family."
good,Sales/Customer Service -
good,This is an amazing company to work for but it wasn't a good fit for me. The distance from my home to this location isn't ideal and as a single parent at times the schedule and time off didn't work.
good,Its a great place to work. The people you work with every day are the best and the friendliest people. I love going to work and seeing my co-workers every day
good,"Evaluate and assess risks, analyze payment and premiums related to the risk, and determine if that entity should be insured. Assisted in creating Auto, Home, and Umbrella Insurance."
good,"Big on promoting from within. Excellent benefits, pay is not comparable with industry standard though work/life balance is better than industry standard. Claims handling is inherently stressful/demanding job, company does great job with continuing education."
good,"As an adjuster, I deal with many disgruntled claimants and attorneys.  I like that I am able to help people in my job and make them whole, but you get yelled at quite a bit. You need a tough shell and cannot take anything personally. The management is fantastic, especially in the Hartford branch. Everyone is always willing to help you and want you to succeed. This job is not for everyone, but if you stick around, you will get recognized and advance."
good,"That was my best place for wok, it was very flexible and organised job . them management is very effective and progressive, all staff members was cooperative. i learned about new technologies and how to manage work in such a difficult situation."
good,Amica is a nice place to work but the pay is low. They work hard to be diverse and inclusive. The people are friendly and the work is enjoyable. The only issues is outdated systems and the compensation is a bit low.
good,"Friendly co-workers, everyone is extremely helpful especially if you are new to Insurance. Paid Training with great Managers. Unlimited Commission Potential with a decent base pay. "
good,The company is focused on expanding the individual to meet the mission statement.  Working there allows you to push yourself to become stronger and more independent.  Work life balance is important to the company and the culture is one focused on the employees as well as the customers.
good,"When I arrived to work, I reviewed and set up new claims for the day. Then, I followed up on active claims."
good,"Great Company to work for.  Nice clients.  "
good,"Nice place to work if you don't have children as there's no flexibility with the schedule."
good,"It was a part time job, 20 hours per week.  This was good as I could help my Mom with my stepfather.  Quickly diminishing with Alzheimer.  Moving them back to Canada and slowly taking his responsibility from him.  He was young really."
good,"Management/Supervisors are recruited straight out of college and don't know what they are doing! Hard to advance, unless you have a college degree, no matter HOW MANY YEARS you work there!!!"
good,I enjoyed working there for 20 years.  It is a great company.  They announced they would be closing our office so I had to make a decision to leave to become a companion for a family member.
good,Amica was a great company to work for and the only reason I left was because I got a job offer that was paying well and closer to home.  I would recommend working at Amica to my close friends.
good,"Typical days was serving customers in person and over the phone"
good,"Working for Amica was great, their are busier times of the year but overall the workflow on a typical day is very manageable. The people you work with, both colleagues and management are very nice and their to assist you. The workplace culture is excellent as well with the focus obviously on getting the job done and servicing the customers while not being overbearing or pressuring. The hardest part of the job was staying ahead of the workflow, although the individual work is not hard to complete. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people you work with and the sense of community in the office and company."
good,"Answering calls, taking payments, making changes and issuing quotes on Auto, Home, Boat and Motorcycle policies.  We would also have to sell them on wanting a Life Insurance quote.  Co-workers were very nice.  Hardest part of the job was pushing the insured's to take get a Life Insurance quote.  I was not told that there was any sales involved with the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers."
good,"I currently work at Amica ( a Luxury Retirement Community) and I have nothing but good to say about the company, the management team and my co-workers and the loving residents. It has been a great working experience and enjoyable to come to work every day. "
good,The job was not a good fit for me but it did teach me a lot. Your work-day was scheduled by you and had little supervision. The company is a great company to work for.
good,"Amica offers the widest range of benefits I have ever seen from one company. They are all across the nation which makes it easy to stay with the company if you move. Management does as good job of keeping all employees, big or small, well informed of the company's future plans. It is a great Career. Not just a job. The culture is like a huge family. Employees are encouraged to engage one another."
good,I started Amica with no knowledge of insurance sales. They had a paid training which lasted about 2 months before you were on the phone. The management team are really great and helpful. The systems they use are very old and hard to navigate and learn. The hardest part of the job is meeting all the guidelines of Amica. Very strict underwriting on all lines and the systems are old so they crash allot which makes it hard to sell.  I enjoy my co-workers and the office I work in. The management team are easy to talk to and very friendly.
good,A typical day at work was answering calls from insureds or claimants that were in an automobile accident and had damage to their vehicle or property. We would have to set up the claims and be understanding and empathetic to their needs and wants. The hardest part of the job was when we would have to tell them that there wasn't any coverage for the claim due to lapse in coverage or because they simply didn't didn't have that kind of insurance.
good,This is a great company for anyone beginning their adjuster career. This company is a true class act and I would not have wanted to start anywhere else.
good,Amazing place to work.  Inbound and outbound calls. Will help you obtain P&C license. Great Benefits and work life balance. Management is great but very by the book. So as long as task are done and   You are engaging in the work life culture you will do gre
good,"I enjoy going to work. Wonderful company and coworkers. Hours aren't for everyone but if they are, there is nowhere better to work. Management is so nice and helpful."
good,"Requires a person to be able to multitask.  Gives on site training. They hire management training directly from college.  These new management people are young and most have never been in a lead position.  The days is busy without much down time, but they do like to make sure that everyone gets their breaks and lunch time.  The company understands when a rep has to walk away from the desk to relax after a difficult phone call.  Never any cold calls."
good,Amica was a great place to work. They value their employees and recognize those that stand out. I enjoyed all my co-workers and felt this business offered me a great step into the insurance world.
good,Was right wing of manager and trained with him in graphic designing and web coding.
good,A very inclusive workplace culture with constant feedback and support from management and peers.  The hardest part of the job was trying to bring your best everyday and the most enjoyable part of the job was enjoying your job.  I really miss the connections and friends I made at this company and wish them the best.
good,"This place was awesome, I didn’t get the opportunity to work there long because I didn’t pass the the text for nv to have my insurance license. I wish that I still worked there. I still brag on there insurance to this day"
good,Very hectic work load but amazing office employees to help you through the day. Everyone is willing to help you. Always learning new things daily
good,"In a typical day at work, I would start with a brief meeting with my sales team. Once the day began I worked on numerous account servicing scans as well as risk reviews. I am responsible for handling any escalated calls and customer complaints that my team may receive. I also have my own customer accounts to service as well as recommend various coverage to. The most important thing I have learned is how to deal with different types of personalities on my sales floor as well as from the customers I have encountered. I have also learned how to adapt my management style to those around me, which involves the most effective ways to set goals for each individual. I really enjoy working in such a busy environment as it allows each new day to present a new and interesting challenge to overcome. I also love being able to train new representatives on the job functions and new systems. The hardest part of my job has been being away from my family and friends."
good,"A typical day at Amica was having contact with customers in person as well as over the phone. Answering there questions and providing quotes for Auto and Home insurance. There was an open door policy with the mangers, all my co-workers were friendly and helpful."
good,"If you're into sales, this could be a dream job for you. Great base pay, no commission cap, and an amazing benefits package. There's plenty of room for upward growth, and if you have the flexibility, management opportunities abound."
