bad,"Stresszes munkakornyezet, rossz szervezeti felepites, munka/maganelet egyensuly nagyon nem kiegyenlitett- rossz arany, munkatarsak tulterheltek, magas fluktuacio."
bad,"A typically day at this job is 4-10s mon-thurs and 2-8s fri-sat. The management literally care about no one or nothing, so if you sick or you have little ones or take care of another human being... this is NOT the place for you!!! You will NOT be able to have a LIFE because they want all of your TIME!!! The working people here are awesome folks and very kind and hard working, but yet they all are so TIRED from working 6 days a week since Feb this year and BARLEY makes $11 an hour... mind you more than half the plant only got a 26cent raise!! That just disgusting and a slap in the face, when you work 2 EXTRA WEEKS within one month because of the constance ""Mandatory Overtime""!!The mass majority are only here because of the health benefits. The turn over rate here is crazy cause there is no balance of home and work. Try this place if you must, but you will be out before you know it!!!"
bad,Full of lies and false promises. You will always work. For 3 months of the year you will work 12 hour shifts for 13 days straight. They will promise it will stop and then hound you to get the work out.
bad,"I learned a lot of things from Jabil. My typical day would include but not limited to the following things: work with engineers and process techs, make and create labels upon request, change and test routes to make sure product will pass all steps."
bad,"muy malo, no me agrado mucho la forma en que tratan a sus empleados"
bad,"Poor management. Lack of advancement opportunities. Politically tiered and toxic work environment. Managers unwilling to spend money to change the processes on the floor and protect MFG employees."
bad,Diz que zela pela saúde do funcionário mas é mentira
bad,"This place is a sweat shop.  My first day I had 885 emails to sift through.  My manager was one of the most unprofessional managers I ever had.  After ""eliminating"" my position to Mexico, she left the company.  Rumor had it she slept her way into the position.  Unless  you want to be stressed, degraded, worked to the bone DO NOT WORK THERE!!!!!"
bad,"Work was low and I was given the option to come in when informed or collect unemployment for the time off, I agreed to come in. Sad to say, I was laid off and to make matters worst, my supervisor spread a false statement around the job about me. Work and life balance is not balanced. This place won't be open for long and I'll never recommend no one to work there."
bad,"Management is a joke at this place. They are barely staying afloat. People come and go easily. There is a huge lack of direction and miscomunication. They dont hire people for jabil. They go thru a staffing company and then if they dont like you they just get rid of you with no prior notification. No benefits. No sick time until after a year! Management spends hours there, most of them say they leave at 9 or 10 at night but still things always seem to be a mess. Managers have no time to train you and they expect you to just know things. They get mad when you ask questions mostly because they dont even know the answers to these questions. This place is a circus. Stay away"
bad,"Plant leadership is lacking in major way. No one knows what they are doing. The working conditions for accounitng are very cold and bad. Salaries are not competitve. Management is not easy to work with. The plant is new and is in absolute chaos. They will require that you work every weekend. You will work 55-65 hours per week. This is not a fun company to work with. They systems are not setup correctly, so trying to do accounting is very difficult. My professional recommendation is that if you are looking for a controller's position, that you keep on looking!"
bad,"Would not recommend this job, it is fast paced hard work in an uncomfortable environment. No paid leave/vacations/sick days and are inconsiderate when you have responsibilities a outside of the job."
bad,"They have you come in at 7am for work for the first few months then demand you come in at 5am and work 10 hours a day for 50 hours a week, regardless of what you have going on with your personal life, they didn't care at all."
bad,A typical day at work is not so fun and loving. Its kind of meshed up environment around us. I haven't learned anything since long time.Hardest part is you don't get enough opportunities.
bad,"This job was the worst.  The environment was terrible.  There was not cohesion, cut throat organization.  Work life balance there is none and the moral is a all time low."
bad,Great place to work. Good pay and excellent benefits. Working conditions were excellent. Highly recommend it to any prospective applicants...............
bad,Management is absolutely terrible. The way supervisors talk to employees is absolutely absurd. They tell you to speak up and when you do you get talked down to. If there's an issue it is not resolved. I was laughed at and mocked while management stood over me watching me clean wheels on the desks. When I brought it to a hire up I just so happen to get let go 2 weeks after. This place is a joke. Pay is a joke. Mandatory overtime. This place expects work to be first and family 2nd. I wouldn't dare recommend anyone to this establishment.
bad,"When I first start this company back in 1999, I really like working her but so much has change at this place . Its like they don't care about the people and their health. If someone leave company you should hire someone to replace them in stead of putting more work on other people.  I think that is why they have high rate of people leaving."
bad,"Very good working also facility is better for employee."
bad,"I worked for jabil for about 6 months and was able to see a lot of things. "
bad,"Muito grata foi nesta empresa que pude ter conhecimento na aréa da industria.Foi uma escola na minha vida,se tivesse oportunidade gostária de está fazendo parte do quadro de colaboradores novamente."
bad,"I worked here for more than two years and saw two job cuts and this company has history of doing job cuts within six months. This is not a company to join where your performance would not be criteria to judge you. No matter what you do only top management who even don't know what you do would pick you for job cut. This company has very bad history of job cuts so you are never secured. All management says after job cut is ""Lets move forward"". There is no work life balance and forget about any appreciation. They would never pay you good and forget about any increment. People in top management are poorly skilled and they judge you so you never get good rating no matter how good you perform and then finally on fine morning they would cut you in very insulting way. They would spend millions of dollars on useless things but they would cut jobs rather than waste full activities to cut cost. I would never every recommend this company to anyone as you never know they may cut even within 15 days of joining without any notice. Anyone can check facts about this company before joining this company."
bad,"I was only a temp at Jail so i really Can't say anything about Jabil other than it was pretty organized, fair work environment. I did not like how far the bathrooms were away from everything."
bad,I began my career because a friend got me hired in Jabil. I had no experience working on software contracts or licensing but soon found that it did not matter. The hardest part of the job is trying to figure out what my responsibilities are for my 3 person department. My manager is never present but allows us more freedom to do our work and take our time.
bad,This was the second worse job I ever had in my life. Unprofessional people. Back stabbing. All having affairs with subordinates. Unbelievable poison company.
bad,"Jabil is a good company to work for. A typical work day is busy with"
bad,"It was a great workplace that took all work , and production serious. I worked with great people. Everyone was nice and helpful."
bad,"This company is learning very good and discipline is good "
bad,Was pushed without appropriate compensation. It didn't feel like a friendly work environment. . Grateful I moved on
bad,"Support service industry"
bad,"they advertised my job on several job boards while i was still working there. i confronted HR about it and they told me that they were not advertising my job, but a corporate position at the location in San Jose.  then they let me go. that should tell you about their HR and management practices."
bad,"what  a horrific job, would be the last job that I EVER apply for again"
bad,I would not consider Jabil for a career. People are more concerned about the shorts they wear than the work they  do     No one takes pride in what they do their.
bad,A typical day at work includes me wondering if I'll have a job at the end of the day.I learned how to operate a few more machines.Management literally walks around joking and laughing during massive layoffs.For the most part my co-workers are decent hard working people.The hardest part of my job is knowing I'll never get advanced.The most enjoyable part of my job is coming home to my family.
bad,"Jabil is one of the worst companies that I have ever worked for, unless of course you just want to get a paycheck. I have worked in various IT places but this place is worst. Nothing ever gets done and one has to go through many layers to get any work done. In addition you have managers who have no clue what they are doing. Their compensation is competitive but if you are a professional and a career minded person who wants to grow in your field then stay away from this place. However, this it is the best place to work if you are lazy and only do as you are told, even if it is ridiculous "
bad,Did not recieve any other training so that I could grow in the establishment.
bad,"Mala Empresa,no se puede crecer profesionalmente, en 8 años solo ajuste salarial minimo cada año, esclavizante de inicio a fin de semana,juntas de trabajo programadas a las 7 pm hasta 9 pm, incluyendo fines de semana,aplicaciones a posiciones de negocios BUC sin oportunidad de crecer ya que las posiciones solo se mencionan pero el candidato ya estaba asignado,muchos viajes al extranjero,en lo personal mi ingles 90% con Maestria, titulado y no se dio ningun crecimiento"
bad,This plant runs in a constant state of chaos. Majority of the management is inexperienced; promoted on the golf course and/or during happy hour and rarely succeeds at even faking that their able to do their jobs.
bad,Unfair point system. Shows favoritism to certain employees. unorganized. Make up rules as they go. Unfair pay scale. No benefits not even paid holidays. No free lunch. Nothin to benefit the employees.
bad,HR personal very disappointing the communication is weak act like they listen but just tolarate you but dont value people.
bad,This job makes you stress out often like on a weekly basis. The hardest part about this job was making myself stay at it for so long. The easiest part was my last day.
bad,La peor experiencia que he tenido en todos mis empleos ...mal manejo de personal y demasiada presión
bad,"This place has one of the fastest revolving doors I have ever seen in my life. They had no intention of hiring anybody on despite the lies to the contrary that were told everyday. Each day, we would see at least two people being walked out with never a reason given other than they were getting too close to higher on date. The management has even flat-out stated that they wanted a bare minimum of actual hirees with everyone else being attempt. They even change policy while I was there so the temps could not apply for other positions. This left a very tight-knit click it was running the show and nobody else was permitted an opportunity to move up."
bad,"A túlórát elvárják, ki nem fizetik, de ha lecsúsztatod, akkor rossz szemmel néznek rád. Előrelépés csak akkor, ha te vagy a főnök kedvence. Juttatás semmi, ami van, azt is folyamatosan leépítik. Nagy a fluktuáció, nem véletlenül. A vezetőség nem figyel az alkalmazottak mondanivalójára."
bad,"Do not apply if you have a family, in a relationship or life. It's long hours the machines always go down one guy was left at a machine by himself all night complaining about stomach pain he was found hours later passed out had to be rushed to the hospital his appendix burst they expect you to drive on icy streets to work or get fired a few machines caught on fire the ones that deserve to be leads or supervisors are over looked"
bad,"Everyday u did the same job, very slow pace. A lot of computer work, management didn't really no what was going on,the area I worked in called ulthera was so behind, every week we worked Monday through Friday 10 hour days and 8 hours on Saturday, made it very hard to take care of everyday things."
bad,"Too much work less pay & no benefits, sick time or PTO"
bad,Jabil Fremont is a mom and pop company.  Management consist of old TTC and their family members who lack the experience or qualification to be in management.
bad,there was no room for advancement and very poor management. they looked out for their friends who were hired and mistreated most of the other workers.
bad,"Alacsony bérezés"
bad,manager would press worker to take sort cut for production sake them when they got in trouble they blamed workers for not following
bad,"JABIL Circuit in Chula Vista overworks and underpays their employees. Period. "
bad,"Not a good place to work for at all. Nepotism is the game they play there. Even if a person is steeling money form the company, as long as they know someone in high places, you can get away with murder."
bad,People are great to work with but managemnt does not care about employees or subcontractors
bad,"Management is not equal with punishment and advancement. People that deserve promotions are treated like crapand lazy people that make lots of mistakes, does a little butt kissing and gets promoted."
bad,The management here is a group of good old boys that pulled each other up through the ranks. None of them have any leadership or business training. The operations manager is under investigation by OSHA and the NC labor board for knowingly forcing people to perform life threatening acts. Management puts production over peoples lives routinely. STAY AWAY!
bad,Never have work. Will not hire you unless you are one of the favourites who suck up or flirt with management or have family that works in the office. They try to keep everything a secret from you. All they do is lie. Its the worst company i have ever worked for and don't see them staying open long.
bad,They suck they give you false promises and pay you great. Yet production is never consistent and you can walk in tomorrow with a new supervisor who doesn't know anything but can fire you at the drop of a dime with no reason why. If you have kids and bills dont work for Jabil
bad,"Favoritism by management. The IT guy's sister dated the Operations Manager's son. Went hunting together regularly."
bad,"Stressful environment that has gotten even worse and provides no support from the new company!  Every Department is massively understaffed and lacks the basic tools to be able to perform your job, then they blame you for not performing.  Management is constantly changing direction everyday due to a new crisis.  Corporate and Upper Management completely disconnected from people who are actually performing the work.  Employee turnover is extremely high, over 60% for both office staff and manufacturing staff each year."
bad,i did kitting stocking and receiving for this company i also expedited parts to the floor  but ended up leaving due to no raises and found a higher paying job
bad,"Title says it all, if you are thinking of working there, don't. No structure, commitment to making deadlines, or paying vendors. Worked employees until they were literally injured. Just goggle Jabil human rights violations, it will tell you more than you need to know about Jabil."
bad,"The only way to advance in the company is through friendships, not merit. Managers will hold you back and make sure you do not get exposed to anything new ensuring that you do not grow in your skill set."
bad,"Many long hour, sometimes 10 to 12 hour days 7 days a week. Very high output ecpecancy. Lot of employee turn over. Very poor employee moral and management only threatened, never built up employees."
bad,"I was only a temp at this company. I could not give much information on anything about this company, also was to long ago to remember how it was working here"
bad,Management is awful they do not like people in the office to socialize with hourly workers. lots of rude people who do not want to help.They love to pile on work and expect you to work a minimum of 10 hours a day or they get mad.
bad,Typical day - receive functional spec - add technical details - get spec approved - start coding.
bad,In my short time there I knew of at least 10 people that were escorted by security because they lost their jobs. I was told not go out on sick leave because I wouldn't have a job upon returning. This seemed to be true because I knew of two people this happened to while I was there. It's a very unstable company that terminates and lays people off often. The pay was decent but they are definitely on a lower pay scale than other companies. If you are a foreigner (Mexican) to be exact you may have a better work experience there. There is a lot if nepotism going on there.
bad,"After promotion to buyer, I began looking for somewhere else."
bad,"Zero management support.  Management promotes and encourages an unsafe work environment.  They ask people to perform maintenance functions that would kill you, have had OSHA called on them for that practice, and still have the same manager that caused the issue while firing the supervisor as if he was the problem.  This company and management is a joke."
bad,"One off those flyby night companys that take full advantage of all their employees ,low wages with no chance of getting a pay increase even tho business is good,all greed on there behalf,management have no respect for their employees."
bad,"Don't work here unless you enjoy poor/bad management and fighting to get paid fully. From week one, it was chaos. They lure you in with promises of permanent employment and awesome benefits with excellent pay and then show you their true nature. Management doesn't know their heads from their tushies, they lie or make up answers and rarely, if ever, actually do anything about bullies or other issues. Not a great place to work for. Plus long hours with barely working machines or machines too fast for one person to handle on their own."
bad,"Unorganized, treat temps unfairly. I do not recommend no one to work there. You never know when you'll have to work. Every department is treated differently.  That's favoritism and that's not acceptable."
bad,Expected to work full-time during the day and have night calls 4-6 nights a week. 
bad,"I've got nothing good to say about Jabil and I'm not going to whine about how bad it was.  Just didn't like the experience."
bad,"a very diverse work environment, , great holiday party, you will learn how to work on a production time setting, minimum downtime"
bad,"Jabil is very demanding and keeps there focus on pushing product out the door more then they care about quality or there employees well being. At one point they were a great company to work for but, the current management is more concerned with being lean then doing what is best for the company or there employees. Would not be surprised to see manufacturing leave St Petersburg within a few years. The month of August we were forced to work every day (including weekends) to reach there goals just to be laid off after one of the plants best quarters"
bad,"I worked with my Production Planner, notifying him of all long lead time, critical parts, so he could advise the customer."
bad,a typical day at jabil it's a normal workplace team working together to meet the customer needs.
bad,Starting pay $9.00 hr. Training is not the best I've seen. Mostly they try to hire experienced employees.
bad,"Managers hire and fire who the want. Human Resources show favoritism."
bad,"Jabil layoffed 35 employees in November 2018. I was hired as a Permanent employee. I was employed at Jabil for only a few months and then layoffed. "
bad,"This is a new company to the Northern Kentucky area. "
bad,need management improvement hours great pay low no union so every person represent their self. building circuit board john deer equipment inside of plant
bad,never worked less than 90hrs a week. very poorly managed. no care for employees at all. good luck finding a parking place. took 3 months to get a computer and space to work from.
bad,Horrible management not involved and blind side you and no training throw you our to wolves and they have favorites and alot of husband and wife's working together
bad,"Though this place has very high quality products, it's not exactly a place you would want to work. It's definitely slave driven. Only favorites of favorites get to move up the ladder. Everyone is very judgmental. Not to mention the drugs, violence, and all types of harassment that goes on in the workplace. Very drama ridden. Managers and team leaders don't handle situations properly or take care of the issue, it's more of a sweep it under the rug type of deal. Only thing decent about this place is the pay, though it could be way better for what you have to deal with on a daily. Environment is pretty clean, at least I can say that. All in all, if you want to go back to elementary school that pays you, apply now."
bad,"Rengeteg munka. 12 órázás amiben max 2x15 perc szünet van. Darabszám fontosabb az emberi életnél is. Barbár bunkó embertelen vezetõség, nagyonkevés fizetésért. A munkatársak megbizhatatlanok megy a nyalizás sok a csókos. Ha nem tudsz nyalizni a csopiknak a legroszabb helyekre raknak betanulás nélkūl. A környezet az étterem jó de sokszor csak arra jutott idõ hogy a finom ételt megvegyem elfogyasztásra már nem volt idõ. Fiataloknak akiknek nincsenek családja azoknak elmegy meg jobban birják a pörgést. Családosok nem menjekenk ide."
bad,"When I came into this job, they were already planning on relocating to Texas. The only thing good about this job was the pay. The Company did not inform us that the job would be ending soon. Our Team Lead told us that and encouraged us to be looking for employment elsewhere. Two weeks before the job was to end, the Jabil had a meeting about another company (IQor) buying out their company and then on a side note, ""oh yeah, Hp is leaving before Christmas!!"""
bad,"Jabil is a great place to work. The pay rate is not the BEST."
bad,Great pay but treated workers like #$%^. No respect for individuals. Change work schedules at the drop of a hat and expected everyone to like it.
bad,"se aprenden cosas nuevas cada día"
bad,"Great company to work in term beneffit, bonus, allowance given... but you never know if you are going to be laid off."
bad,"The Management Team is very unprofessional which resulted in the employees being unprofessional. I did learn many different areas of expertise which has caused me to be marketable as I am now a jack of all trades. The days were normally 8 hours unless there was a large order for a customer or it was the end of the month, quarter or year. I enjoyed being able to meet new and different employees."
bad,"Contract manufacturing is for a very particular type of person.  Fast paced, cut throat, always worried about the bottom line dollar.  There was not much forethought in planning.  We would work a ton of hours and then have to take Monday off unpaid."
bad,"Jabil Circuit could somewhat be a very nice place to work if they"
bad,A mennyiséget a minőség elé helyezi megfeszített munkatempó gyakran eggyik napról a másikra üres öltözőszekrények tucatjait látni
bad,"This was fun work and fulfilling, but the company was very abrupt when advising you the job was over. They just walk you to HR and tell you it's time to go. You think there would be more time allowed to complete work."
bad,If they would keep more companies in American it would keep more people employed.
bad,"A typical day is full with uncertainties. I have learned that a large company such as Jabil Circuits, should have a more hands on approach to the small cell it acquires to, bring it to the highest level of corporate responsibility. This location has serious EOE violations. There is little to no advancement for minorities or people with mild to severe disabilities. The hardest part of the job is due to artificial psychological stress by unknowledgeable secondary management staff members. Toxic work envirnoment due to unqualified management who lack professionalism and racial sensitivity. Advancement is through favoritism instead of merit. No or little emphasis on training or cross training of staff which make a versatile and productive work force. An quasi apartheid work envirnoment, seperate and not equal due to racial alignment of the facility. Little of no notice of work load or mandatory overtime. The most enjoyable part of the job is the benefit package 401k and the stock which you should be fully vested."
bad,productivity is a must the breaks are short and the vending machines are high the managers are understanding and compassionate about their employees the hardest part of the job was when it was hot outside it was hot in the building
bad,Poor management and communication and the pay isn’t enough for the work we do. I loved working with my fellow con workers and making new friends and learning things that might help me in the future with my other new job
bad,I enjoy working at Jabil. I have learned so many things. I have gotten a lot of experiences from Jabil.
bad,"utilization of equipment."
bad,"MI dia especial cada lunes inicio, apredi a realizar exportaciones"
bad,"The management team at Jabil was atrocious with just one exception. This company NEVER had any intentions of sustaining a viable operation in Poughkeepsie, NY and they only made that apparent once many of the upper management people started to leave. The writing was on the wall. They made whatever money they did and screwed the hardworking employees there."
bad,Too many workers and not many of them even did their jobs most of the time. Somehow even with all of the employees we were always looking for more work to do because jobs were not distributed properly.
bad,Jabil circuit is a good company to work for if your looking for long hours. It usually takes about one year to get hired at jabil circuit.  Jabil has a lot of employees.
bad,thru a temp service but the pay was nice the staff not so nice they treated you as if you where jus a number 8 hour shifts morning shifts so not so bad
bad,Atypical workday is hard work. I learned a lot about cable and repair. Management was fair. My co workers and I got along pretty good. The hardest part of the job was the heat in the summer.
bad,"Jabil "
bad,"Not a bad place to work, but the leadership is very poor There."
bad,"La empresa es muy buena los sueldos un poco bajos "
bad,I learn to work as a team to get the job done.But i really dint like the hours pay was ok overall it was something to gain more warehouse experience
bad,"boss wasn't great but the environment was fine. loved the people I worked with just didn't like my boss or lead, they discriminated against me due to medical reasons"
bad,"Where do I begin? I had high hopes with this place.  I started as a temp, and in 90 days (more like 110, but hey who's counting?)i came in full time. Got promotion, but actually took a pay cut. Hows that you ask? Well i was getting shift premium and the temp agency offered me 13.00 an hour to work there. When I got hired in, I actually got a promotion from solderer to manufacturing tech. But manufacturing tech. only makes 12.50, plus I got moved to 1st shift. "
bad,"A typical day working at Jabil vary, one day there is work, the next day there isn't. Little or no notice of how many hours to be expected to work. I learned how to assemble hard drives and data entry. The management needed work, very little direction. Co-workers were easy to get along with, no complaints on that matter. The hardest part of this job is accepting that the hours will vary depending on how much work is available, the most enjoyable part of the job is having work, Time goes by faster and workers stay busy."
bad,"In a typical day at work, expectations are not as high as expected. However, overtime work is normally not done in order to maintain an 8 hour work day. On the other hand, personnel must work harder to reach targets that normally would result in a stable work week, and month in a shorter time, ending in work lay-offs."
bad,Another foreign owned and operated company.  Why does the US let a India based company infiltrate the US and treat us citizens so badly? Extremely poor management at the Florence location.
bad,nie polecam tam pracować . Jest to praca stresująca . z presją na czas .
bad,"Work during peak season 7 days a week , upper management seeks internal candidates for management and give them low starting salaries."
bad,"I started work for this place because I knew a higher up and I needed a job due to my current job reducing compensation and bonus structure to the point it wasn't worth the hours worked for the yearly salary. "
bad,A typical day at work concise of managers not knowing how to talk to adults.
bad,"The hardest part of my job was office politics. Didn't matter if you did your job well if weren't in the ""in"" crowd. Like highschool all over."
bad,My peers were absolutely brilliant to work with line lead clueless and unprofessional and quite bullyish. Very much a crony environment and if your not one of them forget career advancement.
bad,"Jabil es una empresa considerada como clase mundial, pero deja mucho qué desear en la manera como tratan a empleados de áreas clave."
bad,Empresa con mucha grilla y pocas oportunidades de promoción.
bad,Nightly meeting were the start. We learned how to examine product for spicific issues to be shipped to houses. Management was not so helpful in the areas of social issues. It was very cultural. The hardest part was to determine the types of product to fix. Most enjoyable part was the learning of newer products.
bad,Company abuse employees. Terrible schedules and the make people working 12 hours for months when they need and cut hours when they do not need. Life balance in Jabil is horrible.
bad,"The Amount of work for someone like me was insurmountable for the meek wages.Seems like they kept adding responsabilty"
bad,"Not a great place to work in case if you want to have work life balance."
bad,"As an operator Livingston, from my perspective it is riddled with problems from products that do not reach the market, they seem to invest in doomed companies and believe they can make a profit, the management culture is on finger pointing and very much a blame culture."
bad,pretty good job but not good training when u start the job. U must learn as u go. But u did have chance to move up while working at jabil but the job the job was not relaible
bad,"Working at Jabil we went through several plant Directors and managers. There was  always fighting and bickering between line managers, which led to production stops, delays and inconsistency on end product. The plant closed down ultimately  laying off 1300 workers."
bad,I did not enjoy being told every few months that cuts were coming.  It was unstable at best.  Management was unprofessional and our paid time off was always in jeopardy of being mandated of when we had to take off.  That was always on the workload not work life.
bad,"On the surface, a great place to work...which group and building seem to make a big difference. Expect excessive long hours, antiquated inaccurate home cooked tools, education lessons not implemented, local management willing to hide the truth from Customers and Corporate (with made-up processes and metric scores) and misleading Corporate for input affecting the fate of local activities and staff. When your manager tells you to not trust or communicate with HR, there must be problems..."
bad,"Empresa altamente competitiva, con mucha oportunidad de crecimiento para el trabajador, estabilidad y seguridad para los que están vinculados a ella."
bad,I had to do 3 different jobs everyday due to management laying people off. This company could have been a very successful company if the owners would have put someone in charge that knew what they were doing. I liked my co-workers they were like family to me. I learned a lot about laptops and apple computers.
bad,"Having experience of 12+ years with ITIL & Six Sigma Certifications, in Service Industry with  achieving highest standards of Customer Satisfaction, Service Delivery, Program Management & Team Management,  I have developed a solid reputation for successfully and profitably managing numerous concurrent projects, through all project phases from conception through completion within targeted cost, schedule, and compliance parameters. Sustaining a high safety performance reputation, maintaining quality standards, and minimizing corporate costs have been a consistent result of my professional commitment."
bad,Lots of great and kind people but management drove this business in the wrong direction.
bad,I supervosed 10 to 15 employees without being paid to do so. The hours were never set in stone and changed almost daily. Management had no consideration for the employees.
bad,"I do not wish to go into it here. I will say that I had several employees working for me with whom I am still in contact. Management was usually ""out of touch"" with the needs of the employees."
bad,"Passz nem tudom, nekem nem. Volt jó, stresszes 12ora állás fizikailag megterhelo"
bad,"Jabil is good at giving hours giving a sense of job security , occasional overtime and saturdays is code for mandatory overtime mon - sat every week , they underestimate your work ability and are hesitant to advance anyone not in the circle."

bad,"It is difficult to put a review into words. Confidence and morale is very low at this point in time. A lot of good opportunities with a fantastic customer base. But limited resources, technical abilities, and a revolving leadership door make each day very long"
bad,"While there, my team and I had taken it upon ourselves to boost morale, which was abysmal.  Management disregarded requests for help and was primarily concerned with cutting costs as opposed to increasing revenue."
bad,"Not enough internal staff resources to support company growth."
bad,Nem család barát cég... hiába annak hírdeti magát.
bad,"Will not recommended, really bad management that blame all on associates instead of  helping on finding better ways to improve production. (rarely  listen to associates points of view)"
bad,They want you to work 60 plus hours a week and then you stand around waiting for work because they are not efficient in prepping work loads and/or scheduling work.
bad,Work day is hectic always on reactive mode.  Management is inexperience and not fair.  Only good thing about this company is the people they have on board are great people.
bad,"Fast work pace atmosphere, working on an assembly line building computer hardware and detecting parts. I worked 12 hours a day standing up on my feet. There is no balance for life outside Circuit."
bad,Good company with great potential to be a great work place.  Legal department is not a good place for minorities to develop or advance.  No real diversity in the company that develops and/or promote qualified minorities.    Legal department is not organized and a lot of politics with a lot of favoritism.  High turn over rate and no accountability for bad management and malicious treatment of minorities.  A lot of friends of friends are hired with no experience over others more qualified.
bad,"positions with this company could be short time depending on the product line, most of it is being done overseas"
bad,"Administrative Support: to 5 Attorneys and other business Unit Managers, Directors and SVP.  Handling all travel international and domestic. From travel arrangements to all expense reports. Put all agreements into the record system and formatted and finalized agreements. Work on Google email, scheduling of meeting.  I do event planning for the legal department outings. Document preparation review edit and prep contracts/agreements and other legal documents."
bad,No retention of employees. Your just a number on a balance sheet. Lack of strategy communication is missing within management. Not a place to build a career. The company is going downhill.
bad,"They rarely promote if at all black men, some kind of women empowerment work place or something. They are Diverse though when it comes to the employee ranks, and their HR will give you a second chance at work if you need one."
bad,"Wish they had Kaiser coverage. No one likes coverage offered. It is quite a bit out of pocket. Compensation/Benefits...does not coincide with work expectation. Work/Life balance...the worst I have ever run into. Mentality is just ""get it done"", no matter the cost to you or your family, personally. Some management is good, some bad, just like any other place you may go. JobSecurity/Advancement...pretty good because the turnover there is so high, especially with new hires."
bad,"There is nothing really hard to do at Jabil,but the management sucks. They dont show their employers that they appriciate their hard word. They treat you like you're still in high school,signing out for restroom breaks,water etc."
bad,So I started working at Jabil after a rough experience with an employer relocating. Jabil was in the process of reorganizing the company - so it could be just a matter of bad timing but I felt like my expectations and goals were never clearly addressed. Management seemed to micromanage all aspects of my position and the training process was very detailed from the standpoint of the organization but for your individual position was null.
bad,Jabil was a dirty place to work.  The warehouse was always unorganized with little or not janitorial function at all.  Parking was a constant challenge.
bad,There were no certified trainer and communication is so hard that most of the time I don't understand what peer trainer wants to tell. Respect between operators is zero. Without notice they can get rid of you wish they will hire supervisor that can speak English clearly.
bad,"Very huge company, well managed with many managers."
bad,"The work environment was really hard since the management was only management by title not by their abilities.  If you were a good friend of managers, you had chances to be promoted.  If not, you were going to be doing all the work, but you never had the credit.  And management micromanagement a lot at what time do you come in, and specially at what time do you leave.  Big issue if you leave a little bit after 5pm. even your job was done."
bad,"The management is terrible. Little to no consistent communication regarding the way things are supposed to be done, management has no clue what they are doing, only one supervisor actually cared about the well-being of employees. Every bad management decision gets taken out on their employees, including when presses go down. Hours keep getting cut, people get sent home, no matter how lazy the other employees are, temps get sent home first. Being on your feet for 12 hours isn't the hard part, it's the work they have you do during that time. They are currently splitting far too many presses between too few employees, and increasing speeds on certain presses because they're trying to recover their losses. You won't enjoy having any days off because your body will be too busy trying to recover. Breaks were reduced in length when shifts went from 12 hours to 8, and then when they went back to 12 hour shifts, they didn't change the break times back. If you get injured on the job, they will try to put you back to work unless you have to go to the ER and threaten your attendance record. Sexual harassment is not taken seriously, either. It's usually met with ""we'll keep an eye on so-and-so,"" and that's the extent of it. Overall, the company cuts way too many corners, it's not a good place to work."
bad,At jabil you are treated as a number.  Work first and family is second.  Seams to be the norm for a lot of companies these days. All vacation days need to be used for doctors appointments
bad,The pay was great just was bad management and for the temps not many benefits or vacation time.The contract was taken from the HP department and we lost our jobs towards the end of the year around christmas time.
bad,"Decent place to work; great for college students who need more flexible hours, although employees never knew until late Thursday if Overtime would be required on the weekend, making it hard to plan your personal time.  Good Opportunities to move into new positions - unfortunately, sometimes before the person is ready for the job, and often without the training needed to be successful in a role."
bad,I tested directv units I learned how to download soft wear  management  didnt do their job correct  not a very good place to work cause noone worked today  working with no benifits leaving the job
bad,El trabajo en Jabil es muy estresante y no es confiable ya que es por contratos
bad,"Jabil is an old fashion manufacturing industry where it management needs huge improvement. Too focus on customers than employee. OT expected. Developing your career becomes competitive and one of the ways to be notice if you are buddy buddies with the managers. Company lacks training, lack of development, lack of pay, lack of raise."

bad,The job has a great environment with a very flexible schedule.  It's a great place to work and learn more about the orthopedic field.
bad,Closed location due to ability to meet customer demands for products and pricing.  Moved any remaining product to other US or Mexico locations.  Most of business lost to competitors.
bad,"Egyenlőtlen munkamegosztás,alacsony termetűeknek nem ajánlott.A szabványos összeszerelő állomások rosszul vannak kialakítva.Ezért sokan gerinc problémákkal küzdenek.A vezetőség ezzel nem foglalkozik,őket csak a darabszám érdekli,nem a minőség.A szünetek közti idő,akár 5 óra is lehet,ami 12 órás munkánál elég hosszú.Jó munkahely lenne,magasabb bérrel,egyenlő "
bad,"Egy normál napon mindenki emberi tempóban tud dolgozni és nem kell kapkodni sietni sehová. Amit megtanultam hogy kevés emberben bízhatok és ugyan olyan kevés emberre számíthatok. A vezetőség nem túl korrekt és egyenes a munkavállalókkal az elvárás óriási ezzel szemben a bérezés szinte semmitmondó. A kollégáim változatosak, nagyon sok mindenkivel dolgoztam mindenki másmilyen. Van aki tisztességes becsületes egyenes ember és jól el lehet vele beszélgetni valamint a munka is jól halad és van ennek a teljes ellentéte. A munka legnehezebb része a műszak kezdete és fele. A legélvezetesebb része mikor minden feltétel adott és sikerül teljesíteni az elvárások olyankor mindenki örül."
bad,"Jabil is a challenging place to work.  They will encourage you to come up with new solutions and allow you to work without a lot of second guessing.  However, the attitude of upper management is always ""what have you done lately?""  They will terminate you the moment they think they can save a buck.  Also, there is an extreme frat boy culture in the upper levels of the company.  If you're a women or older or just can't hang with the partying and long hours, you won't fit in and will be gone quickly."
bad,"The only positive thing about Jabil is the compensation and benefits are pretty good. The start times change without notice, overtime is mandatory and not communicated until moments before your shift ends the day before.The work load is manageable, however the expectations can be unrealistic. The departments do not communicate effectively, which causes constant arguing and downtime on the production floor. There are hardly in opportunities for advancement unless you are willing to relocate.  Nepotism is and brown nosing are the keys to progression."
bad,Mediocre job experience no job security. Rarely met management so no input on that subject. Job wasn't hard some days I would come to work and not be able to work full shift or even at all.
bad,"A typical day there is usually having to work mandatory overtime with little benefits and few chances for job advancement. The management is strict and there is a a very strict late policy that is unforgiving. The hardest part of the job is the very long hours with minimal wage. The co-workers make the job a little more bearable, but it does little to help with the factory environment.The only upside is getting a paycheck every week. If you do not care and just in it for the money, than this is the job for you. If not then there are other places that can provide better pay and incentives for your hard work."
bad,In my internship there I did not learn a lot but it was a pretty relaxed work environment
bad,"Continual fire fighting and too many bosses.  No accountability and the people who tell it like it is are seen as being negative and difficult.  If you are not a 15+ year veteran of Jabil, you are viewed to as not knowing what your doing, even with 20+ years of experience across multiple industries.  Very unorganized and politically charged atmosphere."
bad,Not terrible but not the best company i've worked for either.
bad,"el ambiente laboral era bueno en si todo el tiempo y me quedaba claro que como parte del departamento de inventarios, era mi obligacion que las lineas de produccion no detubieran su proceso por falta de materiales, pues para eso me pagaban y me gusta desquitar cada peso ganado a pulso, ahora lo que no estaba bien era que los puestos solo se los daban a la persona que era mas barbera, que se la pasaba con chismes con tal de sobresalir, los aumentos raquiticos tanto en sueldo como en prestaciones"
bad,Fast paced environment with many new things to learn. Strict protocols to follow as to product development.
bad,"I've been with the company 4 years, and will be leaving in a few months.  It's been hell to make it this long, but gotta pay the bills off so I don't have to worry about finding another job with equivalent pay.  They have absolutely no retention, and anyone that is fairly intelligent figures out quickly, this is NOT the company to work for.  The communication stinks, there is no team-building, little or no training, poorly executed performance reviews, stifled mobility, and no follow-through.  Do not take a job with this company!!! If you do you will be one of many soon to look for other employment."
bad,"The leadership at jabil is not good"
bad,Falta de motivacion para el empleado para un mejor rendimiento laboral.
bad,This is customer base company. In that company many sections n near about 4 to 5 company product manufacturing n fulfill there requirements.

bad,"Great job, fun work but lay you off in a heart beat. I loved the detail oriented setting where that was a dream to me. But like I said lay you off in a heart beat."
bad,They were there for me when I needed the work. Many of the people I met were helpful and kind. I hate to say this but many people only promoted family and friends and racism did take place on a regular basis. When complaints were made about these issues the people that complained were always let go. It is a real shame because if they just reviewed their business model and weeded out the few people that caused this mess they would be unstoppable.
bad,The job would not be so bad if it was more organized and filled with people that knew what they where doing.
bad,Working at Jabil was the most interesting job experience I've ever had.Nothing was organized and everyone ran around like there was a fire.People were laid of left and right and there was absolutely no job security. It's not a job I would want to rely on.
bad,They enjoy hiring your friend and family because this may be the only place you ever get to see them. No advancement if you're not in well with office folks.
bad,"Routine task and stressful when production face upside -which cause  material shortage."
bad,"- Do tính chất trong lĩnh vực EMS nên khi làm cho Jabil đặc biệt cho những workcell có khách hàng onsite, bạn sẽ phải làm việc liên tục để đáp ứng theo yêu cầu của khách hàng."
bad,always more to do than resources
bad,Working at Jabil it have them days some days we have work and other day they just want you to just clean up all day and when we thu with that they jkus sent you home and maybe call you or not
bad,"I have no negative comments to offer about previous employers, including prior management chains, and workplace culture.  Obviously I left so Jabil culture  wasn't a good fit for me."
bad,"-tôi đựợc học hỏi rất nhiều kinh nghiệm taji công ty"
bad,This company was backwards in the way it operated. There were managers with favorites and it they made that clear with no problem.
bad,The communication in the company from the top down is poor and slow. They always put processes in place and preach adherence to them but then when its crunch time and orders need to go out they want it done by any means necessary. Then worry about or deal with the consequences afterwards.
bad,"Lots of hours were required to be worked (at least when I worked there) and a lot was asked of you. The pay was not good, especially considering all that was required of me on a daily basis."
bad,"a lot of hours , learned more about machines universals , management bad with employee , co. worker friendly does not helped out much,, the hardest part of the job testing,every month , the most enjoyable part of the job running around looking stuff like parts components for machine when it ran out"
bad,"Great team members and peers. A lot of knowledgeable and talented individuals. "
bad,"Overall Jabil is great, however the Memphis location has several issues. Most advancement is for friends and family members of management. Working on production floor is suicide for advancement. Production workers are not seen as options for higher paying roles. The worse part is that those promoted can' t do the job they are Given. So in the end the production workers are being lead by blind family members and friends. If I had to do it again I would skip getting my unappreciated degree and look for a friend in management. "
bad,"work speed changes on a day to day basis, one day it's faced paced, the next... you're counting down the hours. I've learned how to diagnose units and analyze failures. Management, and the organization of the work-cell is very poor. Worst part of the job is having to stand on concrete floors all day long. but the co-workers keep me going."
bad,Is a company where you job can take your private life There is no relationship of the company to the employee
bad,"come capo squadra di un centro riparazioni ponti radio il mio compito consisteva nella gestione delle persone assegnatemi dal mio responsabile al fine del raggiungimento dei target prefissati, quindi organizzare e controllare era il mio compito principale,in qualità di tenico radio a volte intervenivo in prima persona quando richiesto per risolvere problemi di natura tecnica."
bad,Jabil was an OK place to work but there is too much favoritism and nepotism
bad,"When I first started at Jabil, the emphasis on family was strong. It was enjoyable and mentally healthy work environment. With the new management that took place morals and ethics took a back seat. Employees found little to no appreciation from years of loyalty. This company has changed from small town American company to a Multimillion Conglomerate only seeking to advance."
bad,"Managers are mostly know it all degree types, no *real* experience. They don't listen because they already know everything. What is the point?"
bad,Very hard to get 40 hours a week they're always running out of work. You'll get to work and have nothing to do and they make you stand around 4 to 5 hours before they offer vto.
bad,"Első munkahelynek elmegy HA az ember bírja a szivatásokat."
bad,This company cut their most profitable plant without notice of any problems.  Closed it down and moved equipment away.  Certainly a red flag if you wish to think long-term employment with them.
bad,Didn't feel like I was part of the team. My workspace was not ideally located near the rest of the team. The working culture definitely has an old school feel. Stuck in the 90s maybe. Just super corporate and super uptight.
bad,"Was a good place to work until it closed. Jabil management decided that instead of doing several different types of repairs, ie, laptop,PCB,etc., we would do only CD repair and failed miserably."
bad,Boring day at work learn how crimp wire cables and build Automated System locate all positive and negative wire  with pin gages. the hardest part about the is trying to understand what the trainer is saying
bad,Very busy with lots of activities and processes to write and design. Always something challenging on a daily basis. Engineers own their projects and are free to incorporate new ideas.
bad,The company is a decent company overall.  Company culture is hard-working and driving.  Very bottom-line and cost driven.
bad,"People here are very passionate about creating a good product. Unfortunately, the size of the company weighs down on most decisions. Forging ahead and trying new things while not actively discouraged is definitely looked at negatively."
bad,Do not expect a career if you are not from Central or South America. Saw many people brought who were young and inexperienced so they could pay a lower wage.
bad,The culture at Jabil is fun and genuine.   The atmosphere is pleasant but advancement for growth and development is based on personal relationships and not really hard work or contributions.  A lot of politics without oversight.
bad,"Typical day at work consists of maintain  employee  files, records  and change of status​ employee change  requests and process paperwork.  Assists with   recruitment and  interview processes, processing of new hire and termination  paperwork. Performs customer service functions by answering  employee requests and questions. Manage Training Management  Systems procedure training records.Create weekly site Human  Resource communications. Verify employment for current employees and former  employees and process unemployment claims.             Documents human resources actions by completing forms, reports,  logs,monthly metrics and records. Veifies I9 documentation and  maintains books current, verify work eligibility using EVerify. "
bad,Decent benefits and pay but there is very little job incentive which pulls from the morale of the employees.  I learned alot of production values that are utilized in most production setting such as FIFO (First In First Out) and others.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with last minute mandatory overtime.  Other employees there are easy to get along and real team players such as myself.  The one good thing about management there is that there is an open door policy but sometimes that benefit is failed due to unprofessionalism and not having a UNION present.
bad,"We would know what we needed to do mostly some times it would change If we had problems we'd ask the line lead. We would get the jobs to work on checking the operation for each job print, fill out paper work, load the reels on feeders and send the job to the designated lines. Clean up after each job."
bad,Busy work environment with lots of challenges on a daily basis.  
bad,Management is promoted without degrees. Culture is pretty laid back. Pay for supervision is low compared to other companies. Employees are nice to be around.
bad,Each day I must pull orders and store frieght. It could get boring at times but easy work.
bad,"Pelo fato de ser chao de fabrica, o ambiente carregado e corrido faz parte. O que marcou pra mim foi a minha gerencia (Fernando do TI) que pra mim foi um excelente Gerente. Aprendi muito com ele."
bad,All the security standards drove me nuts. I had to leave. I'm just writing to get my needed number of characters so I'll be stopping in a minute here we go!
bad,They should pay more money to the applicant.they deserve better because people in Jabil are working very hard and the company are making money from the applicant. This my opinion.
bad,Lots of drama didn’t keep things confidential bad management Lots of favoritism special treatment to certain individuals Management was very unprofessional
bad,It was continuous change for the work load daily. Management changed hands a lot. The work was unstable at times. It wasn't hard work but you often had to be flexible to work different positions. Then there were days when we didn't have any work. The benefits were reasonable.  If you worked hard and did quality work you could do well.
bad,"I began at Jabil as a 10.50 hour employee and was promoted to production supervisor in under 6 months. That however was my height, with two degrees and a work ethic like no other I was passed by and blown off once applying to positions which better suited both the company and myself. Unless you have an uncle or friend in upper management.....this is not where you'll advance."
bad,The management was a 100% perfect reality I loved sitting at a desk working my creativity on how to arranged different ways to follow clients and the physical therapists.
bad,A typical day at Jabil involved preparing orders to be shipped out for Hewlett Packard.I learned how to make shipping labels and pack boxes for orders in the warehouse. At this particular warehouse management was a little unorganized  but for the most part overtime was usually available. Me and my co-workers were like family and worked together as a group. The hardest part of the job was transistioning from one department to another. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hours and the crew that I worked with and the pleasure of the job.
bad,Always shipping product overseas. I dont really want to write more about the company but INDEED will not allow me to submit my resume unless I say more about the company so I am just typing this to satisfy the word count.
bad,"Regular warehouse, I learned to disassemble lcd's & to put them together. Management & co-workers are not friendly. Hardest part of the job is trying to stay away from drama. And the most enjoyable part is overtime."
bad,JABIL is a typical contract manufacturer and has the typical pros and cons.  The pace is fast with teams broken out into multiple discipline groups to tackle each projects needs.
bad,Not interested in reviewing my current company. Just looking to see what other jobs might be out there. Been working here for awhile and looking to try something new
bad,"esta empresa tiene cosas buenas entre ellas comedor con comida subsidiada al 50 por ciento, transporte lo malo es que los sueldos son  muy bajos"
bad,Jabil is a somewhat difficult place to work.  The turnover during my limited time there is very high and retention of strong contributors is low.  This makes it a difficult environment for new employees.
bad,"no organization, management horrible, way under paid, benefits good, no opportunity for advancement. Too many leadmen and supervisors. Everybody is constantly telling you what to do and do not give any thanks or kindness to people who work hard. They sell their sole for money. Do not know how to run a team. Management has no idea of whats going on. It feels like they are forced by the president. do not care about employees and selfish. They do not listen to open ideas and good logic on things to help progress the workflow. They are people in the wrong positions and I do not know how they got there but its not ok. Once a year raises which is under 50 cents. Basically there is no future and this job is not for high school kids like fast food chains, but jabil likes to think so."
bad,"Repair and maintain production tools, using the best solutions. Delivering products securely and timely is more critical than ever. Jabil's proven track record in lean, quality and IP protection is backed by state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities around the globe."
bad,"okay job to work at, worked there for 2 summers. managers were okay as well"
bad,"I was a receiver . I received Direct Tv box's all day long. I've learned a lot working at Jabil . I've learned how to Receive items , Cross Dock , Inventory & plenty more. I loved my co-workers , everyone was so nice and polite. The hardest thing was dealing with Un Organize Managers And Supervisors . I just enjoyed my job !"
bad,"mission intérimaire lors d'un mouvement de gréve."
bad,I learned alot in leadership. The hardest part was trying to treat people fair with the manager that I had.
bad,When i get to work we have a meeting tellings how much we are expecting to run for the day.So that we can meet our goals by the end of the shift.Working at a fast pace and enjoying what you do.The hardest part is when you have to many people you are trying to help at one time.The best part of the job was just being there with my co-workers. We work long hours so it's like we were family.
bad,"A typical day a jabil can either go bad or go good depending on who you work with. Some days u might come in do nothing all day cause they(supervisors, teamleads) dont have nothing for you to do or the have nowhere to place you. so if u get caught talkin or walkin around they find a reason to fire you. As far as days off they expect u not to have sick kids, family emergencies,personal problems."
bad,"I did not like anything about this company, nothing at all. They gave you plenty hours to work, but the pay rate was ridiculous. No benefits, support, nothing."
bad,"Otima empresa bom pra trabalhar lugar tranquilo nada a reclamar"
bad,"Un dia tipico de mi trabajo es agradable por que me  gustaba lo que asia."
bad,"Ambiente de trabajo agradable con los compañeros, algunos jefes saben convivir con sus subordinados al igual al dirigirse a ellos. Algunas de las áreas saben manejarse para realizar sus actividades y responsabilidades en tiempo establecido al igual que hay otras que no. La mayoría de los problemas que surgen se suelen resolver rápidamente. Y como todo hay jefes que no saben manejar a su personal ya que no tienen respeto a los empleados,"
bad,Jabil es una empresa que se preocupa por la estabilidad de sus empleados  además la oportunidad de desarrollo profesional es muy amplia
good,Very fast paced environment . Must be able to stand on feet up to 10 hours . Not climate control . Left because I wanted better opportunity ..........
good,"The work environment is good. However, the benefits and advancement is not. Its a good job to get n your feet. But not make a career out of."
good,"Necesita más cosas como una mejor administración, los problemas casi nunca fueron solucionados"
good,Nie polecam tego pracodawcy . Zdążył się przypadki mobbingu
good,I worked through a temp service called Talent force. The job would lay you off after giving you a raise and would call you back to lower you pay. You worked more than 12 hours a day and they didnt provide a long enough break.
good,Ok place to work at but it’s only for people who ya e other jobs they will lay you off when ever the work gets slow so people with bills it’s not for them
good,I get along great with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job currently is bearing the stress of the job and management itself.
good,"love my job, but ...."
good,"Los ejecutivos deberían de ser más accesibles, a la hora de que surge un problema solo lo atacan una semana y después se olvidan de él, las promociones deberían de ser reales no porque tengan conocidos y palancas los promuevan, si las personas tienen alergias o dificultades con algún material deberían de tomarlo en serio y no decir que sólo es porque no quiere trabajar."
good,"A munkabért időben utalják, de nem a megfelelő összeget. Az ebédszünetek csak a sorban állasra elegek. A vezetők emberszámba sem veszik a dolgozókat, arrogánsak, nem hallgatják meg a problémáidat. Inkább leszámoltatnak bármilyen indok nélkül, minthogy foglalkozniuk kelljen a papírmunkával egy esetleges ""könnyített munka"" szóba jövetele után. Egyáltalán nem család barát. Előrelépési lehetőség csak akkor, ha a vezetőség kiskedvence vagy. Dobálják az embereket egyik workcell- bol a másikba, neked mint dolgozónak nincs választási lehetőséged mész vagy kirúgnak. Munkaviszony megszüntetésénél nem szólnak, egyszerűen nem enged be a kártya. Jót sajnos nem tudok mondani, csak rossz tapasztalataim voltak."
good,"Te presentan muchas oportunidades de crecimiento, pero no te toman en cuenta, prefieren contratar gente de afuera y tener profesionistas de operadores y tecnicos"
good,Tiene  escasas oportunidades de crecimiento   aún así es buena empresa
good,Need new managers. Better communication skill with staff is needed.Hours changed weekly. They never hire temps. No training and short breaks.
good,They should or may go bankrupt. Not sure they will be missed but if they make it. They will need to increase pay for anyone to live.
good,It behooves you to familiarize yourself with the layout of the building know where you are and at least 2 escape routes. Be sure you know who your immediate boss/supervisor will be. Pay attention to your hand book. Get to know your departmental colleagues.
good,El pago es muy poco y tardan en nivelarte te cambian el turno sin previo aviso y descontrola tu vida laboral
good,"The experience and exposure was great, but the culture is akin to a high school clique where the good old white boys rule and drama abounds. The company takes far too many risks."
good,I was on a great project with a very talented team.  The only bad thing I saw was a lot of really good people were let go in numerous layoffs.  I left because I felt there was a good chance that would eventually happen to me.
good,es mucha presión y es poco salario falta motivacion para los empleados ymas salario
good,"Buen lugar para aprender, empresa en constante crecimiento"

good,"The plant was not a good place to work.  Too many hours, too many days, not enough pay. Was a challenge to just live through it.  It's closed now. Probably ... no for sure it's a good thing."
good,The managers at the Poughkeepsie site do not know how to manage people nor how to do discipline poor performers. They also do not know how to communicate issues to the people on the line leaving everyone guessing. I have never seen a more poorly run organization in my life.
good,"many lay-offs, very big company"
good,very good job which i enjoyed very much  i booked work in as requied ready for the shop floor
good,"I have worked for Jabil Global Services for over 10 years. This company was great for me when I first started as a temp. The environment was great as well as my peers. With the knowledge I gained I was able to grow in the company as a group lead for 3yrs and then I advanced to a Production supervisor over 88 associates. As the years have gone by I have witnessed 4 RM’s (repair managers) to be terminated due to poor judgment and lack of leadership. There are supposed to be 3 supervisors on my shift and now there are only 2 due to terminations of other supervisors. So I'm currently covering more lines of 88 associates while maintaining a manager’s position until that position has been filled. The work load is very heavy and I'm not getting compensated for this or appreciated for taking the initiative to be a team player. I get the impression that I’m not valued at my current job and have acknowledged that no one cares. The passion and pride that I have developed for this company has consumed me and therefore causes me to question the leader of this organization.  Now, I'm looking for a job where I can be of value to that company and be successful."
good,"I loved all the co-workers, I learned so much in the 9 years I have worked here. I think the managerment team needs to be more open."
good,low pay lots of overtime you work every Saturday management has no idea what is going on. You never know if you are going to be laid off
good,Moja ocena nie zbyt pozytywna ponieważ nie zostałam pozytywnie oceniona mimo mojego zaangażowania w cel jaki miał założony zakład.
good,"Jabil has a college fraternity atmosphere. Don't expect to be promoted unless you can hang with the partying and the drinking. Also, they will throw you over in a minute if they think they can save a buck. The work is fast-paced, challenging and requires well over 40 hours a week. Your manager will call you during your personal time and expect a quick response."
good,"Baja posibilidad de desarrollo laboral y ambiente de trabajo regular, sin estabilidad laboral."
good,You work 7 days straight for peak season then after peak you barely got an hours. You can’t bring your phone on the floor and it was a good job. Not enough money for the things you do
good,Én nagyon szerettem a régi munkatársakkal dolgozni.
good,Pay sucks for required work some of the work should be done maintenance personnel. Training is not provided in a timely manner. After safety training all other training is OJT which is only given by fellow coworkers.
good,En conclusion: muy buena empresa con muy mal personal en R.H y Supervisores.
good,Generalmente esta bien anteriormente tenian turnos especiales
good,"É uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, porém muito difícil de crescer."
good,"Jabil is a decent place to work until layoffs come around, which seem to happen every year around the holidays or right after the holidays."
good,"Manufacturing Environment, very flexible with production as in a typical production environment. Difficult to have family/personal life."
good,"Como muito das empresas, a empresa em si não é o problema, mas sim pessoas que trabalham lá, querem trabalhadores que nao questionem nada, apenas façam, pra mim este é o maior equívoco da empresa, e por ser uma multinacional, o plano de carreira também e bem precpario"
good,Company is shutting down so looking for better opportunities. I wished the management was better and the work place is okay but this place was enjoyable and easy. I will miss my coworkers.
good,its not set up for the worker to be most effective. its rewarding in the fact that your work has a high demand.
good,"I gave this empoyer a 100% for 7 years above and beyond in they cut me lose whith out notice."
good,"Es una emopresa en la que me pude desarrollar en la cual pude aprender a trabajar en equipo y a contribuir a la resolucion de problemas de calidad con el fin de mejorar nuestro producto y satisfaser las necesidades de nuestros clientes, sin embargo no es compatible el horario con la escuela por lo que no me permite seguir creciendo en conocimientos."
good,"love to work with employee, on time always no miss day at work worked over time every sat and some times sun big job small job i am there making good quality and i feel good"
good,"I am not satisfied with the remuneration Given by the company. Because i am not only working as forklift operator but also Handling export shipments, Material outward, System updation Etc. hence its very Disappointing to me work here."
good,"Jabil was a much different company when I joined it in 1996. It was transitioning from a small, local employer to a large, international employer. As the company grew, so did the bureaucracy. We began to receive edicts from Corporate HR, which was run by a non-HR person that didn't make sense - for employees or the organization."
good,"On a typical day I loaded the line with product for shipment. I learned on the job to be punctual and thorough, and to make sure all labels are neat and visible"
good,"They need to get rid of R.N. he is a nuisance to the company and great employees. The work place bullying from him is outrageous and nothing is done about it. He's not a fair person, he has picks, especially if you're a young girl. He runs the good employees off and overworks them with no pay increase."
good,"For me, who was a first timer to work in a machine shop, it’s a good place to start  working on parts was a bit complicated but it’s so easy to learn how  to do lay patterning and installing helicoils  defends where you will be assigned to work. I feel like we’re one big family there, working and helping each other if one needs help and assistance."
good,"12 órás munka"
good,"Upper management had no Idea about running the division and had to shut down the branch. While I worked there I enjoyed working with the team, had to work long hours most days and I was under paid for a graduate student."
good,A little unorganized with very few processes in place. Employees who have been there for numerous years understand how the organization is run. Change is constant within the company.
good,"Bom a  Impresa era muito boa,dava oportunidade de crescimento,foi la que aprendir a trabalhar em equipe.bom em fim foi uma porta que Deus mim abriu."
good,Please help others become good or great for the innovative the company is no really doing any more if you make millions by the minute don’t always offer food we love profit sharing to but no one never understand but the poor
good,"The typical warehouse job. Nothing too hard. Some positions require you to stand for long duration of time, but all in all, a pretty laid back job for anyone needing a job."
good,No family time. No matter how hard you work they treat you like you dont exist.  They promote other people who been there a couple of months to a position they know nothing about. You have at least some knowledge of the position but still they dont even give you a chance. They operate by favorites not by who is more valuable to the company and thats not right.If you cant move up then move out.
good,Ha megfelelő vezetők lennenek akkor jo munkahely lenne !
good,ok place to work. friendly people. Upper management ok Long hours and only certain have to work them. on call all the time without overtime pay. Cant be off certain days
good,Had some difficulty with the management. enjoyed my job responsibility. They do not have a good compensation/benefit. Left because they do not have enough hours
good,"Meg kell tanulni tűrni és kitartani ."
good,"I got laid off from Jabil Circuit after working for them for about 6 months.  Company culture is paranoid; policies are punitive and vague.  I was able to do my job adequately but a new vice president stepped in who wanted to outsource the responsibilites of my group to 3rd party companies in the guise that it would be cheaper.  Working for a company of 175000 employee across the globe means that you are just a number and could lose your job at any time.  I worked full-time so my work was ""at will"" employment.  If you're looking for a stable job at a stable company, don't come running to Jabil."
good,"bonne équipe de travail,un savoir faire exemplaire un grand regret que sa soit terminée"
good,"My job was quality control there."
good,"It was an pretty good work place no complaints"
good,You have too much mandatory overtime and the only way to get off is mostly by putting in PTO.
good,Long Hours / Dirty Work Environment. The management team is strictly concerned with quantity as opposed to quality.
good,"hacer requisiciones, dar la herramienta necesaria a operadores de producion, llevar el material procesado a almacen."
good,I learn great knowledge regarding logistic experience and terms on Excel and word knowledge. A typical day at work day was nice and some were hard work
good,Trabajo relajado aunque aveses estresante y con muchas prestaciones
good,"A munkámat nagyon szerettem."
good,debes mostrar conocimientos radioactivo y sobre todo actitud mas sin embargo no hay opcion de crecimiento ni incentivos  pese a demostrar conocimientos.
good,Muchas cosas nuevas que aprender en cada proyecto.
good,"Szociális és PR, illetve szakmai szempontok szerint tekintve, a cég jól szervezett, biztonsági szempontoknak megfeleltethető, környezettudatos, orvosi ellátottsága szerteágazó, naprakész, sportolási lehetőségekkel, meleg étkeztetéssel, külön buszjáratokkal faliújsággal, belső pályázatokkal, véradással, gyermekek megsegítésével, erdőtakarítással és még sokféle hozzájárulással tevékenykedik széleskörűen. "
good,"The IT work was moved to Asia which meant all developers, QA, Ops and infrastrutures people were let go, or found something else first.  These changes were known for a while, therefore the atmosphere was not good."
good,The morale of the warehouse changed towards negative as new management personnel were brought into the company. The lack of advancement opportunities and adequate compensation led many people to take their talents and skills outside the company. Left feeling that I was not able to advance into other opportunities.
good,Too much mandatory overtime. They do not tell you before you are hired about the mandatory overtime. They do not care about your personal life. Treated like a number not a person. They do not pay you according to your skill level. Only receive a very tiny raise once a year.
good,"Negativa, pois não pude colocar em prática os conhecimentos de minha área."
good,"I have engineering experience and credentials. Hoped to get my 'foot in the door' as an Engineering Technician and move up to an Engineering role, but was not given the opportunity."
good,"This was my first job, so I am very grateful."
good,pues la empresa es buena es como todo que tiene sus contras pero si la recomiendo como opción para laborar ahi
good,Just a temporary job. Really cant speak on this job because I didnt care to find out about whats going on with this particular job due to being young and immature.
good,"The corporate managers always have all the work cell use one common computer system. This only made more work because their system never corresponded,"
good,"There was a line work. Not too varied, and it was strict not in the good sense. There was wackers who always on to your back and if somebody made a small mistake like accidentally drop a product, there was one solution: the disciplinary."
good,Muy poca promoción para el personal clave favoritismo para la capacitación importante como cursos de RJG por ejemplo preferencia para el personal con mucha antigüedad
good,"I do what it takes to get the job done that I'm assigned to within following all the proper processes and rules."
good,"Poor management which does not care about people, and does not act ethically. Old machines, old molds. Unhealthy work environment. Career development plans does not exist. "
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, buen seguimiento del recurso humano."
good,"Oportinidad de aprendizaje."
good,Jabil is ok. Like any job it has it's good points and it's bad points. Just focus on your job and not the extra things on the job.
good,"I enjoyed working at Jabil.  I learned so much. My teammates were easy to work with, we always helped each other get the products out on time.  Everyone got laid off because the  company moved out of the country.  A typical day was very busy.  My component level troubleshooting improved with the help of my teammate.  The hardest part was when parts were needed to complete a job"
good,"Processo parava muito"
good,Five plant managers in seven years at Tempe.  Not a good sign.
good,Empresa com alta capacidade organizacional e bem instalada em seus processos e planos. Com organogramas bastante expandido e bem disciplinados .
good,"learned many positions, company is down sizing, it was a great place to work, just needed more reliable help"
good,"Nepotism is one of the things I just could not get a handle on while I was there, Everybody in charge was married to each other, you just have to keep personal things to yourself, you are always on cameras through out the place even on you break, the managers are very petty on issues, they preach quality to their customers, but they don't practice it."
good,Daily meeting with production group.
good,"fast paced environment with quality issues everyday. I.E., incorrectly configured label data on labels, or questions from operators concerning the placement of labels or whether the system itself meets the customer required standard. We also perform purges which seperate the bad material from the good. I enjoy helping people and assuring the utmost quality within the perfomed job duty."
good,Co-workes are nice to be around. Training is starting to pick up for all employees.
good,"Fast pace company, with continuos challenge, working there you learn to know how to report to a different directions, Multiprocesses and high complexity manufacturing enviroment"
good,"Si eres Intern de Manufactura, es como si no existieras en las oficinas"
good,"esta bien la empresa, hay buenos compañeros en el área productiva."
good,"The job is extremely easy. I got to sit, took my breaks whenever I wanted to. My schedule wasn't too bad. But the pay... isn't enough. That's the only downside."
good,"I was a contractor, area where I was at was a secure area. People who worked in there were very team oriented. "
good,"In most cases the management in company is still need improvement,  especially the HR team also needs to improve need to listen to both side and perform a proper investigation before making final decisions "
good,"Trabajo orientado a la reparacion, por unidad de negocio, estrictos con cumplir los metricos de cada puesto, personal de seguridad demasiado observador por continuos robos en la empresa, trabajo volatil al terminarse un contrato con el cliente se cierra la unidad de negocio"
good,Nem családbarát munkahely! Ünnepnapokon is gyakram műszakot szerveznek rendszeresen! Egynapos ünnepeken este 22 órától ! A 3 vagy 4 napos hosszúhétvégét sem kapnuk meg soha! Az ünnepi melót nem 300%  os bért kapunk hanem ingyen egységes vacsorát !
good,"A good job. Productive until it got slow. I worked hard for them. there were very friendly employees. The pay wasn't great, I still stuck with it. Then they had a big lay off, and i was one of them."
good,"I've been fortunate enough to gain mfg and logistics experience working with Jabil.  However, the culture makes it hard to stay motivated and and grow within in the company.  It is a great place to start and gain experience in this industry.  Only problem I see is the amount of politics and favoritism that goes on."
good,"Ambiente laboral bueno , poca libertad y comodidad"
good,This is a relationship based company so promotions are based on who you know which is typically who has been here 15+ years that got promoted up into senior leadership.
good,"La empresa esta muy lejos de equilibrar la vida personal y laboral de los empleados, no te obligan a quedarte mas tiempo pero el staff ve con malos ojos a cada uno de las personas que salen a su hora y hasta una hora despues.."
good,"It is good company to work, cut it depends on what department you work with especially who is your boss. I really like the company and people are really nice."
good,"The workplace culture is more family orientated, however if you are contracted you don't get the benefits nor is it easy to move up the ladder. You learn a lot about the manufacturing process."
good,"some days are cut short due to lack of work. But one can enjoy the atmosphere as it is a big building with a/c.  On the other hand, at time, a lack of communication between those in charge about what to do on the job.  As well as a lack of communication."
good,se trabaja bajo objetivos y metas y eso es lo que mas me gusta romper siempre barreras en mi misma
good,"The work environment was decent, but compensation and benefits were not strong. Like the work hours/shift. Enjoyed the people and management. Would work there again if I were making more money."
good,"Mas o menos ahi mejores lugares "

good,"Nem véleményezem."
good,"Me considero optimista trabajador con todas las ganas de aprender cosas nuevas y enfrentar retos nuevos,"
good,"laid back environment"
good,"6 am start"
good,Jabil is an okay company to work for. The pay is good for the amount of work required to do. The company does a lot of appreciation days for the employees.
good,Jabil was a good first job to work at. We were always busy shipping to our customers especially every quarter. We have nice holiday outings and prizes and promotion with in was great.
good,"Five years working IT testing operator and learn about all types compontant,parts in high technology environment. My fellow co-work are great to learn from.Management is somewhat poor information giving.The job is not hard.Some events and lunch that is giving."
good,"Good company with a great laid back culture, but not much internal growth opportunities. I enjoyed my experience in my dept. and was exposed to a variety of tasks that helped teach me important business fundamentals. My team thrived on interaction and communication which positively shaped the dynamics in the office. I was able to interact with vendors, customers and develop strong relationships in the business."
good,"Good technical knowledge to learn, Very good experience As MNC"
good,"A typical day was 10 to 12 hours long, trying to maintain efficiency while the test department and manufacturing department were at each others throat. Passing the buck on blame game."
good,"Typical day at work is to make sure all testing environments are running."
good,"Jabil is an overall ok company to work for, but mostly if you are a salaried employee.  Salaried employees get better pay, more benefits, and quarterly bonuses unlike hourly employees.  Promotions and advancements seemed to be offered mostly to those who are salaried and in upper management. This will depend on the group/manager you work."
good,The entire company received no wage increases in the 3 years i was employed and then they closed the Tempe site and moved it to China laying off nearly 1200 employees.
good,"Buen Ambiente, grandes aprendizajes y una empresa muy grande"
good,"El trabajo era pesado y eran muchas horas laborando, pero se aprende a trabajar sobre presión y bajo las ordenes de varios superiores, logras trabajar en equipo y a tratar con muchas personas, logras conocer todo tipo de personalidades y a sobrellevar las cosas con todo tipo de personas."
good,Was a great job initially for the first 1 1/2 i was there then a change in Operations Management and the company became about numbers (production). Moral went down and turn over went up...
good,"Great opportunity to get involved with a manufacturing environment."
good,I'm not going to share too much about this one. I discovered that customers weren't buying at their forecasted rate... I reported this and the next thing I know Company wide layoffs... I'm the guy who found the problem that the project management was covering up and they let me go... Along with a bunch of other people of course.... Job security? Nope.
good,"A typical day at jabil was meeting production, staying busy, and being filled with energy. I learned to work at a fast pace. Managment to me was okay. My co- workers were easy to work with we all got along. The hardest part about the job was communication with the management. The most enjoyable part was the comfort from co workers."
good,Working at jabil I had good days and bad days. It was cool but it just wasnt really a job for me.
good,"fast pace, great colleagues, performance focus. Flexi hours but many late calls"
good,"The demands are heavy. The workload is normal, but can be very hectic at times. Its hot in the summer and cold in the winter."
good,Management is unreliable due to the fact that none have experience with any of Jabil's lower positions. Most believe humans should be as pencil to paper: no mistakes and no bumps in the road. The best help is from the co workers as they are in the same position as you.
good,Would be a more productive workplace if management had a clue. Come in and no one really knows what's going on. Coworkers are always pleasant. When I had a for sure assignment it was a worthwhile day.
good,I am not fully bashing the company because the benefits are really good and the work environment isn't horrible but they have the bare minimum on employees that do the hard work and some of us have to do other peoples jobs because they are busy doing another part of there job. I'm glad to have an opportunity to be employed but I definitely think they could do better!!!
good,"Jabil supports multiple manufacturing sites in their SAP instance. Therefore, there are quite a few requests for support and that support has to be coordinated so it does not impact others.  That makes for a busy IT environment.  Which is good most of the time, but it can be stressful and you will be held accountable for your deliveries."
good,New area of businees that has not have the support or knowledge to fully run. Managers are pushing employees to production without criticle knowledge needed by the engineering team.
good,"Jabil fremont was True tech before , so expect a lot of  ex owner friends  running the company a big lack of communication and friendship first before professionalism. Some departments run  without a real supervisor for  months and put people without experience on charge basically for failing."
good,"My duties at Jabil was very easy and comfortable for me."
good,En esta empresa es muy buena para trabajar áreas limpias trabajo sentado
good,"Bedolgozó bér cég,tiszta ,jó munkakörülmények,személytelen"
good,Interesting opportunity with environmental technologies.  Learned a great deal.  Exciting possibilities.  Don't always know what the future holds.  Lots of avenues to peruse with regards to promotion.
good,"Empresa me proporcionou bastante aprendizado e visão de processo. Entretanto, a gestão era distante e pouco solícita."
good,"Overall, Jabil is a good company to work for. They fulfilled all of the negotiated terms and provided good benefits. I had the opportunity to expand my end-to-end supply chain knowledge while there. Jabil culture is committed to meeting or exceeding targets at all levels, which can be truly challenging when the commitments are often very aggressive with multiple dependencies. My work day had regular meetings, but varied by day because I had a large scope of responsibility.  I was part of the management team and we worked collaboratively - which was vital. The hardest part of the job was the uncertainty of our contract and dealing with waves of layoffs. This put a cloud over everyone and was difficult to foster teamwork. Folks did not want to help others or share knowledge as a result and it was challenging trying to stay upbeat. Some of the training provided was merely overviews and no details. I had to figure out a lot on my own and it was quite stressful at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was thanking my team members when goals were achieved or targets were met. I was proud of them and the work we did for the company and our customer."
good,"many have been there for years and hard to change culture.  Hard to be respected as a woman, and opinion be heard.  Some in other teams provided support needed, just depends on the luck of who you have to report to."
good,"Efficient and transparent management needs improvement. There was little to no culture, and most days were just blah. Some days were unproductive because of assembly disruptions, but if they're busy, they're busy"
good,"I loved working on this job.  It was a great place to work.  The money was o.k. I was still a temp and trying to make full time, but the work got slow and I was laid off."
good,its was slow a lot of days so we had to be sent home.  My manger was a lot of help and also our team lead they didn't mine helping out when needed. Which was a lot because they would change a lot of things at the last min.
good,"Es un buen lugar de trabajo,buenas instalacione"
good,Se da poca oportunidad de crecimiento interno y el tiempo para aplicar es demasiado
good,A pesar de que la empresa tiene buenas prestaciones el ambiente de trabajo es un tanto inestable no sólo con el personal sino también con los jefes. La empresa difícilmente te deja tiempo para convivir con tu familia o realizar otras actividades
good,"Jabil cuenta con las herramientas para hacer de la planta un gran lugar de trabajo. Sin embargo, no es así, no existe una cultura laboral que llene el potencial de la planta. No se respetan los horarios de los trabajadores en muchas ocasiones."
good,management was good and very dedicated a time to ensure any employee complaints or suggestions was taking seriously. The workplace culture was very friendly and everyone happily one another and instruct newer employees. The most difficult part of the job was working the back shift which did affect social life at times.
good,Es una empresa internacional la cual se enfoca al servicio de otras empresas proporcionando un excelente servicio para los clientes que tiene.
good,Jabil es una empresa que te demanda el 100% de esfuerzo en tus  responsabilidades y te encamina a aprender algo nuevo cada día.
good,"Jabil is a good company to work for, but management is very unpredictable when it comes to job security. You may drive to work every day in the morning thinking every thing is good, but without any prior warning of notification the management can lay off people."
good,Poor management that was changed four times in 6 years which led to business loss thus its corporate decided to shut down the site.
good,A place where you can learn and improve from the people in your department. Everybody is nice and helpful to each other. Promotes within.
good,"Good Company but no room to grow! Co-Workers were good people. "
good,"L'entreprise ayant définitivement fermée le 30/09/2015, les opportunités au sein de l'entreprise ne se présentent plus"
good,"Es una empresa, con horarios muy flexibles, aunque son horas de trabajo excedentes"
good,My day at work consisted of coming in and checking my email to see the forecast of shipments that were to go out that day. I gathered all information on freight and input it into the system. I learned at this job that communicationb is the key and if its not present that is just a setup for failure because everyone is not on one accord. My coworkers were great we got along well like a work family. We worke together to get orders shipped and labeled. The most enjoyable part was being able to come to work.
good,"Ótima empresa, aprendi bastante. Cheguei num período difícil para empresa, mas ela soube se segurar e permanecer bem no mercado."
good,My time at Jabil was very pleasant. The staff and coworkers were friendly. Although I never knew exactly who my lead was because the kept moving me from place to place I did enjoy the work. The hardest part of the job was standing on the concrete floors for a long period of time.
good,I learned a number of things from working at Jabil Circuit. I love the culture that the company brings.
good,Currently I am working in Electronics Industry. It is US  based MNC and culture and system is very good. I am handling process and customer quality.
good,la verdad era un ambiente de trabajo muy agradable te enseñaban varias campos de la empresa participacion compañerismo
good,Benefits were terrific. You were treated by who you knew and who liked you. Strict. Lots of write ups for unjustified reasons.
good,"This company was a great company to work with at the beginning, but as times progressed it wasn't the company I wanted to continue myself working for. The management isn't that great and you hardly get the hours to maintain a regular pay check. Overall, I really liked this company despite of the problems I occurred here."
good,"Una empresa donde me gustaba lo que hacia, mis actividades, lamentablemente se fue de Nogales."
good,"Just starting their Lean Mfg journey. People /Operators, Engineers, Technicians were dedicated and hard working and very skilled. Product line managers and Upper management drives numbers of output and not quality. They announced they were closing the plant in 2014. No surprise."
good,Started working at Jabil Circuit in July of 1997 putting components in circuit boards for GM cars. January of 1998 I was promoted to line inspector to another line inspecting boards for a water department and transferred back to the original line.
good,"fast paste environment. Voulenteer over time. Little supervision, team work and get job done. Ten plus hours Monday thru Saturday work schedule. enjoyed getting the job done."
good,gostei de trabalhar nessa empresa pois adquiri experiencia 
good,"More work than you can complete in 40-44 hours per week is common.  If you are working with European or Asian groups, you will need to devote early morning or late nights to conference calls or WebEx meetings.  "
good,I would give it a C rating. Learned some new thing that i did not know before.
good,Jabil Circuit is a good company to get knowledges.

good,Jabil was a good workplace. It keeps you busy. The management is very good. Co--workers are very friendly.
good,it was a fast pace job setting that had many attributes but for the most part it was a fun and enjoyable job
good,"Em 4 anos foram vários aprendizados, conhecimentos. Como também a adequar a uma empresa multinacional. Contudo as condições eram simplesmente modernas, e com um sistema de grande utilidade geral entre as empresas de grande porte."
good,Jabil is a great place to start your career. High demands with a dedicated work force. High stress culture but well compensated
good,Estaba contento con mi trabajo y la empresa tambien pero hubo una reestructuración en la empresa
good,trabajo constante todo el tiempo con una moderada presión pero en general buen ambiente.
good,The people there made you feel right at home the only problem was you was expected to know what you was doing from day one. Most new employees had a tuff time adapting.
good,Casi no hay oportunidad de crecer. La mayoria de los mejores puestos se reparte entre las personas de siempre de mayor antiguedad
good,The company has the same freedom for all employees. And the company provides full convenience to all. Mentors help everyone. Selary also occurs at the time.
good,"Trabajo con gran demanda y buenas oportunidades de mejora,"
good,"Tipikus multi. Amíg lehet kifacsarnak, majd amint kicsit kiég az ember, eldobják, bármit is tett le addig az asztalra."

good,I worked at Jabil because it was a nice environment to work in an I had an excellent work station picking an packing items to transport with the forklift.
good,"Jabil dejo de ser buena empresa hoy en dia tiene mucha gente k tiene mucho tiempo trabajando ahí es gente k esta en enfadada k solo esperan k las likiden. Dan muy mal servicio a los trabajadores. Hoy por hoy vi y sentí un jabil lastimado sin dirección, contaminado de gente enfadada, los jefes solo kieren números y la calidad se la pasan de lado"
good,Good people with a.very unpredictable work schedule.Work hard and it will be noticed. Very ground floor but should expect more stability and organization as time progresses.
good,Sometime people call in and you have to be on 2 presses and no help making boxes. VERY fast pace job. If you can not able to work in a fast pace job and this isn't for you. Very easy job after you get used to it.
good,A typical work day begins with a fifteen minutes huddle followed by a production meeting.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with unsatisfied customers.  I've learned many things but the most interesting is FDA requirements and DOE trials and iterations.
good,"This company is all about quality of product, very clean work environment. Has a lot of environmental projects. Plastic, cardboard, paper...cans..etc."
good,"If you’re unable to stand long amounts of hours or work long amounts of hours don’t apply. You will have to work full time hours be okay with mandatory overtime even on call sometimes, job isn’t that difficult once you get use to it, if you’re going to work here you have to be mature enough to balance work and life."
good,It was good over time available . I became one of the helpers in my area . My lead help me to be versatile around the building . I knew more then people who had been there for years.
good,"Good place to work and easy to move up in most departments."
good,"Es un dia como cualquier trabajo , en una empresa  rutinario, es estres normal"
good,"It was a good place to work.  There were a lot of great people, there.  It was lacking in decisive IT management, in my opinion.  IT direction was easily influenced by the latest technology whether or not it was a good fit for the current environment."
good,"It was pretty cool, nice people. Great vending machines with a lot of many different choices. It was kinda fun. Played music. Didn’t mind helping. Only bad thing was a little discrimination with Hispanics"
good,"Muchisimo trabajo y creo que los salarios no son muy altos, ni hay equilibrio en la vida personal y laboral de los empleados, haya área de trabajo muy nobles en algunas áreas si se puede. Pero si es pesado el trabajo ahí y debía ser bien pagado. De acuerdo a la ley si debemos asistir a juntas escolares"
good,"Good supervisor, safety first area, some co workers are bad manner, good for learning experience, normal workplace culture, peacefully is just normal."
good,one of my first job in a warehouse facility. I must say there leadership group taught me alot and i soaked up all the information i could. i learned how to drive all equipments their is in a warehouse. Thanks
good,"Work was slow but steady"
good,I worked as a contractor for Jabil. I did not have much work experience before than in manufacturing. I believe it is a good place to start out working to develop your skills in a fast paced environment.
good,"40hrs a week plus overtime loved my job hrs 5am to 1pm"
good,Szerettem ott dolgozni. csak kevés és rövid szünetek voltak

good,Good working environment. Hardest part of the job was not knowing for sure on what type of work you will be doing that day. It depends on priority or parts available.
good,After working the first year we were required to work 70 hours a week with no time off. This went on for close to six months If you called in you were written up and after three times you will be fired.
good,"My experience with Jabil is different than most, probably. I initially began employment with Telmar that was then bought out by Jabil. I started out in the probationary period with $9/hr with the promise of a pay raise every 3 months for good performance. First raise was for $1/hr extra and then for the next year based off performance. Only to find out 3 months in that Jabil had put a freeze on all our pay raises until the merger was complete.

good,"modern kori rabszolgatartás"
good,Jabil was a decent company but manager picked favorites and wasn't much advancement in the company. you never knew when you worked overtime until that week.

The hardest part of my job is trying to cram everything into 8 hours. The enjoyable part of my job is that the company compensates us for our hard work.
good,Love the people but serious about my job stand behind my work 100%

good,"I worked for this company for 8yrs and i injoyed working for them i mean management great,teamleader great,and so was some employers they was ok bottom line is that it's a great company to work for."
good,I was a temp employee and I was not going to convert to permanent position. The overall job was okay. The people who I worked with were good and easy going.
good,Management style varies wildly from one division to the next.  Be careful about the assumptions you make when taking a position elsewhere in the company.

good,"El apoyo de la empresa es bueno, pero algunos departamentos no tienen la estructura deseada para que  la carga de trabajo pueda llevarse como debe, y no haya retrasos."
good,"abil is a very fast-paced, high expectations company. So if you're not a person who is easily overwhelmed, you'll do great. Although the company has 200k employees worldwide, it still has a small business feel within the corporate environment. The work environment is flexible, the work itself and what the company does is incredibly interesting, and the people are stellar. You also get about two weeks off at the end of December, when the company shuts down."
good,"As long as I finish the job, then I'll be fine."
good,So far the team that I work with has been very laid back and helpful. I am learning everyday. Its a laid back environment with business casual dress code. They pay interns well but employees are compensated on the lower side.
good,I work for the company When it was very small and grew with the company with full support with those I worked with and around. When it became a global company I moved into a global position And thoroughly enjoyed it. The work hours and the travel got to be more than I wanted to endure.
good,Management is the only problem with this place.  The work is trainable and enjoyable.  The pay is decent for the entry levels but low in industry for higher positions.
good,Good company to work with / for. Be prepared to travel. The company has locations in 20+ different countries and they share resources across the locations pretty frequently.
good,"In this company, the benefit is the most important the sing we should to look at. Right now,  the semi-conductor field is going down too much, so it makes the company slow down. The job here is not secure at all."
good,"Empresa boa para trabalhar, no geral"
good,"Jabil es buena empresa en general, pero si el tiempo de trabajo puede llegar a ser excesivo dependiendo el área en la que te labores. Los salarios no son los mejores y no cualquier puede ser promovido a menos tengas algún contacto"
good,A great place to work if you understand your role. Tons of training to help you succeed in any area you may be interested in. The pay is average. However with all the training you receive there's no limit to your earning potential. Job security is 50/50 so it is best that you learn all that you can.
good,"Jabil provides stable employment and everyone is employed full-time. The pay is not competitve with other defense and aerospace supply chain companies in the area. The turnover rate is moderate, but certain positions, such as soldering, have higher turnover because Jabil pays low for that skill. Overtime is added without much notice and is often mandatory. "
good,"La empresa como tal, es buena, sus prestaciones economicas son muy buenas, el ambiente de trabajo es bueno, la carga de trabajo es algo pesada, debes de ser tolerante a la frustracion, pero la evaluo como una buena empresa."
good,Estabilidad laboral lo de subir de nivel no está tan fácil aunque ya están trabajando en eso
good,"Every night that I came to work there would be some machine that would be fast while others that would be slow, but if you're a good multitasker you'll adjust easily. Every night it would be different, for example you would have two machine to work on or sometimes at least four, but don't feel bothered most machine are very easy to handle. We also had to weigh some boxes with there plastic product in it to get a certain weight that the box is suppose to occupy. I did learn how to package, I also learned as team we accomplish task by working together. I did also learn that it is okay to ask your co-workers for help when needed or helping a co-worker when it's necessary. I worked graveyard shift so that being said I would say staying awake would be the hardest part about the job. In my opinion the most enjoyable part of work is we have these potlucks and everyone brings home-made dish they make, dessert, and snacks; for me that's enjoyable because you get to be a family with your co-workers. We come together and enjoy each other culture environment."
good,"Buena oportunidad de crecimiento en la empresa. Jefes capacitados, sin discriminación, oportunidad para todos y respeto."
good,"Se preocupa por el desarrollo de sus empleados, sin embargo las promociones no suelen ser de caracter abierto."
good,"Empresa que sempre busca manter uma boa relação com seu funcionário , para que assim ele possa ser mais produtivo e estar mais disposto a trabalhar."

good,Es buena empresa solo es un poco complicado el superarse y subir de puesto

good,"Handled many different types of payroll. Used ADP for weekly"
good,"A mixed bag like any corporate. Great ""family"" environment complete with the occasional dysfunction.

good,A empresa investi na bastante em treinamento e capacitação dos seus funcionários.
good,"Thích hợp với nhiều người,nhất là người đã có gia đình"
good,"Very interesting and fun products and technology but management lacks good vision. They react too quickly to what they perceive as the latest new trend and add manpower when it isn't going to be needed. This results in reductions after the trend passes or the expected customers wane, as they surely do."
good,This company has taught me and molded me into the worker I am today. I have been treated very well in my many years of employment.
good,"Boa, "
good,"Tramite de contratacion recia por mi salario anterior vs el que me ofrecian, pero con trabajo y experiencia demostre en poco tiempo liderazgo, amistad, profesionalismo, logre crecimiento menor al año y promociones antes del año laboral."
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Jabil is a great company to work for. The people are really nice but nice a better management. I had a wonderful time working for this company but I didn't get enough training from the management but overall it was a great experience.
good,"I typical day could be anything from building up machines from drawings or filling up boilers with gases. i have learned a bit from this job as I was out of electronics for a while it has got me back into factory work, co-workers are good, the hardest part of the job is waiting around a lot I like to be productive I enjoy a day that goes by when busy and i have no idea what time it is. That is a good day for me. Work hard and go home."

good,"Stood up most of the time taking care of a lead machine, Great job but a little to harmful on the lungs."
good,I have learned a lot since I started in 12/2010. I got a great sense of the business world and how keen the military world with how precise and specific there build criteria is. Met a lot of great people while here. I enjoy the laid back and the come in do your work and get to go home. You can leave your work here and not worry about it when you go home. The hardest part is sometimes there isn't much appreciation from management and consolidation of roles on your plate with little compensation. 3 plus years here and absolute no room fro growth unless I would pursue engineering or and IT role which I'm not.

There are many on here that say you need to know someone to advance (and sometimes it feels like you do), but I can say that I was promoted by those old school employees on merit. Considering I don't have a college degree and was an engineer making just shy of $50K/salary...that's really all that needs to be said. When you get promoted, don't be afraid to negotiate.

good,A typical day at Jabil Circuit was great. I really enjoyed the work environment as well as my coworkers. The management was extremely helpful and played a vital part in my advancement within the company. I started as a temp through a staffing service and soon after i was offered a full time position. I was selected to attend a hand soldering certification class and upon completion i applied for the job of a hand solder 1 rework technician. I was offered the position for which i applied and from then on everyday was different. I reworked damaged circuit boards and returned them to the production line. Learning the skill of hand soldering was a bit tricky but after training and working along side senior solderers i was able to develop great technique. Acquiring new job skills at Jabil Circuit was the most enjoyable part of my job. It made me happy to know that my management team thought enough of me to move me along and help open doors of opportunity.

good,"realizar las actividades acordes a tu área conlleva a que tengan un buena perspectiva de ti, y con base a lo que se aprende por mi parte fue una de las empresas de las cuales se puede obtener un gran conocimiento acerca de soldar, por lo tanto gracias a esta empresa tengo una grado de aprendizaje sobre la soldadura a lo que también hago referencia es que te certifican para poder desempeñar el trabajo de soldador, la dirección era muy exigente, pero correcta ya que por motivos obvios cada empresa tiene sus reglamentos, sobre colegas eran amistosos y se puede llevar una buena relación de equipo de trabajo, sobre la parte difícil de trabajo siempre diré que lo difícil un poco es el adaptarse a las cosas nuevas pero no con decir difícil digo que es algo imposible, si no todo lo contrario cuando uno quiere salir adelante las mismas ganas te hacen salir y realizar el trabajo de la mejor manera y por lo tanto dejando una buena impresión de ti, y sobre lo que mas me gusto de mi trabajo fue el aprender cosas nuevas e interesantes, cosas de las cuales tal vez nunca hubiesen pensando aprender algún día mas sin embargo lo aprendes, y por lo tanto creo que eso es lo más bonito de cualquier trabajo que siempre tienes algo nuevo que aprender."

The hardest part of the job would be competing against other smart and hard working individuals that want to go up the ladder."
