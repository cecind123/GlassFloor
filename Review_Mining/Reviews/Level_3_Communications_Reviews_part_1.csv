rating,review
bad,Hours are long and morale is low. CL is no longer an upcoming company. It's main concern is production and making money while ignoring employees needs.
bad,This company doesn't provide a culture conducive to growth and goal achievement.  It is mostly a company run by friends who promote their friends and there are tons of broken systems and processes.  Management is incapable of having a clear vision and remaining organized for meeting numbers.
bad,Precisely what the title dictates. A company that abuses both its employees and its customers. They harass their clientele into buying and rebuying their product no matter what the contact point.  They force their employees to make a sale on even the most dire customer call.
bad,"Poor culture. old mindset of doing business. 8 systems that dont speak to each other. forget about support. management is horrible. micromanagers. sales process is the worst. daily meetings with no value, waste of time meetings. no one knows what they are doing. product over priced. not a good company to work for. run away. this has been the worst company i have worked for. the management is inexperienced with managemnt style from 1972. very poor culture. high turnover. pay sucks. this company is a joke."
bad,Stay away....poor management....Texas friends and family Dept manager is the worst...figures she's always right and honestly don't care if she's not!!
bad,"Bait and switch hiring process. They promise a nice workplace, gym, cafe, etc. but then when you start working there they tell you that you are not eligible for all of those perks. They lie about the shift you will be working and offer poor training. The description of your duties is not at all what you will be doing and they put immense amounts of pressure on your work hours. Taking this job means being insecure about when you will be fired and sitting in a cubicle for 11 hours being watched every time you go to the bathroom."
bad,I don't have anything positive to say about my experience at CenturyLink so I'm not going to say anything about my time working there or the people I worked with.
bad,"A typical day would start with answering 15-20 calls with in your first 2 hours, along with pick up tickets that were sitting in the bucket since the morning. Receiving pings from management on how this is unacceptable and that it affects the Sl. Constantly being told we are not meeting company standards with tickets and call. Being pulled into meetings with management about gossip from the team that turns into drama set by certain same people. You walk on eggshells as a contractor and are constantly told by others that you aren't going to be hired on. Your character is made for you by others on your team. There were some good days, when the lead tech would set time aside for you to teach you new troubleshooting and or configuration to help customers and get their issues resolved. Even with a great call survey it still flies under the radar and the negative overcomes the positive even though it was due to something out of your control. Management was more for team building than support and help on hard task and/ or projects. Management created the problems within the team by picking out the problems from your one on one performance reviews which were for your weaknesses and strengths. I've never given a job a 1 star review but CenturyLink is a place that deserves it. I've asked for help and was told that's a personal problem and that you're a contractor and you don't have HR rights. I have met some really great colleagues who have tried to help and get me on other teams and ways to deal with the issue at hand but management would stop the movement from happening. The director"
bad,"What a horrible place to work.No care for anyone but making sales,no matter how.Training was garbage. As a former manager with Att I ended up helping train my own classmates.In fact taught one class because I was certified and my trainer wasn’t.Employee turn around is fairly high.And they don’t care.I took very sick and all they wanted to do was try and scare me to get back to work quickly.Even before I was over my sickness.Had a much better experience at Att or Time Warner"
bad,"terrible people, terrible place, not worth the stress it causes for absolute no reason.  I was never once questioned on my product, but was constantly followed around to see who I was talking to.  My job required constant communication.  The manager was out of their depth."
bad,"It’s all on the job training; you pretty much have to ask a bunch of questions to try and learn what they’re trying to do there. No formal training. After a few months you’re then asked to be on-call for one week, 24/7. It sucked and was extremely stressful  The work culture was sink or swim"
bad,Poor management and use of employee time and training. Training period lasts for a month and focuses on mainly sales and how to obtain the customers buy and not on how to do the work required when sale is made
bad,"Horrible place to work ,micro managed  to worst degree . Smothered. We are adults and you are treated like like children. I would not recommend this company to  my worst enemy. Expecially on the lead generation department"
bad,Terrible The pay is good and is better after three years but they lie about everything the work conditions the work that you do the environment the only gratitude and kudos that you get is from actually working with the field supervisors not from the department that you work in at least in Sioux Falls
bad,"Lower level management was too concerned with themselves and not the company.  They did not listen to their employees, only to those they wanted to impress."
bad,I was actually hired by level 3 communications before century link bought them out. 1 month after the buyout I was terminated informed by the century link manager that I was unqualified for my position that I held for over a year with level 3 Colorado is a right to work state so I was terminated on the spot no way for me to fight to keep my job
bad,"no advancement, no pay increases. Executives take huge bonuses each year. There is no culture of pride in this corporation as they just look at employees as just a number and replaceable"
bad,"Its like high school all over again. To much drama, and the supervisors don't care. The hardest part of the job would have been got me is trying to calm someone down who is mad at someone else for messing up"
bad,they keep you for the 90 days training period so they don't get fined by the government for massive phone to customer abuse and forced hidden charges after certain months.  they cycle you out every 3 months.
bad,"This employer is one of a kind in that they terminate employment based on a whim with no reasoning whatsoever.  The culture is cut throat and if you can claw your way out of the gutter, this would be a great employer to work for.  If however, you expect that you and your work will be respected, that will never happen!"
bad,"I started when it was US West. with each merger it just kept getting worse.  They cut, cut and cut. I spent most days waiting to be laid off. The only benefit was the union that bargained education benefits. That is what helped me finally escape."
bad,"Manager is messy. She makes up rules as she goes along. No structure can’t take days off when you want. Lies about your pay and PTO days. Doesn’t want to pay OT or Holiday pay. Stressful. Manger texts and emails all day long threatening you that you’re going to get fired. If you have vacation days scheduled she will try to talk you out of taking them. Very messy, and aggravating job"
bad,"I do not feel like typing this whole message out.  im sorry, but the Boss hooked up with my girlfriend at the time . people are shady... I couldn't or wouldnt work for them at the time"
bad,"Company where they have old habits and no idea what to do. Still waiting for correct pay from Nov 2018.  They don't care about you, just make sales, don't pay you on your sales you've made.  They have 3rd party HR and Payroll, and you can't talk to some about your pay."
bad,"The products are horrible, and you are constantly dealing with customer complaints. The company does not value your work. One minute they love you, and the next they are showing you the door. They have a high turn-over rate."
bad,"The higher management wasn't supportive at all. It was very odd, they didn't tell you what you were supposed to do until the same day you were doing it. They tell you, you're going to be a ""account manager"" which is just a nicer way to say you'll be selling internet and tv services from door to door, monday to saturday."
bad,My manager was awful and didn't communicate with me at all or even give me a review and they let me go through my recruiter after my shift on a Friday night so the Manager is unprofessional.
bad,"the work ethic there as it pertained to customers is disheartening. I was not able to continue to mislead customers about their charges and bills. I was told by the manager that, "" if you don't like it here.. there is the door"" we can find anyone to replace you.. "
bad,"After having job threatened on a daily basis for over a year even though I was a top performer I decided to leave CenturyLink best decision I ever made. "
bad,CenturyLink is that company that has to much money to care about the customer and employee experience. Work here to learn how to be driven to work somewhere else.
bad,"Management Snake Like, Pay Low, Requirements High, Little to no training upon hire, Unwillingness from other employees to aid/train new employees,  Overworked employees"
bad,Management is set in their ways and unwilling to change to better most situations. The buddy system in the work place is why this company will continue to over spend on nonsense and under value talented employees.
bad,"You get incoming calls about billing and somehow someway you have to convince customer to buy something from you, as soon as you realize how the system works and how bad they are scamming customers then they try to give you every reason to leave the company and they actually start writing you up"
bad,This place makes their quota too high for their reps to reach.  If a rep doesnt meet quota in 3 months they are released.  The quota was increased to a point that the average rep was not able to meet the quota. Thi resulted in nearly all employees getting let go.  Now the company has a revolving door for this reason.  This allows the company to not have to pay for benefits for the employees.
bad,"Managers are always busy and out of the office, which means employees get to do whatever they want. A lot of unprofessionalism and gossiping. Favoritism from manager to specific employees. Raises are low and takes forever to get one. Repetitive work. Work environment is segregated, pretty much you are in or out. Huge cigarette smoking community. Training is confusing and stressful since there are always changes in work processes."
bad,"Typical day at work with lots of meetings and collaboration but never gets things done. What I learned is that time management is crucial but, metrics and we work by the numbers and not qualitative results. Workplace culture is lenient yet, unproductive. Management are not lax about metrics. Bonuses are not based on performance but seniority."
bad,"I saw many people quit or get fired due to poor management and lack of communication. One horrible manager ruined the lives of a few employees only to get fired himself. Century Link did not reach out to any of the affected employees, they just forgot about them and what this manager did."
bad,"The management has its head in the sand. Good people are leaving the company daily due to terrible management, poor compensation and a lack of care for employee contributions. At this company, if you suck at your job you get promoted."
bad,"people are petty everywhere"
bad,Management was horrible training was a joke. They pretty much gave me none and then threw me on the phones to take calls a day expected me to know what I was doing.
bad,"I left a career of 11 years at Chase Mortgage as an Asst. VP to pursue a career as a senior analyst in Marketing at CenturyLink only to be laid off 3 years later with ZERO WARNING!!! My family & I suffered severe financial difficulty, we almost lost my house to foreclosure since I was unable to move due being a single mother & having 2 teenagers in high school. I made a huge mistake for believing in CTL's values because they were definitely NOT followed."
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for. Nonstop layoffs. You only get paid salary but are expected to work 12-16 hours a day and weekends. They have no budget for anything. This company is a sinking ship, beware."
bad,"Don't expect much when you go to work at a company with no budget, no training, old equipment and nothing but excuses from management. Sorry you just have to do the best you can. The creator of Dilbert worked here!"
bad,Most of the time things were just thrown at you and I had to figure out my own work. The only culture here is a layoff culture with no peace of mind. Find somewhere else that will pay and treat you what you're worth.
bad,"Now this is saying a lot considering some of the difficult companies I've worked for but CenturyLink is hands-down the worst place I've ever worked. Not only are the sales goals ridiculous to meet especially in a retention capacity, whose aim isn't even to retain customers but only to force additional products on to them, but the management and training team were in many cases extremely unprofessional to both customers and representatives alike. And considering their massive turnover rate it doesn't surprise me at all. I literally made myself sick working there and I'm glad I left to pursue better opportunities elsewhere."
bad,this company does not pay it employees the commissions they earned. the company does have proper separation in different size businesses so an enterprise rep can sell into small bus but not the other way around
bad,"CenturyLink was the only company I've ever worked for that I absolutely regret subjecting myself to. I needed the income, but as soon as something better came by, I was gone. Most of the management is forceful with sales requirements and selling products that customers repeatedly say no to."
bad,They have bought up too many companies and have no idea what they are doing. I will not be surprised if you see them sell of a lot of assets or go bankrupt
bad,"i hate this company//cut throat they treat  techs like they are low lifes constantly changing schedules and interfering in ones life, making it hard to see kids games etc"
bad,Will never work for the company again very poorly managed and does not care about its employees at all all they care about is sales they do not care about the individual or customers at all
bad,It was poorly run and opportunities for advancement are minimal. The schedule was not good and they were always cutting hours. they do not teach you how to take the technical knowledge into normal language.
bad,Poor management. Under qualified workers. No training. This was a nightmare. Was set up to fail from the beginning. Feels like a bunch of negative unhappy people here.
bad,Great wage poor leadership.  Message was unclear. Treated employees as numbers and worse if those numbers weren't 150% of what they expected.  Management tried but company had unrealistic expectations of them as well.
bad,It wasn't the best place I worked they focused more on sales than they did customer service and you would be dinged for not meeting your sales goals (even though it was a customer service position).
bad,"Had to resolve incoming calls an average of 2 mins, and if could not resolve call, then move customer to next step. Staff was not allowed enough time to update case calls and had to move on to the next."
bad,"Centurylink is a company that you will never get comfortable with, you are always under pressure, very hard and complicated job and unprofessional and your job is not secure, supervisor i had does not have remorse for your situation but she can be late because her shower was not working"
bad,"Don't even apply. Awful. Awful."
bad,"I would never work here nor would I recommend anyone else to work here.  The management is weak, the hours are long, and the company culture is like the movie Boiler Room...every man for himself"
bad,"not a fun, relax, place to work and they under pay. working for this company the stress level was so high i end up with a miscarriage. i would never recommend this place to a friend"
bad,"Poor decision making from management and very poorly run company.  They do not care for their employees, demotivate, and overwork them.  Stay away from them if you're looking for a good company to work for."
bad,This company was an awful place to work. I was never allowed free time for my personal life and the hours were insane. They required MANDATORY work socials that were unpaid. The company also never paid me for any of the office hours I put in or the commissions I earned.
bad,"Sink or swim environment, training isn't very planned out. Temp employees do all the training, employees walk around on egg shells with fear of loosing their job."
bad,"Bad management from top down. If you don’t have 30+ years, getting time off when you want it is almost Impossible.  Company is in transition of getting rid of all craft employees and replacing with contractors."
bad,"I started when the phone company was all the baby Bell's, like Mountain Bell, Southern Bell, etc. Life was good. Then it became US West,life got better, and then Qwest and life was great.  Then CENTURY LINK took over.  Life was terrible. Poor management, you never knew what was going on, they cut the benefits, they cut our pay. From day to day you never knew if you would even have a job."
bad,"Centurylink paid a lot of money to be acquired by Level 3 -- CEO and all main management are former Level 3. Simply put, I have never worked for a company that has been more up-front about the fact that they do not value or respect me as a person or an employee."
bad,Nothing good to say about centurylink. They do not value the assets that they have in the company at lower levels. It is a revolving door of employees and they are lucky if new highers stay for more then a few weeks.
bad,"CenturyLink will not pay you your commission, this is the worst place ever.  If you don't care if you get paid or not than it is the best place to. You can make more money at the car wash."
bad,this job is not what they tell you when you join. no support and this company is not organized . they cant get anything correct. i would not recommend anyone   to join this company
bad,Micro managed to the point of being set up for 100% failure.  Remind you daily and frequently that if you're not doing what they (leadership) demands of you (even if it doesn't produce positive results) that you will be fired in short order.
bad,"If you are willing to sell your soul for a bonus check and lie to consumers, you will do great here! Stressful days, micromanagement, and angry customers all day, every day. Then they try to buy you off with sales contests for CenturyLink t-shirts."
bad,"Very poor leadership.. they all don't work at that store anymore. I wouldnt recommend working here unless you like work bullies, two-faces, jealous of top performers and no Team ethics."
bad,Qwest was a great company to work for when Centurylink took over they took away vacation days and changed the commission plan to be CPE first service second making it almost impossible to earn commission with the Mom and Pop Shops in the base. I left this company within a year after the take over. Found a job I loved that was also unfortunately bought out 2 month after I started.
bad,The culture is not a work friendly environment. The company is not stable and not a company you should expect to make a career out of. They don’t provide much encentives for employees as well.
bad,"I was laid of as part Level 3's takeover of Centurylink.  I was 1 of 500. Then they laid off the directors after they did the dirty work. When podunk Centurylink originally took over Qwest, they got rid of all the departments and tools that allowed for smooth operation and replaced them with inefficient programs that cut efficiency in half."
bad,The union is pointless they do not do any thing for you.  managements never there to answer your questions and the pay sucks also they make you pay for parking down town with no reimbursement.
bad,Centurylink is a very busy company. they are very undecisive on what job function they would like for you to do. Management was good until certain changes were made
bad,"Management was the worst!  Nepotism abounded! It was every man for himself, including the old bags!  Nobody wanted to help anybody and did their best to see to it that you failed at whatever task you were given."
bad,"A typical day consisted of call backs, cold calling and sales.  The culture provided healthy competition and adequate resources to do your job and comparable."
bad,"This company provides you with some challenges, changing leadership and different schools of thought on what it is to be a strong leader. You can see a lot of turn over."
bad,"N/A....Got sick on the job...Resigned during probationary training period. Was not properly monitored(rest of training class had advanced further into the training due to being sick and improper monitoring) during training period, got sick, could not catch up with training class."
bad,"Nothing to say about this job at this time.  The parking sucks, the management doesn't have a clue, and the customers are really rude.  The hiring manager did not tell me that I would have to meet a certain sales quota to keep my job.  I would not recommend working here."
bad,this company is run by people who know nothing about providing customers good service. The people in the field are the only ones who keep this company afloat. Centurylink doesn't keep up with the technology and is getting left farther and farther behind each day.
bad,"No real room for advancement its all about who you know."
bad,CenturyLink doen't care about their people... just the numbers. There are better companies to work for.  If you do decide to work there negotiate big before you walk through the door.
bad,There wasn't a whole lot of work on a day to day basis.  The work I was given I completed pretty quickly and even the normal day to day stuff didn't seem like it was enough to justify so many contractors.
bad,Not ajob for someone looking to get your foot in the door at a majorcompany for job advancement. The way customersare treatedwill affect you every day
bad,CenturyLink is not a well run company and they do not care about their employees or customers. There are not many career advancement opportunities. company is not investing in the infrastructure to keep pace with current technologies
bad,So much for the company being religious and giving people a second chance.  company made you read religious material on work time instead of working. Pay was decent
bad,They want you to lie about your services to customers so they don't look bad. BIG SCAM! All they wan you to do is make sales no matter how you have to do it (even lie)
bad,Management encouraged bending the truth to make the sale. Compensation structure is the worst I've seen. Very little to no consequences to individuals not doing what they are supposed to be doing and you have to pick up the slack.
bad,No key metric system for accountability. The work is simple but the company does not know how to maximize the potential of the employee.The pay is horrible.
bad,They are too strict on attendance the union wants money monthly but when you have a issue the union can not save your job and they are personal friends with manager which defeats the pupose of having them in the meetings. Supervisors favor the employees employees can steal your sales product is not good everywhere but they want you to lie and say it is. Too many billing calls when you suppose to be in sales department
bad,"Not going to put my neck out there. Its not great put it that way. I do like the people that work for me, they're great. As for senior leadership in Monroe don't have too high of hopes."
bad,Never work there ever again worst management team and everyone there is dating each other. and its just a bad place that you dont want to work at for the money
bad,management has no clue from the top down what the consumer wants or how to give it to them fairly. lack of customer attention by micro managing numbers and not focusing on the needs of customer. not a customer friendly business. Over the last three years the consumer has recognized this poor performance by driving down stock price from 40 dollars a share to 14 dollars a share what this company needs is a clean slate from CEO to supervisors that care about their employees. The employees will take care of the customers.
bad,"Centurylink employees have not received a living wage increase in nearly 8 years, working conditions are extremely stressful and micro-management is rewarded over employee recognition"
bad,"I loved working for Century Link.  It was my second family."
bad,Pay was not good for the amount of stress and the team wasn't fair to each individual. When you need time off supervisor would take to long to approve it or schedule someone
bad,I can't stand this company. Everything ymthwy do and have you do is a joke it seems like it is all peaches and cream to you start on pho we then it's a get through it on your ow. No d of deal and if you don't meet sale requirements they terminate you.
bad,I hated working there. People would find ways to manipulate customers into things they didn't want on their account. Management doesn't care about the people who work there. Favoritism is apparent. All they care about is adding more to people's accounts than the services.
bad,This company was so bad that it got acquired by another telecommunications company.  It had poor management and a complete lack of respect for its employees.
bad,"This company is poorly run, has no culture and terrible infrastructure. "
bad,"They will do whatever they can to get rid of you before you make it to 1 year"
bad,It is an us them mentality with large gaps in training and knowledge. They have their favorites and treat contractors as second class citizens with no rights or equality. Extremely high turn over among contractors and employees alike. I would say there is 0% chance of being hired as an employee despite their false promise otherwise.
bad,I do not recommend this as a company to be employed. Opportunity of advancement is impossible. The pay is alright but the oppportunities of pay raises are based upon someone's opinion of you.
bad,CenturyLink is an very poorly run company.  They/re management team is inconsiderate and not knowledgable of the work that is done.  They do not support the work force only interested in their budget goals and numbers created by people who have no experience in the field.  They are not customer friendly.
bad,"CenturyLink was created when Embarq and CenturyTel merged.  When CenturyLink took over, first thing that was done was to cut my salary, said my job salary was too high compared to the same type job in CenturyTel in Louisiana; cost of living of where I lived was not compared to cost of living in Louisiana.  For the last five years that I worked there, a typical day was very stressful as managers were constantly spying on employees to see if we were talking with each other instead of having nose to the grind stone.  If you went to the bathroom and happened to stay too long, you were questioned as to your whereabouts and being gone so long.  My group was timed on how long a phone call lasted.  Our hours would change from day to day.  One day 6-3, next day 9-6, next day 8-5, next day 10-7, next day may go back to 6-3.  Never could schedule any doctor appointments when I would have time away from my job, because if you took time off during work hours, it was a chargeable occurance.  I  loved my job before my company became CenturyLink.  Nothing nice to say about CenturyLink as my job was sent off shore and partially brought back and temps were hired.  That tells me they wanted to get rid of long time employees; don't have benefits for temps.  Most enjoyable part of the job was leaving at the end of the day and days off and friendship with other employees.  Sorry I couldn't have better things to say, but I have a really bad taste in my mouth when it comes to CenturyLink and how they treat their employees."
bad,job  inefficient training travel safely training health insurance returns tools  work vehicles great coworkers good support good location a very stable job
bad,good place to work unless they replace you with contractors and you no longer have a job.  They will also train new employees in another state at a lower rate then move your job to that state to get out of paying you the higher wages.
bad,Very stressful and demanding working for over 12 hours everyday due to numerous events & shows. Experienced hard work with very little top executive management support. There is no such life and work balance working for this company!
bad,The management and cut throat style was a huge turn off.  All the company cared about was the bottom line and had no regard for how we obtained our goals
bad,"This company has to outsource/off-shore good paying American Jobs."
bad,There are constant changes with the policy and procedures for the company. The expectations are set to a certain standard without providing the adequate/sufficient tools in order to meet those expectations. It is a very stressful position and work environment.
bad,"it's an okay place to work for seasonal time not much room for advancement, if you would like a raise you will have to work overtime and bring the company more money"
bad,"When I worked at the Sioux City office, the management was more interested in making a ""date"" for the evening than watching their teams.  If you did a good job for them they didn't acknowledge it they just pushed more work on you.  When you tell them that you needed help with it they would say ""Do it or your fired""."
bad,"Not a career path I would choose for myself.  Cut throat , and threats constantly.  Would not go back to that position.  Workplace culture was very uncomfortable."
bad,"Run, run, run, run, run. Very abusive place. They don't care about workers. They over pressure workers. If you don't sale, you get fired even if you're not I need a sales position."
bad,"If the water forms"
bad,This was probably my least favorite place to work. When hired I was hired for customer service and after a couple months we were told we needed to do sales as well.
bad,Centurylink only cares about making sales. They fired employees in the US because the replaced jobs over seas. Centurylink allows employees to mislead and lie to customers to create sales. This is a horrible unfair workplace.
bad,"Completely under staffed and under paid. The company was a revolving door, which led to unqualified employees. This is a good job if you are going to school."
bad,The work environment can be hostile at time. Little to no room for growth are the opportunity to express yourself with skill sets
bad,The pay was absolutely horrendous and the job itself was one that I dreaded waking up and going to every day. It was probably the worst job I've ever had.
bad,When I worked here the office was ran by a bunch of women who had no idea what they were doing. I felt like it was a big soap opera working there. Workers over worked due to lack of staff.
bad,"Not geared toward family, goal driven, no incentives, no yearly or Christmas bonus, treated like a number and not a person. Over all not a good place to work."
bad,This company is hanging on by a thread.  Despite attempts to transform the organization is hampered by a combination of dated technology and a mix of company cultures that has never been successfully melded into one cohesive unit.
bad,"Taking telephone calls from customers and helping with their account needs. Improving my skills with each call. 40 hour work week with 8 hour shifts from 11 am to 8 pm Monday, Wednesday through Friday and 8 am to 4pm on Saturday's. Days off were split days on Sunday and Tuesday. Very hard to keep your hours and days straight with sleeping habits and work hours. I worked well with co-workers and enjoyed the job and helping the customers. The hardest part of my job was selling products over the phone to existing customers and also customers whom had lost a loved one and were closing out the account for the person. I thought this was very rude to ask a customer to purchase a product when the loss was overwhelming for them. I would still be working at this job if I did not have to sell. I also would still be working at this job if it paid 15.00 an hour instead of 9.00. I could not pay my existing bills and feed the family on the current income."
bad,with old bell system you were able to advance if you got education and were willing to learn.  you also had different levels of supervision that looked at the overall picture so the direct supervisor had limited power to stop advancement.  over all the company has degenerated into a self interest policy that the management staff uses to advance themselves to the detriment of the company and any employee who gets in the way.
bad,Projects continue to be pushed out and post phoned. Leadership only hears what they want to hear. Performed Senior and Lead QA functions and also Development and Analysis of a Wholesale Ordering and Billing application.
bad,"Deceptive practices by team leaders"
bad,This company is not above lying to the customer to meet sales infact it is encouraged. No job security your job is constantly threatened by management  the center management is a joke!!!
bad,"An undesirable work environment with poor executive leadership. Constant change in the business model, product emphasis, and market focus. Company does not honor established compensation plans. CenturyLink is trying to morph itself into an enterprise IT solutions provider with Telco mentality and talent. Recently laid off 2,000 employees and completely missed expense goals."
bad,"I was fortunate to have a job. Good beneifts , the above wouldn't let me rate higher than 1-it was 5 star rating. I had to earn my seniority to get good hours. That was about the hardest part."
bad,phone landlines dwindled and Centurylink took over company and closed all centers that were legacy Qwest.  replaced union employees with cheaper employees lots of outsourcing overseas.
bad,"supply chain management,warehouse type of work,work as a team,self managed, work monday thur friday,good work group to stay "
bad,Management was inappropriate and terrible. Unfortunately I was there while an employee was found murdered and the company did not have the decency to have a memorial for her.
bad,"A typical day at work involves being smothered by your supervisors constantly, even when doing well. Management is very unreasonable. Do not get this job if you need any type of medical accommodations because there is more red tape than going on disability. Even though its a union, the benefits are a joke. Management is constantly in a terf war with the Union, trying to keep you from full knowledge to your rights as an employee. you even have restrictions to get your employee discount!"
bad,"Copper, Fiber testing and installation, cage modifications"
bad,"started off all was good doing tech support for advanced services. "
bad,"Excellent Bonus incentives,  Base on hourly pay and sales.  I made daily sales and received Bonus's and gifts throughout my daily shift"
bad,"take inbound calls "
bad,hard work but a great place! I don't have much else to say about it.
bad,"Century link is a sales job. the employee must work on his/her own making door-to-door sales; TV, internet, and phone services. the jobs was tough because it was compensation based, also the salesman had to provide himself with their own transportation."
bad,"Do not work at Centurylink if you care about equal opportunities.  I have worked in 2 different positions and both jobs provided horrible experiences.  I have seen a lot of favoritism and discrimination.  One of my Old supervisors was also seen taking advantage of his position on many accounts.  I have also witness Centurylink putting an employee in a supervisor position who knows nothing about how to do the job that the group is supposed to do.  What were they thinking?  Too many poor decisions have been made by upper management and complaints made by lower personnel always go ignored.  I have also seen wrongful termination as well as wrongful employment.  This was a horrible place to work and many claims have been filed to Human Resources regarding the terrible and inappropriate actions that were being done in the work place.  This was the most unethical place I have ever worked in my entire career of Telecommunications.  I consider myself to be way over qualified to result to such a lowly company.  However, this may be a great place to work if you are fresh out of high school and have no skills or ethical values."
bad,"I was a bit afraid of getting this job because of the low pay. But when I got the job I was made to believe that everything would eventually work out. Nope that was a lie..."
bad,"What can I say it was a contractor position under paid, over worked and to far from home, but in order to put something on the table for the children we have to do what we have to do!"
bad,"Everything that I was taught was on the job training.  I was able"
bad,Qwest was never a company that I felt I would be able to feel completely comfortable at.  You could never be sure if you were going to get laid off that day.
bad,"very political environment, constant turn over; the company was acquired."
bad,"So I accepted the job for a Customer Service rep in Boise, ID at 10.50 per hour, a raise to 11.00 after 5 weeks, and then a raise to 11.50 at the end of assessment.  Assessment is basically a one month period where you have to hit 70% of the monthly quotas or you are fired.  About a month in they brought our new hire class into a room and told everyone they weren't going to honor any of the pay that they promised.  They said it had something to do with the new contract that corporate and the union signed and there was basically nothing they could do about it.  They are going to keep our pay at 10.50 an hour and then get .25c raises every six months.   What company does that???  Not to mention it is illegal because we all signed documents about our pay structure."
bad,CL stock is lower today than when they purchased Qwest. Employee morale is all time low. Customers are leaving in droves. Customer Service has been slashed.Benefits are horrible if you need medical. Current Des Moines Sales Managers are slippery and not equipped to handle their positions. Sales people last about a year on average. Very sad.
bad,answer phones. push the customers thru the call. cause you where timed on each call. i have learned that i hate call centers. management does the best they can. co workers are fun part about the job. hardest part is answering the phones. enjoyable part going home.
bad,"Typical day at work was hetic and busy, A lot of calls coming in. But sometimes dead and no calls. I learned a lot of new systems and codes. Management, Well my management I always seemed to have trouble with, she continously said I was doing something wrong. It was my first time ever in a call center, But for a first timer I was doing an great job compared to others thats been in call centers for years, I'm just saying. The hardest part of the job was getting your supervisor to like you. The most enjoyable part was the diversity of customers and the different moods you had to deal with."
bad,"No Opinion. No Review to post."
bad,"The focus is sales, sales or sales. If you happen to help a customer that's nice but it's not a focus. If you are not sales focused it's probably not a good match for you."
bad,This company is VERY good at lying to you. They tell you that you are joining a family and that you are treated more like a person rather than a number. I was isolated from my counterparts and was treated like a second class citizen. The management would constantly emotionally abuse me and treat me like I was uneducated. 
bad,this employer does not work with your needs as an associate.  The advancement is non existant the pay is very low for what the job entails.  management is not the best.
bad,terible company to work for mangement sinks they dont aloud to get sick time plus they take half of commission away but they want to sell there prorducts and get nothing back
bad,"The job was okay but there very flaky in job security, was not happy."
bad,"AN hour and 1/2 drive each way. Learned certain product knowledge, computer programs (13) Hardest part of the job being online with customers while supervisors and employees threw and batted balls around the call center or rode electric skooters, tandem bicycles. Most enjoyable was treating the customer with respect and the reward of solving their particular problem"
bad,People making up numbers just to hit their quotas and no one seems to care
bad,"They constantly make you feel that your job is in jeopardy. Constant micro management from managers. While trying to help a customer, the manager is sending you an IM about what you can sell them. I had this happen while an elderly woman was complaining about her $1.00 increase in her bill."
bad,It’s a mindset of socialism/communistic in that they could care less about you. They expect you to be cemented to your sit blasting thru calls and getting perfect scores on everything but they monitor you and video tape your whole day while you sit on your computer it’s so 3rd world it’s unbelievable to me that in the USA this is what we have sunken to  and if you die in your chair so be it but that’s how it is
bad,It is a dead-end job with high stress he will have health issues and they will make promises of advancement that do not exist    There are plenty of other places to work in the valley so look around
bad,"After 18 years with a company that I planned on retiring from, they outsourced our organization to an off shore company. Poor management decisions have led this company down a path that there is not return from."
bad,Company has sales reporting issues.  Reps are not getting paid correctly which the company has acknowledged.  Rep will need to be able to live off of base salary and not commission.  Micromanaging has increased dramatically.  The company is not very competitive with competitors.  Company also has stated they may sell the consumer and small business market.  Medical benefits are decent.  This used to be a good place to work.  Its all changed.
bad,"I was hired as a ROW Agent and worked at the I-17 and Camelback location. I was one of three agents hired across three States since four previous ROW agents walked out on the job. I didn't find this out until after I was hired and started working. My job was to oversee all ROW projects in WA and MT, and to manage/review the contractors work for final submission. My only resource for learning the company's internal databases was a narcissistic crusty old hellhound, who was also the only other ROW employee there. She was tasked to train me by our ROW manager, but refused to do so, and openly insulted me in the office in front of everyone. The few other agents (6 total) spread across the other States had similar attitudes depending on whether or not you were accepted by the coven. My ROW manager had neither Right of Way experience, or mgmt experience. He said he had a friend at CTL who told him about the open position and was hired. He had only been a RE attorney previously, and knew nothing about Right of Way. In less than three weeks after starting, I was forced to file an HR complaint against the black-hearted beast when it became obvious that the public shaming and berating was never going to stop without intervention. I never had to file one before at any previous employer, and the complete lack of training was affecting me. I tried to soothe the demon with home baked goods and compliments to no avail. My HR complaint was filed through a 3rd party company, whose own employees stated that complaints filed through them were worthless, and it was just something companies did"
bad,"The management at the Johnson City,TN call center tells their reps to lie to customers and tell them they can do more on their slow speed internet then they can with higher speed companies cause it is a ""dedicated line"". And if you have been there awhile they will feed the senior people the sales calls and their top reps can lie to customers and be hateful to them and they don't do anything to them at all. And they set ridiculous goals so you can't make good money."
bad,There is no protection for the csr. A customer can curse you out for 30 minutes and you are not allowed to escalate the call or warn the customer to refrain from the language.
bad,Before the level 3 and DirecTV take over the company was great.  new management came with new ideas that didn't work and haven't for years but yet they still chose to lay off technicians and customer service representatives.
bad,Centurylin k is not a place to begin a career. The best thing is to get in make money and get out. The benefits are good and everything however the management is not that great.
bad,"The managers are fake...think they can talk to employees any way they want and treat you with disrespect. They have the pick. Money great health insurance sucks. No job security, if you do not meat goal they will fire you at a drop of a hat.  But if they just don't like you they will fire you. I have seen this happen as well."
bad,Location was Downtown .  Secure Building.  Busy work . Schedule breaks and Lunches. Sit 90% of the time. Busy and mutil tasking required. Answer phones.
bad,"Macromanaging, Bad decision taking - Bad work environment - They don't care about their employees. a lot of BS employees characters and your voice as an employee will not be heard. Policies are very awkward"
bad,"If you don’t have experience working in a call center, nor have tech experience DO NOT apply! They told me no prior experience was necessary because training would 6 weeks as advertised. Well, training was 7 full class days, then I was on the phones. Having absolutely no clue. Stats started to count as well. I reached out to my supervisor with concern on lack of training, he said he would provide more training, but the training coach (arrogant, Mr. know it all) ignored the supervisor and ran the show as he pleased. The coach was rude, and demeaning when help was requested. Terrible training approach overall. Employees within the center were also rude especially if they knew you were new. I had a sales rep in the same building hang up on me because I transferred a call to him by mistake. CenturyLink didn’t even offer parking, I had to pay $100/month to park on a $13.50 hr, job, bye! Boise center, get another coach/trainer!!"
bad,This job is not what it seems to be. The management in this Small Business department are very unprofessional and lack integrity and knowledge about the job itself. Upper management hires people in leadership roles not based off of experience or knowledge only based off of who you know. The goals are unrealistic and just not a good place to work. They have sneaky ulterior motives and they care nothing about you being sick or having children.
bad,"The management was very poor at Centurylink.  The training was good, but once you left training, nothing was the same or relevant at office,  They need to send the managers to the same training."
bad,"I would not recommend CenturyLink to anyone."
bad,no cost of living or any pay increase in 5 years. management will promote their friends instead of the person qualified. absolutely no training provided
bad,"CenturyLink wants to be a top-tier technology company and they do some things well within specific and limited circumstances, but they are lying to themselves about their capabilities and ability to execute on much other than voice and network solutions in markets where they have a relative monopoly.  "
bad,horrible company to work for that does not have the tools available to do your job and so they frequently make them up as they go.  Seems like their entire focus is to rip customers off and sign them up for long contracts for bad service
bad,"Days can be on and off busy management shows favoritism, basically you have to be a certain culture to move up pay is low for the work load required.."
bad,We were required to meet unrealistic goals for retaining customers for a product that consumers were replacing with lower cost and better performing alternatives.
bad,Leadership talked a good game but actions did not match their words.  Worked 60-80 hour weeks for past 2 years.  No promotions.  Poor leadership.   Unwilling to listen to employees.   Terrible planning for future.  Trying to survive as a land-line telecom company with a quickly shrinking customer base (do YOU still have a home phone?) by acquiring other companies to offset losses.   You have been warned.
bad,"You clock in up stairs with your supervisor running late as usual.  I learned how to use their billing system which was rather easy however, the constant over charging customers really got to me. Random charges would appear, for no reason and I would of course adjust them. I really grew tired of all the drama there. I am there to work, make a difference and do a good job. NOT get hit on, not get oggled, not be harassed. I was happy to be gone."
bad,"The benefits are worse than we had before, by a small margin, but cost nearly twice as much. They made all managers and above interview for their jobs after the acquisition, then called it an employee termination of employment if the interviewee then refused a job offer at lower pay and/or in a different position after said interview."
bad,"This is a door to door job.  When I first started everything was great, made great money, made my own hours, then management changed and our leads became repetitive, we were going to the same areas over and over. The Century Link company is hurting itself by not having good enough internet speeds.  Customers did not like the products so sales dropped, so my paycheck dropped (100% Commission pay).  Now, the market I worked at went from 12 people to 3 and we just lost the market."
bad,"This company will use you until you are used up, then will toss you out to the wolves, management is disrespectful and once they get what they want then are done with you, literally (the worst company I've ever worked for in my life)!!!!!  Would I ever go back there again, they would have to clean management up, and rehire anew.  Or change companies (wait a sec, mental note, there changing to Level 3 Communication).  Don't trust this company, I did and got screwed out of 17 years.  Take it from me it's not worth it."
bad,This environment is a family neighbor environment everyone lives in each others neighborhoods or all related by marriage or family. This place was not diverse and need better managerial operations.
bad,"So when i started working there i really liked it. I started to noticed that unless we are selling something to the customers.... ""there issues are not our problems and get them off your phone."" They promise services to customers and then dont deliver the correct services. which in turn screws over that agent that spent an hour with them on the phone setting up the sale. when they do call back and complain a new agent will erase the old sale set up a new one and then steal the sale. This company is so corrupt that even politicians look like saints."
bad,"One of the worst job experiences I have ever had."
bad,"Very stressful selling environment with almost impossible monthly sales goals, which leads to being forced to badger your customers for a sale. Management was a joke, it was pretty much sell or else we'll fire you..."
bad,"Very stressful, but fast paced. Very important job tasks that are vital to their customer's ways of living. Some co-workers were helpful, but some weren't. The hardest part of the job was trying to help customers solve their problems by having to use a very unreliable system. The most enjoyable part of the job was some of the fun activities that were planned by a committee."
bad,Managment doesnt care about Employees. no training. you have to work by your own effort and management don't appreciate your hard work instead you get laid off. Management exploting your knowledge with out spending a penny for  your training.
bad,dont join century link wast company  . i did not learn any thing. frist they put PIP . after they terminate. with out reson they terminate .waste company. dont join
bad,"Management is afraid to do what needs to be done to fix things or they are simple tools and too stupid to realize it."
bad,"There are some bad businesses out there and Centurylink is one of them.  Today, most leaders there are incredibly rude, loud and insensitive.  So, not only do you get that from your customers, you get it from management.  I can honestly say, this is the worst company I have ever worked for.  They change on a dime, just when you get used to doing it one way, they change to another way, and threaten your job if you don't.  The union is terrible too, as they seem to be on the payroll of corporate.  Take it from me, if you work for Centurylink, you are putting your whole career at risk.  I mean seriously, what company would sent their leader out on the call floor to yell and scream at employees, with a football whistle while your customers are yelling and screaming at you.  GIVE ME A BREAK!"
bad,"retaining business customer's services, great co workers, making sales on retention calls were the challenge of the job."
bad,"Challenged my though process."
bad,It was nice being able to talk to different customers. The negative side to the company is that a sale is more important than customer satisfaction. I also never liked that when a customer asks for a manager they are never really transferred to a manager but just another rep. I also did like that I got in trouble for speaking Spanish to a customer that spoke no English instead of getting praised for solving their problem. 
bad,Horrible job!  No job security!  Everyone is treated like children.
bad,All I can say it left a very bad taste in my mouth. Even as employee with access to significant discounts for the services offered...I did not wish to have those services in place due to the fear of slamming or cramming additional services without my consent.
bad,"If you are looking for a place to get your foot into the workforce, CenturyLink is it. However, this place has poor management and low morale. Most people are there for the paycheck and there's very little motivation to do more. Management is mostly the legacy Level3 people who exhibit very outdated practices. Get some experience and move on."
bad,This place is a rat-hole. The managers are horrible and the HR are scumbags. Avoid this place like the plague before you catch it!! The pick alot of temps build you up. An the min they say want to get hired... They fire you as soon as you say yes. An wont even tell you why. You lose everything!! This place cost me alot!! Avoid it at all costs!!
bad,"Stay away, that is all.  A bunch of charlatans who look to take EVERY advantage over their employees.  They have an absolutely horrible reputation in the marketplace.  There's nothing here that you can't get at Comcast, Verizon, AT&T or any other provider.  They can't keep sales people because there is no culture to speak of."
bad,"The company had a very strange management culture.   There was abuse by the upper management, and when brought to their attention, nothing was done.  Compensation was flat for years, while upper management received all the money.  They are beholden to their shareholders and not the employees.  They talk a good game, but make no action."
bad,"After over twenty years, I would not go back to this company. We were not treated as valuable employees more like cattle to be herded, never encouraged, never appreciated."
bad,Management is very incompetent along with the supervisors! The managers or supervisors don't know anything about what they do! They are all related or very close friends! No room for advancement at all!
bad,Bad business practices.  Poor treatment of employees and customers and executive leadership takes forever to make decisions then are poorly  executed. I’ve become increasingly embarrassed to tell people I work here because they unload all of their service complaints on me that are valid.
bad,"Poor management, company spends millions on upper management compensation, while the outside plant deteriorates, management only cares about numbers and production to get their bonuses. Company shifts the cost insurance including any raises to the employees while giving upper management and board of directors free lifetime benefits including their families."
bad,"Manage a base of 200 accounts, poor management, benefits cost more every year, people rarely get raises..they just keep piling more customer on a already skeleton crew!"
bad,"irrational management, job description over the past 5 years changed from installing & repairing customer ckts to making sure a scorecard has percentages of the tasks that do not apply to a what technicians have done for years"
bad,Handled the merger with Level 3 very badly. Management is terrible from the top down. Was very difficult to do business with for both the rep and the customer. Was a very difficult place to work. Extreme micro management!!!! Could not go out in the field more than 2 days a week.  Had 4 engineers and 3 CSM's in 5 months. Too many changes.
bad,"A typical day includes working installation orders for customers and taking phone calls from customers with questions and requests."
bad,"Never paid for commissions earned.  Constant pressure to sell, sell, sell even if it isn't what is best for the customer. VERY high turnover no job security at all. Poor management. No support. If we had a question we had to call another call center in a different state and find someone there that might be able to help."
bad,Centurylink will bring you in with promises of career development and advancement but in all reality it is structured so that it is near impossible to advance. The initial training is pretty fair but in the world of telecommunications there should be more frequent  follow up training. Employees are left to figure out new products and processes without proper processes in place.
bad,Alot  of job stress with little return. All bonuses have been taken away and the metrics to meet job requirements have increased.  Company  has taken away all joy and stability
bad,"Was told explicitly that national technician opinion was NOT welcome.  It made NO difference what we thought regardless of experience.  Metrics are EVERYTHING and nothing else matters.  Customer service is irrelevant and unimportant unless it is a measured item.  ILEC services are ""not profitable""."
bad,"No work life balance- everything is NOW NOW NOW, but it never is Now, because management the ones that are supporting you do not look at it like that, ""You support them"" Constantly changing methods, do not follow process (which they have) make it up as the go along then blame lower management and employees for the issues. MICRO MANAGEMENT at it's finest. A  mission//vision statement in 2016 - Empower the employee so they can be involved with the decision making. ""NOT"" They rarely let the employees do their job assignment without constant surveillance."
bad,You will be micromanaged and belittled with zero upward mobility in sight. The most de-motivating environment to work in & you will never be payed adequately.
bad,"CenturyLink is a very ""who you know"" company when it comes to advancement in one's career. Little to no consideration for work performed and dedication to the role is done, it's really decided by friends of friends. Management positions are posted, only as a formality and positions are actually filled prior to the job's posting. Annual goals are set high and even when met does not guarantee a bonus or even raise in salary. Workplace culture has improved over the years but managers, who are out of touch, haven't made it easier. Overall, I would have a hard time recommending this company to a young person beginning their career."
bad,Centurylink is a fast paced environment that requires you to be a self sufficient worker. You work in/out of peoples houses and businesses. You work in all weather conditions. Supervision style can be micro- managing.
bad,"CenturyLink is the worst place to work. There is NO training, no help, no collaboration, and no chance for advancement. Management lies to the employees. This is a dead-end job."
bad,"Lied in the job recruitment form, only sales such a driving force employees lied to customers to keep their jobs. The customers would then call in feeling lied to and instead of providing customer service we were forced to sell"
bad,"I have been with this company in the support for going on 4 years I was hired to just work high speed internet fast forward I now take calls for voice,prism video,fiber,high speed internet and well as the ton of misdirects from the ivr I opened the center and after all this time they still don't have a clue how to run it. They like to point the finger at the employee but yet don't give proper tools management don't take calls due to Union contract so they really can't relate. Union was great in the beginning but has leaned with the company and we no longer get bonuses or a raise every year that is more that what health care prices go up. When I first got the job it was exciting now I just feel over worked under appreciated and kinda stupid cause I have no clue what I'm doing well a little but not like we should I am not alone most text employee's feel this way and management don't care it's all about numbers and pushing dumb things like a survey or the my acct app"
bad,I was lied to about the position I was told it was a technical position as in technical support and I got there first day and low and behold its sales but had to support my family horrible how they lied
bad,Enjoyed while lasted they really mix up the job when they tell you what you're going to be doing they say it's customer service but it ends up being a high pressure sales job
bad,I feel bad for Centurylink because they have to follow all the regulations the united states government puts on the industry.   But none of the competitors have to follow those standards because they are not the former MA BELL.    With that growing that business is very frustrating and all the employees are unhappy.   Work life balance is very frustrating.
bad,Job satisfaction is directly related to your supervisor/manager.  Union has little to no influence.  Training is OJT by another technician.  Nothing official.
bad,"Tech Support experience, starts off at $11. If you are here in the Monroe Louisiana area work at any of the other departments outside of this one. The supervisors show favoritism. Your raises are pretty much non existent. This company is headed downhill fast, it is not taking care of its employees at all and the schedule choices have gotten worse and worse since I have been here. If you have kids or any other life outside of this, do not come here."
bad,"First IT job. No training. Sink or swim work environment. "
bad,"I worked for directly for Century Link  in a large Central Office. There was trash everywhere. Boxes,"
bad,"Was moved around to 7 different jobs during 4 different restructures in less than a 6 month period. Managers were good, but the upper levels of management didn't know what they wanted to do with the company or what direction to take the company."
bad,this job was outsourced to different companies. the job was very stressful dealing - management did not handle any calls and had very unrealistic expectations on call length
bad,"The company has this thing called the unifying principle that only applies to the employees but not management especially the ""Fairness - the golden rule"" and despite getting ready to lay me off they are forcing me to train my Indian replacement. The company treats their employees like cow dung and gives us some of the worst benefits I've ever seen. My copay for medical is $80. Absolutely absurd. I've even presented them with an alternative plan that makes more sense than what they're doing and they are not even considering it. Do not work for this company, do not use their products, don't even acknowledge their existence."
bad,Managers want you to have the same opinion as them even when you know they are wrong. managers are too politically correct even when customers are wrong and bow to there every whim even when it has nothing to do with the products offered. Customer make false complaints and still manager agree with the customer.
bad,"Their revenue is declining fast. They try things but don't give them time to work before shifting to something else."
bad,"Large company, large geographic territory, dying product type, poor management, decreasing revenue, average to below average benefits, 10% employee reduction October 2016."
bad,"Company is not loyal to their employees. In 13 years, I had 9 different managers. Each having their own agenda and trying to one up the previous manager. Career advancement is unheard of."
bad,"The worst place I've worked at in AZ.  Being unscrupulous was the only way to get ahead in this company. Even as a retention representative, I was pressured to SALE SALE SALE... and when I couldnt meet my weekly quotas of selling direct tv and verizon cellphones I was reprimanded."
bad,"Joined CTL(Formerly Qwest) 7 yrs back as a Consultant.Qwest got taken over by Centurylink in 2011.Became Full-time employee in 2012."
bad,"They set operation goals that aren't reachable, you get attendance write ups for their system issues.  Management will tell you that your doing something wrong but not what it is then write you up for it. You are held responsible for customer satisfaction if your the last representative they spoke with, even if in the survey the name the person that didn't do their job right you are still to blame."
bad,"the people, you work with are great but the management would pick favorites. the smallest thing would get you in trouble, thank goodness for the union"
bad,If you haven't been there over 30 years (most of them have) you area nobody. There is no room for advancement and if you do you don't get a raise for it.
bad,"I was told this was not a sales job it is just customer service. When i get to the floor I was expected to solved customer disputes, give credits, and sell them internet, direct tv, and verizon phones. Even if they had every product I was expected to sell them even more. I could not take no as an answer. My supervisor basically told me to lie to customers promising credits if they bought products and then not giving the credit. I was also told to ""slam and cram"" to meet my quota, which is just giving them things they didn't ask for or want (which is illegal) and if the customer found out just apologize and remove them. I was also making 11.00 an hour for doing 3 jobs while the man next to me who started 2 months before me was making almost double that. So I also believe there was some racism going on. I would not recommend anyone working here, at least not in the small business department."
bad,"Promoted from Logistics Coordinator and managed material demand planning systems personally responsible for managing $20M in annual spend with more than 13 inventory turns per year.  "
bad,"Took the job at Centurylink -"
bad,"They advertise this job as a customer service job.  However, its really a sales job.  Your job is to take customers that call in and have a problem with their service and you try to sell them new products instead of helping them.  The supervisors are never available and when you get a call in person screaming at you there is no support for this and you cannot hang up on them no matter what.  The hours are long and the customer calls are a nightmare."
bad,"we are not welcome, we are not heard, we have no valid partiipation.  If we proffer an opinion, we disappear."
bad,"typical day includes taking phone calls from customers with a variety of complaints and issues.  I learned to tolerate the public better.  Management is dependent upon the culture of the center you work in, some follow rules some do not.  Co-workers don't get used to have the same ones turn over is very high. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the frustrations of wanting to provide the bet service to the customer but not being able to give what the customer is entitled to due to parameters of the job,  The expectation is to have the customer off the phone in less than  600 seconds, this results in customers being passed between reps which infuriates the customer.  Dealing with difficult personalities of the customers is very difficult."
bad,Management is always looking over your shoulder to make you work harder even if you are producing at 110%. Productivity is never enough. This company expects it workers to work whenever they wish for however many hours they wish without any care for your personal commitments or personal life.They will work you to death then fire you and get a fresh body or send your work overseas.
bad,Treated employees like cattle.
bad,Centurylink is a high stressed position that is not for someone searching for advancement. Basically if you don't hit your goals in three months you can be fired. I would not recommend this job.
bad,Stupid
bad,Qwest Communications is the most anti- Field employee company I have ever had the displeasure of being involved with. Greed for the benefit of top level management rules the culture over all else. The CEO went to prison found guilty of fraudulent financial dealings for his sole benefit. These practices led to a 90% reduction in retirement benefits for current and retired employees of both Qwest and US west while driving the stock value from $40+ to $1+.
bad,"Terrible management unable to figure out a solid schedule. Constantly changing hours of employees not allowing proper adjustment. Just overall not a great place to work, unrealistic time frame to complete jobs including drive times. Given an hour and a half to complete job and including drive time which could be an hour in itself."
bad,"The training was awful, the computer equipment is outdated and there is always at least one system down every day. They expect you to meet certain metrics that are difficult to reach because the majority of callers are irate and want nothing to do with the company. The only reason they have century link is because they had no other option. I do not recommend working here."
bad,"This company has gone downhill from when I started back in 1998.  They are now more concerned with hiring the person who will do the job for the lowest amount of money over experienced people.  That has led to an even worse customer experience and in turn led to more turn over as they cannot keep top talent anymore.  Most of the non-sales jobs are contracted now, meaning the customers and employees get little to no support.  I am glad I left this company when I did, I see the writing on the wall."
bad,CenturyLink bought L3 but you would think it's the other way around and their management is horrible. They've let so many customer facing employees go and implemented barely functional systems that seem to intentionally drive customers away all the while blaming the few remaining.  Most 1st line supervisors are looking to leave since they are bearing most of the burden of this incompetence.
bad,"There is a lot of undue pressure at the job site, constantly in fear of your job, goals are not achievable, everyone is written up for something, morale here is extremely low, Management targets certain people and others are left alone.  I am still there hoping to see some changes with new contract coming."
bad,This position is the worst I’ve seen in all my years. Commissions are ALWAYS wrong and late. Managers don’t care about their employees. No real accountability...just scare tactics.
bad,"Management is condescending towards her employees. She didn’t know what to do which contradicts her own supervisors. Management belittles their employees to the brink of the quitting. Training for the job is 3 days which should be longer for the job you would be doing. This is a place if you don’t mind being spoken to like a child, you could work there, otherwise, I would strongly recommend not working for this company."
bad,If your desperate and need work maybe give CenturyLink a shot. The only different between CenturyLink and the fiery underworld is the florescent lighting... No one seems happy and it affects everyone else's morale.
bad,"Call center was horrible. No training. Learned more from people I sat near. Union sucks, doesn't do a thing for you. Merged with Level 3 a year ago, all tech/customer service jobs going overseas."
bad,"Level 3 Rules and does not care one bit about doing the right thing or improving the business,   Decisions made are taking the company backwards.   No vision for the future and only lip service paid to what needs to happen to address real problems.   Staff reductions come every quarter like clock work."
bad,"If you work remotely from a CenturyLink office you are on your own.  There is no training, but expectations are completely in line had one been in a CenturyLink office and had applicable training."
bad,"When I began working here the benefits were okay and the pay and incentives were good. I mean you're never going to get rich working here in the traditional sense but as long as you're willing to put in the time and effort you can live very comfortable. This is the phone company so you will be sitting in a little cubicle talking to customers who call in about an issue and then attempt to up-sale them a product. So I did learn how to think and talk fast to make a deal. Management at this company is very poor, they focus more on hiring anyone and everyone and if they don't pan out they get canned for someone else; I have always been of the belief you hire the right person for the job the first time. The culture here sucks, it is based on food and if you look at some of the people they have working here that is easy to understand. I did enjoy how easy this job was and in the summer time you work 8 hours and you are done, however during the Holidays there is mandatory overtime and expect to work 50 hours a week from Black Friday until about mid-February. Your peers will slam customer's accounts and leave you to deal with that angry customer. Ultimately CenturyLink is a mediocre company providing mediocre services and they regularly screw their customers over. Unless you really enjoy working in a call center (who does?) I'd steer clear. This was a great company to work for when I started and they slowly started reducing commissions, benefits, and negatively adjusting work schedules without any input from the employees. I got out at the right time, but I have heard they have changed"
bad,"Beginning day one, I had 25 technical meetings a week (starting anywhere from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m.) for a massive, multi-system upgrade.  The project was already well under way with a remote team, and I was expected to instantly catch up on months of unrecorded meetings to create tech requirements full of complex processes and internal acronyms for dozens of proprietary systems.  There was no documentation, no one in the building on the same project, no context, no introductions, no ramp-up time, and no test environment (it didn't exist).  "
bad,"This job went from enjoyable and fun to broken and ending. Management is completely pointless and unsupportive from top to bottom. For a communication company no one seems to know how to communicate, unless they have a way to pass the buck. Join this sinking ship at your own risk."
bad,Trying not to be too negative CenturyLink is a place I would never work again.  People were nice but systems and company insane.  You had to have a degree just to figure out your commission.  Trying to get an order processed or service installed was a joke.  I was shocked how they could perform so poorly for their clients yet still be in business.
bad,"After the L3 Merger, the company was thrown in complete shambles. No one knew what to do, who reported to whom, and what anyone's job duties, titles, or expectations were."
bad,"The benefits and pay are great- the stress, pressure, and management team are horrible.  It is a high pressure, very stressful place to work. There are unrealistic sales goals and a lot of pressure from management. The company really struggles with ethics- and that reflects in the service you provide people. The benefits are phenomenal however."
bad,"Everybody there likes to complain about everything and not do anything about it. Nobody is ambitious, and there is no room for quick growth. Management doesn’t take the time to show you how to do things if you don’t know, they just do it for you or tell you to figure it out. Training is excruciating, because you aren’t allowed to learn faster than everyone else."
bad,"They are very behind the times in their culture, very clique oriented so if the dont like you you are out. Management sleeps with the reps and if you mention it you are fires, they will find an excuse. Management hangs out with the reps on personal level for drinking etc. Overall very weird environment to say the least."
bad,"a typical day at work involves praying that your next call, which inevitably will be someone who feels that treating you as subhuman is their right as a paying customer, will be fairly quick and bring on a minimum of attention from management...this ridiculous company has no concept of positive reinforcement...Century Link believes in motivating through fear and intimidation...The corporate suits all come up with grand ideas that rank and file end up being burdened with, to the point where jobs are being lost...The pay and benefits are actually one of the few things I can't complain about...even when presenting proof of a problem, from varying sources and includes witness statements, charts, graphs, etc, management will often turn a blind eye...In fact, many times management gets defensive, argumentative and refuses to listen...In short, if someone needs a job to live, pay bills and the like, then yeah, you do what you have to do...but please, if you have a choice between Century Link and anywhere else, choose anywhere else..."
bad,Not a good place to work.  Poor career advancement and little to no appreciation/compensation for certifications/degrees obtained while employed.  Annual compensation increases of 0%-1% are typical.
bad,"CenturyLink is run by fear, rhetoric, and politics.  Many of the employees there are more than happy to slit your throat and throw you under the bus for their own career advancement."
bad,"Manger go across the street to the hotel and sleep with sales reps that how you get promoted here! Everyone either sleazy or an alcoholic, i loved the job but there is no job security and even when you are killing it in sales managers will toss you under the buss to save their own butts. no one lasts more than a month I saw so much turn around there in my yr of working there I advanced fast but only because I was cut throat with my sales and everyone was being fired. you only last if your prepared to be a sell out and never think for yourself. only sheep survive here."
bad,"It's sad when a company does not care as much about their employees, as the employees care about the customers. When it's all said and done, everyone is just a number in this titanic of a company. It's too bad that what the CEO has set up as values, gets lost in the chain of command. The people that cheat get promotions and the ones that bust their hump for the customer, get let go."
bad,Poor management. Everyone need to be on the same page!! Lack of communication. Too many changes. Stressful environment. Supervisors are NOT professional.
bad,"you are not managed by performance for improvement or raises, it about who you know or kiss up to.  the culture has changed from the old bell system to a culture of not satisfying the customer"
bad,"380 sec is not enough time to Trouble shoot High speed internet, Fiber phone or Prism cx which make the cx frustrated when employees start send out replacement modems for programming issue or line issues. That in results in customer calling back in the same issues"
bad,A few of the managers seemed to genuinely concerned for the employees but upper management had quite the opposite view.  One of the directives from upper management was that  each 1st level manager had to have a certain percentage of employees written up at any given time.
bad,"Quantity over Quality, you are a number not an employee, can easily be replaced. Change is consistent, get used to it. Very Stressful working environment."
bad,"Do not care about anything except sales, don't help with anything, training teaches you nothing about the job role you are going in to. Management will constantly harass you over everything. Previous manager would publicly call out team members and harass them in front of everyone and nothing was done about it."
bad,"I was a toll operator.  When you dialed 0 you got me.  They had multiple perks for doing well, until the union changed it.  That's when I got out.  My pay was going to decrease."
bad,"20th century telecom culture is toxic. Couldn't tolerate the ""it's not my job"" mentality. Hired to perform the role of an Enterprise level Account Manager and quickly evolved into a call center rep."
bad,"The management team does not care about employees in any way, shape or form. They will deliberately sabotage employees and then blacklist them from ever holding a position elsewhere in the organization."
bad,"Working for CenturyLink for so long was an experience that helped me gain valuable knowledge in the telecommunications industry. To be fair and honest, if you are dedicated to your job there you are able to move up. But there is not many positions to move up to. And the pay increase is very minimal. The pay is below average compared to other telecommunications companies. And the benefits are mediocre. But my overall experience with the managers was OK. If I was to run into a problem, I would bring it up to the main boss. And it was heard, but there was never a productive solved answer. The managers there seemed to be more worried about upselling to the customers than to be concerned with their businesses being out of service. Leading to angry customers who would rather leave to another carrier than to have happy satisfied customers."
bad,They boost your confidence only to left you down. They keep telling me Im so good and they've never seen anyone catch on as fast as I do but I am still temp. I have been here over a year and still making $10.00 ph
bad,Run..Run as fast as you can away from this company! They allow customers to be abusive to their employees and tell you to take it & get a thicker skin
bad,"Not a good place to work, there is very little job stability.  CenturyLink is struggling financially and continues to outsource in an effort to save hard dollars, despite the fact the quality of service degrades with every single application they outsource support.  There is very little concern for quality anymore, if it's fast and cheap to produce, then do it, and don't worry about any downstream effects. They do internal re-orgs every couple of months, so you may be under a different management chain several times a year, and most of the time you never even meet anyone except your manager.  You are simply property and they herd you around like cattle."
bad,"A very political environment with little chance to grow. The environment does not foster meritocracy either seniority. Most of the times, the managers hire external candidates that do not possess the type of skills and personality that the company pleads. High performers know that they will need to leave the company to obtain better compensation and respect somewhere else. It will really depend on the department/manager that you report. While some of them will help you learn, others will leave you at the corner of the office until you get laid off, especially if you do not act as a ""yes-man"" employee."
bad,"Work schedule is mon thru friday 7 am to 4 pm"
bad,"Typically worked full day shift and then told to come in at midnight for maintenance work. This could be between two and seven additional hours. Come back to work with maybe four hours sleep to find eight more hours day work and another night shift assigned. Occasional thirty plus hours of wake time for special projects disregarding any labor laws. If you finally reach burn out management says hold on it will get better. Don't expect much good for your health or marriage."
bad,"The expectation is simple: take forty calls per day, help customer with problem, while doing so review account and suggest new sales.  Seems like a piece of cake. But 20 of your calls are for a branch of Centurylong called Qwest, you cannot sell to them you must transfer them and stay with them until a Qwest Rep picks up (usually about 20 minutes per transfer.) 10 calls will usually be for large business branch, you cannot sell to them, same story with the transfer.  5 of your calls are people calling to cancel their accounts, you can try to sell but eventually you will transfer them to Save/Retention, (after 20 minutes waiting) and they usually do NOT want to take the call and will fight you to keep the call. That leaves about 5 calls per day that are potentially viable.  You can do your best with those, but in most cases you will soon be cut for ""Sales Performance"".  Of the 30 people in my rotation, 6 or so remained at my termination, i have no doubt they are gone by now.  It is a revolving door company and it is very stressful while you are there."
bad,"A good place to get started on your telecommunications career. A typical day includes working with both outside technicians as well and customers. As in any work place you will find a mix of very helpful and friendly co-workers, some become like a second family."
bad,points for things that can't be helped car accidents death etc
bad,"Employees are actively encouraged to lie about services available and pricing. Customer service is not a focus. Reps have multiple metrics which are reviewed weekly. One of which is transfer rate. Reps are expected to transfer 1 in every 4 calls rather than resolving the customer issue. NOHD reps refuse to take calls to assist customer. 12 hour work days are the norm not the exception. Commissions were drastically reduced with no prior notification. Policy changes frequently. Phone reps are often the last to be notified. Supervisors do their best to assist you, but have no knowledge of operating system. This is a poorly run company to say the least."
bad,Always had an adversial feel to the job as Union and management could never agree. It had arrived at the point where you could tell the main goal of management was to get rid of you so a severance package seemed the best way out.  Customer Service means absolutely nothing to this company.
bad,"Hired me for my ability to sell, then provided zero relevant training on complex products and services until 4 months into the job. When training was provided, it was how to navigate antiquated computer systems. They still run on a DOS based billing system."
bad,Typical day at work consisted of conflict resolution both with customers and employees and ensuring that customer servicers were maintain.Regarding management I leaded how to manage large groups in a coherent manner while still maintain some level of individuality among people under me in achieving the organizational objective. In the area of co-workers I maintain open communication and the sharing of information that allowed for productive execution and implementation of day to day operations and any changes that may be deemed essential. The hardest part of the job was the change of individual agents work schedules (daily) in attempt to meet the need of the organization. The most enjoyable part of the job was working directly with employees on a daily bases and the exchange of knowledge and skills made the job have a real bases rather than just going through the motions.
bad,"When i went in for the interview initially I was told that the job consisted of basically retaining customers from disconnecting. You are giving certain discounts and promotions to place customers on to retain them. Well after you finish the training part, which is basically useless unless you want to learn about the company itself and how to make accounts(Which i never did). I found out when i actually got on the phones that its all about selling useless things to people who are calling to disconnect services. Management refuses to aknowledge the probablity of potential sales. In order to keep your job, you have to meet a retention goal & SALES GOAL every month. Job security there is horrible, the environment is depressing, and worse of all you have to deceive people into getting products in order to make sales. Personally I felt horrible every day i was there so i eventually up and left. Its a job and a good one if you like gambling your job every month and love to deceive people. When i was there i basically saw people getting fired EVERY WEEK!... and new classes start up every two weeks so think twice before you apply! Oh and the $11 dollars an hour they pay is NOT enough for what you deal with there on a daily basis. Out of my class of 20 5 started smoking, and 7 started drinking because of the stress, and anxiety."
bad,Management is incompetent and/or indifferent about providing avenues to succeed. It appears to be slowly burning from the inside out. There is no training other than government madated. There is no workforce to complete the amount of assigned work.
bad,"All they care about is competing on who can get the most sales by the end of the day, but to come across a customer that was sold direct TV and prism tv just so that sales rep can get their sales and compensation for it is disgusting. The poor old lady had been paying for both tv services for 2 months and had no clue why the bill went up so much, the sales rep didn't tell her they sold her both tv services and she only received direct TV, then when I tried to help out and correct this I got yelled at."
bad,Management is awful.  Training is bad if any.  Too many brown noser's.  Half of the employees do not do there job correctly and the company suffers and they don't even know it.  Too much work for the time allotted.
bad,Supervisors belittle you make your workday unpleasant all they are concerned with is numbers. The benefits are great I will give them that but no way are they about there employees  all that's important is there stats.
bad,"Very high turnover rate in the sales/customer service area. When I left after 8 months, there were only 2 others who were still there who were in my new hires training class of 67 people."
bad,"I spent 5 years at CenturyLink. I received some initial training, after that, I was left to fend for myself. The company and the union have constant disagreements. I had several grievances going at the same time, all the time. There are very little effective training programs. You’d be better off with a different company."
bad,"Great pay and benefits,hostile work environment, Terrible management, micromanagement. Hire their friends Worked here 8 years and left awful place...."
bad,Use to be a great company. Then they laid off every one and left the prejudice red necks now go figure that one out. ( Favoritism for a special skin color)
bad,Dont do it!!! Its a bad job!! Not good. It was so stressful and not worth it. Not worth it! Dont! Doooooo not do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"DAILY emails explaining what new thing we now need to do,  NO EXCEPTIONS!!!"
bad,"The technology is ancient. For such a large company, you would think Centurylink would be cutting edge. This company is floating in the ocean on a rubber raft with a hole in it."
bad,"Terrible place to work "
bad,The management at CenturyLink regularly ask you to lie and cheat to get sales and they reward those that do so. There were employees that lied on every single call and those were supposed to be our example employees.
bad,"I transitioned to Centurylink initially due to the pay increase I had received from my previous company.  There is some work like balance and decent pay within the position I was in but that is pretty much where the pros end.  Turnover within the company is at an astronomical rate. Never been with a company that replaces salespeople like tic tacs.  Minimal on the job training and management is just looking for you to hit a sales target. Could care less if you need help resolving issues with existing or onboarding new customers.  Company culture is awful since they cannot keep sales managers or salespeople for more than a year.  I worked here for less than 1 year and I had 3 different sales managers due to previous ones getting fired. The sales goals are unrealistic and if you do not acheive them there is no coaching, just being fired. Never seen an organization like this so poorly ran."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy. The union is a part of the problem, too. All told most people not in management positions hate the company."
bad,"Upper and executive management at CenturyLink no longer values the customer or the front line employees.  The call metrics are at the forefront of every decision made, and the focus of ""customer service"" gets completely lost in the analytics of the positions, including supervisory positions."
bad,They only give new sales opportunity calls to new hires then they eventually put you in nothing but escalated call queues dealing with states who are suing the company. It does not pay to stay at the company for very long. Management sets unrealistic sales goals and train you to badger the customer into signing up for service. It is the most horrible job I have ever had with hopeless dead ends to employment there. It's a greedy company who punishes it's employees for it's own poor management and mistakes in dealing with customers in shady ways. This company is all about greed.
bad,Poor management lack of communication to employees. No real opportunities for professional growth. Management only cared about themselves.Some advice to leadership coach management on being better communicators with the employees and send them to training on how to coach and develop their teams. I worked in Talent Acquisition Dept.
bad,"For all employees caught up in an unfortunate acquisition, most will be on a 2-4 yr phase out by first being outsourced with the improbable promise that you might be able to find another job. IBM will burn most people in this situation but I will say that CTL did a hard negotiation with them to ensure that former employees were not just treated like a mere obstacle. Aside from that, you may be on the account but you will learn quickly that you are definitely no longer a part of the actual company. Two acquisitions occurred during my tenure, and during both, it was observed that the inevitability is that you will lose your job. Many wait it out thinking a compensation will be worth it, but honestly that is a personal choice, however, it goes without saying it is easier to find a job when you have one and not having to compete with so many others during the mass layoff phases."
bad,"Unstable work environment, toxic manager, not an atmosphere for productivity. Every time we learned a new program or software, not soon after it changed."
bad,"Dying company that does not invest in employees, only looking to fatten pockets of top execs. tax breaks were given but still axed our bonus and company only invest in short term to make stock look good. Class action lawsuits are pending and they use the CAF2 funds to fudge numbers. they are not upgrading. Stay away"
bad,Terrible place to work. Sales ethics and practices are not consistent and often dishonest. The company doesn't really care about it's employees. They will take anyone off of the street who is willing to lie about products.
bad,"Unstable work environment, with unclear objectives. Realignments throughout company are causing even more obstacles for good customer service.  Lack of transparency causes more speculation than clearly stating future expectations.  The majority of employees at local office are exceptional people.  An invaluable asset not truly appreciated by CenturyLink."
bad,"No respect from upper management, when reaching out to upper management/ HR for some unethical things being done by management and call centers I was ignored."
bad,a typical day at work. Worked in a call center. Offered on every call to sale company products. job was dealing with irate customers. The hardest part of job is save the customers from disconnecting svc. The most enjoyable part of job is commission and incentives.
bad,"Management doesn't know whats going on, you are left in the hands of tsc who are on power trips so if they dont like you you do not go too far in the company."
bad,I do not currently tell people where I work because I don't want to hear others complaints when I have complaints of my own. When I started with them it was a good place to work. but since then things have changed to where we are no longer given any incentives to do a good job. Customers are very dissatisfied with the company also.
bad,Typical work day is 8-5pm. Review contract and calculate ETF charges on customers that are terminated the service. Management is not supportive. I have learned a lot in my 16 years at CenturyLink. The hardest part about the job is when a merger goes thru your not sure about your job.
bad,Management do not care about customer satisfaction as long as the reps are meeting quota  they can be rude to the customer and it will be overlooked no matter how much the customer complain.
bad,"Management could care less for the customer as soon as the order is in the system and month has closed.  If you sold the client service,  Sales was asked to avoid the client to help if a problem occurred (very often) ...  was told to ""Move on and don't take their calls again"".  I was shocked to hear that from Management.  I knew professionally I had to move company that wants to help their clients be successful."
bad,"Managment led with fear mentality, job was repetitive and horrible. Retention is dumping ground for all customer services reps so they can field sales calls vs billing calls"
bad,"This job caused my blood pressure to increase to dangerous levels which affected my vision. The management displayed blatant favoritism, the systems are constantly down,  the training does not put you in a position to work independently. I worked under a supervisor who did not know the systems and would consistently give misinformation. The point system with double points on certain days is unethical, the shifty advertising to get customers is unethical and puts reps in positions to deal with customers who are angry . The methods of selling and tracking it constantly is very overwhelming. This job as a sales Rep in Jefferson City was one of my worse jobs experiences ever"
bad,"The day starts early on the phones with customers calling in about billing questions or issues. Customer most of the time were upset about their bills and services received. I learned how to solve customer billing issues quickly and efficiently and provide the best customer service to each customer. My managers were available when needed.The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to resolve customer issues, and being allowed to be creative."
bad,"don't like lying to customers.think its just wrong."
bad,"Horrible job, the only thing that was good was the pay. The hours were terrible, training was terrible because you are not totally prepared.I feel like the sups diidnt take their job seriously, it was more sociable"
bad,There is zero work/life balance. They have you work 10-11 hours a day and every saturday. There is no room for growth and high lay offs. Management is ok depending on what team you are on.
bad,"I was hired as a customer service representative and during training I was slightly short of the official sales goal, and because it was a union environment there was zero tolerance."
bad,Interesting place to work. I don't really know what to say beside you won't really know until your in the door. Just give it chance and see how you like it.
bad,"No room for advancement, you have as good of chance as Joe Schmo of the street.  Management are a bunch of puppets for upper management to play with.  Your work means nothing nor is ever considered.  Thank god for the union otherwise nobody would be able to keep their job."
bad,A typical day here was not being guaranteed eight hours of work.  I learned this is a poorly managed company because there are way too many layers of management.  Management here are Micro-managers.  Co-workers were okay.   The hardest part of the job was working for a highly mismanaged company. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things on the job.
bad,"DOS, need I say more?"
bad,"Horrible company to work for, low wages, terrible managers, after 4 years couldn't take it anymore. HR cares nothing about the employees. Training allowed for only favored employees. People I worked with were great."
bad,The money is more important to this company than the customer.  We were told to d owhat is right for customer and right for company-not correct at all.
bad,"A typical day at work..."
bad,"Be wary of anything anybody tells you when applying for this job..."
bad,ok job * did not learn alot •the hardest part of the job was co workers
bad,I do not want to review this job management was awful had t check your payout closley
bad,The company change when Centurylink took over and nothing felt safe about working there.
bad,Was on the phone and had to sell to people no matter what. had to make people buy things that I knew that they didn't need just to meet my quota in order to keep my job.
bad,"Upper management makes poor staffing decisions that negatively impact middle management, labor, and in the end the customer pays the price for bad service."
bad,"I worked for Qwest (currently Century Link) for four months in 2010 as a Sr. Admin. Asst. At that time, the company was downsizing administrative staff, which resulted in additional responsibilities for remaining staff. I was working 10 to12 hour days, every day, to get my work done. I witnessed several people break down in my department due to the tremendous pressure to sell. Some sales people had been with the company for several years and could not afford to leave due to the lack of employment opportunities elsewhere. This was not a good culture for anyone. I hope Century Link makes improvements for the sake of their employees."
bad,Whatwas once a great company under Sprint and Embarq became absolutely horrid after its merger with  Centurytel. I was a top performer but was set upto fail by the current management after 10 years service. Don't work there.
bad,"Not Recommended "
bad,Will be all contractors before long. Level 3 will do away with union jobs and make it like the cable tv industry. All piece work with charge backs. Stay away if you are looking for a forever job.
bad,"Work here if you like being constantly pressured to answer back-to-back calls while others roam aimlessly through the call center, talking to their friends. Also, if you can smooth over customer anger once they’ve been lied to by the sales team, that’s a plus."
bad,"Terrible place to be at with a corporate screw you, I've got mine attitude. Toadyism was rampant and people only worked there because there was no where else to go. The dear leader and sucking up by the higher ups was revolting."
bad,"They pay a livable wage for an entry-level job which is rare, atleast in my area. I like the base pay+commission rather than either or. This job did teach me resilience but it did cause me to die a little inside. Management is constantly stressed out they are not going to make numbers and be fired so they take that out on their employees. Adding insult to injury, not only is manager constantly IMing you telling you how terrible you are, you have a customer screaming death threats at you because their bill increased by $2. The sales expectations constantly raise because the retention departments gives out unneccesary discounts and credits to anyone who says they might cancel (Yeah, right. They heard from a friend this is how you get a loyalty discount.) I appreciated having the weekends, holidays, and night off. They give out plenty of PTO and have decent benefits. I quit months ago but I still have recurring dreams of being in queue, screamed at on the phone, and my manager telling me to ""Sell, sell, sell!""  If you do not mind torturing yourself every day then this is the job for you."
bad,"I am happy that I left this place. When I first started it was an amazingly fun place to work, when I left it was all stress. No fun! Then to top it off the management got worse as time when on and they didn't value the employees that worked very hard for the company. They didn't seem to care if you stayed or if you left. So, I left."
bad,"The new level 3 management is killing a good company, they could care less about the customer and employees, they say they care so much about the customer, they don't honor repair contracts, they let all the good techs go, and replaced them with contractors. The management is going to give centurylink a bad reputation for customer support, I know every call I get after hour hold time is a angry customer wanting to know where there tech is to repair there service after 2 to 3 days."
bad,Centurylink was a stressful position. Training was about a week but we were doing technical support. There was lack of communication between departments which made it hard to do your job. On top of that my supervisor was very mean and not emphatic to the fact my son had ADHD. That was the deal breaker. What kind of employer makes you choose between your job or your kids health and safety.
bad,"CenturyLink is Horrible, they need to stop the good ol boy club and hire knowledgeable people, but most important they need to quit giving misleading information to their customers. HR does not care, if you complain to management about management or anyone else for that matter your as good as out of a job. "
bad,A typical day in my role is to prospect for potential new clients.  However the support that you receive from support staff and management is limited making it very difficult to achieve the set sales quotas required by the company.
bad,"CenturyLink was, until recently, mostly composed of local phone companies (LECs).  The new CEO and top management team has never run that type of company and is trying to reshape the company into what he is familiar with.  At present, the strategy seems to be to gut legacy operations and send as much work as possible to offshore vendors."
bad,"I hated working here. They put you in billing, and if you don't meet a certain sales quota, you get written up. And the managers recommend misleading techniques for signing people up for things they don't want. Very unethical and far too stressful for the compensation. There was also no way to take time off for being sick or for family emergencies."
bad,"People refuse to work together to get the job done.  All about holding your job close to the vest, not doing your job, and everyone complaining about how others do their job."
bad,NO fun to work at!!! no cooperation or communication between depts for a communications company!!!! No one wants to work together they only want to get by with what keeps them employed there!!!
bad,"I cannot stand behind shady business practices by employees, as well as a non functioning product that you are encouraged to sell.I urge all to find empolyment else where."
bad,"Layoffs every 3 weeks.  Everyone always looking over their shoulder. Employees throwing each other under the bus to look better to management and positioning.   Constant change, and no clear direction.  House of cards network that is just waiting for a crash because it hasn't been updated.  Switches that hadn't been updated or rebooted in 15 years."
bad,Very negative company culture. Constant negative daily reviews from management. It was like management was required to give you negative reviews on your calls no matter how well you followed company procedures. Managers were always making up different rules for each call in order to give you negative marks.
bad,This company has awful company policies and very little help for the customer.  No room for advancement.  Misleading expectations from supervisors. Centurylink does not follow through with policies laid out for agents.
bad,"It's all about numbers, you have to be perfect. Management only cares about themselves and they don't take the time to encourage you and reward there people with a simple thank you. It is really laid back. Hardest part of the job is covering up for others when they don't give you the correct information and you are expected to figure out what you need. Stressful because we have to wear a lot of different hats and it is hard when your manager don't fight for you. It is enjoyable when we do office activities."
bad,It is not worth the stress no matter how hard you try you are set up to fail they don't allow for human error and feel your work is more important than your life literally they made us stay on the phone through a tornado.
bad,"I hate it , does not pay well, took away bonuses and raises, raised insurance, a single mom can not work here and beable to afford to take care of her kids on the salary offered."
bad,"I became part of CTL recently, but the longer I stay, the worse it feels. We have zero recognition for what we do, and we haven't been steadily busy for nearly a year. The benefits are not as good as the previous company, we never see or hear from management, and the company is quick to point a finger of blame at any group they feel has dropped the ball. Salaries are stagnant, people are overworked and stressed, and H.R. can't get their act together. There are regular reorganizations; lack of clear, consistent communication; and six months later, there isn't even a clearly-defined salary range for the jobs we do."
bad,They tell you sales isn't imperative to your job and then they change it after a few months and you always feel as if you're going to lose your job. They allowed people to do illegal things so they could report they were making better sales than they were. Their service is terrible and they don't do much about it. Working at centurylink. They constantly lower commission and raise goals making it impossible to advance or be paid out fairly.
bad,Centutylink employees are haunting an already dead company. its lack of proper marketing and deployment of new products will ultimately destroy whatt is left of the company.
bad,10-12 hrs of work mon-fri with occasional mandatory saturday shifts. I never felt like the money I was making was the kind of money I should receive for the amount of hours I put in. I just didnt fit in with the mentality there. Mine is not a review you should take to heart.
bad,"Don't ever trust anyone, especially if you're a nice person.  No chance to improve or even know why you're being fired, they just come in one day and fire you.  Good luck working there!"
bad,"You have mandatory overtime every Monday, 1st and 2nd of month."
bad,"over all your always busy however; the moral is poor. There is not much flexibility when it comes to home life if something is happening at home, they do not care"
bad,They ended up requiring sales over customer support to the point of the absurd. Requiring people to sell even to people that have just lost a loved one.
bad,"Great benefits but this company wants your life to revolve around them. Hard to schedule days off and if no time is available and you really need it tough luck unless you are willing to take an occurrence, which affect your job performance and chances of advancement. The question you are always asked is how you absents effects the business as a whole. I understand but in today's modern society lots of people have families and majority of their employees are single mothers that have life happens events as a Centurylink employee would say."
bad,Qwest was good at first but the CEO was arrested for inside trading . many people lost a lot of money. Qwest never recovered. Work place was good because of the people.
bad,Good pay and benefits little opportunity for advancement. No longer employed. Function I did was relocated to another state.
bad,A typical day is nonstop calls of customers calling about services that don't work properly or misquotes.  Overtime maybe given with little notice.  The company cares more about quotas than taking care of current customers.  There is little room for advancement because they would rather hire off the streets than promote from within but will take reps offline to help train new managers.  Management only looks out for themselves and will tell you team meetings that if it comes down to your job and theirs..then it's bye bye to you.
bad,"I actually have nothing positive to say about Qwest Communications that has now become Century Link. The worse part is that lower levels of management are allowed to persist in their inadequacies in terms of their communication, professionalism, and production. Particular managers have driven out numerous great employees and reliable sources have been confirmed that in at least a single instance were perjurious."
bad,"when trying to do good customer service you're constantly pushed to try to sell you the people that didn't mean things. stop had no job security more let go for lack of sales. a stack of customer compliment cards with the best thing taken away from the job I enjoyed providing good customer service regardless of what management thought about sales. I would've enjoyed a long career there, but wasn't able to."
bad,"This company is sales driven if you are not making your sales and you are placed under a supervisor that only cares about sales you will be fired. Benefits and paid time off are very good , schedules are good and there is a lot of room to make extra money in comission if you get the right type of calls. There is no job stability at this company more like a temporary job."
bad,"Lowest paid in the industry for what we do. "
bad,"They care more about their shareholders than they do about their customers and employees. Yesterday, they fired a guy that's been there 5 years for not using one of their useless apps on a call where he quickly solve the problem."
bad,"The job was enjoyable and could be fast paced, however the manger did not manage, if you were in the click things were good if not , watch out they will get you. "
bad,They are in the process of breaking unions and reducing pay and benefits. Offered several buyouts. Began layoffs. The telecom industry is failing due to cell phones and is gearing toward business only.
bad,CenturyLink is a swirling cesspool of know nothing management who have no technical knowledge and favor new young dumb employees who don't know that what they are being told to do is unsafe or illegal.
bad,Was nice pay but was never told about mandatory overtime and if you missed you were wrote up. It was a fast paced place to work. Hardly any down time people were friendly
bad,"Training was not very good from day one."
bad,Once out into the field it is much better but the training program they have you go through is disorganized and ran by those who have never actually sold for CenturyLink.
bad,"New to CenturyLink? ...New to Telecom?...You're on your own and good luck. Highly flawed systems, departments don't sync client info, people pass-the-buck and the client when client needs support, very angry and trapped client base to work with. One daily has to navigate through an impossible gauntlet of systems and support teams who have low job functionality and skills for their positions. No one ever seems to know what is happening with client accounts and billing is a nightmare. Had a client whose bill was suppressed for months; he ended up with a $10,000 invoice on a small account. Need tech support on the job? Forget it. A sure recipe for employee failure and guaranteed stress. The machine is too big and EVERYONE gets lost in the shuffle. The most enjoyable part of the job was recognition. We all respected those who could actually get a viable account through the ordering process."
bad,"Job is sales based, if you dont meet numbers you will be let go. When asked for an opinion, if yours doesn't fit theirs you won't do well. Several cases when I was told by a supervisor to let an issue go rather than solve the actual problem. Worked there for almost 2 years and couldn't be happier to leave."
bad,"Qwest was on the right track, but greedy corporate management sunk the retail arm of the company.  At the end of the day, an ISP that couldn't stay competitive chose to keep their employees in the dark and force them out unceremoniously."
bad,"CenturyLink treat their customers horrible and worse service.  Repair tickets are scheduled for 1,2,3+ weeks & then no call no show.  systems are slow & will automatically cancel tickets without notifying customers.  Even though they are set up to receive text mess or email alerts.  We can't tell when order did not go thru to dispatch.  So when customers calls back, they think we are liars.  I consistently have to apologize several times a day on each call if I take 80 calls for the day. 75 of them are very irate.  They are not trying to fix the problem with the bad service always going out when it rains etc and repairing in a timely manner.  They are consumed with making sales."
bad,"CenturyLink does have some IT professionally working for  it. New upper level engagement within CenturyLink however, has made many, many bad decisions in its effort to make more profits."
bad,"I have worked for the company for a good number of years. They used to take the approach that they will work you hard but you are rewarded for that. Decent rate of pay, great benefits and avenues of promotion. Then it all stopped instead of focusing on employees as assets they are now just numbers handling contacts. The rate of pay for new hires make it only slightly better than getting a job at a fast food joint. The benefits package now is horrible. Pay increases (if you actually get one) never come close to matching inflation. The only thing still positive are the direct supervisors. It feels like the company is dieing. Promotion is never given to someone that has the back ground to handle the position. You are more likely to be asked to fill in or work on a special project in a position you would like to move to. That position well never be hired for it is just given off to someone else as a special project. The way that the company handles things is ethically bankrupt. There is no joy, there is no drive, there is no sunlight. It is the bleakest of journeys. Taking a job here, at this time, is like walk in the shadow of the devil."
bad,The work place was just par if not less at times. Also being laid off was just uncalled for. The job required a certain unspoken quota and an even worse treatment of customers. Basically pushing the lie without having to say it was type of work performance.
bad,I really didn't have a great experience here.Some days were slow. Again I am a quick learner if taught everything. I was not taught everything. Really laid back atmosphere. I enjoyed learning new software and helping clients in any way possible.
bad,No training. Management is only worried about bottom line and not customer service or employee satisfaction. No family and work balance. No sick time.
bad,"Their culture is very cut-throat. If you're a contractor, never believe them what they say about the length of the contract. Chances are you'll be laid off in Sep or Oct because they ran out of funding for your project."
bad,No one is leading the team.  New product and GTM strategy each month or quarter.  Lack of focus and direction.  Trying to be all things to everyone and not doing it well anywhere.  Confusion at top levels as to who is the boss.
bad,"Centurylink management is the good old boy system."
bad,"After working for this company for over 8 years I have decided to move on from a company that doesn't recognize their strongest sales reps and best customer experience. I have applied multiple times to move anywhere in the company and there is just no where to go."
bad,It's hard to thrive in a company with sinking revenues and yearly layoffs.  Culture of cronyism is well established.  My manager was totally incompetent.
bad,I work very limited hours and I have so much time on its a very boring job. Sometimes there is no work. My supervisor is very unorganized and not very motivated.
bad,I Can't wait to get out. The culture is horrible. There were so many red flags during the interview that I ignored. With an imminent merger coming up it can only get worse.
bad,"cutthroat environment with unrealistic goals  The supervisors ""don't have to know how to do your job, just encourage you""  They have union reps but you are not given any kind of representation"
bad,"Not really sure why this is needed, but if need be, I can talk about this position that I held at this company in person if the need arises."
bad,"To be honest, I took the job under false information. Centurylink made me believe my job would be one thing and it became a very skewed version of that."
bad,"Working there you want have time for other thing such as school, kids or medical need."
bad,"I worked as an at hoen agent. I realize that this was still a job, but they had no understanding of life happens situations. My daughter had to see a specialist and even though applying for the time off a month in advance I was denied and had to call out. Because of frequent visits, I missed a lot of time and got corrective action, even though it is something I needed to do for my daughters health. Hours were long and training was not adequate enough for the position. Training was long, but they didn't spend enough time reviewing billing or even accounts set up actually working with the systems and MANY representatives made mistakes with it. Management was not very understanding about situations. I was told when I was hired but the training company that there would be no sales requirements, and I found out quickly that there was and that was what I wanted to avoid. The only upside that I had to the job in personal experience was the sommissions if you were lucky enough to earn any and the friendly co-workers. Other than that I have just as much trouble with them as I do as a customer. - a lot"
bad,It's a good job to start off for students or temporary job. However not recommended for long-term as there is limited growth for advancement or salary increase. Lack of appreciation from management no matter how hard an individual works.
bad,It's great money if you can hack it on the phones talking to people to make sells. But be ready for dropped calls and people to steal sales. The one month you don't make that sales quota fear the very real possibility of losing your job; hence why everyone steals sales. It's done for job security. Single most stressful place I've EVER worked.
bad,"Started out Great, but will not & would not ever work there again."
bad,Navajo kansas begaye union violation of my rep and declining al said with marsha and then no supportive of health issues like a siezure on ur ground and forcing back on the phone by the coach blu and others.
bad,"A company that is bound to fail. They lie to their employees and customers, CONSTANTLY! Their internet speeds are a joke and you're excpected to tell customers that 1.5MBPS will meet their needs. The PTO policy is not what it seems. You can't take time off whenever you want. The cafeteria on site is so expensive and pretty nasty as well. It is a sales job of course but this is 2018.. CenturyLink needs to upgrade their speeds and and learn to quit shoving Directv down customer's throats. I would not recommend working for these people."
bad,I was laid off of a project that I really enjoyed. Trillion dollar client didnt care about a working guy.................................................
bad,i loved it here but the business went under. They are a very cut throat meet your goals or be fired company and I don't recommend anyone with less than  thick skin even apply here.
bad,"If you aren't the type of person who can survive in a sales position, I wouldn't recommend it. If you want to try learning sales, go somewhere else, as they seem to think it's not their job to train for sales (their words, not mine). Beyond that, the culture of the department is insane."
bad,"I love working with businesses and helping them be more productive and grow. I greatly enjoy building and maintaining business relationships. Everything at CenturyLink works great until a contract for new Network/services is signed. Billing issues, install mess-ups, repair issues and lack of communication from support/back office makes the customer experience horrible for both the customer and Relationship Manager. 90% of my time is spent on fixing issues rather than on selling which is what I was hired for. If I don't take the time to fix issues, nobody will. I take CenturyLink's relationship with business customers very personally and if I don't take the time to help, no one will. If CenturyLink could fix all their back office/support issues, this would be a great company to work for, but until then, I would not recommend working for this company."
bad,The management is only interested in making sales & will imply unethical sale practices to ensure sales goals are achieved. Honesty for the customer is not a value & customer service is limited to anything that does not cost the company revenue.
bad,It paid well but management didn't truly care about the workers. The benefits were great if you got to use them. The work environment was slow and not upbeat
bad,I'm a hard working self motivated person.  Team member.  Helpful and willing to assist others.  I manage my time and complete my tasks.
bad,Focus is not on employees. Main goals involve sales and nothing else. Too many quotas and not enough focus on customer service.
bad,over a good job if your REALLY good at sales. But even if you are there comes a point where you will have to do something unethically to make a sale when you have to make a high quota and push customers to by something with out giving them all the correct info about what they are paying and what for. I cant do that.
bad,"started day in rush they did not give time to review systems and see about any company changes, management was rarely available and changed who you reported to frequently. sales on everycall EVEN if a customer had declined product before"
bad,"This is one of the best jobs of my career. I worked here for 23 years and enjoyed it tremendously. I became ill and suffered a disability and that’s when I ran into adversity. All in all, I would not change working there for one minute because the job itself was exciting and dynamic and made a difference and it was exciting I’m working at Century Link, anyone would enjoy it and it has great benefits and the pay was good.pay was very"
bad,"Face it, Level 3 runs the company, not CenturyLink.   Sales is cut throat, good boys (Level 3) club.  Benefits are good and if you are a sales account director, base salary is good.  Systems & process are horrible, too many of them and no training on them.  No one is willing to help probably because they don't know.  Orders don't install.  Many customer service and disconnect issues.   As a sales person, if a customer disconnects a services, it comes off your revenue number even if you never sold or got paid on the deal.  Hard to quote anything.  People in all departments are over worked.  All the good people (legacy CenturyLink) left the company or got ""pushed out""."
bad,"It was a horrible place to work. Upper management cares nothing about their employees, their families or their health. They over charge their customers an then leave the call centers to lie to them."
bad,"management was not good, felt thrown to the wolves, used and discarded at the mngt. whelms. was not a professional atmosphere.."
bad,"no bonuses, no job security, they have a micro management culture after the Level 3 takeover and have to record time for every tiny work you do on day to day, even email checking should be tracked."
bad,They dont care if a sale is stolen and wont help you fix it when people take your sales. They push you to be immoral and lie to customers. Everyday you have to check sales cause techs never install orders
bad,"Focused primarily on sales more than anything.  A team leader was quoted as saying that the job description for a CSSA (Customer sales and service associate) was 80% sales, and 20% customer service.  Crooked things seemed to happen often enough to be noticed, and though there was no proof, leadership seemed to overlook a lot of it."
bad,It is impossible to work some where not knowing if your guaranteed a job or not they will deny your unemployment and you will not know what you can receive it for I worked in Tarboro NC there was no communication TSC don’t wanna take escalated calls or even assist you they take 3 hour lunch breaks sups out there sleeping with each other smh terrible place to work great money but worst place I ever worked
bad,"Company merger was the worst thing to happen to the company.  The cost savings measures and the employee layoff's have made the company very uncomfortable and the transition of the new merged team is very unbalanced.  "
bad,"Terrible policies make working there a nightmare. Due to changes in how metrics worked there, most of the staff was put under warning and constantly had to worry about there jobs. The union feels weak and the supervisors do not regulate the staff unless they are under fire from upper management. Unless you want to have a job were you have to worry about being fired right out of the gate for metrics that are not under your control, I would not recommend CenturyLink."
bad,If you are sales driven and willing to lie to the customer to make your sales goals then this job is for you. I hated it. I was miserable from day 1 but since the insurance kicked in at 30 days I stayed.
bad,"Once embarq was bought by centurytel to create CenturyLink, this company changed for the worse. Incentives changed.  The customer service aspect changed and was no longer customer focused."
bad,It's easy to lose your job if you have a family emergency. They don't care the situation they just want you at work. It does have a fun and friendly work place.
bad,"I learn how to use ""OVERCOMING SKILLS "" from this company. Removed my self from this job because i dont lie to customer or clamm account."
bad,"No longer care about employees.. Buyouts and layoffs make this company very unstable..Was there14 years under Sprint , Embarq then Centurylink..The company is going under ander very unstable..Stay clear"
bad,"Logged into a call center environment and received inbound calls from CenturyLink customers and CenturyLink field service technicians. "
bad,"The local manager is good but the district manager is a total jerk. He treats employees like school children, not adults. You are expected to be perfect or else. There is always a threat of being laid off."
bad,"Incredible pay. 21.50 an hour plus mileage. Not sure if you have a job the next week, every week really sucked. Management had absolutely no idea what was going on."
bad,It was a nice company to work with they just don't work  with you when you are on medical leave I learn alot from the supervisor and it was a family company but also they had a agenda
bad,They do not provide the necessary tools to do your job well.   Monthly and annual job reviews do not match up.   You are set up to fail it feels like.
bad,This is not a job i would recommend if you don't want to do sales. And you don't want to lie. They literally train you to lie to people in order to make sales. I won't work for them or have my utilities with them either. Avoid Centurylink in all possible ways.
bad,"In the area I worked at, Eastern NC, they had no plans on updating or even rehabbing decades old technology/plant. They had the put a band aid on it approach, and only want to fix one customer at a time. Several areas with deteriorated cable. Constant fiber ring issues."
bad,"The most recent merger disbanded my team, I lost my  job because of the merger, very dissatisfied. Typical day work is on the phone speaking with clients, helping them with their accounts and day to day tasks."
bad,"You have to sell on60 percent of call, but 75 percent of calls had cancelled service calling because being charged for equipment causing issues with credit scores"
bad,"You are just a number to them, They do not care about there employees and they do not pair at a fair rate either. due to the many acquisitions there is not room for growth or opportunity"
bad,"The worst company to work for. Second only to Comcast.Not only do they treat their customers horrible, but they treat their employees just as bad. Bad all the way around."
bad,"This company is more focused on profit than they are the customer.  In the words of a trainer, ""if you can't upset your customer, get them off the phone so you can move on to the next"""
bad,Got layed off after only being there a year new CEO took over and is running company into the ground doesn't care about customer service just how to get more money for the board
bad,Really a sad place to work you have to be someone's cousin or attend church with someone to get promoted then they promote who they want and how they want. Most employees at coporate office are not technical at all.
bad,A typical day at work was to sell Qwest telecommunication solutions to new and existing customers.    You had to make sales quotas on a monthly basis or you would be terminated.  Very stressful work environment.  You had to sell no matter what.
bad,"This company does offer competitive pay and decent benefits, but that was where the positive aspects of the customer service department ended for me.  I was often expected to work mandatory overtime and the sales quotas went up at least four or five times in the three years that I was there.  Was released due to strict change to break policy that was completely reversed less than two weeks after my termination.  Drives sales VERY aggressively; in my opinion and experience as an employee, the company sought profit more than servicing the customer."
bad,"CenturyLink was unprofessional in my opinion, that's why I left. They were ok to work for if it were a temporary position. Overall I have been to better and they can do better."
bad,"Not terrible if you love being screamed at all day long, benefits are amazing. never able to take time off unless you call at 5:55 am and get the limited availability."
bad,"After working at AppleCare, Verizon tech support, and At&t customer service (second worst), I've determined that CenturyLink cares about NOTHING but their sales goals. If you’re not selling the internet product… you’re not worth anything to them. There are only two things that are unquestionably good about the job: Benefits (actual benefits and compensation) and weekends off. "
bad,"The training alone was horrible! I only stayed employed there for the two months until I could find something else. The training program taught you nothing, and even though there were so many mistakes made before you got a customer on the phone, you were still expected to try and sell them services."
bad,"Take inbound calls selling Century Link products, assisting customers with billing inquiries, and processing payments. Very friendly environment must be self motivated person to succeed"
bad,"Mediocre company with benefits and flex time. I learned a lot of skillsets such as account and project management. Centurylink does not retain good talent but rather would pay less for bodies. Enjoyed my co-workers, but the structure and direction of the business was always blurry."
bad,"They contradict themselves, they want you to be truthful with the customers while lying to them.  The calls are all stressful, you will not get paid for experience but on some kind of system that is designed to get you fired"
bad,Held horrible customer service practices/just wasn't for me.
bad,"assist cust on troubleshooting phones, phone lines, computers, internet, etc."
bad,trust me working for century link is the most stressful work environment that you will ever work in
bad,"Fast paced environment and fun place to work."
bad,Stay to yourself and you wil do well. It is a christian based place with devils running it...
bad,I was hired and praised for my skill and my experience and then immediately fired because of a past misdemeanor. Pathetic.
bad,"Company rarely gives raises, and hires at the lowest salary possible. Benefits are good."
bad,I enjoyed my first year and after that it got stressfull. Things started changing in all the ways to help customers. They ride you for the time to help the customers. They are basically wanting us to be cold to the customer and not go that extra mile in helping them! They are having some issues in other states so when we transfer to customer service we have to transfer to that certain state! Lawsuits are happening and thats why I am looking for different work.
bad,I liked working there was great time and experience but the management were not available as well but was a good company and they have bed bugs just beware they wont admit that
bad,They don't work with your personal schedule it's only about getting their job done
bad,"Selling Telephone products for Home and Business.customers. The ability to take payments and Kiosk, to sell to customers products they might need or want for their cell phones."
bad,Manangement was decent some better than others. The sales requirements vs the sales opportunities was not there so most people slammed and and crammed products to actually hit their numbers
bad,"Although the incentives and work benefits were great, compensation was great. The work atmosphere was not something I appreciated. If you weren’t willing to be friends with everyone outside of work then they created an atmosphere in the work group similar to high school. Where everyone had a certain attitude about them especially if you were making more sales then the rest. Nor did I enjoy pushing people into buying things they couldn’t afford."
bad,"this was an ok place to work "
bad,"I already entered the information that you are asking for."
bad,"I worked as an IP Tac tech and the job was ok. Management really sucks. The team is not helpful, but you do learn a little. There is favoritism going there and they won't teach you anything new"
bad,"no job growth, no opportunity to advance. You have to have a family member or be extra special friends with management in order to move up in this company and even then you can be let go at a moments notice."
bad,"If you want a place you can kind of lay and get a bunch of PTO, CTL is good. But if you want to accomplish something or get rewarded for your efforts stay far away. Raises have been ""under review"" for the last 2 years even though the new CEO was able to increase his salary. Additionally, don't expect any training everything is ""on the job"" training."
bad,"Working for CenturyLink was not what I thought it would be. It was stressful and unfair and the managers or ""Supervisors"" were not very helpful. Just not a very good work environment...."
bad,"Helter Skelter work environment. Everything is subject to last minute change, management does not manage. Co-workers do not share information or methods of procedure."
bad,working troulbe cases. wrighting mops and training new people
bad,You're just a number. Decisions made by upper brass management impact the lives of the lower level workers but the decisions are based on projections and not real world data.
bad,"I worked for the Centurylink on Washington St in Monroe, LA....one of the most horrible jobs I have ever held. I was not able to move to a different position at a different building because the managers always complained about them not having enough people if someone was transferred out. Hours were very unfair and EVERY WEEKEND was to be worked. The only time you got a weekend off was if you used personal time. The benefits were good, and vaca time was good too. Management was horrible and the building has rats, that they really didnt care about getting rid of. Favoritism is shown to about 90% of the staff while the remaining 10% were treated as if they didnt really matter.No lunch breaks either...have to beg other staff to go get lunch for you or order something to be delivered."
bad,"I spent 15 years working for the company and it is like a prison,"
bad,"Management is a joke, work place harassment is ignored and advancement is nonexistent. I feel like I am wasting away and falling behind as there is vertically no training of any kind and your job offers no transferable skills, once your there your stuck or you have to leave the company and re-educate yourself."
bad,"The only plus sides to working for Century link are what is provided because of the CWA Union (paid time off, raises, healthcare, ect). Managers and supervisors do not know the meaning of positive reinforcement or empathy. Don't apply if you're interested in future advancement with the company. There are employees there currently with 20+ years tenure who are still taking frontline calls. The micro-managing game is strong. Schedules are based on seniority, but more on company needs. Don't expect to have an early shift 3 - 4 years or less into it. Great for someone looking for a call center based job for a while, but not for people looking for a career."
bad,"Since 2009 and all of the mergers CenturyLink has undergone, the company no longer values its employees. It is not the company that Clark Williams founded."
bad,CTL does not hire qualified staff for the job description.  Individuals with qualified skill sets tends to pull weaker staff along due to no training.
bad,Poor leadership.  Company is made up of too many different Systems from multiple previous acquisitions of smaller companies. Constant company layoffs due to acquisitions.
bad,there was a lack of working slow day where nobody was doing anything than on days like that they send you hoe an that's messes wit my money so there was less work an no hours to help me pay bills
bad,"If you are in the union its a little better but not by much. The company is very focused on making more money at any cost. The consumer is misled by relationship managers calling them. They are outbound sales reps with a fancier name. They are only there to get you to pay more on your bill. You can be on an old plan and they will tell you to increase your speed it will be $30 or more with their modem rental. What they dont tell you is there is a new plan they could offer that will get you the faster speed and probably save you money or keep you right about the same price, but because they get yelled at for doing so they will make you spend more than what you really need on their service or they just wont call you at all because they wont make any money on getting you better service."
bad,"The leadership is lacking diversity and availability. There is no room to move towards promotions and no monetary gains, less than $0.50 in 3 years for raises."
bad,"They dont consider employess as family any longer. They are seeking higher buck and employees are expendable."
bad,"Back when it was owned by Sprint and Embarq life was great. Ever since Centurylink took over things went downhill quickly."
bad,"Centurylink gave me good opportunity by giving new role due to which i got good chance to learn new technology and new responsibilites. Time flexibility, Providing support to the Certifications, Encourging self development by opting trainings. Its good company."
bad,"The command structure of the department has issues. The primary boss is on another team which takes up most of his time. I was there 3 months and only say him once. The entire team aside from him, the shipping manager, and the team lead are contractors. Because of this there is no team cohesion."
bad,Working for this company was one of the worst experiences of my professional career.  Level3 has zero respect for it's people and they demonstrate that regularly.
bad,"It's a okay company, but they don't pay enough and don't care about their employees. I've said all that needs to be said. I think this is so not necessary, because there's no need to bash the company, just giving my intake on it. It wasn't for me, but it might be for someone else that's just starting out and wanting to work from the home"
bad,"Company is undergoing many changes, culture is non existent, management is absent.  Many layoffs and people looking for jobs at other companies within the industry."
bad,They do not give you any flexibility when having to take off from work. They do not offer support if you are lacking in performance and their management style
bad,"Very poor middle management.  Low pay, little work and family mentality.  Management works from home so they do not get a clear understanding about what happens at the office.  May go for weeks without seeing management."
bad,"stressful place to work.  No opportunity to advance. No teamwork.  No work/life balance.  No communication from management.  Not appreciated, no raises."
bad,Company was bought out. Its not not the same company I was hired too. New team is ok but they expect a lot of different results then what was the normal.
bad,"The culture and management were toxic.  There was little to know advancement, no strategic direction, no recognition, and no decent compensation offered."
bad,"Training was a joke. You are always getting micromanaged because of their stupid sales expectations, nobody even wants to come to work, disorganized enviroment. Unhealthy and stressful work environment. People are always getting fired or just go away anyways management is always trying to find a way to harm your productivity."
bad,"The company is great at acquiring others, however, awful at integrating data, systems and people."
bad,"A typical day at work would be taking inbound calls from upset, angry and confused customers. Constant calls about their bill and why it was so high. After we regained customers trust, it was mandatory that we sell them something. If we did not try to make a sale on every call, we were coached on what we did wrong.  Customer Service skills were not encouraged, and if we were able to keep the customer from cancelling there services w/CenturyLink, management did not praise you for keeping the customer, they berated you for not transferring the angry customer to retention and moving on to the next call in order for you to make a sale.  CenturyLink could care less if they loose a loyal customer, they would rather have you make a sale to a customer who can't pay their bill and who will eventually be turned over to collections. they do not want consumer service reps, they want sales reps."
bad,"It's amusing that such a vital part of the company's day-to-day would be ignored.  As such, work load and operational tempo becomes overwhelming quickly.  Burn out is a serious problem."
bad,"CenturyLink was definitely a challenge to work for. Unfortunately, I was communicated during the hiring process that CenturyLink was a Tier I technology company. I reviewed their website and based on what was indicated there, I assumed they were."
bad,"Typical large company.  Easy to get lost in the shuffle of day to day tasks.  Hard to feel like not just a number in such large companies.  I want my work to mean something and be valuable to my customers, many times not getting the same vibe from the company."
bad,the new centurylink treats employees and technicians like they are expendable and they have no response to competitor advanced technology and offerings.
bad,"The people that work at CenturyLink are great but ever since the merger with Level 3 Communications the company has made a huge shift and it seems now instead of being able to help you have to say no more often or you don't have the necessary training or tools to help.  It is a big hurdle in providing customer satisfaction.  Turn overs among the sales reps is high and the company should look at this.  Instead of making someone do tons of work and go to 2 or more people to get something done allow for a one stop process.  The company really needs to look at this because it is getting in the way of getting the job done.  They are so focused on money they are forgetting to invest in their people.  They are doing lay-offs in area's they should not and putting triple work on people that were already overloaded and not giving pay increases for all this extra work.  This is not going to make them a strong company.  A strong and successful company starts from within so maybe invest in your people rather then the high level executives getting rich.  A merger does mean you will have lean years but you shouldn't take that out on your workers you will stop getting good talent to do the job and CenturyLink will keep getting bad reviews and no one will want to work for the company."
bad,"To start out it was a wonderful environment to work...then as time progressed, the environment was so intense you worked on eggshells. The reps had unrealistic expectations put on them, and the environment became toxic."
bad,Poor leadership. Bad managers. Managers  need training. Be prepared for anything.  Stay focused and keep expectations low. Do your job and that's it. Nothing else to say.
bad,A good stepping stone to move up in your career. Salary is below industry standards. Management is very cliqueish and immature. The management style is very controlling and doesn't allow for much input from the employees.
bad,"My co-workers were very helpful getting me up to speed on their systems and practices.  The management lacks the knowledge to properly implement processes to allow timely customer customer delivery of all service types.  Engineers are overworked, underpaid, and underappreciated for their efforts and then chastised for failing to meet unreasonable time completion deadlines due to the enormous amount of differing interdepartmental goals, procedures, and programs.  If you want to work long hours for minimum pay, zero advancement opportunity, and micro-managers that have no idea how to properly build a fiber network, than CenturyLink is the place for you."
bad,"CTL has not been the same since the acquisition of Level3. High-value services are no longer being sold in favor of transactional MRR deals, Expect Managed Services and D&T groups to be sold off soon."
bad,"Call Center."
bad,"When I worked there I observed a fragmented culture following many years of acquisitions and subsequent integrations (Qwest, Savvis and most recently Level(3) that didn't emphasize or pursue unity.  In certain positions there is a trade off in terms of the ability to have meaningful impact on the business tempered by overwork of those in a position to do so.  Unfortunately, during my time there morale and the development of a positive culture seemed not to have been on the radar of senior management.  It will be interesting to see what the impact is of Level(3) senior management (CEO and CFO) taking the helm in the near."
bad,Worked here for over 10 years and no chance to advance within the company would not recommend working here if looking for an advancing career. I worked for 7 different managers without moving offices.
bad,"Everyone in our new dept was out for themselves. I was the oldest of the group and the trainer told me he didnt think I would pass the class.( I have a business degree). "
bad,I don't believe that Centurylink cares about their employees. They care more about making money then the future of what keeps their company running. This is a very stressful work environment
bad,During my four plus years at Level 3 I had 7 managers and 4 job  titles due to the unstable leaders within the organization.  My decision to leave was due to the acquisition of Level 3.
bad,"When Hired, they told us it was a customer support job with some selling, than they made you stop helping people and only sell.  They forced quotas that made you hateful to clients."
bad,Just another Telecom with lots of processes to digest. Too slow in reacting and less innovating . We need more competitive products & huge investment in marketing.
bad,"Widespread sentiment that one is always walking on eggshells. Creativity immensely hindered by countless layers of approvals, reviews and data entering in too many software applications. A lot of employee turnover."
bad,The place is the same as it was 30 years ago with little change. We have been sold and bought so many times I can not keep track. Things are stale with little room for growth in Seattle.
bad,"Its not what you know but who you know, very large inconsistencies in the way employees are managed and promoted, opportunities that you qualify for have unrealistic expectations."
bad,They find the dumbest reason to fire you. So many people at the Des Moines office were fired over the dumbest things. Their management sucks and are unprofessional.
bad,I find that my competition is my own company and that it doesn't matter of the relationship built between the sales rep and it's just about the numbers and not the valued customer.
bad,"Benefits are great, however the pay is low.  Management is very inconsistent in directions and only cares about the numbers produced.  Very strict attendance policy, two minutes late and an employee is written up no matter the cause, i.e. elevators not working in the building, or management stopping you to talk before you clock in. The job is advertised with no nights, weekends or mandatory overtime; however, weekends, overnights, holidays and overtime are mandatory."
bad,CenturyLink is not a company of the 21st century. The company is not willing to invent where it is necessary in order to compete and win in the marketplace. Compensation is low and work hours are long due to reduced staff.
bad,"This is a great starting job. The pay is not that great. The management is below average. With Mandatory overtime, it is difficult to plan or have a work life balance. The company's work ethic is sub par. The company's knowledge of their products compare to their competitors is also sub par."
bad,"poor morale, felt like everyone was out for themselves from management on down."
bad,"At Level 3 there is no room for advancement.  As an executive assistant I would expect that the position more challenging. I would expect to be doing more than just calendar management and even coordination.  Also, the work environment is very impersonal.  I feel that I am very underutilized.  The oether executive assistants are happy with with these job duties.  I really challenge and i want to be a an asset to the team."
bad,"Took inbound calls to take care of customer billing issues. Here you resolved customer issues and attempted to upsale products and services. "
bad,"meeting monthly requirements to keep your job, was hard but I made it each month"
bad,a typical day at work was installing and repair of osp phone and dsl lines Ive learned how to improve my communication skills with the customer and how to do a better job in repairing and installing the customers phone line the management needs to learn to trust the employees keep there voices to the truth and not lies . don't set up the employee for fail but build and train the employee for success i never got got the proper training and as a ex employee i never got that chance my co workers was the great bunch of guys that would help you at any time you called the hardest part of the job was dealing with management the rules they made would in how to do the job would change every several weeks to accommodate the the management and the management would always put more work load than the employee can do in a normal days work the most enjoyable part of the job was to help the customer get and understand there services from dsl on there computer to there phone line
bad,Centurylink is a company that’s not family or employee driven . It is a self contained company with its only drive is to make more money. They take from there employees for self gains every chance they can
bad,CenturyLink provided me with my first full time experience in a business work place environment. Unfortunately certain policies made it very difficult for employees to pursue long term or somewhat fulfilling careers.
bad,"This was the worst company to work for.  The only thing I liked about it were the other agents I worked with.  I don't really care to leave a review because it is a waste of time, but this system is forcing me to do so."
bad,not the best management at the time. have heard things have changed. not much else to say about my time there. They did not train well or have a solid organization
bad,unable to keep up with the policy changes since merger with level 3 we are not told the policy then held to numbers that are the same as the guys on the level 3 side without having half the tools they do we have about 40% of the people we are supposed to and they refuse to hire more
bad,Anyone with seniority at this company will eventually betray you and/or make sure you are forced out or fired. I witnessed a mass exodus here unlike any other company I have ever worked for.
bad,"Working in the sales department at Centurylink is a thankless, disengaging, and boring job.  You are given a base of customers, roughly 200, and your monthly sales target is $3100.  You can ONLY sell to those 200 customers, you cannot sell to another reps customers, and you cannot prospect outside your list.  You can cold call random businesses, aka to get new customers, but there are not lists or criteria/tools to use to look up information on said new businesses.  You can't tell if Centurylink even has services available at the location.  So you can cold call all you want, but the likelihood our services are available there is slim to none.  Management is very poor, they have expectations of you, but do not coach or train on how to be successful.  Turnover is high."
bad,Very difficult place to work. Hard to get anything done. Long dependency tree for project work. Many hands. Complex portfolio. Mix of company cultures. Sales is a revolving door.
bad,This is one of the most stressful jobs i’ve ever had.   Constantly having to look over my shoulder because of sales.  It’s cut throat in there.  Would take an act of God to get me to go back.
bad,"CTL is a great place to start out for recent college grads. Full benefits, generous vacation time but salary is low. Not a place I want to retire from."
bad,Werent allowed to miss any work. They didnt care if you had a doctors note. I was literally at my desk with a trash can and throwing up. Was never told to go home or to seek medical attention.
bad,Wouldn't work here anymore.  It's Level 3 take over.  The MANAGEMENT had thier heads up thier butts and it's very cliqish. The good employees are being run out.  They Prety much just want dummies in Chairs who tout thier lies and misrepresent  the customer networks.
bad,When I started at CenturyLink it was owned by Savvis Communications. And everyone got along for the mist part. And it was a good place to work at. Since then CenturyLink purchased Savvis Communications and things have been a struggle. To have VP level employees say that they are having a problem filling empty positions within the company fast enough as they open should show how difficult it is to work there.
bad,Did not enjoy job security being based on whether or not you could get someone to purchase products -  when the incentives offered were causing some employees to be dishonest with their sales and the honest ones were left to clean up the mess
bad,They don't have commitment to our customers an more worried about internal issues and how they can let go so many good people. Have no morals to their employees and more work on those that are there now.
bad,It was horrible and then they moved us out of nowhere to another company. Not worth the time there and the company doesnt care about you or its customers
bad,The company is in a state of flux and processes are all over the place. Unfortunately there's very FEW people you can ask for help. The new CEO just retired so very unsure of future here
bad,CenturyLink relationship manager position was one with flexibility but also one with little direction or resource for assistance. Management spent it's time babysitting rather than using their influence to move deals that really mattered across the line. Many employees at CenturyLink are fed up with the bureaucracy of the company.
bad,Antiquated systems held back successful delivery of projects. There was a constant fight to get delivery/provisioning systems updated to support delivery and launch of new systems.
bad,Good benefits but management was hard to work with and working outside on the coldest days was not fun. Management pushed very hard and always threatened to fire us for over 10years.
bad,"Shift started at 6am ended at 2pm, which was not a good schedule. They had to approve all transfers from our department and each time it was time for someone to be interviewed for a job, they found a reason not to let us leave. No lunch breaks...8hours of straight work, in addition to 2, 15 minute breaks. Hardest part was all the daily tasks that had to be achieved in so little time and pay!!! Requested transfer from my position and position, each time was turned down saying we didn't have enough employees, although we were fully staffed. We has to work every weekend and all holidays unless you scheduled time off"
bad,CenturyLink is playing catchup with an ever advancing cloud industry.  They have made several acquistions that have not panned out and are searching for ways to stay relevant in this dynamic environment.
bad,"Retention office was laid off and moved to Arizona, which may have been a reason for the extremely high call volume and the mandatory overtime. May be more balanced now."
bad,This company has been under lawsuits.  The culture has changed and sales are not viable therefore decreased pay.  We are now forced to work from home and purchase our own equipment; this does not fit my budget.
bad,Working at CenturyLink was stressful because Management at the VP and higher levels did not make good decisions. Their stock is tanking and always tanks because of those poor decisions. CenturyLinks' IT culture homes in on saving money and thus they outsource work. The Chiefs save money and get poor quality work.
bad,There is really no advancement options in I.T.  This used to be a company I thought I could retire from.  It now seems more and more each day that centurylink is going with the offshore contractor route for I.T position.
bad,"There is not much room for growth if you work inside the company. If you do your job, you get extra work from the people who don't. The pay is not comparable to our competitors and we work over 50 hours a week in my department."
bad,"CenturyLink is a burn out shop, every team is shrinking in size while the workload does not also shrink, so as time goes on, you are just doing more work until burnout sets in or you stay there and become a better shell of a human."
bad,"When I was there, there were layoffs the first Friday of every month.  It was extremely chest wrenching living with that weight on your chest.  I was a decent tech, so I didn't have to worry as much as some... but, I had to watch a lot of my peers/managers get walked out.  This company didn't seem to have a team mentality when I was there.  I didn't get much help from Senior folks, either.  You really have to hit the ground running here."
bad,"Prepare to never have any job security.  Company focuses on sales vs. customer service.  Despite having been in business for many years constantly changes practices to limit ability to meet sales goals.  While working for them does have some perks, the constant threat of losing your job due to not meeting sales goals in inhumane when you factor in the fact that said goals are changed  often and are often impossible to meet."
bad,"Low pay....not enough instructions to perform job...employees cutthroat. "
bad,"A typical day at work is reporting to work but being afraid that you may touch the carpeting too early.  But it would be another fateful day for you if you showed up late, as well.  Nepotism is the norm, here, at Centurylink.  If you are not a yuge fat cow who sits around eating chips and gossiping, you won't fit in."
bad,"This company operated bare bones. Shared test equipment, broken tools. Complete lack of safety equipment. Complete lack of training for new hires. Unskilled labor working on high voltage systems. They have big problems in this system."
bad,"Centurylink was a terrible place to work with great pay. The people and managers that you work directly with are great, but above them is a poor structure and not customer oriented."
bad,I worked there for a very long time in their retention side and it messed me up so bad so much stress customer are so rude over their bills because they can't read them or you don't give them the answer they want. Other reps wouldn't do their job right or would pass them off from rep to rep until you get them they are already frustrated and they become hard to be able to help. The only good thing that came from here was my great supervisor and the floor manager I had and the friends I made. The taxes are so bad you made over 1k a paycheck but you take 750 because of the taxes same with the comp checks if you value your sanity don't apply
bad,"At first, Century Link seems like it's going to to be a wonderful place to work...and it can be as there is lots of $$$ to be made. "
bad,"This was a transitional job to stay closer to home and have less travel.  I was a sales consultant in that I was a customer service representative fielding phone calls from across the country to assist with billing questions, service, and to promote the products that Century Link offered.  This was a remote job and I worked from home.  I enjoyed talking to people from all over the country and the pace was enjoyable.  However it offered no flexibility for hours worked or days worked."
bad,"The training was rushed and incomplete, resulting in agents who could not handle calls properly and frustrating customers."
bad,"CenturyLink is on a rampage of reducing management and occupational head count at the cost of degrading operations."
bad,"Traditional phone company where employees stay for 20+ years. Resistant to change, and they typically don't hire off the streets."
bad,"Despite acquiring Savvis, Embarq & Qwest(Former US West), the core company methodology is far below acceptable telecom standards.. It will take a few years for the ripple to be seen, however, with current leadership and its methodology passed down to lower management; its very noticeable from the inside. "
bad,"Theres nothing to say. Needs better mangement, co workeres are great"
bad,It will get old very fast. Its not for everyone and the hours will change.
bad,"The management at CenturyLink only cares about one thing: Sales. While working with this company I was told to get sales no matter the cost and sometimes that meant being unethical to customers. Over time this will weigh heavily on anyone and something will need to change. I decided to stop the unethical treatment of my customers and eventually left this company after being passed over for 3 promotions, of which I was more than qualified. I would not recommend this company to anyone and would caution those who are interested in working with CenturyLink."
bad,"Inbound billing calls, Transition into sales calls."
bad,I was always taught if you have nothing nice to say then don't say anything at all. With that being said. It's a hard no for me with this company. A HARD NO.
bad,"At one time this was CenturyTel.  That was a great company!   People were respected, treated fairly.  Then they outgrew that basic virtue and became dishonest in how it treated employes.  Though I managed one of the largest divisions in the company I was paid less that others.  The 'prime directive' of honest and fair treatment was a false flag.  Like most companies it was really about who was feared and who was in favor that week.  Requests for an honest evaluation was retaliated against if it did not go along with the favorite person of the week.  SOX was rigged, and was afraid to actually look into issues brought before it."
bad,"Unless you are working in Monroe, LA, you don't matter. There is no focus on employees and there is a toxic culture that is pervasive. I wouldn't recommend working here if it could be avoided."
bad,"CTL is focussing more on cutback than growth. Since 2017 and every quarter, CTL reduces the staff by 10%. Sales are very depressing. In addition, the work environment is combative."
bad,"It's a call center. It's stressful. You're stuck in a cubicle on the incoming end of angry upset customers. 99% about their bill. "
bad,"With the leadership limited with executives trying to save this company over time and time again, each merger killed a piece of the company. Also, with working with the union affected the company. Each day when you are told to ""save the company money"", how are you suppose to do that when leaders don't have a vision for where the company is going? They kept stressing to you ""your lucky to have a job"". With that type of leadership, how can one really feel good about the company and support the company when the execs don't even have a proper vision. Bad customer service has always plague the company and empty promises damaged the workforce."
bad,"Very stressful place to work, co-workers and myself  never received job training.  Management not aware of workers needs, and reluctant to listen to concerns of employees."
bad,"I  would not recommend this company to anyone. If I could change my telephone service I would.  They are all about hiring contractors, not employees. Since Level 3 took over it's all about contractors, not employees."
bad,"This place hires you, tells you one thing to get you in the door then once you’re in everything changes! If they were up front and honest about what you’re gonna be doing and the hrs you will be working then it would be an ok place to work. Also I know people who been there 3, 4, & 6 years and have gotten 1 raise it makes no sense.. no diversity in supervisor everyone in authority was a white lady. Have no regard for your life and what you have going on changed my schedule with no time to prepare"
bad,Being tied to a computer for 8 hours a day fielding calls from abusive and demeaning customers takes a toll on the average person.  There is little time to connect with your co-workers or build a rapport.
bad,The current management seems to be without vision. They are constantly cutting departments and laying off workers only to refill those positions later. There does not seem to be any real direction given to employees and internal surveys show distrust of management.
bad,"It’s just not worth it . No matter how excellent your performance is , there aren’t any bonuses to be received and promotions are never within the company ."
bad,Depending on who you were friends with or who's a*s you kissed you could be promoted to a special team to work on cool interesting projects with little to no knowledge or care about them then sit off in your little group chit chatting all day and getting nothing done OR just be allowed to do anything you wanted so long as you sat down and did a tiny bit or work before the day was over. Not kissing someone's a*s was basically treated the same as defiance and once you get shoved to the side you can pretty much never move up or even out because your supervisor will talk you down to other departments.
bad,"Since the last merger, the direction of IT services has taken a very foolish turn.  Management is not using what is best practice, but is instead trying to see if their former clique driven style will work in the new world.  It doesn't.  Run away and don't look back."
bad,"Unfortunately when CenturyLink took over Qwest morale went down the tubes and everybody was panicking to try to stay employed, their sales goals were very aggressive and eventually our office shut down and we have a choice of a buyout or move to Phoenix to follow our job.  Even though we were the best producing office apparently our wages were too much for the company the bear that's why they decided to shut down the office unfortunately."
bad,Great pay and work life balance. Young managers do not get formal training. Limited training in Lead Generation dept. Remote work 2 days a week. Great benefits
bad,"Before merger things were ok, now layoffs, managers that could care less, no help within teams and system issues. No proper training and most sales reps are clueless"
bad,"When I worked ate the c there were lots of incentives, good bonus's and a great team to work with.  Management takes sides with no tolerance for mistakes.  If you have a family emergency or need to take time off for legal or medical issues they will fire you. There is a Union that is supposed to work for you, however they are puppets and don't do much to stand up for the employees."
bad,"Just as the Summary indicates. This is a great company that has great benefits. The job is very cut-throat and if you have an employee with the same Job Title as you, then there seems to be this unspoken ""competition"" that happens. This, in my opinion, creates a hostile work environment. Fun place to work if that wasn't a factor that involuntarily creates a horrible work environment."
bad,How can a company as large as Centurylink operate with no employee oversight? There isn't one customer I had the pleasure of dealing with that had anything good to say about Centurylink.  Seriously!  Every customer I dealt with had nothing but bad things to say about my employer.
bad,Company seems very unorganized because of the merger.  Typical large company behavior in the midst of mergers.  I am hoping to have the opportunity to become a perm employee and hoping for more responsibilities.
bad,employees still owed money from last year from bonus'; still awaiting full compensation for commissions earned past few months; support has different answers everywhere you go; and always attaining points for minutes here and there and policies on makeup change daily.
bad,"This was once a really good company to work for, when we were Sprint and Embarq. It has changed for the worse since becoming CenturyLink. I enjoyed my job and the people.  In the last few years, bad & inconsistent management decisions and failing to compete has made this position less desirable.  This position does not seem to have a bright future. Many co-workers have opted for early retirement packages and have not been replaced. Forced overtime and added pressure has been placed on those remaining. There are not enough tech notions to service our customers effectively. A new dispatch system has made matters worse and technicians less productive creating a bad work environment and morale  issues."
bad,"Underpaid, Underappreciated, non-competitive, while selling an underwhelming product. ""do more with less"" will be the bedrock that will last your entire career while the expectations rise."
bad,"-culture is a dog eat dog with high turnover and high pressure sales tactics are taught"
bad,"I was allowed to write standard operating procedures, create processes and manage a large variety of projects all at the same time with minimal to no guidance."
bad,"Favoritism is the biggest issue. Certain people get more support and resources than others. This is fine sometimes, but everyday it gets old quick. It really depletes from the culture, and when the wrong people are promoted, it looks like this favoritism is actually driving the direction of the company culture."
bad,"When working for CenturyLink, I found that the expectations of the employees in the position that I held was overbearing. Too much is expected and too little is provided to promote good ethics. Employees on the front-lines of consumerism/tech support are expected to be machines rather than humans with emotions and reactions. Way too stressful."
bad,"Very stressful environment with bad leadership.  The pay is decent but the problem is follow through with the customers.  As a sales professional, there were many times when commissions were not 100% paid because the ball was dropped on the project implementation."
bad,When I applied this was for a internet technical support. About 30 days after having the job there we (other new hires) were force to be trained on PRISM support which would put us in a 24/7 schedule. This was able to be done due to CenturyLink putting a fine print on the application saying they could do this. They did not even care that they did this to their employees. Once you start doing the new PRISM support you are expected to make promises that cannot be guaranted. I was not comfortable about lying to customers.
bad,This company does not offer career advancement.  It is impossible to receive any advancement with this company.  They upper Level management does not care about the advancement of employees.
bad,"The hardest part of the job was being able to sell a product to a customer but then other departments losing the sale for you. For example, techs that never show up for new installs or even move orders. In addition, for being such a large company we had MANY areas with ""High Speed Internet"" as low as 1.5m. Seriously? I do miss the people I worked with and the management team."
bad,was a hi stress environment with random changes that made no sense to the job and did minimal for employees only cause they were a union and had to  do
bad,"Stressful, promotions are based of how much the manager likes you rather than experience, hard work, and accomplishments. Management has no idea what they are doing and every change they make creates massive complications."
bad,"I loved this job when I was in the 6 month grace period.  I always hit the 90% percentage each month, but the first month I didnt because of their techs having scheduling and install issues, I was put on notice like I was nothing but a replaceable worker.  Its almost like dodgeing bullets to keep from getting in trouble for something else, like over gifting, customer mistreats for things you didnt even know you were doing wrong, company does not have your back at all."
bad,"Sales job is mostly updating reports.  Very little time to focus on customers due to internal processes and policies.  Management has created a miserable sales culture due to  poor leadership. and micro management.    "
bad,"job was okay. I liked being able to increase my base pay from sales."
bad,"If you're working for a contract with a federal client, be prepared to be bored. Tasks are more administrative than technical. If you're lucky enough to have a supportive team, you'll be okay and survive. Most of the people who stay at this company get promoted even if they're not qualified and that's how you get bad management running your teams."
bad,If you are looking for a way into the industry it is a good place to start. If you have experience I would look elsewhere. There is far too much transition and management seems determined to add issues instead of taking on the current issues with the company.
bad,Gained experience but less growth in salary. Work here and you will generate revenue for company and not for yourself. You will always get tough work and poor wage type of salary.
bad,"You get paid well and that's it. There is no incentive to stay or encouragement for a job done well. Everyone feels neglected, local management is a circus, higher management is too busy trying to merge companies."
bad,"Could be great, but no one is held accountable. If you want to goof off and get paid this is a great job. If you want to achieve something, good luck getting anyone to care."
bad,"Nepotistic working environment coupled with grown women who have  a very ""high school mentality"".  ""Soul crushing"" working environment.  Management v Union workers."
bad,"A typical day at work was more stressful than it needed to be.  I learned to keep my head down and do my job.  There was very little managerial support for both customers and employees.  My co-workers, however, were wonderful and the best part of the job."
bad,"Very unstable working environment, Contracts ended prematurely.  Worked for several clients at this facility.  "
bad,"It seems to me moving around and up is very difficult. Lots of walls between departments, cant go from operation to marketing for instance. Marketing would rather hire someone who sold dog food in their last job that someone from operations who has implemented networks. Very curious. Also as with most other telecom companies, nepotism is starting to rear its head. Lots of metrics with management not knowing fundamentals of the Business."
bad,I was working from home; and their VPN didn't seem to want to work 40% of the time; so I was off more than I was on.  So therefore I was forced to resign
bad,"While the incentive of working for Century Link is nice, they do not give the basic skills or knowledge to be a effective employee. The handle time expectation can hardly be met due to there systems being outdated. Right out of training you are being written up for attainment goals not being met due to systems taking the whole attainment time to load. Over all is was dissatisfying to be an employee of Century link"
bad,"This company rewards and keeps employees who are incompetent, lazy, and who say yes to everything--even at the cost of wasting company resources and the going against the guiding principles. The employees that really try to make a difference, create new processes and really know what they are doing (or strive to learn new products, processes, technologies) are the first to go. Right now the company is having significant financial difficulty and going through a huge reduction in workforce."
bad,"Some employees working, some walking around and talking- a few seem to pick up the slack of many. Bullying is very common- issues not addressed by management"
bad,"Accurately documented, researched and resolved customer service issues. Managed customer calls effectively and efficiently in a complex, fast-paced and challenging call center environment"
bad,"employees must work in Monroe, LA in order to get promoted."
bad,"The compensation and benefits kind of suck for part time employees. They don't really treat you fairly either. The only way to get ahead is that you will have to know someone. The pay is horrible. They pay part time employees on Tier 1 rate, but have you doing Tier 2 work. I'm kind of thinking of getting a lawyer."
bad,"Answering phones, helping customers with requests, offering new products based on the customer needs, helping with billing requests and accepting payments. Co-workers are great. I don't like that customers are on hold so long, that when I talk to them, they are mad, some will curse you out and get racist. The objectives are too high. Only 60% of people nation wide have landlines, but on my that expect you to 85%"
bad,So if you're ok with trying to sell technology products to customers while using a CRM tool that is DOS based.....this is just right for you.
bad,CEO allowed ALLTEL hostile takeover. If you were a CEO would you call CEO for ALLTEL and asked them if they were interested in purchasing a subsidiary without a NDA? Then telling employees that he would never sell to ALLTEL or do business with a unethical company and then after the hostile takeover - a year later did!
bad,It's not a good work environment-bean counters run the show
bad,Company that doesnt believe in letting minor issues go unless you are a favorite then the world is your oyster. Micromanaging and too many hands in the cookie jar is standard practice. Anytime a new company is saved from going under they take over where established employees were and try to run things like their old company that was going out of business for a reason.
bad,"The shift I had at Qwest was pretty good. Until I had sprained my ankle pretty badly and was awaiting confirmation to as of if I needed surgery or not. They did not take too kindly that I had missed one day, due to the fact that I could not walk. My supervisor was always checking out the younger girls whom had been hired with me, and didn't care to pay attention to the others. Sexual harassment was pretty bad here too.The only thing that I liked about this was getting to help customers the best way that I could to make sure they were getting the best of their bills, and my work hours. I would have rather had a desk alone where I could get work done instead of cubicles with several others around me."
bad,A typical day at work consists of taking muliple calls and going over billing questions
bad,Call center environment with huge objectives massive stress that used to be balanced by decent wages and great commission structure went dramatically downhill higher expectations with less pay...no real raises.
bad,"Fast paced call center environment, decent pay and commission. However you’re micromanaged in ever aspect of this job with a constant threat of write up or termination if sales goals are not met on a monthly bases."
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job is actually helping the customers.  I find it frustrating when the company's systems do not work properly and we don't receive proper training.  The morale at Century Link is very poor.
bad,This job was soul crushing and I felt like I was lying to customers. Management didn't care and only wanted to push us for their own benefit-no matter the cost. I highly recommend not working here. A very dishonest company.
bad,If you are hired at this place in St Louis you will find that there is a hanging on by the skin of your teeth mentality. They have pulled out half of the light bulbs and cut back garbage pick up to once a week. The rooms are extremely dusty and people seem to be sick much more there than at other places. Management is done by spies that run and tell on you to the manager. They believe whatever they are told and give you no chance to defend yourself of whatever you have been accused of. They are a company that has been hobbled together by buying 5 other companies. You are required to learn how each of the old companies did things and there seems to be no efforts in place to bring all of the different networks together using the same methods and procedures. There are 5 ticketing systems to learn to use and that is very confusing as well. There is no actual training to be had and the people that are training are not actual trainers they are just the ones that enjoy a small amount of authority and like to yell and belittle the people that they are suppose to be training. The management there is weak and inefficient. The director is constantly out on leave and the managers have no people skills or HR experience to deal with the issues that are literally right in front of their face. The people with seniority only work the 5 day work week. The weekend shift is a 13 hour grueling experience that is terrible. No one wants to work it but when you are hired on it is the only choice that you have. My recommendation is to find a better work environment. If the dust doesn't get you the stress
bad,Training at CenuryLink was very good and extensive. The problem was miscommunication of the work schedule after the 4 week training program. We had a group of 12 people in the group and we were all advised incorrectly and they did nothing to correct their mistake.
bad,After a merger between CenturyTel and embarq the company that I enjoyed working for was gutted and turned into disheartening place to work. I did not trust my manager
bad,"In short, if you are not meeting your goals you will be fired. The goals are astronomically high with a slim chance that anyone will meet them. You are set up to fail. Also this job is commission based, so if you aren’t meeting the crazy high goals, you aren’t getting paid. It’s awesome if you’re meeting your goals, terrible if you aren’t."
bad,"It's hard to leave this job because it seems CenturyLink works with every recruiter to fill jobs. Expect to get call after call when they are hiring even when you work there. Also expect recruiters to desert you because CenturyLink is their client and they don't want to spoil the relationship."
bad,"I was a top tier performer (bravo club/presidents club) for several years. "
bad,Before merger as Century Link. Not a serious place to work. Upper leadership left after merger.  There lied the issues since they were looking for full vesting and didn't have their hand on the steering wheel.
bad,people are great / day 2 day work stressful  to make matrix / management problems. way too many systems  to work through  /.from many company buy outs and mergers. adding to the stress. The best part of working there was the people and the customers .
bad,"CenturyLink overcomplicates literally every aspect of the job, from simple things like attendance to the actual job itself. The systems are insane, they have a system for every little thing and it's very hard to learn 30 programs, if a customer calls in to ask a simple question like where their tech is or what their bill is, you then have to navigate through a ton of outdated systems to get an answer. Most people who call in are upset and hate the product. You were required to sell on every call even if it was unethical, the department I was in was customer service but it was really about 10 departments and sales all in one with the metrics for all. I  feel like this place has the potential to be a great place to work if they simplified everything, the only reason I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 is most of the management is pretty aware of how dumb it all is, there's a couple tryhard managers but when I resigned mine understood it's not for everyone. "
bad,"A mentally draining, thankless job with no proper training and terrible work/life balance. There are no company incentives, and you get thrown into the deep end on new products and services that you have no idea on how to support"
bad,"A typical workday included milling away at repetitive busy work. Much more work could have been done, but the politics and management do not allow for a high functioning environment. You have a lot of lifers here that are set in the past and do not want to do anything more than the bare minimum. It's a very pass the buck environment. I also saw a lot buddy/buddy career advancement instead of actually promoting the best candidates for management positions."
bad,"unattainable metrics, management who resent union representation and subvert it whenever they get the chance, no internal hiring besides tokens."
bad,Still a good job with good benefits and salary. Wouldn’t enter with expectations of retirement here. Just a dying industry. One of the few places with a pension still. New hires get a modified version.
bad,"A typical day is trying to collect pay and make pay arrangements to those who qualify. The hardest part of the job is being cursed and called out of your name by irate customers.  We have a good number of great employees, who try to work together. The building is always very cold."
bad,"Fast pace "
bad,I liked everything about it. Could be better point systems when there is a medical reason that is serious for absences. I would definitely work for them again
bad,I was laid off after working with the company only six months.  Century Link changed hands many times and there were a lot of labor disputes.  My boss was great but their was a lot of fraud and waste being committed by upper management.
bad,At the time of my employment the management staff was in chaos and there was not much leadership.  This was during a time of transition so some of the cons were expected.
bad,"At one time CenturyLink was a great place to work.  You had to work a lot, but the people were good and the respect was plentiful. Times have changed and the company (while bigger) is a shadow of what it used to be.  "
bad,"I felt that CenturyLink was a mediocre company with only  fair technology, little product differentiation, and frequent organization change.  They treated employees okay, but didn't pay sales very much."
bad,This company does not consider your need for work life balance.  I would not recommend them if you have a family.  Some department leadership does not care about you personally.
bad,Its nothing special I sat in a cubicle all day and did barely any work. I did not have access to the applications i needed to do the work and they never gave me any work to do.
bad,"The company Qwest Communications was merged with Centurly Link and I was laid off during the process for no apparent reason.  It was mostly due to newly appointed management disliked me for whatever reason and made that know to a few that he did not know they passed it on to me.  So, I was a target and easy to lay off after 12 years with the company and good to great reviews from customer base."
bad,I worked for Century Link (QWEST) many years ago.  They were a solid company.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and the challenges that came my way.
bad,They have unrealistic sales quotas as they want to to sell or upgrade services to customers who are already upset over billing errors or charges previous employees did not tell the customer about.
bad,"Worked for Level 3 prior to CenturyLink takeover So I have nothing I can say good or bad about the management, no pros or cons. Level 3 was just ok to work for."
bad,Apopka was not a great call center and management was terrible. I know more people that left than are still there.                  Would not recommend that place
bad,"Time after time I would get a customer on the line I COULD NOT HELP due to departmentalization and just plain bad customer service.  "
bad,"Must be able to work in a fast paced environment, ability to multi-task. Can be stressful at times with a heavy work load. Hardest part is being very thoroughly with your work. Mistakes can be easily made and can be very detrimental to service. I feel some of the tasks that had to be done had nothing to do with providing service to the customer, mostly just busy work, that got in the way."
bad,I just feel as a company its not going in the right direction. They are closing store fronts. In the position I work why should sale outweigh the customer care part of my position.
bad,The job day was typically slow at Qwest in Champaign. I found myself often seeking thing to do.  My time in Philadelphia was packed with much more work as we tended terminals from New York to Washington.
bad,The pay can be quite good at CenturyLink IF you make it.  The ramp up is incredibly difficult and there is little support ever since the Level 3 acquisition.  The environment is completely cut throat.  Everyone is competing against everyone so you have to watch your back on your deals.  They don't care who gets the deal as long at CenturyLink gets the revenue.  Upper management doesn't care about their people.  They don't care if you stay or if you go.  You are only as good as your last month even though they will tell you that you are working toward an annual quota.  Either you make your quota within your first 6 months or you will be fired.  They will even put a tenured rep with a long standing history of success on a performance plan if they have a couple bad months.  The environment is extremely negative.
bad,"With the “acquisition “ of Level 3, CenturyLink is no longer controlled by CenturyLink, Level 3 is in charge. In my opinion, the company is moving away from Agile and scrum to some other process that I am unable to discern."
bad,"Technicians are treated very poorly here. The work environment is very hostile and unsafe. Dozens of technicians reported the abuse to the Corporate Complaint line, but local management removed and discarded the complaints. They were never viewed or investigated by corporate. Many techs have been involved in accidents, as safety is no longer a priority. Productivity is all that matters. They amount of mental and physical damage this company has caused its employees is sad. Most guys stay, only because the amount of money we are paid!"
bad,"Too much middle management with little or no direction from sr leadership or executives.  "
bad,"A lo largo del tiempo los valores de las retribuciones salariales han Sido  no solo insuficientes, sino también de índole extorsiva."
bad,"Considering when I first started working for the company, it was U.S. West. I enjoyed the work, environment and the people. When Qwest Corp bought the company there were understandable changes, but the transition was fair and good. When Centurylink LLC bought the company, there were wholesale changes in all process areas, and constant changes from management, when their processes didn't pan out. The work environment became very stressful and tenuous. The engineering folks, of which I was one, were doing more work then we could handle, and were spending many extra hours at night from home logged in, just to keep up."
bad,"I loved my position and role at CenturyLink however with that acquisition of Level 3 the company direction seemed to not be efficient and the roles were undefined. Process implementation was nearly impossible and the company showed very little organization. the compensation plan took nearly 6 months to be finalized and the entire sales floor was unsure of how they were getting paid for the first half of the year, not to mention that the compensation plan was nearly impossible to understand or follow."
bad,"CenturyLink was good to me at a very tough time in my life.  While I enjoyed the work and made great friends over my years there, when it was time to return to the workforce, I found that coming back to a starting pay that was less than my original starting pay was just not something I could do."
bad,"This company has been taken over by another company so it is difficult to rate anything because Qwest no longer exists.  Qwest did pay we,, but the working environment was very stressful.  It was a union shop so my feeling is that that set up a competition between management and union employees which was stressful"
bad,"I didn't care about selling other services, I cared about helping the customers fix the issue that they called in about. It was hard to help the customers when you were worried about what you needed to sell them to make sure you didn't lose your job. Just wasn't for me."
bad,They racial profile and treat others better if they like you very judgmental and do not have respect for there employees a very bad company to work for and there customer service is horrible
bad,"OK company, decent pay and work life balance.  Losing direction on hosting and cloud initiatives.  Seems the company is mainly focused on selling network products."
bad,"Continuous layoffs.  Poor management.  Poor internal systems to run the company on. Still using mainframes!! HR has too much power.  Jeff Stories will fix much of this, in time, but it will take years."
bad,"The job was a job, the point system will get you fired quickly if you have small children or just children period. The pay is great but the balancing work and home is impossible"
bad,"I work hard but not always recognized for the effort.  At times there seems to be favoritism but on any given day its all about rushing through.  Most times when field management is required, they don't always follow through with the customer making me look as if I lied to the customer, making me lose credibility."
bad,"Management is encouraged to lie to employees and reward only people without the customer in mind. They are also encouraged to belittle each employee, no matter how well he/she performs."
bad,"I can't say I was happy with the insular boy's-club culture, the ""it's only a problem if you let it be, we can handle that down the line"" attitude of management, the chaotic and incomplete training, or the fairly long hours (but that you can't blame them for, just a fact of the job). The pay is decent, and the work isn't too hard once you figure out how to do it on your own if you aren't lucky enough to have been stationed with someone helpful. Overall the cons outweigh the pros here for me."
bad,Not a great place to work.  terrible leadership and even worse management.  This company doesn't not have an offering to compete with other telecoms in the Northeast.
bad,"Not good place to work, for a system administrator.  Jobs are being farmed out overseas.  No one is on-time for their job.  No one is held accountable for anything.  There is a great deal of ""It's not my job"" mentality."
bad,"Supervisor will not be present on time and favor one employ over another based on friendship, most interesting role is to coordinate a get together food party"
bad,I always panice when coming in not knowing if i would be fired. It was a sale driven job after them telling us we wouldn't be selling our only job was suppose to be rentention.
bad,"I worked for Communication Solutions LLC, based out of Springfield, MO which is a vendor company to CenturyLink. I was a Small Business Sales/Customer Service Rep. and manager, and both the vendor company and CenturyLink were ran terribly. The commission structure which was the bulk of income at CST (Communication Solutions LLC) constantly changed rarely benefiting the agent. The management was poor. The vendor company was trying to support a dying CenturyLink which isn't possible."
bad,"Overall poor work/life balance, most difficult/complex/understandable compensation plan (never understood how we were going to get paid or when), lack of training and available resources, too many inefficient processes and inadequate tools.  A culture of failure and lack of forward thinking."
bad,The management at Level 3 Communications gave unrealistic demands from their employees. Guidance is often time unclear. I would not recommending working at Level 3.
bad,"Provided the company with a continous great work ethic and always met my metrics. At the end of the year, 2 days before Christmas, the entire company was told we would not be receiving our yearly bonuses. I started working for the company with the belief that my hardwork and dedication would be rewarded with a raise at the end of the year and the entire company wide was sent an email a week after the new year that we would also not be receiving our yearly raise. Having been with the company for a year, I have never received a raise but I was given 2 additional job duties which normally are each handled by another employee and given a promotion to level 2 but no monetary increase. Unsure of the stability of the company"
bad,"No room for advancement, The hardest workers get more work with out the pay to go with the work. would not recommend, AT ALL.  If you want a dead end job this is for you."
bad,It was okay at first things definitely have changed and there is no job security even with the union and seniority. Very little choice in schedule. process always changing
bad,"Steady incoming calls. Difficulty of call ranges depending on customer issue. Mainly, verifying account information and troubleshooting customer's service (voice, internet, TV)"
bad,The culture at CenturyLink is top down.  You are given assigned tasks and are expected to complete them on time.  There is very little information or guidance from the corporate tax manager in Monroe.  All of my guidance is from my supervisor in Denver.  The hardest part of the job is the lack of communication and the disorganized behavior of the director in Monroe.  Information was provided to us very late this year so we had to complete all of our returns in 2 weeks.  We normally have closer to 4 weeks.  The most enjoyable part of the job is my supervisor and my fellow employees.
bad,"They've been in business for a long time and you'd think they'd have it figured out but don't. Emphasis is on sales vs customer service so even if a customer is crying, pleading, begging for assistance you are expected to sell, sell, sell.  If you don't they will fire you.  They also constantly change expectations so you can't hit your numbers and make your commission. There is not job security here at all.  The amount of stress they put their employees under is inhumane.  Of the 24 students in my training class 12 ""graduated"" and there are two who still work for the company."
bad,"A typical work day included prospecting, account management, and setting/attending appointments."
bad,"If you're fine with selling people TV, Internet, Home Phone, and cellular phones, this is the job for you. You work as a consumer sales and service associate, and their motto is ""the sales comes before the service""."
bad,"They made lots of changes that I disagree with, with no option to opt out. The benefits are good, and the pay was okay but the training they give us is terribly lacking."
bad,"nothing to say about centurylink, this job was a call center job and they can be very stressful dealing with upset customers over billing issues and required to sell at the same time"
bad,"Company continues to acquire companies without any real vision as to what it wants to be in the end - first it's all data centers and cloud. Now it's selling off data centers.  Then it's all about being a cable company, now it's abandoning that idea for over-the-top entertainment. Too busy trying to please shareholders, all the while, losing focus on the most important thing it's customers.  With each merger, customer service declined."
bad,"The work day was fairly straight; for an eight hour shift, two breaks and a lunch. Continual time on the phone, helping business customers get their internet working."
bad,CTL was trying to get brand name established in east coast territory - CTL with the purchase of SAVVIS in cloud computing was over paid and CTL continuously put emphasis in new logos to offset purchase price.
bad,"Not a good place to work."
bad,"Didn't learn a lot from this job. Although tried to learn a lot, didn't get a lot of my questions answered and was always frustrasted about not getting the help I needed."
bad,"Policies changed too much, sales goals that are hard to meet, hard to move up, supervisors had favorites, management did not care or listen to issues employees had"
bad,"It was okay. It was a job I needed to move up and a paycheck. I wouldnt expect more then that. Honestly, i didnt like the area in which I was working."
bad,"The building is dirty. Broken and unused equipment is stacked in corners. The management is not good. They don't know enough about the job to be of any real assistance. They like to play favorites and make ridiculous decisions. There are no windows in the building. They run the air conditioner at 68 F, which makes most of the people in there have to wear jackets or even blankets. The pay isn't that bad but the work you do and the people you have to deal with everyday is not worth staying there."
bad,"Management not people oriented, only care about the numbers."
bad,"I split my day working from remedy tickets building and updating applications credentials for about 100 different applications and the other half maintaining mainframe security using RACF. As the company started laying off more and more people, management has been directing less and less security oriented and more towards 'quick and dirty'. Many experienced employees were let go and their job functions and experience have left with no documentation. The main job requirement has been to maintain a proper paper trail to cover yourself."
bad,"Everything we learned was when we hit the call floor. If we had questions about a call, we would wait long periods of time before someone would help us."
bad,"Mostly good people working hard, hampered by upper management. "
bad,"This company has a lot things that require much more work than doing the actual job calls for, you have to contently be aware of your time from each job on top of doing the job..."
bad,"Static business model. Management takes a top down approach without any ideas or discussion coming from employees."
bad,"Part of a large group they hired for new sales acquisition.  After training there was no support.  There was never a local manager in place.  The manager was in another city.  In the short time the sales acquisition position existed, they had gone through 3 managers.  The second manager didn't even know how to use the system, and admitted if you had a question don't ask him because he doesn't know how to use it.  This manager was arrogant, had no integrity, and very disrespectful.  After on of our weekly staff meetings an employee kindly mentioned he didn't appreciate the way the manager spoke to him in meetings.  The managers response was ""so what are you going to do?  Quit?  So the employee in turn, cleaned out his desk and left.  Within 3 months all but 2 sales reps were left in our office; leaving myself and another.  I worked there for 7 months total, and felt it was the most unorganized company, and could no longer bear the verbal abuse from the manager.  3 months after I resigned the last Acquisition Rep was laid off,  with the other 1000 employees.  "
bad,Employees are intimidated to basically do as they are told rather than try to improve or contribute to company long term success.  Most veterans are counting the days to retirement.
bad,was hired as a sales rep but am doing only customer service. Had 3 managers in the short time I have been here. A lot of grey areas when it comes to what is and what is not aloud.
bad,I had a chance to obtain OJT(on the job training) in various areas of telecommunication/data line and device installation and repair.
bad,CenturyLink has far to many systems due to mergers and acquisitions or order entry. They have a poor track record in central Florida with customers who overwhelmingly prefer other providers. the culture at the time I worked there was non-existent. I have kept in touch with a co-worker who says things have improved.
bad,"I started at the end of 2014, and you are supposed to receive training before being put on the phone, however our training room did not have the systems we were suppose to learn. The scenarios we faced were pretty simple fixes, compared to calls I've received. Our training just consisted of us reading the company's intranet wiki pages, no real interaction for the most part just trying to retain info to take quizzes and exams. A typical day - take the first 15 mins at the beginning of your shift to log into your systems. Take calls until first break, get back into queue resume taking calls for another 2.5 - 3hrs until scheduled lunch break. After lunch, time starts to move a bit faster. They have a goal of I believe a 12/13 min calls at the max, so never mind you get a call from an older person who is not too familiar with a modem or how to find something on the pc and it takes you an extra 20 mins to help, that will raise your ""handle"" time, which can be grounds for dismissal if you're not able to lower it. To me it just depends on your luck with which phone calls you get, you have the angry customers who calls in cursing you out and in the end it turns out to be something on their end that's causing them not to connect. They do have an early release tool, which can sometimes come in handy if you are not having a good day, granted its no guarantee you will receive it, depends on how many calls are in the queue. Because if you call out, and use PTO, you'll still receive a occurrence/point. Of course you have supervisors and their favorites, and  a lot of the supervisors aren't"
bad,"good place to work. pros and cons to all jobs, felt like it was a failing company on a sinking ship in Charlotte, Not very well known on eastern coast but well known on west coast.  enjoyed time there while i was there management is ok. Not terrible"
bad,"This is the most mentally challenging jobs I have ever had with very little consistency.  "
bad,"I worked 12 years like Customer Sales & Care Representative in Altamonte Springs, FL.  Once Embarq merge with Centurytel and get the new name Centurylink everything in the company came so bad, higher sales quotas, sometimes they gave mandatory overtime the entire week.  This is a stressfull job where you do not want overtime, just you want to go home and rest. The 90% of the inbound calls are irrate customer calling because the bill came too high and because have charges of services that they never order. "
bad,"Most of the attitudes in the kitchen were very hostile, no team work , and sometimes it was abusive . The hardest part of the job was  lack of teamwork ,,,,, something I always learned was important in a job."
bad,This company operates off of lies! When you see a top sales agent that is constantly being honored for making sales come up on your list of disconnects because they lied to a customer something is wrong! I saw this all too often.
bad,"get a load of snow cones, pop, popcorn and sell them to the fans"
bad,It's a job with decent pay and benefits and the rest is all bad
bad,"Poor training, lack of help, poor schedule....People come and go faster than the days of the week"
bad,If QWEST were to focus more on employee engagement and satisfaction production and performance could improve.
bad,"typical call center environment, Answered all incoming calls addressing the customers need while trying to close a sale. Sold multiple products, aside from century link goods and services. Learned how to truly handle my calls and take control of ever sales opportunity."
bad,This job help in the more 10 years of customer services. it was also I high place workplace. that gave employees the chance to earn extra money on sales.
bad,"I am a former employee, released due to work force reduction, no clue as to why me and never will know. Had excited hopes for changes to management once merger completed between Qwest and CenturyLink. We were seeing value statements that made sense and new terms like Promised Based Management. However, our hopes were eventually dashed. My former location is filled with people looking to leave in any way they can financially afford to do so, not because CenturyLink has poor policies or stated values but because the local management team does not adhere to the stated values and when called on the discrepancy, no actions ever taken. Very poor morale, troubled relationship with union leadership, not a good place to come to day after day."
bad,"This is one of the worst company's i have ever worked for, i wouldnt make a career of it but threw college it was a good fit. The bad side is that they are almost always short staff and can never get a day off unless you give like 2 months notice. Job security here is also really bad you are only as good to them as you are at selling things and keeping customers. The breaks are short and you sometimes might have to skip them to keep up with your ""adherence"" otherwise it throws away your percentile you have to maintain. Most of the time i lied to people and deceived to make sells, thats why i left."
bad,"Working for Qwest was a bit of a scam. They encourage you to take advantage of older customers and sell them products that they don't need. I didn't like their selling practices, and I didn't like being pressured to change my cellphone/cable carrier to them. I had a T-Mobile phone, and I was pressured constantly to switch to Qwest services - which I didn't do."
bad,Centurylink has the ability to be a great place to work. With recent mergers and changes the company as a whole has gotten away from making the customer happy and doing what is needed for the customer to putting the company first. They offer great benefits and Vacation time but often lock down vacation and make it unavailable for use.
bad,"I have never worked for a company that manipulates and uses people like Qwest Communications. I spent fifteen years of my life pursuing a goal that I thought was attainable just to be shot down by a buyout and new management. Cultivating employees was not in the equation, only dog eat dog was available."
bad,"Good place to work as long as you are sales driven. Very much an environment of get a sale no matter what, then worry about the integrity after. The new CEO does not care about customer service/experience, only about increasing revenue."
bad,"Company does not care or consider employees in decision making. My job was relocated to the other side of the country. Our choice was to move or lose our job, even though the job has remote work capabilities and several of us work remotely. This is because some VP's vision ""did not include remote work""."
bad,"If you are working on DSL services then don't expect a promotion or raise; no matter how much effort and work you put in."
bad,Was an okay company didn’t really care about you if you weren’t the best seller. You could be the best with patients but if you didn’t offer them anything that was it
bad,This company was in a difficult transition at the time I was there. I wish them the best. They made a deal with Louisiana to move a lot of people there from other states. This project did not go as planned.
bad,Monday thru Friday was nice. It was not the job for me there. You will need to figure in paying for parking since it is downtown. The people who work there try to keep it fun.
bad,"Whenever you work for a call center its non-stop go-go-go and the issue I consistently had with CenturyLink is they said they care about the customers, but when they are whispering to shove a cell phone/cable sale down their throat when they can barely pay for their internet bill in the first place, its a bit disheartening.  Didn't feel really good about doing that to a sixty plus year old lady.  CenturyLink had some decent benefits and told you to go home and there was no overtime, a lot but for constantly pushing us and telling us to get on the phones for a full eight hours without having that breath of fresh air it was a terrible place to work."
bad,"There are To many layoffs, every 6 months another layoff.  They plan on closing Gardner facility based on what news said so not sure I would want to start with them."
bad,Once level 3 took over conditions declined rapidly. The unifying principles seemed to be forgotten.  When the RIF was announced we were told we had 14 days to decide. That changed to 7. Then the following week what we had been told was going to happen changed dramatically and there was no option to change your mind.
bad,Would not recommend this job due to relocation tactics.  No job security. CEO is ran by Qwest CEO and company has gone down hill ever since Glen Post sold company.
bad,"Serves as a good starting point to build skills but career advancement is horrible, the culture can be a little toxic and way to competitive, salary is not enough and customer service is difficult"
bad,Was continually frustrating due to changes that were not thought out causing increased times for services. Increased use of applications on smartphones added to the already dismal response rates for technicians.
bad,This company is not the same following the acquisition of Level 3. The level of internal expertise relative to professional services is not professional and the constant churn of people and organizational entities is staggering.
bad,"So Stressful, they will always find something wrong. No matter how much u do right, they will nit pick, your work to death, even as simple as making a copy and sending it to the printer,  It all depends on the supervisor, and It will change emmensely.  So do not expet consistancy.  "
bad,Too many changes since their last merger when they still haven’t caught up from the prior merger. Product line is extremely difficult to position to customers due to a number of internal systems that do not match up with what’s in the field.
bad,"The company has ""merged"" with Level 3.  Centurylink was supposedly the bigger company but in the last year, the management has been replaced by Level 3 executives.  Becoming more and more micro-managed.  They use their ""employee expectations"" against their employees whenever they see fit."
bad,"Responsible for cold calling and prospecting, both on the phone and face-to-face, in a high activity sales model within the assigned territory. Training was not very oriented to my job functions."
bad,"Not employed i am contracted (I am trying to complete your survey but I don't work here as a full time employee, your site should ask if employed permanently or contracted so this field should not be required."
bad,"If you can handle the back stabbing in some departments and the family atmosphere in the others, this is the place for you. I worked with every department on the campus fixing everything from HVAC to power. Most think the maintenance guys are a bunch of idiots but had no clue what our job entailed, but yet were either quick to judge or tell us how to do it. I never pretended to do their jobs so why are you telling me how to do mine? "
bad,"The company is always changing its sales and customer service departments in some way, shape, or form.  FYI... closing all of your retail outlets and relying solely on call center operations does not help calm down already angry customers.  Plus, there's no cross-training. so there's no means for a sales/service rep to transition into a long-term and rewarding technical or engineering role."
bad,"Good work, but the company and management cant seem to get out of their own way.  The dysfunction trickles down from the top.  Management usually has no true understanding of the work in most cases."
bad,There are far too many calls taking place which don't allow one to actually work.  Extremely stressful place to work.  Management micro manages and doesn't allow it's employees to take action and/or think for themselves.
bad,Sales quota would increase but calls were not. Incentives were inreachable. Had to purchase own equipment and pay for phone and Internet as well. When I started two years ago they were firing everyone and starting over along with upper management. Since then a lot of changes and policies changes. No training or guidance to learn new policies or systems until they listened to call then coach you on it.
bad,"CenturyLink is very metric focused with plenty of negative consequences. "
bad,"Typical Day - Worked 8 hours in a DSL test lab and/or at home."
bad,"Bad upper management, Poor planning for the future, Manages manage numbers not people. Industry standard culture ""Just wait a week, it will change."""""""
bad,I have nothing that I wish to share about centurylink. It was a stressful job with no room for advancement. There is really nothing more to say about this.
bad,"This is a large company that is so far behind the times it is not even funny. The office computers are 7+ years old based on the processors used. They were still using single monitor desktops when everyone else moved onto dual monitor systems. The server went down almost daily while trying to make sales. Even when running everything was soo S-L-O-W. I worked in the Phoenix, AZ office and there is no free parking. You actually have to pay to use the parking garage or pay to be across the street in an uncovered lot. You would think they would provide free services to employees (internet, tv and or phone) like all three of the cable companies I have worked for, but not so at CenturyLink! Yes, there is opportunity for advancement but why you want to settle when you can find so many better opportunities just about anywhere! This was the worst place of employment I have EVER had! I survived 5 months here before I just couldn't take it anymore and found another job and moved on.If you see a posting for this company you should move on to the next company and save yourself the headache."
bad,Children and family came second in the century Link corporations perspective which is hard when your a single mother of two. Retention also was an obstacle due to the company's inability to do all that it promised and to add a required sales on to saving a client made it a difficult job I overcame but found it to be unrealistic requirements and poor training to staff
bad,They waited to long to address problems in the field as well as rolling out Fiber. Poorly run company and now hard working techs like me will pay for it while upper management gets a pass and a big fat bonus.
bad,No work life balance with CenturyLink. Attendance is on a pointed system which doesn't really allow the hard workers to take time off sick if they need it.
bad,The job has enough stressors but now they are moving the work to another state.  The managers don't have idea of how much training and skill set needed for the job are necessary and think they can get the new location up and working within 3 months.  Several employees have been at this job for over 7 years and still learning and running into new situations.  The company offers good benefits but did not take into consideration the skills and length of service several employees have in this department.  The culture continues to change to look at the employee more as a number and not a person and contributor to the culture and job.
bad,The company is gear more towards rewarding their investor instead of there customers and their technician. Management are constantly putting out changes which seem to constantly increase work load on the technician.
bad,"Unstable work environment. Lack of organization. Expectations often changed. My time at this company was during a period of uncertainty, as there were many organizational shifts, culminating in a merger that resulted in a complete restructuring. But the benefits were good."
bad,"Your peers are typically good people, though the management structure does not have the technical expertise required to effectively implement projects."
bad,"CenturyLink is the same as any other place in Telecom."
bad,Never knew if I would be finishing the job I started because the boss would move the work around depending on the technicians experience.  Not all technicians were trained in all aspects of the job which was very frustrating depending on who you were paired up with that day.  The  best part about the job was the ability to get time off with short notice if needed.
bad,"Did not receive adequate retraining to perform job functions, which caused frustration. Incoming call wait time grew to 90 minutes, causing tension with some callers. Got along well with coworkers. Disappointed that opportunity did not last, but I knew going in the position was temporary."
bad,Each day is fast-paced.  I learned to multitask. Management not always available to assist you with questions.  The diversity of the groups is good but sometimes the management has favorites and I believe that is not acceptable.  I feel everyone should be treated fairly.  the hardest part was getting the sales and overcoming the objections from the consumers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is winning all the spiff prizes for being the top sales person for the week/month.
bad,"This job was for the billing department. People called to pay their cable/phone bills. Management was terrible about making you ask people to upgrade their stuff. I am not a sales person, I took the job because I can do billing."
bad,"Centurylink has potential to be the leading internet, phone and cable service provider but lacks the vision and leadership to take them to the next level."
bad,"Ambiguous and vague downward driven efforts given to engineering teams.  Resourcing of teams is leaner than lean, resourcing doesn't even come close to meeting required numbers to be successful."
bad,"high volume of calls"
bad,this was my first call center job and I love it other than the management. They micromanaged and definately had their favorites. Nothing was black and white it all depended on who you were.
bad,"Small tasks throughout the day, all of them have specified times in which they must be completed."
bad,"Once you sell services, you will spend a disproportionate amount of  time trying to keep it on track with all of the many, many people behind the scenes. Very simple routine services frequently get derailed and expectations set to you, then from you to the customer are frequently missed. Be prepared for everything to blow up and you need to keep it afloat."
bad,This was by far the worst job I ever worked for. My boss was a straight up a** hole and her manager was even worse. All the 15 year vets were miserable and only stayed because they were making great money. I would never recommend this job to anyone.
bad,I was able to pick my own hours and enjoyed it. My boss was easy to get a hold of when I needed assistance. My coworkers were good help and it was a friendly environment. I enjoyed the customers as well.
bad,"Frustration is key  on a typical day with the company. all the  rules and policies chang quite frequently. I learned much for the time I was there,but the compensation pay for this job title is for a college grad,not for experienced techs in the industry. Management only cares for the welfare of the staff. My co-workers are the best,and I envy them. everybody has the same experience and challenges that face them on daily basis and they show frustration everytime issues occur from all the way from time order placed to deployment of the services. I can't find any enjoyment moments with the job,all I can say is that their is free breakfast weekly in the local offices"
bad,"I don't appreciate the ""sell, sell, sell"" aspect of the Sales/Service Associate job.  There were several times I was required to try to sell, up sell or suggestive sell a product that I knew the customer couldn't afford and that didn't sit well with me."
bad,"The culture was fantastic along with the people.  Team Managers were VERY unprofessional!!  No ability to move up on the promotion ladder.  And once they role out a new procedure, they contradict themselves a breath later.  I would not recommend the job, it's a dead end."
bad,"I worked with a great team."
bad,Stressful call center environment. Little emphasis on proper technical training with customers and customer related telecommunications troubles. Multiple applications provided with liitle or no training on how to navigate through them.  Bonus and pay advance was very restricted.
bad,Pushed to sell products that could not be deployed. Threatened job security monthly. Successful rep found ways to steal deals and trick internal systems to appear to hit their numbers.
bad,"Back in 2007 was attempting to change business model to be centered around business value.  That direction fell to the side quickly and was replaced by cold calling, close it now attitude."
bad,I feel like a company as big as this should treat both their customers and employees a little better than they do. I would never recommend to anyone to either work here or buy their services. The only thing that is currently keeping me here is the fact that the health benefits are pretty good while Im looking for another job. I can't get out of this place fast enough.
bad,"Working for the Contract Inspector was one of my favorite jobs.  Stayed super busy, always a new challenge.  Manager was supportive, on going training on the job.  Supported splicing manager as well as line crew manager.  Management and co-workers were fabulous to work with."
bad,I learned a wealth of information working for Qwest Communications.
bad,"Being a part of Network meant you were on the clock 24/7."
bad,"Demanding to meet stretch goals regardless of impacts to work/life balance with lip service to manage time. i.e. get multiple 3 week long tasks done in one week but be sure to take some time."
bad,"*Not a Better Place for Employee Growth"
bad,good co workers fun environment but not a company with reasonable standards or a desire to help improve existing employees
bad,"There was not much to learn, but I did create a training manual for my group. Management was okay.  My co-workers seem to be friendly.  The hard part of my job was getting use to the attitudes.  Was going home for the day."
bad,"If you've ever worked at a call center, you've got a pretty good idea what it was like. Offer on every call (most of which were angry customers upset over a legitimate billing issue). The place has potential, and some perks too, but overall I don't think I could ever work there again due to an utter allergy to the stress it caused me."
bad,After being with Century Link/Embarq/Sprint for the past fifteen years I have learned many things. Gaining experience from new and old employees which have come and gone.
bad,"...but considering the pick for this town, it is the best I could do. I would never recommend anyone to work for this company"
bad,The Trainers and Management are extremely careless and tend to be verbally abusive.
bad,Don't respect employees and the morale in the company is negative. The management team will quickly point out something negative rather than congratulate something positive.
bad,"Walking on egg shells about what dumb unimportant thing they will decide to hold against you while not ever giving you credit for the outstanding work you do otherwise. Due to being union based pay rates are high, but the good benefits get more expensive every year and everything is seniority based so the the poor quality tech who has been with the company forever, but refuses to learn new tech will keep his job while you get let go even though you are better trained and consistently produce higher quality results."
bad,"The company was a great company, but now, operational decisions are based solely on revenue and not employee loyalty and experience. I have worked here for 5 years."
bad,Management is good but you are handcuffed and limited on how far you go unless you work there for years. Great pay and benefits. High pressure with little chance to actually be yourself and succeed.
bad,"Century link tends to trick the customers into thinking the problems they may have will change in a month or two.  But, in reality, their bills will go up,  they will have to add more services for the bill to go down. Older adults have no idea they have wi-fi, but the bill reflects it.  Most of them pay the bill, because they don't want to have bad credit, or loss the only services, phone they have."
bad,"Their a very strict place to work for as far as their written procedures. Isn’t much room for creativity or flexibility in the daily job. There isn’t much time for even replying to emails. Most places encourage finding solutions, focus on the customer, aren’t so by the book and want happy employees. I like their attendence flex options for attendance. The management doesn’t move on like in several other telecommunications places probably due to wages and benefits, Which is a major setback as far as career growth, there isn’t much new incentives for employees other than health perks. The benefits of a pension and a union shop are sadly holding this place together. IMO, There’s too much work to be done. I was hired for Internet, after they threw on phone and Prism tv. This is way too much to focus on for one person as a result many people have left the job. I love to work in technology and believe that a workplace should be fun, exciting and employees should want to be there every single day. I love resolving problems with technology though Centurylink has a long way to go to be a leader in the Omaha help desk job market."
bad,"high stress, micromanagement, do more faster with fewer resources."
bad,It was a great company to work for but has seen a steady decline in workforce and very high attrition rates due to unhappy employees and unrealistic goals
bad,Lots of churn. The company is trying to transition from an old telecom company to a new technology company but has a lot of baggage to get rid of. Hard to tell if it will succeed in doing so.
bad,The work more with less montra is the way it goes with LEVEL3 now park of CenturyLink. It go go go with alot of yes men at the management level. The job culture is at two different levels from the eyes of technicians and management at this time.
bad,"Leadership in Salt Lake City is fantastic....upper management at HQ (since the company merger) is lacking.  Salary is better than average for Utah, commission structure is confusing on how, and what is payed out to employees."
bad,"CenturyLink is a great company if you want to take 2 years to build your resume; however, it is not a sustainable career company. With the new regime, they hold lay offs regularly. The over all company morale is quite low. "
bad,"Attitudes include ""not my job"", very little communication or cooperation between departments. Not a customer focused company. company with a cost reduction plan and not a growth plan."
bad,"In the beginning, it was a fun company.  We were building a telephone company and everyone was appreciated and rewarded.  As CenturyLink grew and grew, managements mindset and attitude changed.  After it was bought by Level Three and the layoffs began, morale began to start dropping.  When I was RIFF'ed in May of 2018 the morale was at an all-time low.  I was very sad to see a company that we had been building for the past 20 years to become totally destroyed."
bad,I do not care to provide a review of a company that threatens to lay off employees every 12 months. The company is not moving in the right direction and the acquired company (Level 3) is running the show now.
bad,management was very lacking.  DIY training online that did not help when you got on the sales floor.  Not a friendly work environment and very little opportunity to move up from the retail store sales position.
bad,"wonderful coworkers,wonderful co-workers,  little to no support from management to provide proper tools to do job. technicians not appreciated, sales gets all the perks."
bad,"Worked with customers and potential customers to use technology to help improve the bottom line. I learn new things daily and enjoy learning. The hardest part was to get support teams to move quickly for the customer needs.  I enjoy working with customers and helping them with their issues, using the company's product and service offerings."
bad,This is ridiculous I am not going to bad mouth a company I am currently working for. Making the review mandatory is not right. If a person does not want to leave a review then they shouldn't have to.
bad,"Job is ok, very fast paced and could be very stressful on your mental. A good entry level job to start off with but would not recommend as a career path."
bad,"Working for CenturyLink was not what I thought it would be. It is stressful and unfair and the managers or ""Supervisors"" were not very helpful. Just not a very good work environment"
bad,"Was a good job while it lasted but I was let go as part of a RIF.  Thought I was safe.  Other no-so-productive people should have been let go.  Typical large company with good and bad points.  A lot of opportunities and good pay but also some bureaucratic waste and politics.  Overall, I was thankful for the opportunity to work there but it's over now.  Changes now going on within the company makes me wonder if I would want to be re-hired."
bad,"If you like sales and blindsiding people who just called in to ask a question, you'll love this job.  The training program was phenomenal, like 14 weeks long.  After that, goes downhill pretty quickly."
bad,"A typical day centered around the 6-12 applications that I supported as point of contact or as backup.  I would have 3-5 meetings and around 50+ e-mail to sift through.  On a good day, I could carve out 4 hours of focused work."
bad,"If your goal is to develop positive relationships with customers (so as to become their trusted advisor), do NOT take this job.  It is dang near impossible to help your customers quickly and effectively due to all the red tape you have to cut through.  Your support staff is very reluctant to help you and, more importantly, the customer, out with problems that arise.  Additionally, you will have to constantly fight an uphill battle with other vendors because, in this business, price is everything and CenturyLink is one of the most expensive providers of voice/data services.  This is assuming, of course, that you can actually deliver services to a particular location (which is not always the case).  Sometimes, you'll be able to deliver services, get the customer to sign the contract, and then you'll be informed that there is additional costs for the installation (which, of course, you now have to inform the customer of and get their buy-in on the new costs).  Finally, you will have to deal with other reps. continually trying to sell things to your customers even though they're technically not allowed to."
bad,The managers made this a bad experience for me.  I learned a lot from the Sr. Engineers and I was able to choose the shift work but I did not like how the team of Ops Techs were micro-managed. The supervisors and managers didn't seem to trust the employees.
bad,"Poorly managed acquisitions that cause multiple issues across multi networks, forced merger of operational procedure, sales operations policy overrides logic, product offerings not consistently offered in all markets, competitive products not offered in legacy markets, customers are unhappy...."
bad,"For me a typical workday is all about meetings.  There are so many meetings that include, 1 on 1's with your team, your Manager, your eco-system, overlays, training etc.  It appears that there are meetings just to have meetings.  Workplace culture is improving, but the % of attainment within the region is declining.  Less than 50% of the 47 reps have  achieved 100% of their goals.  Moral is bad since no one is making money.  New Management has been helpful, but it takes a long time to turn that ship around.  The hardest part of the job is getting appointments to get in front of the Clients in addition to explaining to existing clients why they have experienced an outage of service.  The most enjoyable part of the job to me is to meet our clients.  Going on meetings to assist the team in obtaining more information in order to offer solutions that always benefit both the client and CenturyLink."
bad,"Worked in customer service center in monroe, LA. Not enough ppl employed so others were expected to pick up the slack. Not much done for morale of employees. Pay was low. They expected employees to come in during floods and ice storms."
bad,"Workplace culture is focused on the bottom line, how much do you cost the company as an employee and how can they eliminate that cost.  The local management are great to work with, but the company sees you as an employee as a number on a spreadsheet."
bad,Years of acquisitions and changes have led to a chaotic work environment and a business that still has much work to get things right.  I had 9 years with the company working both in HR and on the Labor side.  Centurylink acquired Qwest and the transition was difficult.  Two years post acquisition I made the decision to leave the company and moved to Level 3.  One year after being at Level 3 - it was announced that Centurylink would acquire Level 3.  I took a package as I had no desire to return to Centurylink.
bad,"we have now been able to work at home.  sales quotas are non attainable.  good benefits if you reach your goals, but i have not been able to. it rocks to work at home, don't have the commute."
bad,I would go in and take calls for new service. It was hard to get bonuses or a commission pay out. I did enjoy working there and i also did learn a lot.
bad,"Not the right place for me, I have a college degree doing a job anyone can do. No challenge. Held back. Not allowed to learn more than the scope of my job. Very poor pay even for entry level position. Unable to post out for better job. Corporate politics and networking required to get a decent paying job there."
bad,far location needed two buses to get there. good benefits pay was good at the time. decent people around but they expected too much from us. over all decent experience.
bad,"My bosses continually changed their roles, I've never met half of them in person."
bad,"When I started this job in 1979, it was a job that you knew you would retire from. They used to compensate employees with luncheons or parties, and as the years went by, everything went away. Towards the end, it was a non caring company to work for. They would take to many repairs for the day for the technicians, and have them out working until midnight. I would not want any repair person coming to my house past 8 pm. Since Century Link has bought them, everything we went out on strike for and fought for has almost all gone away. No raises ever for retirees pensions. Insurance used to be free and now it is over $400.00 a month per person for retirees."
bad,"Hire skilled training instructors and Supervisor that want a great team not show for a check. Administrator should know what she is doing,not guessing"
bad,"Update Reports verify any device not available 100% in the last 24 hrs. Update tech schedule,  Access queue and update Break/Fix tickets and close out MACs.  Provide daily direction to the NOC."
bad,Management is horrible and mean spirited the merger is showing the worst in everyone. Few people will be getting a fair shake after day one combined new company
bad,I was a regional top performer whose job was terminated after a company real estate deal didn't work out. I thought it was really unfair that many employees who had worked there for over 20 years lost their jobs and their retirement because the company's attempt to sell the Bell Plaza Tower was mishandled.
bad,Company policy on additional responsibilities with no pay increase minimal training and responsibilities aren't shared across the board also lots of micromanaging with still very little instruction
bad,great people but not a great vision.  instead of implementing a long term strategic plan they're falling back to a transactional philosophy.  there have been a lot of extremely experienced people forced out by changing agenda.
bad,Current M&A has made the work environment unstable and unpredictable.  New leadership will be in place after the acquisition and the sales units are interviewing for their own jobs.
bad,"working at century link was ok at first , after a year they constantly change the metrics , making impossible to make commission ethically , good pay , very stressful environment and management is bad depending on who you  have. work here until you find something better."
bad,Level 3 is a great company but it is not ran properly. Over worked and under paid. No matter hard well you do they always tell you how bad you failed.
bad,"This place was pretty great to work with when I first started.  Long story short, I worked for this place off and on for many  years.  The culture was way to profit oriented than customer oriented and just got worse over time."
bad,"And torn apart by myopic decision making VP down. CenturyLink provides reasonable starting wage, industry leading benefits package, and expectations that will never come to fruition."
bad,Great company that works around around family needs. Upward growth encouraged. Good benefits. Job security is less than average.  Future of company is uncertain due to lack of leadership.
bad,"This was one of the worst jobs i have had. Boss was not respectful to most of the employees, some of them he bent over to help out and others he pushed down when ever he could."
bad,This job is very much a call center job. The pay is very middle of the road. The typical workday consists of coming in and sitting at your desk in front of a screen and helping as many customers as possible during your shift.
bad,You are very disposable at this company. There is 6 weeks training. A lot of what you will need to know your are expected to learn on the job. You are monitored on your calls and your score really depends upon who is grading you.
bad,"On a typical day an employee with Centurylink (CTL) will be somewhat stressful.  There are processes embedded in processes.  Employees work together to get customer circuits built, but sometimes it is frustrating due to the number of processes, applications and groups needed to complete a task. My co-workers are the only reason I work so hard to get my jobs completed.  They make the days fun and tolerable.  The hardest part about working at CTL is convincing management to release money needed to build the network proactively and explaining the network designs to management.  Managers do not always understand the rolls and responsibilities of their employees.  Alot of co-workers aren't sure if management knows what direction CTL is moving in.  I have learned alot about the ISP culture.  Co-workers are considered family.  You aren't just a number to other employees."
bad,"I am a Contractor in the Finance department and I can say that Level 3 is a very difficult company to work for. The training is lacking and not designed to give employees the tools to succeed. With all the network and company acquisitions the work is very chaotic and ambiguous (multiple ways to do one thing). Management is very clicky and they seem to insulate themselves from everyone else while employees are regularly RIF'd (reduction in force). Overall, I wish I would have accepted other job offers instead of contracting with Level 3, but I have no regrets."
bad,"Century Link was an awesome place to work, recently they are unwilling to take the steps to help the customers that have been misled or lied to about price and the services they are receiving. Most of the management is great. They are a company more focused on selling products then training they're reps to do the job correctly. they're union is a joke."
bad,"Leadership likes to talk about their Christian values but are not capable of walking the walk."
bad,Great if you integrated from another company. Very good benfits. No work life balance especially if you are on call. You can be gone a full 24 hours and they still expect you to be at work bright an early the next work day.
bad,The culture has never recovered from the merger of US West and Qwest and then CenturyLink. Senior executives are out of touch with what is really going on. They say we are one company but there are still so many silos it makes it impossible to get real work done.
bad,"The typical day at work was repetitive. I learned how to better deal with irate people. The management was circular. No one here can take responsibility for any type of issue. The co-worker were cool, but never stuck around for long. The hardest part of this job is getting issues resolved without having to go through hoops. The most enjoyable part of this job is when I am actually able to get a customers issue resolved."
bad,Management is good but the processes make your job hard to learn and be able to complete what you are promising to your customer.
bad,"Positive: The people that work there are fantastic, everyone is very supportive. People will try to help you in whatever way they can but because the training is not very expansive, everyone has conflicting knowledge. I love having the freedom to make my own schedule with appointments and getting an iPhone, iPad, and laptop."
bad,"Did not meet my expectations, then. Its been very long time, since I worked here. The company has been acquired by or merged with company called Century Link."
bad,Very low pay. Monitored every step of the way. Given no time to take care of personal or family matters. Working hours can be a problem.
bad,"Provision, install, turn-up and maintain voice and data networks."
bad,what the company does best is micro manage. way to many levels of management and every on has to justify there jobs. No room for advancement. No acknowledgement of your skills. Unreasonable demands. Indecisive management.
bad,"Been through a lot of changes at this company. My cheese has been moved immensely. From the changing of the guard, to being on a different team every month. you name it.....I experienced it. It's time to move on. This is a company that needs to get real. However I'm not going to stick around to see if they figure it out. Arrivederci! Century Link or who ever you will be in a few years."
bad,"After CL took over savvis, good people are leaving."
bad,There were no opportunities to advance in this company and this company always make their employees fear for their jobs.  I learned how to multitask and offer sales.
bad,A typical day at work is very fast paced you always have something to do. I learned a lot about sales. The management I think needs a lot of work. However I loved my co-workers they all made my day at work go by better. The hardest part of my job was keeping up with the consistent changes and changes specifically in sales goals and related agendas. I enjoyed the people that worked with and the constant challenge of my job the most.
bad,"benefits are good while the moral of the company’s expansion is not. It was not a good fit for me as I have higher morals than to sell products to people who do not need or do not want, then feel good about myself when i went home."
bad,"log in to 7 different systems, phone is monitored as your time clock,Can not be 6 min late from break,logging in,or personal break during the day. If you go over 6 minutes you acquire a days vacation removed from you. Can be made up by working overtime only. Co-workers are on the chat screen all day long and share issues and help each other solve questions in regards to service calls. The hardest part of the job is listening to customer after customer who are upset. Get yelled at,cussed,called names, and is a very hard job to stay focussed on promoting this company."
bad,I was able to bring a new focus to a large telecommunications company (e-learning) at a time when it was just starting to become a new area of learning.
bad,"The job is for someone that is extremely sales driven.  If you can't sell or meet sales goals, then it's adios amigo! They set unrealistic expectations for average handle time, and you are micromanaged to death.  The pay is good, and you can make good money with sales if It is something you enjoy doing."
bad,"In my experience, starting out as a ""Retention Speacialist"" and then later becoming a ""NOHD Support"" member is this:"
bad,"It is an OK  company to work at.  Pays well, but there are no perks at all.  When you are at work, you work 100% of the time.  As with all companies, they have some really bad managers and the bad ones are allowed to stay."
bad,It used to be a lot more fun and they cared about their employees. Now it’s just about numbers. They have their favorites in the department. Its boring
bad,Very laboring but fun! The work got slightly gross but it was a good experience getting comfortable in the food industry. I worked 5 hour shifts on my feet the whole time.
bad,"I worked at CenturyLink full-time for a year"
bad,If you're not meeting your sales goals by 30 minutes into the hour your boss is instant messaging you and talking across the room teling you to sell and upgrade this many of each product by the end of the hour all day. Within 6 mos If you don't meet your sales quotas 1/6 mos verbal warning. 2/6 mos written up 3/6 mos fired no matter your tenure. Very stressful every day no job security.
bad,"The market has been shrinking, so they put very high expectations on employees. You learn lots of valuable skills, but you need to move to Monroe LA, if you want a career here."
bad,No raises after my 1st 2 years and none insight for the foreseeable future. No room for advancement at all. Culture as far as who decides what to do with unused equipment was horrible.
bad,Continuous layoffs. Poor management. Poor internal systems to perform your daily tasks. Still using mainframes.  HR has too much power and really not knowing what they are doing.
bad,Treats employees unfairly and constructs them with time limits to do the job.  Helping customers is key and the time constraints are unreasonable to get the job completed.
bad,"This Company is very customer oriented while performing at a technical level, this represents a challenge when you are having to explain to small business owners tech lingo. "
bad,The atmosphere generated by senior management is not conducive to a productive work environment. The various departments that must work together to meet client needs do not communicate and make it very difficult to meet customer requirements within timelines.
bad,"Poor management has ruined this company and will destroy its future.  Working 50-70 hours a week during summer time in 110+ heat is overwhelming, but that is not what makes it undesirable.  It's the lack of effort from management to provide the technician what they need to perform their jobs to serve the customer properly.  Not only that, they give you no time to recover after a long installation and expect you to perform a certain amount of work within the given day.  Management is notorious for not having answers for anything and provide misleading information as to the current process and procedures of certain material that needs to be done.  You are playing a guessing game and if you make a bad call or mistake, they will investigate you and do anything they can to pin something on you.  They are not their for you and provide zero support if it comes down to a customer confrontation.  You are a lawyer first, technician last with this company.  Despite the negative there is some positive.  Good pay and benefits and a good amount off PTO once you have invested time into the company.  Management wasn't always that bad, but has progressed to something worse over the years and it is rapidly declining. Technicians (peers) are what keep you afloat, most of them will help you if you are in need of it and have great knowledge of their respective positions at the company."
bad,"They expect you to sell products to customers who usually don’t want anything else. If you’re not good at sales , I’d recommend a different position. They get upset if you don’t make enough sales."
bad,"The overall job experience was fine. I got along well with all of my co-workers as well as my supervisor. When I had a medical problem (that they were aware of), and my youngest son got killed, they asked me resign."
bad,"When I began with this company before it became Centurylink job security was stable.  Once Centurylink acquired the company, job security was extremely insecure.  If one has a stable position it can be a good company to work for."
bad,Although this position was in line with my knowledge of network provisioning; the skill level was not.  The position did not have advancement opportunities and I was restricted to what I could do for the customer.
bad,"CTL is a great place to work at, depends what department you are in. "
bad,In my earlier tenure with Centurylink it was a very progressive and productive time for the company and the employees. The company offered a great caring and family environment. Promotions came from within. You were commended for a job well done. Through the years the company became a hostile place to be. We were unable to go to other departments or do anything to save our positions in the department. Packages that could have been offered were not.
bad,"Customers call in usually with a problem or concern. Call script and try to sell products to those customers. Overcome objections and show value of the products. If they want to buy, they will. If not, on to the next call. Numbers game, try to get as many calls as you can."
bad,Some of the platforms were still on DOS. Two phone companies in one was a real challenge when porting lines.  Managers sat in office a lot no really helpful.
bad,"This company does a 180 from what would be good for the customers."
bad,"it is a great company to work for but they are super strict about even being a minute late coming back from back from a break. They want you back at your desk the minute you are supposed to be back their they are very strict about this, and they will fire you if you are late. they do not care if you are always on time at work or if you stay later or skip your lunch to make up the few minutes you are late."
bad,"When I worked there I had a saying that sums it up,  ""Constant change is not a direction.""  Upper management seems to shift around every couple years and all the initiatives shift with them so its like we get half way there and change directions.  The old troubles resurface after a bit and the new boss will come up with a new plan for the one we abandoned from his predecessor."
bad,"Fast paced work not for people looking to do nothing and get paid, unfortunately they don't care to much about their people. I was laid off after 18 years due to force reduction."
bad,"CenturyLink can't decide what they want to be when they grow up.  They purchased several businesses only to not have a good strategic vision of what they wanted to do with the company.  They didn't invest in their people for training, nor did they invest in the companies that they purchased and ended up selling them off or letting that segment of the business fail."
bad,Work force reductions are out of control due to lack of foresight.  Outsourcing and contractors will become the new standard as CenturyLink continues merging with Level3.
bad,"Lots of phone calls, not of a lot of on the job training. Management knows what to do but don't know how to explain it. Culture was decent, but needs more communication."
bad,Sales teams were actively competing against each other with little senior manager oversight.  Culture was negative and cutthroat with no loyalty.  High turn over
bad,"Before this company was CenturyLink Communications, it was Qwest Communications."
bad,"Has potential to be a great place to work.  When a new team is formed, there needs to be better support structure though, rather than the chaos that has ensued  in St. Louis"
bad,"The Help desk team is a great group of people."
bad,"Get into work and start taking calls from customers. Did not have any power to help customers with their issues. Was told it was just going to be customer service, not have to up-sell any of the people we spoke to but were judged on how much we did up-sell. Products were not available in areas we were told to up-sell in. Management was excellent, but their hands were tied when it came to helping their teams."
bad,Good pay but very shady work environment. Got more life experience than work experience. Not as much opportunity for advancement as the company claims
bad,Turn over was high in the sales division.  The turnover rate was running 105% to 115% annually. We were union and the rules stated you had to meet you quarterly goal or you would be let go.  New employees remain only about six months.  I was an experience employee and was able to keep my position.
bad,Centurylink is a good company but has a lot of changes to make in the retention department. More uptraining and less on sells.
bad,"Attendance is very strict, flexibility is not a thing in this position and it is very hard to juggle if you have children. I will honestly say the hardest part of this job is attendance"
bad,"I was hired for one role and then after 3 weeks because the solutions I was hired for were still in development."
bad,"Good team, upper management unwilling to listen to experience."
bad,Call after call. You have to use the repair wiki in order to answer your customers questions. Trained me for only a week and threw me out to the dogs when it came to taking calls. I asked for help and only got to watch a guy take phone calls for an hour...employees are poorly trained.
bad,Stressful but good pay if you can make it. Union environment CWA to it is a good and bad thing. Management does not care about you just your numbers.
bad,"The people seem nice and easy going. The atmosphere was pleasant. The pay was decent. There was even talk of advancement and great promise about the future. Then the budget was cut, and without warning it all ended. None of the three people above me came down to tell me. Instead, they relied on the contractor to tell me."
bad,"Very monotonous. Very little breaks. "
bad,Great supervisors but to many seperations in departments. No team work between co-workers everyone is just for themselves. Contractors have a hard time being hired on permanently.
bad,Centurylink is based in Monroe LA.  Lowly moved work to different states to pay a  lower wages. lost a lot of hard workers for 1/2 the pay workers who are not a well trained in customer service
bad,"Good management and co-workers."
bad,"This job was by far the best job I have had, just no job security."
bad,"There is no other activity goes other then work , all is required is as much work as possible from you. remote working option is possible but again it depends upon your manager and location you work. The Management is not good at all , there is lot of gap between upper management and lower management due to lot of mergers and different locations."
bad,A typical day at Qwest involved inbound calls all day everyday with hardly any interaction with peers due to high call volume. The best part of
bad,"You had to mostly solve all problems on your own, the managers and supervisors didn't know much about helping you. I learned a great deal about computers, programs, etc that I could use in other careers. Trying to remain happy everyday when every customer who is calling in already hates you and the company. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and when you were able to help a customer and make them happy even though most of the problems were already out of your hands."
bad,You have quatas to meet that are not always realistic.  It is about high pressure sales.  Many people that work there are not ethical and have been know to add items to customers accounts that they did not order or ask for.  Why so they can make and extra dollar and meet quota.
bad,No central accounting system made financial jobs extremely painful and more room for error.
bad,"Sales is the only part of the job of any importance. I am not a great salesman but during my employment period, even if it was barely, i met all the sales goals, all the call stat goals, and only missed 3 days due to strep throat, never lied to, swindled, or fibbed to a single customer. Must be why i didn't fit in and was bullied out. I found myself in a managerial meeting 2-3 times a week for miniscule reasons such as forgetting to recap a change a customer requested unsolicited, not offering 1 of 8 products on one call. Meanwhile three of your team mates forget to mention the 2 year contracts the caller just agreed to or purposely transferred the call to the wrong department since the caller didn't contribute to their sales for the day. Worst job i ever had, only the 2nd i have ever quit."
bad,"Great benefits day one, Strict with sales if you don't meet goals you are fired. Was a place that you could move up if you wanted to."
bad,I received no real training for the 3 years that I was with the company. Every employee that works here basically just did the job different. Every employee has a different way to use the programs.
bad,"This was a really difficult place to work.  I spent more than 50% of my time just figuring out how to get paid and then actually ""getting"" paid.  Not once was my commission ever correct and when I left they owed me more than $20K in earned commission.  Managers were promoted because they were good sales people, not because they had great manager skills.  There were senior managers that really had no business being in management."
bad,"I worked in the telecommunications field for many years. The work, my co-workers, and my immediate supervisor were typically great (there are always exceptions). The upper management after CTL took over talked a good game but, that's it. Compared to the other large telecom companies, CTL is not that great."
bad,"Worked 40 hours a week plus mandatory overtime of 2 hours everyday. This went on for months and months and at points, close to a full year."
bad,"Management was just horrible to their employees. Disrespect. Yelling at agents allowing the bullying to go on, And the HR lady was a racist and condescending to certain agents"
bad,"It has it's fun moments, but with downsizing it leaves those who are left to pick up the work from the cut departments. Don't expect to have it easy, you'll be working you butt off every day. Expect to be stressed a *lot* and to have management hold you to almost unreachable standards. Also, if you do your own job quickly, you get to do someone else's for them."
bad,Management was pretty good to work for. Little to no chance for advancement. As a contractor I was given the impression that full time hire was a lock after 6 months. I was there a little over a year and it never happened.
bad,Job description is very misleading. You are working at a call center and given unrealistic sales goals along with supervisors that do not possess the knowledge to help the relationship manager in being successful.
bad,Learned how to troubleshoot more effectively. Was recognized for good customer service. There are incentives for doing a good job. The hardest part of the job is trying to get the end user and the Corporation to be on the same page on some occasions. Supervisors are typically willing to accommodate issues that may arise .
bad,As of late they are cutting people left and right to increase the bottom line. No one is safe from the axe. this is not a company that you can stay 20 years at anymore.
bad,Surplus conditions abound in all of company. Very shaky times for contract employees. I do believe however than a bright star will appear and buy this company soon.
bad,Enjoyed coworkers but departments not on the same page... Job became frustrated without incentives and no benefits. No yearly raises and no semi  annual or annual bonuses
bad,Manager is unavailable most of the time. No motivation or support. Lackadaisical to a fault. Company does not provide adequate information to employees on time. Never feel employees are important.
bad,"The middle management was amazing. Very hard working, talented individuals. However, they are over worked and under appreciated. Work life at CenturyLink was very stressful. There were not nearly enough employees for the work load and yet there was constant downsiIng."
bad,"It is a difficult job, there is a lot of requirements and the job itself is stressful, making for a negative day to going home in a bad mood most nights. You have to work for your commission and you make a lot of money if you are good at pushing products on people, but the management makes it difficult to be proud of where you work. You can't pick and choose what calls you get, so you have to have luck on your side to make the quota to retain your job. Out of a training class of 20, only about a fifth remain after 3 months. Overall, if you are good at selling, then you will do fine at this job. It's a customer service job, but it feels like you watched closely even if you are doing your job well and taking care of the customer."
bad,This building is currently closed so unfortunately the ping pong table is gone now but the job was fun. There was plenty of downtime to browse the internet and the job is an excellent first job for anyone interested in IT or tech support.
bad,Most hired now are offshore representatives. self taught classes. Hard to pretend confident in technology unless you speak IT slang fluently. Customers are more aggressive over the phone.
bad,"This company has potential to be a good company but they are to busy playing gotcha games as opposed to allowing you to just do the job."
bad,"The company culture is fading quickly.  The exec have made decisions based on shareholders, which is understandable, but doesn't make it a good place to work.  All the changes will catch up to them.  They always do."
bad,"My previous employer, tw telecom, was acquired by Level 3 Communications. About 9 months in, around 500+ employees were let go because of reduction in force. Level 3 is not a stable company to work for. They have the reputation of not doing well as a company and falling apart."
bad,Qwest no longer exists as it was acquired by Century Link.  Management lacked integrity and killed a great company when they acquired USWest
bad,The management has made a number of bad decisions over the past few years and now they are coming home to roost. Layoffs have affected people in every corner and market of the organization.
bad,"This is a basic call center environment, you have to know how to sale.  Very high call volume, pay decent if you are a good salesperson."
bad,Great work life balance.  Company is all about numbers though unfortunately.  Right and left hands have no idea what the other is doing.  Smart employees.  Good people.  Leadership doesn't value people though.
bad,when the company was Embarq it was far more enjoyable to work for the culture at Embarq was great new management @the link is under construction have some was to go before they can reclaim the happy to work for company title
bad,Qwest was just long distance calls. Then it was bought out and all customer service was laid off or had to move to canada.
bad,Answering incoming phone calls and selling customers products before helping the customer with their actual problem.
bad,"I have never seen a company go through so many mergers and name changes. really killed moral for many. I loved my actual job, and was very successful there"
bad,"I thought it would be a good place to work, but my supervisor was terrible at her job.  She needed other workers help to do her own job and over worked everyone."
bad,"The work environment is negative overall  The morale and management support was very negative, and hitting any sales numbers was near impossible.  The products are solid, but the pricing isn't competitive and implementation of any of any service is painful.  There isn't a team culture there and pre and post-sales support is non-existent.  Would not recommend."
bad,"Centurylink can be a good place sometimes, but with their inability to properly align internal resources, you have to fight all of their internal groups to try and get things fixed. This causes a bad employee morale issue along with a bad customer experience."
bad,"CenturyLink has went through a major overhaul of their business models. This has left sales people with u paid commissions, multiple layoffs, and a company (Level3) that doesn't know how to run a very large business."
bad,"Typical Telecommunications company.  Many buyouts and continuous changes. With the continuous changes, comes the challenging directions and environment."
bad,"Working for Centurylink was all right, but overall they need to work on their management. It can feel like they don't appreciate their workers and only care about numbers."
bad,"Centurytel used to be a wonderful place to work. A place to take pride in what you did. A company that cared very much about its customers and employees. Not anymore. Now it's CENTURYLINK. And it's a much different place. Pay is good, but that's about it."
bad,While they give you very limited training and not professional . Im my opinion everything is rushed in training. When you are working on sales via cold and live inbound calls. You are expected to generate a quota that can sometimes be beyond normal sales expectations.
bad,A typical day at work would include calling 60+ Business 25 of which were junk leads. The rest was fishing and cold calling for upgrades or new business.
bad,"Centurylink has internal employees from the older union crowd who do not like to work with anyone new especially if those are contractors.    Hateful and negative place if you consider this a work-environment to work in.   IT is NOT!!!!!"
bad,"It's hard to feel good working for a company that is in a never ending cycle of expense reductions, which makes employees suffer from always having to look over their shoulders."
bad,The experience i obtain was fine yet the pay was awful because when you put your facility out in the middle of nowhere and no one is the wiser it might seem like a lot of money yet it is not the paid 15hr yet to break even in overland park ks you have  to make 20hr
bad,Customers will call for computer help and expect not to pay for it. Some people would call because they were bored. Some would call and say they were going to kill themselves. Look for something else.
bad,Very stressful selling services to people who could not afford current services and wanted to reduce bill instead of increasing bill amount by adding services.
bad,They make you feel like you are a big part of the company even though they will let you go at a moments notice. They promote people with no experience and wonder why the competition is always one step ahead. They do not invest money in the residential side of the business.
bad,"If you like being yelled at by customers and your supervisor, this is the job for you. I had to get out before I lost my mind. Many times the client was yelling on the phone and from the other side of the room I can hear the supervisor yelling to me as to what to say. I don't work like that."
bad,Lots of unfulfilled promises are made. The grass definitely isn't greener even though that is CTL's color of choice. If you are a top performer stay where you are or look to other horizons.
bad,"Bad management decisions through the Level 3 merge, upper management seems to be more interested in numbers, and moving the headquarters from Monroe, LA to Colorado, then the people that work for the company"
bad,answered calls and a lot of times calls were easy because it was a matter of just reprogramming equipment to get service back up; it was difficult getting help from someone because everyone was busy or on phone; the customers were usually rude because they were usually on hold a while before they got to us on phone; customers would yell and cuss before given a chance to resolve problem
bad,You had to push all products on every call even if you just got off the phone with the customer. You sat in a cubical & couldn't leave unless you were on break.
bad,"The work-from-home, customer service position is amazingly convenient.  All of the provided tools and equipment needed to run a successful office are consistently reliable and provides greater ease in job execution."
bad,"If you're a cut throat salesman who is only out to reach commission, this is the job for you. But if you're not happy with high sales quotas, digging in people's pockets, and stolen sales, then don't apply here."
bad,"This was a good place to start my career, but if wasn't right for a long term place. Art this point I was ok with being inbound sales and it was a nice learning experience"
bad,Not a fan of Unions - If you need someone to speak on your behalf this might be a fit for you...Sit back and be an average Joe / this is your life.  Yes maybe your hard work will pay off
bad,"Sloppy, not a place I would invest my money and time into. Empty Promises. I do not approve of how sketchy they do business and negotiated with each other"
bad,Okay company without the training needed to do your job.  I was put with an all new sales team and they were new to the company as was I and our managers did not assist with navigating the the internal company processes.
bad,Great co workers who really cared about the technicians they helped until CenturyLink destroyed that relationship by shipping the job overseas
bad,"Not certain about future direction, no clear road map. No leadership across the management chain. Tight command and control from the top down. Deaf ear to local teams and feedback."
bad,worst place ever worked. no clear guidelines and management is inept. racist company and the worse with people skills and people are scared
bad,Very stressful job. Taking calls from angry customers all day as well as a qouta to make as far as sales from these angry customers.
bad,Was a great company to work for when it was US West and Qwest. Great experience in working with telcom. Exposed to many different technologies and software development processes.
bad,"Relaxed environment, Pressure from management, Lack of leadership. Casual work environment,Work from home, Lots of work, Time to study."
bad,I fell into this job through a hiring agency whom lied to me.  The position was listed as Customer Care which I later came to find was really just sales.  I'd never held a sales position before but I gave it my best.  Calls were all incoming and we were suppose to sell to customers that were calling about their billing or if lucky they wanted to setup service.  The best days were when customers called in just to setup service and not discuss their bill.
bad,"A typical day at CenturyLink is answering multi-line telephone system, assisting customers with billing questions. The hardest part about the job is not being able to make every customer happy no matter how hard you try. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you make a difference in somebody's life."
bad,Cell home phones is a time in which on one wants one was stressful. The demands were unrealistic. Talking to customers was sometime fun and interesting.
bad,"Provided technical support to customers having issues with Prism television, high speed internet and phone services."
bad,"Very Challenging.   I reported to the Director.  The PMO needed a complete set up from scratch, including policies and procedures"
bad,This company was weighed down with extra management layers.   There were a lot of disparate organizations that did not work well together.
bad,very stressfull not worth it you will probably get fired after three months.
bad,"The work itself was very challenging in the heat, on the pole, dealing with cable facilities, but there was a sense of pride when the day was done."
bad,I enjoyed the experience while there. I would recommended the job experience to anyone before Qwest acqusition. I just did not like the experience of working for the Qwest group. I found that very disappointing and sad. I now can see why a union represents the employees from Qwest.
bad,"I was hired thinking that it was for my customer service experience, however, I was hired to sell sell sell. I don't mind having to sell things, but I dislike it when my job depends on it. People were being fired left and right at this company because they weren't selling. You had 6 weeks or so to ""graduate"" (meaning you had to sell enough in order to be able to keep your job). The daily sales quota were ridiculous! I felt that they cared nothing about the employees. My supervisor gave me praise on good days and had nerve to call me ""lazy"" on bad days. She sat beside me on a call once and kept feeding me lines to say. She made me push and push and push different products until the customer cursed me out and hung up on me. Also, there's no way to advance in the company unless there's an opening. Who wants to work in a call center forever. There were people that worked there for 12 years making the same pay as me and looking miserable. I was pregnant and nauseous a lot, they didn't care. I had someone (I guess a manager) literally drag me out of the bathroom to go back to the phone. That was the last straw. I left early that day and then called in the next day saying ""I won't be back anymore, it's a headache."" They then harassed me by phone and mail. Biggest headache of my life working for this company. "
bad,"CTL was an ok place to work. I was hired fresh out of college as a collection rep, I was able to move up in the company. Selected to work in ACT department but the dept moved to Monroe so we were all laid off, I was hired back 2 months later worked as a collections rep moved up to team lead then finished my tenure at ctl before leaving as a business collection rep! ctl is no longer in Shreveport, la. My supervisors were all great, while I was employed there."
bad,"Good- pay. Bad -Training and lack of appreciation of employees no awards, gift cards, tickets. This company should have a monthly meeting and show employees they appreciate all the hard work."
bad,"The pay is great; when I worked there we received a $0.90 raise every 6 months. The problem is the customers are a NIGHTMARE to deal with, and if they're especially bad or requesting a manager, you're not allowed to transfer them. You're only allowed a fixed amount of days missed regardless of what's going on. In the 2 years I worked there I experienced 2 deaths of friends, and both times received no sympathy and was expected to carry on work as if nothing happened. The first death I was told, and I quote, ""Well you're obviously not handling this well,"" and was expected to carry out my shift."
bad,It was a long time ago but it was Good.😊. I would love to work at Fire Rock. It was a good time and a Great job. But i had another opportunity in Business so i gave it a shot.
bad,"CenturyLink would be a wonderful place to work but in harsh weather, they don't care it you lose everything in the flood, fire, hurricane you better come to work. If your house is surrounded by water and you cant get out, you better come to work.  The pay is awesome for the type of area we live in. The manager and supervisors need training on customer service themselves and a communications course would really help. Often customers are lied to and not told all the details and then they don't want you to correct the issue. They advise have them to pay the insanely large bill and then credit the next bill so the customer still loses out. Often they don't have any sympathy /empathy for the customer."
bad,if you could sell an eskimo ice than this is the job for you.this is a very stressful position. Other jobs within the company may not be as high stress as this one.
bad,"It's a great place, but hard to advance and supervisor is wishy washy he's super phony and is the devil  to your face, but when he's around upper management he acts like an angel"
bad,The training system teaches you verbal selling techniques but doesnt teach you necessary information about selling products. Different managers have different rules that cabnot be followed together. Periodic ultimatums are issued when unnecessary.
bad,It was a good place to work before the merger and management change occurred. New management had no idea of what job responsibilities should entail. Good Work-Life balance.
bad,Centurylink would be a great company if they didn't have company-wide layoffs every year.  That is really the only problem I have with them.  I always feel as if my position is not secure even though I have relocated multiple times for the company.
bad,"Its ok but it is hard to make on such low salaries. If the salaries were higher compared to other telecommunications companies, this company would be great."
bad,My primary responsibility is to solve customer problems and offer products delivered by Centurylink and its partners.  I enjoy the team environment and the people I work with.  The most challenging aspect of working here is the schedule 10am to 7pm and it pays 1/5th of what I am accustomed to earning.
bad,"Very unprofessional environment, its like a soap opera on the floor for the department I was in. I have no problem with the company itself, it was honestly a good company with great benefits that came because of the union. However extremely unprofessional"
bad,CTL is not a good place right know. There hasn’t been any merit increases in 2 years. They value their shareholders more than the employees. I have been at CTL for over 16 years and my performance has been exceptional but my salary isn’t equitable in the market place. We have lost a lot of tenured reps and the company culture isn’t what it used be.
bad,"Joined 6 months ago and now they fired 300+ employees."
bad,"If you have a family and young kids that depend on you, then you probably shouldn't work here. They give you manatory overtime and you'll get into serious trouble if you skip out on it. Not to mention that they make you work 9-10 hours daily and your shift when you first work there will be a midday. "
bad,"I worked here for 2 years and 9 months.  They started out loving me and slowly drew back after a surgery I had.  Everyone was in constant fear of losing their job.  All over, a terrible place to work.  The insurance was fantastic though!"
bad,"When I started with the company it was known as Sprint. The starting salary was competitive and the company reputation from an employee standpoint was good. Sprint spun off the landline/DSL division after a couple of years citing profitability issues. When the company became Embarq there was still an air of focused customer support, resulting in JD Power awards. Finally, the company was acquired by CenturyTel and soon after it appeared that the main company focus was satisfying the shareholders instead of the end customers. Process changes slowly eroded the employees ability to provide the stellar customer service they had been used to providing. Several divisional layoffs followed as the company fought to become and remain profitable. As with many major companies of this size, there appears to be a disconnect between upper and lower levels of management. If you are looking for a job and not so much of a career Centurylink may work for you."
bad,Typical day was taking care of OUR wonderful-hones-trustworthy -particular- customers.
bad,"It was always very hectic. The company always expected more, Taught me to be dependable, considerate. Management was good to me. Always had good co workers. Hardest part of the job was just getting there. The most enjoyable were the co workers."
bad,Managed the day to day operations of the call center.  Our Area Manager and Director were great people.  The environment was like we were family.  The hours weren't always the best fit for attending family functions.
good,You only work when there is events so you should probably find a second job to help compensate for income this is a very part time job. But you get to see cool stuff
good,Striving to give the best product to the customers.   Everyday telephony has been changing and new challenges came about on a weekly bases.  At times hard to do our jobs because there has been limited training on most new challenges and innovation.  The hardest part of my job was that we didn't receive the proper training to do our jobs.  Which meant we had to rely on our co-workers to help out each other.   The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers and that I felt I did company justice with my work performance and dedication.  I was part of RIF Reduction in work force.
good,"CenturyLink, Inc. is an American telecommunications company, headquartered in Monroe, Louisiana, that provides communications and data services to residential, business, governmental, and wholesale customers in 37 states."
good,Good pay with too much micro management.  Leaves employee wondering what is expected of them.  Too many managers proportionate to employees.  Very political
good,"CTL is very hard to do business with and that is internal!  There are multiple systems that require incredible tribal knowledge to access. The industry is easier than the company itself. It takes 6m to a year to learn the internal systems.  TBR (farming base) pay is screwed up company wide and sales people are leaving in droves. A big re-org is coming and that will once again slow things down.  "
good,"My experience at Centurylink was not good. I feel my experience was bad due to a lack of professionalism for employees co workers . However, my job itself I loved working and helping customer solve their issue"
good,"No job security at all, zero trust in management, I am a contractor now, I have seen several people in my group fired only for agitating the manager, be careful if you accept a position here as you most likely will have to work whatever shift you are given or be fired"
good,Very run of the mill employer. Management are idiots who care nothing about their employees. Stay away from this employer.
good,"nice call center, well trained, take care of employees, good pay & benefits, great bonuses, if you need anything to make your job more comfortable you would have it, nice new computers, everything was set up to you, excellent trainers to assist you, great and friendly managers.."
good,I had to voluntarily quit because I did not get adequate training so I was disappointed and was forced to leave. very hard decision
good,"Not a great place to work. Top management is inexperienced in IT infra domain. No transparency, do not have leadership skills. Not a very employee friendly place."
good,Just like anything it matters where you work and when you worked there. Telecommunications is generally very clicky. I can tell you this as a 20+ year veteran. You have to find the joy in what you do.
good,Call Center but union based in some departments. Caused conflict due to differences in union and non union employees
good,I don't have a review for centurylink. It was a good company to work for. But once you are starting to have a family you need to switch jobs. You will never be home.
good,Too hectic and disorganized.   I wasn't there very long after they purchased our company from bankruptcy.  Not sure of the current culture at the company.
good,"There are some really smart people working there but the lack of management and structure is difficult to deal with. Plus the lack of training and support is definitely a factor. Moral, communication, and a willingness to fix easy issues was difficult for some reason."
good,"Third shift contracting position while in college full time.  Basic entry level computer skills required.  Being a full time father and putting myself through college on my own, the job shift grew to be too much for me to handle at the rate I was being paid."
good,I would not work for Manpower again; after they gave me my 2 weeks notice of being laid off they were very distant. Rarely saw the recruiters on the job unless they were there to write someone up.  Very disappointed in there connection to there employees.
good,Friendly co-workers and management. Didn't have a great option for advancement but overall company moral was good. Enjoyed getting up for work each day.
good,"This job was a family of friends, that only benefited that Group of Friends. If you were more experience then them they were jealous of you. You would never be promoted to a position if you did not fit in with them. They promoted people who were inexperience only because they were friends. The NOC Supervisor was a good friend and not management material. Don't forget he was in the family. No matter how much we informed management about him, they did nothing."
good,"They have a very strong portfolio of products however their management and culture are weak.  Too many internal/inter-department issues, lack of communication & same sense of urgency that those in Sales have (customers as well) causing for an unhealthy environment.  "
good,Training could be better and could be more truthful to the customers
good,"Sales staff goals extremely high, This review is presented 10 years after being employed by QWEST"
good,"workplace culture needs improvement."
good,"Typical days include forced overtime, which comes with little notice.  This causes a poor balance between you work and your personal life.  Most training occurs on-the-job and the management provides little support."
good,"It is an avg company with avg culture"
good,"it is an ok place to work, management is not the best, not willing to work or coach when needed. Money is not good at all, the calls are not just sells but you also do Customer service."
good,You make choices to enjoy every day you can.  Work need to get done but you are with the friends you make.  Enjoy it while you can.  With new management each day can be a new opportunity so be flexible.
good,"Typical call center setting, fun environment, helped build social skills while also learning multiple computer functions.  Management could use some work as fairness is not always fair"
good,Point system that penalizes employee for life events. Sick children/relative gets points even if the employee doesn't normally call out. Not very flexible with schedule.
good,"Local managers have their hands tied. Upper level managers are in it for the money, not the customers. Technician concerns fall on deaf ears in lieu of stock holder and management bonus profits."
good,"I only worked there for a month or so, because it was a contract job, but I enjoyed the pay while I was there.  It consumed my entire week working there, but again, the pay was good."
good,the managament team did what ever they could do so raise the goals so that we were not able to obatin them then get upset when they my team didnt make goals!!
good,"Worked as a contract worker. Data entry was my main focus"
good,The organization continues to strive to improve it's talent.  Some parts of the organization are capable of executing flawlessly on initiatives that keep employees engage.
good,Began working for this company when it acquired Qwest Communications and quickly realized that management style seemed lacking and was very one-minded.
good,Extremely high workloads and very little recognition. Decent compensation plan. Too much streamlining. Company seems more interested in acquiring more companies than taking care of it's current employees.
good,"I loved the job itself and was very successful at it, pay was great and because I excelled I made a ton in commission. But the management was ridiculous and critical and not in a constructive way. They are completely unwilling to work with you when emergencies come up as well. My son was having severe medical problems for a short period of time and as a result had times where he wasn't able to breathe and had to be rushed to the hospital when he was only a year old, I made sure to provide doctor's notes every time an issue came up, as well as becoming a top performer for the company and going above and beyond what was required when I was there. Then after having to leave one day again for him, I was brought into the office and fired. I contacted my union rep provided all the documentation for every time I had to leave and also released all medical records to them. And because one doctors note said that grandma brought him in since she was the one who watched them, that there was other options for him and there was no need for me to leave work. I'm sorry my son stopped breathing I think it is extremely important for the mother to be there. And to add icing to the cake, they marked me as unrehireable. So if you plan on working here just remember no matter how hard you work if something comes up and you stray even the slightest bit from their attendance, no matter what the reasoning or if you bring in documentation, they wont hesitate to let you go. Oh and don't bother paying the extra for the union rep, its a waste of money."
good,"Very cannibalistic culture. Constant turnover. Scheduling, communication are terrible. There is very little room for growth and absolutely no training or support."
good,"Worked at home.  Like working where you see other people during the day."
good,"Solid Company built by hard working employees. Have gone through several mergers. Company head quarters is located in Monroe, LA."
good,"You have the opportunity to learn a lot and advance your skill sets. However, the culture is lacking and career advancement is minimal."
good,Typical day at work was getting to work in the morning and logging into the system at my allotted time then I would begin work. Had a 15 min break after two hours and an option for a 30 minute or hour lunch. Another 15 min break in the afternoon. Co-workers were OK but a great number were always involved in office politics which I steered clear off. I learned a lot at work for the years I was there.
good,Image computers as requests would come in. Would work tickets that could be assigned to me. Move equipment from users old office to their new office. I would also ship out laptops to different office locations.
good,"This company doesn't pay well, doesn't give cost of living pay raises, and does not provide much opportunity for career advancement or continuing learning opportunities."
good,"When this call center was in the name of Sprint and Embarq, was a great place to work.Had amazing pay and benefits.As it became Centurylink, that all changed and everyone left."
good,"Management is unprofessional. Pay is nice when you are able to make sales. Peers and Team leaders are nice however, training is very long and hard."
good,"The Level 3 acquisition of tw telecom was a great move for both company’s… although, good management was lost. "
good,Became bad place to work.  Management metrics pay advancement were all bad
good,"The people you work with are great, the managers don't care at all. When a manager is in doesn't mean you will get a answer to questions about the job policy and procedures. They will tell you that  you are needing work on something and not tell you what it is that  you are lacking."
good,"workload throughout the day is pretty easy, co workers are friendly..for the most its a good work day . very uptight when it comes personal life emergencies that may arise."
good,"very structured environment, very strict attendance policy. Good rewards for hitting your goal."
good,Over worked - under payed
good,As a successful Center Sales and Service Representative you will be working in a call center promoting and selling Century Link products and services to residential customers. In this exciting and fast paced position you will be responsible for the following:
good,"The one thing I liked about working there was the nice view of downtown Phoenix. In addition, the great selection of food in that area. Along with great diversity"
good,"ability to make judgement calls in the field and act on that, makes this a workable environment. lower level managers assist/help their teams accomplish goals."
good,"Put your data skills hat on! And your Customer Service one too. the CSM II position is fast paced, never a dull moment, and always something to learn within all departments!"
good,Our manager at the time spent more time away from the team then with it. meetings were negative and usually took too long. There were not team training sessions and our manager was not motivating.
good,great pay but poor management and no flexibility with hours. It is great because you get paid a base hourly rate no matter what you sell plus you receive monthly bonus checks which are nice.
good,Local Management is good to work with. Poor communication from Corporate leaves you guessing and/or scratching your head when they do make a decision. (Poor ones at that) Insurance is poorly managed by UHC for the company's self funded plan. More and more we are denied Coverage or Drugs suddenly are not covered (even if you were just covered last month) Steer Clear
good,The techs never completed their jobs correctly or just wouldn't show up making it difficult for customers to ever be pleased with their services. As a customer service rep we heard about it the most
good,I was paid only based off of commission. If I didn't make a sale I did not get paid for the hours I put in. I was forced to work over 72 hours each week with no pay unless a sale was made.
good,if want to work and gain your money this is the right place otherwise you have no vacation . we work everyday of the week even Sunday .good thing management is ok
good,not a very good company going downhill fast. have let go of most good employee's they have. its now on a buddy system not on your actual work itself. its all about who you know and kiss up to
good,Centurylink and Level 3 are in the process of merging jobs and locations. It takes about 3-4 years for a company merging together to get out all the kinks and release surplus of employees.
good,"Hiring manager was awesome, clicked on all cylinders, knew the business, knew the people, understood leadership and key aspects to managing properly and fairly. They brought new manager in, who immediately sucked up to the superstars and consequently devalued the remainder of the team, allowing superstars to shine and others to wallow and fail. Which we did. Never felt a part of the team, very divisive culture he maintained and constantly managed to create failure."
good,Not able to provided feedback to upper management. Customer focus is gone after the acquiring Level 3. Upper management is cutting departments and dumping extra work on middle management.
good,"After buying out level 3 there are no full time jobs, strictly contractor basis. Great place to learn if you need NOC experience or a foot in the door for IT. But I’m looking to leave this company ASAP."
good,"Call center environment, disliked taking call after call. High pressure sales environment. Wasn’t a bad job, pay was definitely lower compared to what you would sale, decent job, stayed two years and found a better paying job with better benefits."
good,"I was unable to plan my work week. Careless Management always keep me to see tasks and assign me task due the same day when I had some other task to complete. "
good,A typical work day includes numerous interactive team meetings and they encourage team building exercises. Continued education and open door policy are encouraged.
good,Loved the challenges learning of new products lines but frustrated there wasn't good training ...always learn as you go.  Communication has had tremendous changes from phone to internet to VoIP...sometimes very stressful trying to keep up with the changes.  Great co workers.
good,"Took 40-60 calls per day"
good,The company has too many systems to operate on a normal base and because you're dealing with old technology it made it hard to compete with other telecom companies.
good,Company was in constant reorg while creating new revenue streams.   I am thankful for my time with the company and the friends that were made.   After the merger only 1 person from my team of 30 remain at the corportate office.
good,I worked here for 15 years. They are not family oriented and do not have compassion. Empathy and integrity are two of their core values and they are not practiced by management.
good,Not the worst job in the world. Management was clueless but I don't think that was their fault. Need to consolidate their ERPs and CRMs because having 6 different ones per product destroys productivity.
good,"Before the acquisition of Level3 this was an amazing place to work. Now that the acquisition is complete the family-feel has left, jobs are being lost, no one can answer simple questions, and what once was a good structure for promotion has fallen flat on its face."
good,"The job was to escalate past due orders, make sure all current orders met their critical date and make sure orders flowed through to completion.  Escalation to management was a routine that drove orders to completion."
good,"Integration of the different companies/departments was terrible. People were indifferent to interpersonal skills, and good culture. Company is very stuck in the 90s Corporate mentality, and is not very forward thinking. Very much a good ol' boy system still, but once you get in, you can usually stay in pretty well. Health care benefits are ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. They only have 1 medical plan, and it is outrageously expensive. On the flip side, the 401k is A+!"
good,"It was an okay job at first, however it quickly became apparent that there would be no raises or promotions unless you happened to be best friends with one of the managers. High turnover, no training, clueless director also contributed to this poor review. Job will most likely be outsourced to India once someone upstream realizes how pointless the job is."
good,Not satisfied overall.  Not satisfied at all with the management and management opportunities.  Tough place to work.  A lot of micromanaging going on while there.
good,CenturyLink is an ok company to work for.  The unfortunate part is the company is always changing their leadership. This ends up changing the direction the company is going and can be very confusing for people.
good,Nothing to say per my severance agreement.  I do not do surveys as a general rule. Since information is so valuable why should I give it to Indeed for free?  Are they a non-profit taking a vow of poverty or just leaching off desperate people in search of employment?  Then why is this section mandatory?
good,"16 hours days are the average. leadership can be hard to work with if you are not part of the club. "
good,"Provide sales for internet, telephone and cable. retail environment very competitive. Offer add additional features. Also offered technical support, customer service and incentives."
good,"QWEST is still alive and well... if you aren't a former QWEST employee then you can forget about a future here.  I have never seen a manager or director truly care about the long term growth of the company.  The only thing I saw in seven years of working there was constant interdepartmental blame shifting and no true progress, unless the goal was to let good talent go.  I left for greener pastures before the fifth layoff in 7 years, only to hear of my boss and two peers laid off a month later.  This is a great company if you are only interested in working today.  The longer you work here, the greater the odds of you being downsized.  It's what they do, along with practicing a growth by acquisition strategy.  The company truly has nothing to offer employees anymore....not even PTO (believe it or not)."
good,Very stressful. Job is retention to save customers. You get fired for not selling Directv. The job was not selling. You walk around in pins and needles. Very unpredictable.
good,You are tied to your desk as every second of your day is watched; and given goals that only 10% of employees actually end up reaching. You can be amazing in one area of sales such ask phone service which makes the company more than internet but you have to excel in many different category's in order to not be written up as is the process in place by the Union. Also I am at the max that I can make hourly but any new hires for the same position their starting pay is higher than my current pay.
good,"Recent acquisition of Level 3 Comm. seems to have been a bad move."
good,"Great place with some great people, but you gotta watch your back. Being a strong personality puts a target on you. You cannot speak up against your manager if your manager is female. You will be reprimanded"
good,There was alot of uncertainty when i worked there. the work place was great as far as environment and such but management wasn't great. it was very stressful
good,Stressful and in desperate need of more employees but won’t provide funds where needed.  Current shifts are changing constantly and making life difficult for its employees
good,"This was so long ago, it's not even the same name. Entry level and call center is all I remember. You could wear jeans and you were paid incentives, won prizes and things like that."
good,I only worked there a short time and left in order to pursue a second degree. In the time I was there I was indifferent about my work experience I worked overnights is was really quite.
good,The metric structure was not conducive to interdepartmental collaboration.  Merger/Acquisition of previously acquired companies never completed. Years separate and unequal
good,The Load Management Position is very demanding the pay isn't in line with the position and advancement is often not given because they need you to stay in this role due to a high turn over.
good,You have to try hard to update items that people don't want and bundle large bills that people can't pay.  If you can keep your statistics up it is an OK job.
good,"In office environment excellent.  Multiple reorganizations, structural changes in management, human resources department lacking in communication and efficiency."
good,"Union Shop.....Most workers are slackers. Some are very good. Manager is overworked because supervisors are weak. No or very little oversight.No accountability of workers."
good,I did not like the workplace culture.  There seemed to be a lot of favoritism in my department.  There was not much training development for growth due to the budget.
good,"Overall I believe in the company; Level 3. My particular department & organization however is a stressful environment. Overworked, underpaid and no options for advancement within the department. Unfortunately my department is key and therefore advancement within the company is difficult too; some have been blocked from moving internally to different positions."
good,I suppose some people are content with feeling temporary at all times. The benefits package is terrible all things considered. I ended up realizing I needed out when PTO stopped being even a fantasy.
good,"Limited opportunity for advancement and pay is not commensurate with experience.  Management is sometimes inexperienced and have little knowledge of telecommunications, networking, and little management experience."
good,"Large telco that was looking to expand into other areas through acquisitions of data centers.  Acquired a data center company, hired to it, then sold the company.  Not a place to work for non-telco reps or senior technology professionals.  Good place to start for young professionals as a stepping stone to something better."
good,"Still Employed, but thank you. Maybe later. They have a lot to be desired. Management very Inadequate. Cost of living increases non-existent. Working for this Company really SUCKS."
good,Great company only problem is corporate location. Company has many opportunities and opportunity for growth. It is a family environment nestled in Northern Louisiana.
good,The company had been sold twice while being employed.  There is alot of competition for telcom in the denver metro area.  I was always wondering if I'd be laid off when I'd arrive to work.
good,Previously reviewed.   Telecommunications that moved to cloud.  They have a problem providing the customer services in a timely manner.  Expectations for the customer is voided by the lax attitude of individuals that manage orders.
good,"Een typische dagals opleverings- en ontwikkelings coordinator  begon voor mij om 0400 met een werkvergadering met de off-shore die in India gevestigd was (11 uur tijdsverschil.)."
good,"A typical day in my role is hectic and unproductive. Process is rarely followed and my role is a ""clean up"" crew to fix the mistakes that were made. "
good,"A typical day started with going through what we called the Premiums box; we would respond to emails asking to modify/cancel an order or to contact a customer. After our allotted time was over for that, we would be assigned daily tasks on top of taking calls. A lot of the time those tasks were completed fairly quickly. "
good,The people I worked with were great but the management was horrible.  A typical work day consisted of talking to customers and providing products/services they would need.  The hardest part of the job was trying to advance.
good,typical telecom.  No job security and constantly micro managed
good,"It is very monotonous to provision cross connects and do command line interface programming all day under time pressure, and having to manage people who you'd have to keep accountable like field technicians at the site, while all the technical stuff is going on in the background."
good,"High stress, the same as CenturyLink, who bought them. Customers were very abusive, the hardest part of the job having is having to take abuse off customers, I enjoyed the pay"
good,Management is non-existent.  No room for advancement.  Company is not stable.
good,Good be part of the company but no support from the management.
good,the collections department the pay is the worst part and as well as the overtime on 8 hrs a week that is nothing compared to other companies who don't care you come in a make as much OT as possible 
good,"I came to the company with wide eyes and enthusiasm and quickly learned that the company did not have the products, pricing, culture or will to address the proper support of the Select Account Executive SAE."
good,Field 70 to 100 calls per day to help new and existing clients. I learned the sales flow of selling multiple products on one call. Management is OK as they have an area of improvement when it comes to coaching opportunities with struggling agents. Co-workers are amazing to be around and we all help each other get stronger with our skills. Hardest part of the job would be the work\life balance. CenturyLink makes it difficult to have that balance within the organization unless there is a death in the family. The most enjoyable part of the job is creating an amazing experience for the customers
good,"Everything was changing as the new company, Centurylink, assumed control."
good,Centurylink is an good employer. They are much like a small company and oftern get lost in the shuffle.
good,"You day starts with call after call after call of having to clean up other department errors and getting yelled at by very upset customers on the phone. It's a good job if you get to T2 or 3 where you don't take no calls from external traffic, but if you're T1 you're getting blasted at least 8 hours a day and 9 on Mondays. Nothing is standard or stays the same at CL. They pay you low wages and expect you to live off a teenagers summer job income. This job is good for part time, but if you're trying to make this a career, I wouldn't recommend it."
good,"A typical day of work started at 7:30 a.m. and would end when all the jobs were completed.(weather permitting). I had a great work crew when I got there, I had learned from 8 cable technicians with over 30 years each of experience.Before I left Centurylink I had 10 years experience and was number 1 in seniority in the shop. When I started their the co-workers were the strength of the job. the hardest part of the job was juggling ordering supplies, budget cuts of ordering material, trying to complete the job, without the necessary materials. The most enjoyable part of the job was the new and exciting challenges that would come from everyday troubleshooting."
good,More room for growth within the departments.  Provide more training to hire within the organization.  Provide better pay and benefits.  Better communication.
good,"Lots of changes, stressful and learning new products was trying at times. Good benefits, the culture is diverse, they are international and you're just a number."
good,Depending who you work with; it could be heaven or hades.  They do not provide adequate training. Often the work objectives are fluid and achievement is often impossible.
good,It's a good stable company with poor unprofessional managers that you could work for and will get other employees to spy on you if the manager thinks you cannot do the job.
good,I worked for Centurylink for 17 years upon reaching a good salary and getting close to retirement I was let go with employees in my team junior to me being kept. No fault (numbers game). I enjoyed working there but would advise anyone applying be dilligent with your pay you are just a number and expendable with this company.
good,"I've met and worked with a lot of good people at CenturyLink.  Most are skilled, hard working experts in their field.  The constant reorgs and turnover of leadership has led to a lot of dis-function in the workplace.  The endless mergers keep everyone on the lookout for the next layoff."
good,"CenturyLink use to feel like a company with compassion. Where you did your work and you felt like you were respected and taken care of. Now it feels like they are trying to get as many people to reconsider their position in the company, especially the technicians. It is a challenge to do much of anything considering they seem to be treating the network as its already failed so why maintain it. It's fun being a Network Tech, especially with all the other titles that includes. Just feels like they aren't invested their employees anymore, they seem to care more about the contractors. Also, it use to feel like we were on a mission to do good for the customers and hold true to what a phone/network company is. Today I feel like I have no idea where they are steering this ship."
good,My assessment of CenturyLink is a little tainted by the chaos of a merger of CenturyLink and Level3. Upper management of the company was in flux for more than two years. But it was very clear that there was no clear direction from upper management.
good,It was an okay place to work.  Management could use some development courses as there were multiple managers in the same departemtns with their own set of rules. some would let you work from home and some wouldnt. Lots of micromanaging.
good,"Management does not understand the amount of administrative work required outside of selling.  Good products but too many different systems and networks that must be sold, ordered, provisioned separately."
good,"Great work/life balance, benefits, and flexibility. At the same time, poor culture and advancement opportunity. The size of the company makes for difficulty to move up or get many things done."
good,I had some real great times with Qwest then CenturyLink. Things were supposed to change when CenturyLink bought out Qwest but management did not change so the culture stayed the same. Design Engineer is great job now that working conditions changed diue to lawsuit but still not a place i would go back to as an employee.
good,NA not much to say. I didn't advance and there were some things that could use improvements when it comes to attendance. I didn't like the hours I was required to work.
good,I was with Level 3 Communications when Centurylink took over. I was immediately alarmed at the reduction in work force which was extensive. I have since left.
good,I worked through a vendor but I did get a Internal Manager Certification over a weeks time in Phoenix Arizona.  That location looked amazing and the pay seemed fair and it look like it was 1000x better.  Wish I could have worked there!!
good,Desperation to succeed in new markets. No marketing help from corporate only flyers we have to print ourselves. Large multibillion dollar company with shallow pockets.
good,Not bad but a job is what it was. I am fprced to do this review to continue. Hate being forced into this stuff on the web. It is a sign of the times for sure
good,"Fast paced micro  managed, supervisors breathing down your neck. Have to stay in your chair and take calls.  Not able to get up and move around freely."
good,"not the best,not the worst."
good,"This Company used to be the best ever , 10 + years ago anyway. Now there is no job security and will gladly outsurce a department to save a few $ . When your with a company 20+ years in a small town this is a big deal."
good,"Disorganized disorder at best, the Sr leadership provided a vision, and tried to provide the flexibility for organizations to work without micromanaging the groups. This is only effective if they stepped in when things were not going well or in the direction the company was headed. Also, there is very little emphasis on solving internal problems and issues. No overall strategy developed for the Government Team, which effects ptoductivity."
good,"When I started in 2015 things were great. After a year and working my butt off to get noticed, I was never given the opportunity to advance in the company. Finally after 3 years, it was decided that my whole team would be outsourced."
good,CenturyLink in the past was a real good place to be an engineer. The company has reorganized and gone to a more contract staff base laying off quite a few of the experienced employees.
good,Pay and benefits were decent but raises and promotion impossible. Seemed like an unending amount of metrics. Always something that wasn't being met. Most employees burn out in under 6 months.
good,Ok company to work for. Some supervisors are all about wanting to make the employees better and reap the benefits of good workers and happy workers. Some just look to see who they dont like to replace.
good,"It can be a decent place to start a career in networking but due to the lack of raises and poor health insurance, it is best looked at as a temporary job until one gets more experience."
good,Was pleasant working here. the cafe is good. management and human resources are lacking an understanding of how to retain good employees. took away the free coffee for one. :(
good,"The enviroment at the office was great, peers at the office were always willing to help or discuss any project conflicts to come up with a solution and provide a great service to the customer.   Management was not so good in the last 2 years,  constant unresolved issues witch lead to a lot unknown ways to proceed with your projects."
good,"Since I had started working at CTL every year there was a merger, hence new leadership, new direction, new management style, etc. which in turn became very difficult to get anything done in a timely matter. Once you had processes figured out, they would be gone in a year and you start over. Highly inefficient."
good,"The company has implemented some great new benefits over the past few years around FTO, family maternity leave and continued pay after death for a period of time for surviving spouse.     "
good,"Centurylink is attempting to position itself as a premier solutions provider and is re-inventing itself at a very fast pace.  It has embarked upon the aggressive purchase of many other companies over the past 8 years.  They are struggling to integrate those efforts and align the results with their internal goals.  Time will tell if their vision will be realized.  A typical day of work involves a lot of meetings.  I've learned that more resources are needed if the company is to achieve their stated objectives.  Management can be top heavy and not as progressive as they would like to believe they are.  That may be changing with their latest acquisition.  Workplace culture can be very chaotic and is oftentimes driven by circumstances, instead of direct action on stated / targeted goals."
good,Anything from customer service to analyzing customer website data is a normal day at centurylink. I managed and trained over 50+ ppl inside my job description.
good,A company that has failed to keep up with today's technology. An organization that needs to realize that innovation move fast and that change is imperative.
good,"With proper leadership enforcement this would be the place to work in Telecommunications. "
good,"the work is enjoyable, however the lack of training, advancement opportunities, and salary leave something to be desired.  the average salary for technical positions is well behind the rest of the industry."
good,"My shift is divided into two categories. First half I take manager escalations from extremely irate customers. I do all I can to help them and resolve their issue. Sometimes it can get very stressful due to the fact that appointments from our field technicians are not being met. "
good,"do more with less.. For years they would lay people off and just expect you to do more."
good,Things change in the job daily and what is expected does too. I have worked here a long time and at this point CL just does not care about the customer at all.
good,Manadatory overtime and you basically live there. Cant pick schedule. But it was easy to do and very chilled. If you dont have a life youll be ok. Sales is horrible they give people things they didnt request.
good,Started off as a great place to work however with the upcoming merger with Level 3 the environment changed drastically. There was a lot of instability due to people and management not knowing where they were going to end up.
good,"Lot of long time employees from Qwest but little opportunity for lower technical employees.  "
good,"It can be better if WFH option and time limit nt fixed to 9 hrs compulsory.Productivity should not depend on hrs.Work should be completed at most though it's 5 hrs or 9 hrs does not matter."
good,"When I first started working at this company it was quite enjoyable for about the first 2 months after training.  During the time that I was there, the company started changing rules and procedures that caused much of the core management as well as core staff to leave the company due to poor management after the new changes.  There were many managers however it made doing your job effectively very difficult as each manager and supervisor and a different answer, response and way of handling the easiest of situation.  I did learn much from my time there, but quickly realized that they were not a company that I wanted to grow with."
good,"Nice team, intelligent, well rounded, good location, lots of work.. fairly good work/life balance, very interesting projects"
good,"this company does many layoffs and does constant re-orgs.  it pays ok"
good,"Overall the Centurylink company review from me is okay. It is a call center based company. Like most call centers it changes rules and policies frequently, almost too frequently. My co-workers are decent, they treat everyone like family, which is a good thing. The call center environment and expectations are too high. The whole center was told every day, to try to defuse an angry customer before transferring to a supervisor, some of the time it was doable, and the other times the customers wouldn't give you the option or time of day without yelling at you personally and at the company you work for. Situations like that is what made the job hard, and stressful. I enjoy helping people in whatever way I can, to the point where it was out of my job scope. The supervisors wanted you to save the customers, but wanted you to get them off of the phone for more phone calls to come through. To save angry customers it takes longer than 790 seconds."
good,"Very stringent in terms of time and time management."
good,"CTL is a somewhat stable company to work for, although in the past 2-3 years a RIF seems to come each September. Benefits are solid. Career advancement is nonexistent."
good,"The sales department see's a very high rate of turnover. Classes each month in the 30 plus people. ""New Agents"" Their billing systems are totally messed up and the agents are encouraged to lie as to fix the customers problems. "" Tell the customer what they want to hear and move on to make a sale"""
good,"The training is horrible, the veterans are stuck up and the management is absurdly unknowlegeable .The coaches aren't helpful except for 2 of them. Adherence is insanely strict and more times than not unreasonable. The commission isn't all that great either. Hours were good aside from the mandatory overtime. Unionized.. trying to grow so there were a solid amount of weekly incentives."
good,We deal with Business to Business repairs nationwide; I work 3rd shift and we create tickets for our customers so that the techs can test their circuits and correct any problems if needed. It is a fast paced environment and we have to deal with stressful situations and be able to navigate to different sites to look up and create tickets for the customers.
good,"The best part of the job was the co-workers, as we had very rigid schedules. Most everyone would be willing to trade hours/days off to help with appointments. The hardest part of the job was to process a call in less than 30 seconds. I understand that time is money, but sometimes it just takes a bit longer for the person on the other end of the telephone to process what you are saying."
good,"Pros: Great benefits/PTO Good place to learn tellecom"
good,"My typical day at work included the writing JIM's, EDP's, MOP, processed work orders, acted as project manager and sometimes a planner. On occasion I was able to travel to perform my own site surveys."
good,"I worked for SAVVIS.  CenturyLink bought SAVVIS and began right sizing the workforce.  The hours were conditional to the issues of the day. The co-workers made the job fun, and inspired teamwork."
good,Good work environment and friendly people.  Collaborative work environment and people are willing to help in and outside of department.
good,"The computer systems were always the toughest to get for me. I would get different pricing for customers every time, or at one time the services would be available, and the next day they were not. There was only two people who knew the systems well enough to explain how they work, and they were always busy...Loved the people that I worked with though."
good,"Help customers with their Qwest Communications account then work with the customer to upgrade / update their services so that customer would be more profitable to Qwest."
good,"I had an overall good experience from Centurylink. Though I didn't agree with a lot of the decisions made there it was still a nice place to work. Always something to do. I learned a great deal of time management and also organization. My co-workers were amazing there and it was a lot of fun. The hardest part of the job was when you weren't able to help a customer and your hands were ""tied"" so to speak."
good,stressful mostly wanted sales benefits were good 8 years ago since centurylink bought out qwest  nt same company
good,"I know the title seems a little harsh, but it is the truth. A typical day starts with a bunch of whiners trying to get out of work. I start my day early, because I know there will be some slack to pick up at the end of the day. It is a never ending battle. The management cant see it. The techs who do it on a day to day basis have the wool pulled over Managements eyes. I get along with all of my co-workers. We may not see eye to eye, but we have to work together to get the job done. I have no balance at all. Sometimes I have to hire my grass to be cut, because of all the hours I put in. The hardest part of my job is trying to find the balance with all of the hours put in with all the responsibilities I have. The most enjoyable part of my job is, knowing at the end of the day the tasks that were put before me had 100% effort put into them, and were all done with pride and the best of my ability. I try to learn something new every day. "
good,Benefits are expensive and the salary is the lowest in the area. My teams managers does not seem to have the ability to get raises or promotions for any of the crew.
good,Calling customers daily
good,The people at this company were terrific to work with. They were supportive and liked to help their fellow employees.
good,"This company offered great work hours and pleasant co-workers, management."
good,I worked several contract positions since like 2008 was not hired full time. You absolutely DO NOT want to work in a NOC. You get worked to death and are married to an ACD phone. You hardly get any type of lunch of breaks. They monitor every little move you make and you are graded on a quarterly basis. They like to hire contractors to beef up the staff during storm season then drop you like a bad habit. Not sure what it takes to get hired full time outside of giving your soul to them which I refused to do. And if you get hired full time they try to cut your pay from what you make as a contractor because they claim you get benefits as a full time employee.
good,This is an all Union company. It is almost impossible to improve sales numbers when you have a Union protected sales staff. You cannot not fire the malingers and you cannot promote the best. You can only promote based on seniority.
good,Fraud Analyst-- I loved this job. It gave me a chance to investigate possible fraud accts. My manager was great we all worked as a team and the group of 8 was a family.
good,This company is now called Century Link. I was a contractor there and was laid off.
good,I would have been nice to have more work life balance within that company. It is more about making it everyday and less about family if there is any type of issue.
good,The typical work day is very demoralizing but the pay and benefits are worth staying a few months. They are very willing to fire you over small issues.
good,Realize you have people working for you that have families. Need more than 4 days off a year without being out of compliance. More hands on training and more realistic retention goals.
good,"As with any company, there are good and bad managers.  The culture over the past couple of years promotes keeping a low profile and not speaking out when you don't agree with a direction. It has turned into a burn and churn environment."
good,Was down sized have no good opinion. Was not offered any options for a different position. There are no opportunities in the operations field in my area. Very little opportunity for advancement.
good,Nice play to start if you are getting into the IT world. After a while it becomes boring because the task become redundant. You sometimes feel like a secretary on certain days when answering and transferring calls.
good,The company was recently acquired by Level 3 causing quite a bit of upheaval and uncertainty. Entire work groups were outsource overseas. This caused frayed nerves and put many departments in flux.
good,"Alot of favoritism and good ol boy mentality. Good work ethic is not rewarded, but favoritism and who you know is what is rewarded. Not much job security."
good,"The company is not doing well and is not well run from the top.  I worked with some great people that I would hire or work with/for again.  But the company is in a tough financial spot, which makes it hard to compete and invest.  Senior leadership is very disconnected from the day-to-day."
good,Its a good company but no family values. You can request time off but if someone who has been there longer request it and there are not enough hours that day you will be denied. Parking is another issue. You have to buy a monthly parking pass around 80.00 a month for roof top or park and ride.
good,"Nothing too terrible to report except that the company gets negative marks  for job security and advancement. I received a top performance award and then received a large promotion. The promotion ended up paying me less. shortly after that, I was let go from the company due to a RIF, despite my top performance and recent promotion. Yes, that's corporate life, but the job security is just nonexistent."
good,"The system was designed to make technicians work against you instead of with you. these technicians would get special treatment,but no extra pay. teamwork has recently been done away with as their new dispatch system doesn't allow for a technician to assist another without hurting their own personal time and therefore getting disciplined for it. Centurylink treats their employees like unruly school children and it makes working there unbaerable."
good,I found that the stress level of Customer Service combined with Sales did not equal the hourly wage or the potential bonus pay outs. Having worked in Sales and Sales management for many years before this position I can say that they needed to divide up Customer service from the sales division so that proper focus may be placed on both.
good,The company is constantly trying to integrate all of the companies they have acquired.  They have disparate systems and processes.  They are finally working on the culture to improve internal interactions between management and staff.  The compensation is on par with other telecom companies.  There are many amazing people that work here and a customer focused approach will be an advantage for you.  The company encourages diversity.
good,CenturyLink was not a bad place to work until the merger with Level 3. Since then there has been a constant force reduction environment that is stressful. Unmanageable work loads due to force reductions in all departments. Those that stay have to many years invested to retire and the smart ones are leaving.
good,Fun place to work in the early 2000’s..things really went down after mergers...with new CEO came less regard for employees...would still be there if not for that reason
good,Always on call and the work environment was fast paced and demanding. Managing techs at 2 locations would mean upwards of 40-60 techs reporting directly to you. All and all a good job if you have ambition.
good,"It was better before Level 3 took over."
good,"My main complaint is there is no formal training, everyone is trained differently when they are hired even if its for one specific job title. Some tier 1 agents would be way less skilled than others based on whoever trained them which would cause an overflow of tier 2 tickets or constant customer call backs."
good,I had been with the company six years and was laid off. The pay is decent and the benefits are good. The company had a big layoff of employees within the past two years. CenturyLink has been going through major changes since the merge. You just never know what is going to happen when you arrive to work and it became stressful.
good,"Nice people, certain layer of senior management not geared to making decisions and hence, procrastination. Confused culture due integration of Level 3 business and hence unclear strategy on business model moving forward."
good,"The work was fine when i started, but they continually added more responsibilities to my workload without any intent to pay more per hour. Pay Raise are every 6 months, I believe it was 50cents each raise until hitting the pay cap, but no raises for added responsibilities.  Also had when I worked there, a tendency to have remote management, which was not ideal in the environment."
good,"If you not selling you are losing and if your losing you dead weight.  Being dead weight your fired.  If you could sell anything to anyone this is your job. If your  Timid, shy, introvert you should stay away."
good,CenturyLink is a numbers based job. Customer service skills means nothing because it al boils down to sales and how quickly you can get the ca over with
good,"Lots of upheaval and stress due to merger. Too many good people and processes lost to make way for Level3.  "
good,"I refuse to put anything here. CTL was 6 years ago and I have moved on. They were a good company to work for, for a time, but like a lot of call centers, too survey based by customers and supervisors."
good,This organization is an adequate place to work if you enjoy working long hours and making a very decent salary.  I was able to meet great coworkers in my job and have built lasting friendships.
good,"A typical day at work was busy, busy, busy.  Very fast paced environment ruled by a keen sense of urgency to meet time driven metrics and commitments, which helped to home my time management skills. Work place culture was one of respect and collaboration. Management was good about providing adequate training. The hardest part of my the job was inadequate compensation.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the work itself, being able to break a circuit down to its simplest parts, analyze/troubleshoot it, and determine a fix."
good,"The pay is good but that's about where it ends. Management sucks. If you aren't related to half the company you probably won't get a higher position. You will be stuck doing the same old job for the same old pay. If they run out of money (which happens often) don't expect them to cut it from higher up. They will cut it from the bottom. No bonus, no raise, no christmas bonus, nothing that they advertise they have. No job security. They will replace you just as fast as they brought you in"
good,"Management not so good, not paying attention to employees needs, they're usually always distracted on the phone, "
good,"I start work by 8 and leave after 4pm. I was given the opportunity to grow from a seller to a sales engineer by the local leaders in the SE organization. "
good,"They don’t care about the customer and the quality of services the company offers. Is a sales position so nothing else matters as long as you hit the sales goals. They really wan you to shove a sale down a customers throat, and most of the deals don’t even help the customer save money."
good,While working at the call center I enjoyed working for CenturyLink. Then there was a transition to move csr's to work remotely. That's when everything changed..The sales percentage expectations became higher and the pay rate per unit was lowered. You became just a number.
good,"Good internship, but limited advancement. Internship could have been coordinated better. Great experience. Company was going through heavy transition."
good,"Though I enjoyed working with the people at Savvi's, my job coach gave me a hard time almost everyday I went to work. She even made comments about her other clients which I found to be rude, disrespectful and unprofessional for someone who works to help people with learning disabilities find employment"
good,"this is a very typical customer service and sales job. Its not fun, it will wear on your patience, and its incredibly micromanaged. however, it pays well and provided me a way to go back to school and finish my degree."
good,"CenturyLink has had the flexibility I required as a single parent when I started. I have enjoyed the jobs I have had over the past 22 years."
good,"they score us on 4 different areas, normal for a call center but the way they do the surveys is very unfair and set up to fail. I take anywhere form 40 to 50 calls a day most of the costumers are very unhappy because there phone and internet are not working the best part of the job for me is at the end of the call the caller is calmed down and less upset, knowing i changed there mood and maybe made there day is a great feeling. i learn something new everyday, the amount of network and PC knowledge that i have gained is unreal. i didn't know how the phone system worked before starting here or how modems and internet network devices worked. The hardest part of this job is that you are given such a small amount of time to assist and resolve the issue while making sure you make the customer feels like a valued part of century-link."
good,Good pay and overtime but just viewed as a number you can’t move up in position very easily and it’s union so it’s a 1.92 raise every 6 months till topping out at 31.87
good,"This is tainted my my last manager and the companies upper management when I left."
good,"The days are stressful and long.  Also, you are always on-call after hours 24 X 7 X 365 unless you take time off on PTO. It requires to maintain site locally and in 6 other states."
good,"Working for Centurylink was a good experience when it comes to making money and meeting people.  However, not selling the products can cost you your job which sucks because you can;t force people to buy products.  People most of the time have to have a deposit and they are not able to do that at they time they call in."
good,"Was a good job with a lot of potential for advancement, but then the management changed and became a friends to hire type place. People started getting hired for higher positions that weren't ready for the position but got hired cause they have friends or family in higher positions. Really puts a damper on trying to move up when you have zero chance before you walk into the interview"
good,"Centurylink offers Work-At-Home jobs as well as Call Center jobs for tech support and sales. WAH positions are nice because you can work from home however you are held to the same standards and rules as call center reps. Competent reps are held down due to only a certain amount of tech leads and other advanced positions being available."
good,In the past 5 years too many processes were implemented where there were too many people trying to push work load thru.  Engineering work group was not provided the necessary budget to provide plain old telephone service (POTS) not to mention providing for upgrades to DSL capabilities.
good,"The company has correctly identified the trends of the future. Unfortunately, they are more interested in trying to sell those ideas to others than in applying them profitably to their own business. "
good,"Pretty hard to feel good about your job when the VP of your division says the entire department was a waste of resources, when 7 techs leave in 2 months and your group is told, ""we'll backfill eventually"" and when you are told you can't move out of a job you are horribly overqualified for because of those staffing shortages..."
good,"The consumer side of the business was unstable due to inferior technology, therefore it was a very high pressure environment to produce results and upper management was constantly changing. I knew going in to the job that layoffs would be inevitable at some point however the pay is what initially attracted me to the position."
good,The lack of training in various departments has made it virtually impossible to excel from within.  The environment has become dense and stressful.  Hopefully someday that will change.
good,CenturyLink is always in a bit of turmoil due to it's focus on growing through acquisition.  Being one of the largest telecom companies in the world has it's challenges and those challenges are amplified because we are a combination of so many smaller entities.
good,"CenturyLink would be a better company, if there was better job security. They were buying other companies too often and EVERY TIME call center jobs were in the air. We never knew if we were going to go in and have a job or not."
good,"I was fortunate to work in so many different roles.  Since CenturyLink took over, I have seen their lack of appreciation for managers, organization and loyalty.  This company will be mostly contractors without experience, pensions or decent benefits and they will continue to lose customers and market share unless more changes are made for the better."
good,Century Link does grant a lot of opportunity to learn new things.  However they do not compensate you for the growth.  They expect a lot of work from the employees but don't want to pay them for it.
good,I learned a lot while working there but many problems with supervisors. I enjoyed the people I worked with but it became too stressful especially if you wanted a better work-life balance.
good,Sat at a desk and got yelled at from customer and other CTL employees. The other members on my team were great however. They were super friendly and helpful. Team Leaders and managers were mostly invisible when needed.
good,Going through many changes in leadership without providing clear direction.  Selling their colocation assets was a poor decision as it was a good part of the business.
good,Retired after 26 years. Great pay and benefits. Stressful work conditions. Often encountered violence in the Work place as an acceptable work culture.
good,"I worked for Level 3 Communications for almost 4 years before the merger of Level 3 and CenturyLink.  There is a lot of good out of the merger, such as growth, job opportunities, revenue, and a combination of multiple years of experience in the telecom field across multiple teams.  The company benefits are lacking as they are looked at as supplemental and not full, however the company itself does compensate its workers with a fair wage."
good,"The only downside to this company is that it is union based, but it can also be a positive in a way. The benefits aren't that great until you get into a higher position. You work at least 10 hours a day due to the hour long lunch given. So takes up more time in my day than I want to give."
good,"Job was great learned a lot and wish they would invest more in their field ops team. Work life balance is well lets just say they don't have enough people to cover the work load or pay per work load is not the best."
good,"My coworkers were great, until about 5 years ago it was an enjoyable job.  Once the upper management lost focus on the customers and focused on buying and merging with other companies, the environment became unstable.  The heads of the company were generous with pay raises and bonuses to themselves and in the last year they took away the Holiday bonus and froze all non-union wages."
good,"I worked for Level 3 for two years before CenturyLink bought us out and took us over. I liked working for Level 3 much better, the culture was a lot better and the culture that CenturyLink brought was a much worse place to work."
good,Was senior tech level 3 handled any issues that I was assigned to. Proficient on most systems we serviced certified telecommunications specialist by nortel on all systems. Worked on voip systems for 7 years was proficient on all nortel/avaya blue systems
good,"The team I worked with was a fantastic team.  Leadership changes created much uncertainty and with the acquisition of the company by CenturyLink, the uncertainty increased.  There was little support of our team by our management."
good,The company is pretty good but is going through changes.  The ability to advance is unclear right now and job security is unsure.  The company has really good founding principles that hopefully will remain through the transition.
good,"Level 3 is not what it seems to be looking from the outside.  Low head count and high work load leaves nothing but stress and minor mistakes.  If you are in to being late on all your tasks, being judged on performance metrics while not being supplied the correct tools or training to complete tasks on time then this is the place for you.    I found myself after a few years regretting taking the job and loosing hair.  "
good,"I worked at centurylink for over 10 years. Some years were good and some others very stressful."
good,Management required us as Field Sales Execs to arrive into downtown Seattle every day at the start of our day when we were told we could do otherwise.  That delayed time to sell as it caused more time to travel than necessary.
good,"corporate management is out of touch with general working conditions, lower management, mission statement training and customer focus. They do not want to spend the money to provide the service they promise to customers which makes it very difficult for all technical services"
good,"Casual clothing strict work ethic good work environment management was at a minimal. It was a friendly environment, easy access to the work place. You do have to pay for parking location is Phoenix down town."
good,"Worked as a cable installer, then moved into PBX install. Eventually moved to an onsite maintenance technician. Enjoyed the job as much as on could. Learned quite a bit while on the job."
good,"Management doesn't understand all of the Engineer's work duties, and is only interested in crunching numbers.  The customer is NOT priority.  Manager speaks to us in a demeaning and disrespectful manner, instead of providing support or advice, or better yet, hiring more Engineers."
good,"Many promises were made in order to have me join the team.  Once on board 75% of the promises were unfulfilled.... Everything was blamed on corporate stating  ""Decisions have changed thus impacting our promises to you"""
good,the managers do not know their jobs and are most times unable to help the employee with work related problems.the employees receive next to none training.
good,"I have worked for this company on two different occasions. They refuse to run enough fiber so that their customers can get a reasonable speed, so essentially you are manning their phones to get yelled at all day. Also the equipment they use is very sub par compared to today's standards, that is another reason customer's call in and complain. I have a degree in IT and knew what I was doing, most people they hire come right off the street with very little technology experience. "
good,"I had fun while working there. Too much turnover and advancement is very difficult. Sales quotas must be met or you'll be fired. I worked there a few years and would only be given a ""temporary"" supervisor position."
good,"Below average salary and compensation benefits."
good,"As a technician of 30+ years, I only received one raise in the last 8 years. The company now isn't appreciative of union workers. They don't seem to want to have cost of living wages. They are cutting costs by hiring people over seas and eliminating jobs for cheaper labor."
good,IT organization does not know what it wants to be - leaders are constantly making sweeping changes that drastically change processes and functions without clearly thinking through what it means in getting work done. Management is not willing to listen to employees to understand gaps that need to be addressed in order for the organization to be successful. Many pitfalls could have been avoided if leadership had been willing to welcome input from those most impacted by the sweeping changes. Employees that do not blindly accept and champion changes without questions are perceived as  non-team players and it is reflected in yearly performance reviews as such.
good,"The Denver Tax Department was a great group of dedicated tax professionals.  Many had worked for the company through many mergers for 30+ years.  They all did incredible jobs meshing the different billing/taxing systems to comply with regulatory filing requirements."
good,"A typical day at work included sitting behind a computer desk taking calls all day and desperately trying to get people to buy things. We were compensated for this, true, but most people didn't care about the compensation, only not losing their job. I did learn how to use quite a few different softwares and techniques to not lose my cool under pressure though. The customers did a great job at hardening my skin. Upper management was fantastic. Friendly, helpful, and encouraging were the three things I would name their upper management. However, most floor managers were not those things. Most held their employees to such high standards that they were so terrified of not selling things that it was the only thing they did, and ultimately were bad employees. The hardest part of the job was definitely the insane, borderline unachievable sales goals. The most enjoyable was the payout."
good,"Level 3 is a decent company run by mostly incompetent executives and management. Most people working here will not go out of their way to help you with anything that is not their direct responsibility. That being said, the pay can be solid depending on what you do and the work life balance is generally pretty good. If you want to be on board with management decisions then look elsewhere. If you just want a paycheck it's not a bad place to work."
good,"Centurylink,like many companies has leveraged their future on acquisition, poor internal processes, and outsourcing certain customer service functions that does not bode well for the overall customer experience."
good,"TW was acquired by Level 3. Training was on the job. Co-workers were knowledgeable and willing to help but workload and changing stratagies for meeting customer demands created additional stress.."
good,"great compensation.  Short ramp.  Issues in implementation and management support and execution. Make your number or you are out no matter what your skill set."
good,I would rather not state my opinion about CenturyLink. This company does not breed healthy work environment. I will not comment any more.
good,"A communications company that doesn't know how to communicate. Very little opportunities for advancement within the company and management does not make any effort to develop its employees. Employees are often left in the dark about major company changes and announcements...i.e. when century link launched gig internet in the metro, many sales managers and representatives received calls from residents in the metro attempting to verify information that they had read about in the morning paper. Unfortunately, the retail sales staff had not been informed of the product launch and were unable to answer customers questions. Job duties and expectations often change w/o prior notification. Benefits are average. On the plus side, you can meet some dynamic and inspiring individuals at CenturyLink. No two days are the same."
good,this job is very fast paced and mentally draining. the goal of the company is to sell to everybody no matter what. they are not worried about customers just sales.
good,Some fun things to do but  very stressful job. Not enough continued training for representatives to  keep up and a great lack of  advancement opportunity. Pay not bad   but  should be more for all the   grief one has to  subject themselves from customers calling in. To many departments doing things different.
good,"Large global Fortune 500 company with little regard for employee work/life balance or engagement. As a company which has not been profitable for almost all of it's history, the almost singular focus is on hitting unachievable financial targets. Frequent layoffs make it difficult to motivate employees. Compensation and benefits packages are above average but cannot replace a positive employee culture. CEO and executive team is exclusively focused on the short term strategy and with further acquisitions as opposed to organic growth. The Customer Experience is a ""nice to have"" but not central to corporate goals."
good,"If your main concern is making a great wage and really nothing else, this is the place for you! However if you ever want to see your kids or keep appointments you made weeks in advance to be told hours before your day off that you are working and now your plans are spoiled, then think again. There is absolutely no work/life balance here! Upper management tells you how to do your job from a book that they got from corporate...who also...doesn't know how to do your job. There is no long term benefit of working here, pensions are dead and with every contract renewal you will be paying more for your benefits or will be working more hours because the company isn't comfortable with making less than 1.2 billion per month. If its any less than that, there will be less techs and more work for you to do...hope you don't like a hot dinner."
good,"We report into the CO office around 7:30 am login to your work book,"
good,Most enjoyable part of job is the atmosphere of workplace and assisting people via telephone. Compensation was great and fun workplace.
good,"overworked, overpaid with bad management.  I found the environment competiteve with no regard for the problems that minorities face in the workplace"
good,I answered calls from customers about their billing on their accounts and set up new service to be installed. The hardest part about the job was selling to customers that were already in delinquent status. The most enjoyable part was the incentives that came with the job.
good,"Leadership (in Denver) at this company is horrible. No clue how to coach, just manage. Every project is presented in a ""due yesterday"" approach."
good,this company job is unsecurity job.this comany not mnc company.
good,As long as you are a sales minded person and don't mind being on the phones for 8 hours a day this place gives you the potential of making good money without a college degree.
good,"I usually had mandatory overtime and worked long hours answering about 80 calls a day. I learned to how to be a great salesman in a chaotic, yet professional call center. Management was fair and my co-workers were very friendly. The hardest part of my job was always finding new ways to make my monthly goal, which was raised every month. I enjoyed the great benefits, and they paid really well."
good,Work at home - customer service job that focused on sales rather than helping customers and supporting their issues with the telephone or computer or TV.
good,"When  I started with Century Link I enjoyed my position. I like helping people. I enjoyed the learning the technical aspects of how the internet works, and learning about the different operating systems and devices that require internet connections. Everyday was solving puzzles to get people back on line. I was promoted very quickly to level two within three months where I learned how to access the main pieces of equipment and help solve more complicated issues. I did these job duties for and a year and was praised by level three and level four technicians as well as team members and supervisors from other departments. However every time I applied for a position at the next level when an opening was announced I was overlooked.  Even for an overflow backup position. My supervisor, who is wonderful, kept encouraging me to keep applying. I did so multiple times without any response. The job it self is fine , it can be taxing sometimes when you are speaking with someone who is not tech savvy . But you find creative ways to explain technology in non-technological terms. "
good,"A good company to learn things."
good,Seems bean counters and outsourcing is more important than the techs on the ground facing customers in their territory everyday.
good,I use to really enjoy working here but over the last two years the amount of  meetings each day has doubled.  It seems like we are more spinning our wheels with document requirements that are not really used and meetings overkill that it takes away from actually coding and development time.
good,A typical day at Centurylink is very upbeat. I learned how to provide superior customer service. I enjoyed my co-workers they were the best.
good,"Management often micromanages and takes good ideas from support staff and claims them as their own with no acknowledgement of who originated the idea. While all customer service companies have benchmarks for performance, Centurylink viewed them as a hard line  doctrine rather than something that could be discussed pending the extended time spent with the customer resolved their issues rather than perpetuated them to meet a call handle time."
good,If you like being pressured daily and good at sales its a good place to work.
good,Qwest was a challenging place to work with high expectations for sales some of the things that happened went against my ethical standards. If you would like to know more I would gladly expound on the subject in person. 
good,"Enjoyed working within my immediate organization, but opportunities for growth were limited as were benefits and job security."
good,"Management was a nightmare, constantly pressuring new employees and make them feel outside of the collective workplace group. Everything else was pretty good, but bad management is really a deal breaker for me."
good,"If you enjoy selling a lot and being yelled at by people on the phone over their billing issues, this is the job for you."
good,"Working for CenturyLink is a basic call center environment. Very structured, and limiting. There is very little chance for advancement, management seems rather disenchanted, as do most employees. There is very little joy in the job and it seems most are just earning a paycheck and nothing more."
good,"The company's executive leadership has done a good job of keeping the headquarters in the sleepy town of Monroe, LA for a long time, forcing employees, management and leadership from other metro areas to relocate, most with pay cuts, pushing out higher salaries with layoffs or corporate reorganizational moves and hiring local grads for cheap in Monroe and surrounding areas, plus pushing for IT outsourcing in their operations in India which has offers huge cost savings but slowing processes and wearing down internal employees psyche with less experienced resources. Co-workers are overworked and most underpaid. It is a slow grind that can wear you out."
good,Now that's it's Century Link they have new expectations for their reps & will fire you if you don't hit your numbers. Very stressful due to micro managing styles of upper management.
good,Worked for Qwest during their financial collapse. Many people laid off. Those of us us who remained were given muliple responsibilities outside our scope of knowledge and alternating schedules that rotated among all three shifts. Good training.
good,"I spent my days doing spreadsheets and fixing billing problems for large business customers, CenturyLink had purchased Embarq and was converting billing systems. I was in charge of a queue in that billing system (Citrix) and had to correct billing mistakes caused by the system conversion. I also spent a lot of time re-rating customers long distance and international long distance bills in the Cixtrix billing system. I learned a lot about data entry and billing systems and how to get a lot of things done on a computer. Unfortunately I went through a temp agency called Superior Staffing that was fired and a lot of people were not hired on full time as a result. I relocated to San Diego within a month after leaving this job. I had a lot of fun with the people that I worked with. It was in the central office in Mansfield, Ohio. I enjoyed working full time first shift, I had a lot of free time in the evening to spend with my family."
good,Working at CenturyLink can be a great experience with a good compensation plan if you have previous LEC experience and get assigned a good module. The culture is very conservative and the company rarely does team building events or fun activities.
good,A big player in their sector located in St Louis. They had a number of management problems during the time period I worked for them.
good,You have long hours because you get alot of mandatory overtime. There are always changes being made at any given moment.
good,great people and culture. family culture. Vacation days are good. Company matches 401K.  Competitive salaries and bonuses. CEO is a great leader and cares about the people.
good,"Fast paced day, always something new on each call from our customer base and you always learn something new that you had not experienced before in network routing and in providing services for our customers. "
good,Senior leadership at the time never spoke with employees and sent down unrealistic sales goals and then used the missed quotas to do mass layoffs. Come to find out they were prepping for a merger between Qwest and CenturyLink and unfortunately the people suffered because of it.
good,"Typical day is spend dealing with systems and trying to get other groups to do anything."
good,"I liked working for them but a beter op came up and I took it. "
good,The company appears to be scaling back and opportunity for advancement is scarce. The job is high pressure with unrealistic goals. Management is out of touch.
good,CenturyLink values their customers but expects more and more job functions from its employees.  The job expectations do not match the job titles.  If work can be outsourced then this is the direction CTL would take.
good,"Good work-life balance"
good,We changed managers three times in the last 2 years. Three different levels of knowledge and experience. 2 of the three didn't understand our channel program whatsoever. Nepotism runs wild within these walls.
good,"Management can never tell you what's going on. They're lost which makes you lost. They stress handle time yet, can't do what you do. The place is a joke now"
good,"Stressful environment. Very little appreciation for employees. A lot of disgruntled, unhappy employees. One minute they want you to work work work, but they do not want to pay you overtime."
good,"Typical large company, employees are expendable.There are a lot of great people at CenturyLink. Overall a good company to work for. Poor decision making at the executive level."
good,Their compensation is on the lower side. Work challenges are above average and the people are great. The company became so big in a short time that there was a negative change in how management treats their employees.
good,"As a whole the company doesn't pay very well it is often considered a ""tech farm"". The company is always in transition but give you resources need to grow your skill set."
good,CenturyLink has phenomenal products and a clear vision to growth their technology offers. The challenge now are still with the integration of the former Level 3 acquisition.
good,You know what your getting your self into in a call center environment. It’s stressful with no job security. There is a union which can be good and bad depending on your experience.
good,"Need to hire more engineers to manage workload."
good,"Everyday became more stressful. Screaming callers angry at the company, taking it out in the worker. I worked there for 5 years and every year my mental health felt as if it declined a little more. I was working for a position promotion for almost a year but training was never completed, and they went ahead and had me doing the work for both my original department and the one I was trying to transituon to."
good,"While the dress code was great and the people were nice, everyone was always worried about their job going away.  No security in their positions or the longevity of CenturyLink staying in Monroe."
good,"Micromanagement yourself, but if you know how to do your job you really don't need a manager. I loved the work I did to help people with their issues."
good,"Its an ok company to work for, but at my current location there is no room for advancement nor applying skills that require certifications. Overall, the company provides you with uniforms and decent bonuses."
good,Overall enjoy the culture but have never worked with managers who bring their personal dislikes of people into a business and prevent individuals from receiving the incentives and advancements they deserve.
good,Enjoyed working with the team and beautiful building to work at. I Iearned alot about working with various state tax laws. The hardest part of the job were the long hours during tax season.
good,"The company has gone through many mergers and acquisitions during the 32 years of my employment.  I have been able to learn and take on many new positions and projects.  I sincerely love the work that I do, but the downsizing and constant reorganization has made it difficult to support the network groups that require my assistance."
good,Since I've worked with CenturyLink we've had several acquisitions occur. This has led to increasing operations needs (supporting legacy systems) while reducing headcount. The company struggles to maintain a leading edge in the Telcom space.
good,"With this company continuously turning over in ownership there was not much room for growth. "
good,The most important benefits for the time I have been at CenturyLink was gaining Program Management and Business Analytics experience.  This experience has helped me grow professional by looking at the business from a different perspective. I was able to gain experience protecting and driving revenue growth and assisting leadership with overall strategy to achieve their annual goals.
good,"Some managers have no idea what the employee is doing "
good,"CenturyLink, unfortunately could be a great company. However, they  are not committed to their employees. There are no development or growth opportunities. A perk is that company does  encourage and provide  work life balance, but you find that it varies on case by case basis with manager and depends on the role.  Overall, I would recommend CenturyLink but with caution."
good,"A typical day begins with looking or reviewing the tickets in the Sr Engineer queue. Sometimes they consist of LEC, or an occasional L3 routing issue. If it's LEC issue we usually call them directly and work the issue. Generally is a misconfiguration somewhere within the LEC network. Also, we could be assigned some implementation activities. These include 100M Ethernet upgrades, site moves and CMRs (change management requests.) That requires reconfiguration of the routers/ESM switch , circuit upgrade which could lead to LEC/Troubleshooting. Anything is possible"
good,run with a hire people then lay off multiple times a year.  Very intelligent people in technical positions but upper management is not in touch.  Culture in the company is almost gone.
good,Managed financial network support for many of CenturyLinks major customers to the financial exchanges.  One good think about CenturyLink is they did partner with Global Knowledge and provided many occasions for offsite training.
good,"I took over retail management , and saw what the cost for rent was inside the malls.  I quickly put a plan together to move all stores out of the mall , and it took 6 months for C-level to decide."
good,"Job was fast paced and enjoyable. Learning was at a fast pace. Team dynamics were excellent. Plenty of opportunity to learn products, talk to potential clients."
good,Broadwing was bought by Level3 and I was let go and the rehired. Lasted a year and was let go a second time. All due to re-organizations and internal politics.
good,"Typical day is reactive and anticipating business questions from across the organization"
good,"This is not relevant to my job Search.  Some roles at CenturyLink are lucrative and demanding, others are necessary for the company to succeed, but are not valued by management."
good,I was very disappointed about how divided some of the departments within the organization were performing. S.ome people were very territorial and it made interacting with them very difficult
good,"This job paid the bills.  I was in the same position and there were other opportunities in other departments where I was better suited and those departments wanted me to interview but the current policy stated I had to be in my current position for a year before moving."
good,"CenturyLink was great in the beginning and then we had to go into the office every day. Since I live 65 miles away, this became a burden on me. They are also not very good at paying your commission."
good,"Centurylink is a fun place to work, and I've had opportunities for advancement here. The culture varies considerably from group to group, so it's difficult to give it a fair rating."
good,"Enjoyed my job on a day-to-day basis. Position required attention to detail with no supervision. Position was eliminated, was laid off with no notice, minimal separation package."
good,It can be a fun place to work. There are multiple ways to get training. I think management could be more supportive of people. I enjoyed being able to buy dinner for the Techs every couple of months.
good,"CenturyLink was a good place to work until the CEO managed a buyout of Level 3 communications. Level three management took over, Glen Post resigned. Many were layed off and those of us left are expected to work like dogs"
good,new management took over and ran the tv side into the ground with poor ideas and bad management of outside plant.The work place became to much of a a who you played golf with and hung out with to even get considered for any position ofadvancement
good,"The company was great when i started in 2010 "
good,"Gave me a career for many years, but not a lot of advancement room.  I learned a lot, made a lot of connections and always had a good work environment."
good,"You come into work and are responsible for your time. Tardy and absence dings WFM though - they often screw up when correcting a time or putting your time off in so you get written up anyway. In tech support, you take calls from people needing their service fixed. You have about 12 - 15 mins per call to resolve it. This is one of the metrics they require, first call resolve. If this customer calls back for any reason, it dings you and your rating goes down. Hardest part of this job is how helpless you are when you can't fix it because you don't have access to the tools which they frequently take away. You, instead have to call other depts to essentially do your job. Care often disconnects customers and sets up new service so they get the commission, tech support of course get that call to fix what was cancelled. No one in mgmt seems to care about this.Frequent hang ups from other agents not wanting to do their job, and mgmt has no way of tracking who so it is left alone as well. Don't get me wrong their are good, passionate supervisors here. Some, not so much. On the up side, they do have schedule bidding! But again, that to is frustrating. You spend 2 years moving up the ladder so you can work early, only to have them change the policy, add new groups and all of a sudden your working until 10 pm again. You do get pay raises every 6 months, it caps at $16/hr. You get 10 days vacation time, 4 days of personal paid time off and 2 days of paid priority time off. This may change from years to year based on the union agreement. Decent Union. Fees are fairly low. If you participate"
good,"My typical day starting with 20 prospecting calls, some inbound call, and preparing for appointment that were previously setup. "
good,"Good pay, poor management, poor work life balance. If you start out as a tech you will be on the bottom of the list for a long time. There are techs that have been a C-link since the 70s. Good luck getting vacation over any of the holidays/fishing opener/hunting opener/ ect."
good,i can say that i enjoy most of people who were employed there . people are willing to train and make sure you know how to do your job properly and efficiently
good,"Overall Good Experience with centurylink will get learning scope and we can upgrade skills. Work life balance.Good Benefits. Job security, Management is good. Job culture is fine."
good,"No processes.  Horrible high level overview training.  More questions than answers on how to do your job so you can efficiently and effectively help the customers.  My personal Manager is the best, but hands are tied to make improvements."
good,"I really enjoy the work, but the micromanagent and pay isnt worth it. Special projects leads to alot of learning, but no rewards or recognition even when out of your skillset."
good,"The job was okay. Typical call center. If you're looking to advance, it's pretty hard. I was promised a training position but never was hired on full- time."
good,"NOC Center"
good,Contract Position for World Bank and IFC employees in Washington DC. Competitive salary and benefits were offered as well as PC purchasing options available through working advantage.
good,"They recently changed leadership,  stopped giving holiday bonus cause they're too poor to pay it , butt gave see drag millions of dollars I  bonuses to they leadership. "
good,Is is a job where you must always try to convince people to buy new products who are upset about company about billing no show appointment or who have been miss quoted company services and cost
good,"Average place to work. Way too much management.  Not enough management that knows what they are doing.  Poorly structured, not good direction.  Not a career move"
good,"The Portland, OR CenturyLink Engineer and Operations Branch is employs and manages good people.  But the company is in a transitional state and very little is currently adamant.  Employees are often left in the dark until decisions have been made.  For 2017, there were no holiday bonuses, or yearly raises for instance."
good,Overall my experience with Centurylink has been pleasant a little stressful for but I cannot complain my jobs requires for me to work at a consistent pace and ensure that all the customers needs are met. I wouldn't change anything about my current job with the company
good,"A typical day either has me covering one or all of our Northern Arizona central offices. I maintain all types of circuits ranging from POTS to SONET. I have learned that there's always more to learn. My desire was to be a manager, but the culture was and in my opinion still is really bad. The hardest part of my job is seeing a once dominant company sinking more and more each year. The most enjoyable part of my job is to turn up a SONET product for a customer and see the happiness and excitement on their face."
good,Though the company is labeled as unionized the union support is in management.The company work is fine but the supervisors do not have your back and your coworkers will betray yourconfidence.
good,"I started with the company (then CenturyTel) in the early 2000's, but the corporate culture has changed significantly along the way. Our customers and employees used to be important to the company, but more recently the focus has shifted to the shareholders. As a result, the bigger the company got, the less our customers cared.  This also has resulted in many folks being downsized (which is likely to keep happening for at least the duration of 2018)."
good,"Before Qwest, I worked for LCI. Then, after LCI was bought by Qwest, the whole place changed for the worse. I was moved from sales and forced into the customer service side and all of the drama that comes from that department. Absolutely horrible!!!"
good,"Long hours, no support from management, not work/life balance. Great benefits, 401K, health and life insurance are great, and they pay well. CenturyLink is located in many states."
good,"Excellent pay and compensation "
good,"Enjoyed my time at Centurylink, if you are skilled at following directions and are coachable you can have a very successful sales career. Definitely a competitive sales environment, they push agents to overcome objections and push past sales goals, even if they are sometime not needed products. They are growing as a company in adding lots of regulations and call components, but still have a long way to go to catch up with the changing telecom industry. Great start to a career, just be aware when you go in that they have high attendance standards and very get choosey on who make flex them more than others."
good,Management takes care of themselves. Advancement potential is very limited. With the acquisition by CenturyLink employees do not know where they stand with continuing employment and management is not making it a point to tell them. So people are in limbo.
good,"Nothing special, It was a Job-like any other. Very little training. I relied on learning platform basics myself. Benefits were being taken away and the crew was reduced meaning more tasks and requirements."
good,Bought by Century Link so the company will be commpltely different. Was good while I was there but I expect lots of changes. Maybe things will get better over time.
good,"productive and can be fun, really stressful and strict policies when it comes to attendance. you have to be the kind of person that doesn't take it personal when an angry customer  calls in and screams for no reason."
good,I'm on a team that is scattered throughout the country and consequently have very little face to face communications with any one.  I sit in a cube with no one else around. There is little collaborative work being done and have been pigeon holed in a silo.  I'm want to branch out in an environment that offers a more friendly atmosphere.
good,"Overall, this is a OK job. However, when an abundance of work comes in and needs to be done by a certain time, management does not help employees get the work done. They threaten their employee's jobs (even if you make your productivity mark every month). Basically, they try to use the ""Scare Tactic"" to get what they want. I did very well working here but there was a zero opportunity to advance within the company (without being Salary based)."
good,"Every call was a new issue. Almost never the same thing twice. Lack of teamwork. Everyone too busy to help someone else. No break between calls. One after the other. Some overtime. Did not get paid for overtime. Job was a salary job."
good,"Lack of proper guidance and supervision. Need longer training classes. Need better help on the floor, need to be flexible to life crisis. Would like an open door policy with upper management."
good,I worked in Fiber Protection for five years. I read maps basically for 12 hours per shift. After the CEO was indicted there were company-wide layoffs.
good,"Was a nice company to work for. Good pay and benefits. Cared about customers and employees. That ALL changed when merged to become Centurylink."
good,"Centurylink Cloud is team based. Everyone worked together and was willing to help at the drop of a hat within the NOC team. "
good,This company does not pay their employees well and does not have a very good benefits package. It is union based and you have to bid for your work schedule every three months. I think they could do a lot better at providing their employees with more opportunities to advance.
good,On a day to day basis you did not know where the company was going. There was alot of turmoil at the Sr. Level that it caused the company unease.  Major layoffs happened due to this.
good,"Transition can create opportunity.   "
good,"Outside sales team treated like in side sales"
good,The company has not figured out what identity it wants to take on.  Too many management changes in the last  few years. They need to get great at something before trying to be good at a lot of things.
good,Its a typical environment with very sedate and monotonous working environment with no appreciation from management side as well as no advancement at workplace.
good,"Company has grown rapidly by acquisitions.  Solid business technology solutions with impressive global network capabilities.  However, extremely complex internal processes with disparate systems that creates an challenging environment to sell confidently in."
good,"Loved my job @ CenturyLink, i would have stayed until retirement age if i could have.  I wish management would think more of the employee and the customer rather than how much money they can make."
good,Sales goals went up and up for years until 60 to 70 percent of people were written up and on paper.  Management was like big brother looking over your should. Company started firing everyone after a while.
good,"Customers constantly called in about aging or faulty products and would curse at techs. Techs were the first, sometimes second after a foreign operator, person for the customer to vent at. Others were frustrated that techs couldn't help with certain products like gmail, yahoo e-mail, or Windows log in without paying another fee."
good,"CTL is going through extreme revenue and sales challenges. The legacy side of the business (Phone, Long DIstance, etc.) is declining  due to the technology becoming obsolete. CTL has tried to combat this by getting into Hosting, but they are now competing with Amazon, Microsoft and Rackspace...and simply cannot compete."
good,"Recently had a great manager leave, and second level hired another person who is completely incompetent about how a phone company works.  Also, KS techs are treated differently than the MO techs who are in the same local and have the same contract."
good,"CenturyLink is going through growing pains.  They still aren't sure who they are and what they sell, which makes it difficult to be a sales rep for them.  Goals and focus are a constantly changing target.  Management seems completely out of touch with the daily hurdles that need to be overcome.  Promises have been made to numerous new reps, that are dismissed as soon as they are hired."
good,Did the bests I could do under the circumstances.  Poor training available.  Too many tasks involved in processes to become proficient in anything.
good,"I spent my entire career at Century Link (PNB, US WEST, Qwest). I started in the business office after college. Moved to inside sales to outside sales and eventually sales management. "
good,"Intense sales training when you onboard for 2 weeks in Denver, Colorado. Then there was a second session for new hires about 6 months later for 1-2 weeks in Denver with other sales folks from around the country. Once back in your assigned territory, there were not many resources/marketing tools to access and research information on prospective clients. Sales targets were sensible, but it was rare for sales engineers and technical folks to come onsite with you to client appointments, which was challenging, because it is a different experience when you are on the phone/webex vs. face-to-face with the client/prospect."
good,They are so worried about sales and are so very strict on things and there is no support. the sales pressure is beyond stressful and there is no clear understanding
good,"CenturyLink is a telecommunications company with headquarters in Monroe, Louisiana as well as a large presence in Denver, CO."
good,"High paced work environment, with ability to work independently or as a team. Great benefits for union employees. We operate in 37 states so the opportunity to move around the country is available."
good,"I was a mid-level manager in the provisioning department for 7 years after the Level 3 buy out.  Integrations are always tough, but this one was especially difficult because there were six other companies being integrated at the same time.  Within the 7 years I was there, the integration was never completed, but Level 3 decided to buy up more smaller telecom companies, which created even more integration chaos.  There were several changes at the VP level during that time with some good people getting squeezed out replaced with ""brother in laws and buddies"".  They said they wanted an ""employee owner"" culture, but their actions were different than their words.  Forced bell curve employee evaluations were the norm, but nobody ever used the words ""bell curve"" and they denied this was happening company wide.  The networks are great, but the culture is deceiving.  This is a great place to get technical training on voice, IP and transport, but don't buy into the culture they are trying to sell."
good,"Collaborated with C-Level leadership on understanding particular business needs, providing detailed competitive analysis and clearly demonstrating value on a portfolio of services including DDoS/IT security functions, cloud solutions, managed services, disaster recovery, leading edge network management tools, improved scalability, and business continuity.  "
good,"I've been working for Centurylink for over 20 months now, and while the employees are good people, and the starting pay is fair, the management at the current location I am at now is terrible.  "
good,Loved the job the money was good and lots of benefits but way to much was placed on sales and I could not try and con a old woman on ssi to take tv services she didn't need
good,Fun place to work with multiple team interests always involving you. But that quickly wears off as you see the job force there roll off.
good,"- Typical day: Hi stress, Challenging, Long hours"
good,.job can be high stress.all calls are in billing que with a hard chance of sales conversion.takes a real confident person to do well or a real not so honest person.i have worked in sales all my life and i didnt see much advancement commission wise .
good,Very poor efficiencies.  Process flow is the worst I've seen in years.  Too many groups involved to get the simplest things done.  They need to learn it's ok to have skilled employees performing multiple tasks.
good,"Solid company, great aspirations, needs to focus more on integrating the various acquired companies so that the customer experience improves."
good,"I enjoyed working with so many wonderful people and developed strong, lasting relationships with customers. The toughest part of the job was the transition while the company was merging with another company."
good,One of the best bi telcos but they are struggling to transform into an IT services company.  Layoffs occur nearly every year.
good,"fun workplace, good working culture, timings,flexibility, no time restictions, enjoyble, good office location , maintainead/kneat/clean office but future growth"
good,While it is a good place to work and provides a good living the management left a lot to be desired.  Management had no real direction refused to take suggestions from employees causing employees to be intimidated and to keep their heads down.
good,Co workers are great people. Company going through Management restructure. Has a great cafe. The campus is really nice in the Broomfield area.
good,"The EMBARQ culture was great. Once acquired by CenturyTel it was a bit more divisive. There seemed to be an us-versus-them culture and it hasn't been resolved. The minnow swallowed the whale, but the minnow wasn't as prepared to fully digest."
good,Nice place to work if you are just starting out. Management styles vary depending on business group.  Expect some long hours.
good,"Good hours, and location but company morals aren't good. They are a good place to work if you are good at selling products and services, but other than that not a good place to work also have to pay for your own parking, or try to find free parking downtown,"
good,Very focused on driving revenue at all costs. Loved working with my co-workers and manager. Great team.
good,high turnover because sales quota is too high for anyone to hit without lying to customers.
good,"Would take incoming phone calls. Helping customers set up new service, taking pmts, scheduling repairs."
good,"good  coworkers . learned about customer service, was fun while it lasted"
good,"Typically started with meetings with customer technical contact to other work specifics such as gathering details for network requirements."
good,"A typical day at work would be going to meet clients, and helping them learn how to attain jobs."
good,"Centurylink was a good place to work with great people, till this last year. The center in Logan is closing as of June so they are letting everyone go"
good,"Call center environment"
good,job variety good never the exact same work.management good but not very knowledgeable.
good,Company Looted by CEO there was no commissions paid last four six months I worked there.
good,"False impersonation of caring for there employees. Top ended toward executives as far as income. No consideration toward there employees as far as weather conditions. Doubling work loads. Continued on demand overtime instead of hiring extra personal. Management non caring about working conditions for field service techs. Most managers have no idea what their even managing or what it takes to do the jobs they are so called managing. Coworkers extremely knowledgeable in their assignments and willing to give their all especially in the I@M department but are continuously scrutinized well above the rest of the technicians associated with duties."
good,This is a great place to work for. Things are constantly changing.
good,"Extreme workload, difficult dead lines. Absent supervisor ,except when he had some one breathing down his neck. then he would give me grief.  Often when I had problems requiring his attention, I would have to track him down at the golf course."
good,"I am new to Centurylink, and I am felling my way. I need more direction for my new job, and am reaching out to my supervisor for help. I really would like to make this new career work"
good,"I enjoyed working for Centurylink very much, the company rewarded and recognized individuals for the great lengths they went to for the company,and included certified education certification in their training process.Wile working for Centurylink I maintained a monthly quota with both sales and customers, Centurylink sent the sales team to local and statewide events, and held many store events. The location (corporate store) and position I worked at Centurylink was both fun and very fast paced and I enjoyed  managent as well as all of my co-workers"
good,A typical day at work would be anwsering phones and assisting customers with opening new accounts questions about products and services on current accouts as well as billing issues.
good,"Rigid Schedules"
good,"I took a variety of calls everyday and would upsale on each and every call. I had to use 5-10 operating systems while talking to customer. It was my job to make sure the customer felt understood and problem was going to be solved. While talking to the customer I need to review their account/s and make sure they were getting the very best deal possible. I enjoy variety, I love learning new things. I love to have a change of environment as well. I am dependable a hard worker and outgoing. I can and will do anything that is requested of me."
good,CenturyLink is a very high stress job and because of that I was unable to perform the job. Sales quotas of that magnitude where almost unobtainable. The management was kind but the policies where not good.
good,Work at home position within the Centurylink phone company for the residential billing service department. With the home phone becoming obsolete the primary purpose here was to assist Centurylink in expanding their customer outreach through identifying areas of opportunity among callers to offer our products.
good,don't use it! i learned the hard way that everything starts from the permanent date not actual date of hire!
good,meeting new challenges each day and making things lighter on customers.
good,"Did not like how managment treated their employees and how corporate did things when new employees started on their first day. I've had better first ""days"" at other companies."
good,Good Benefits but pay varies on comission and high quotas and expectations but not well trained
good,"I know that Sales makes a company grow, but this company forgot to take care of customers and pushed sales rather than service. Any employee that tried to help the customer and got put on the chopping block. exmple customer has all products that they offered and they wanted you to add more than what the cstomer needed. I feel this company could have been great if they redid their values and took care of customer needsfirst and sales second. Advancment for only TOP performers on their sales charts. Family doesn't matter or health I watched employees so sick have to get taken out by Ambulence, and then get written up for it because they couldn't call out sick do to company proceedures."
good,I was very lucky I work here for 11 years(which is rare) This companyu has very high goals and has a very high employee turnover
good,"A typical day at CenturyLink consists of taking calls back to back until the end of the day. Each call has to do with either some type of internet issue or email problem. I learned how DSL technologies work, and a bit about networking. A manager is assigned to around 20-30 employees. Offices are in cubicles, and very little communication happens between coworkers. The hardest part of the job is to get the call in the call metrics that CenturyLink demands. The most enjoyable part of the job is to help out customers and get their service up and running."
good,The company is overall a fairly good corporation. I quickly moved up to a management position year after I started working there due to to my sales performance. But that was the company was Qwest. There have been alot of changes as far as payment structure and policies since the company merged with Century Link. The merge completes April 1st 2012.
good,This is a great place to gain some experience but the job is demanding which is not a problem if the compensation was good.
good,"I left Savvis late in 2010. While there, I worked in a support department. Since I left, Savvis was acquired by CenturyLink, and the manager I worked for has left the company. My ratings reflect my experience there, so someone considering Savvis would be better served to consider reviews of those who have more recent experience with the company."
good,"Great at Work-life balance, it had a flexible schedule with good PTO that allowed me to continue with the outside items I enjoyed doing.  The company was very supportive of my career advancement."
good,"Good co-workers"
good,"Management willing to assist you with tools to succeed; Work load can vary day to day with potential to increase based on company needs. Workplace culture is one that is helpful, sometimes even family like depending on your team."
good,"Decent place to work.  Ongoing struggle to stop revenue loss. Many were laid off due to the revenue issues.  Difficulty with unions, too many to deal with effectively and get better benefits than non union employees."
good,"Ever since the Level 3 acquisition, Centurylink has started to micromanage everything, work/life balance is decreasing. All performance is rated by metrics and many areas of your work cannot be measured by their metrics."
good,I worked for the company for 15 years and for the last 4 I was a business trainer.  I was sent an email at 8 from my director I've never met and it had HR cc'd on it asking my co-workers and I to get on a call at 11.  We knew tight then and there we were getting laid off.
good,"My former colleagues and my last Supervisor were the best! A lot changed after the merger with Level 2..., huge culture shift....I've since taken early retirement over a year ago."
good,"As per the work, it is a very good place to learn and excel. The problem comes with the management. For management hard work doesn't matter and you can't grow until you become their favorite. "
good,Interesting company to work for during merger.  Old time Mountain Bell employees working with new CenturyLink employees did create some challenging cultural items.
good,This company is not the worst or the best place to work.  The pay and benefits are ok but the quotas are random and unfair.  The company has bloated middle management.
good,Fair practices. Not much room for advancement. On call duties include mandatory response within 15 minutes to emergency calls no matter your circumstance 24 hours a d seven days a week.
good,"I had fun working there and definitely a place of opportunity but due to the seniority that exist there, it's hard to grow. i would still work for them."
good,"Quotas difficult to achieve, micromanagement is excessive.  Products and Network is one of the best in the nation/world.  Great support from coworkers.  Difficult to weed through processes and procedures, very complex."
good,"Having gone through 3 previous mergers, this last merger with Level 3 I do not think ended well in the 2nd year as the plans kept shifting which frustrated many people and those that could leave did so."
good,"Had monthly competitions, food brought in for some meetings, co-workers were nice, management was ok. Call flow was changed so that some co-workers got new accounts, while others got complaint calls."
good,I had 22 years in with Centurylink.  They were a decent company to work for.  I had no real issues with the company; some of the people in my department were another story though.
good,"that's about all you will get. some groups are good others, medicre.  management is open to work / life balance.  company is going to struggle to find itself in the future."
good,"Good  job, poor management, seems like company in transition. Copper lines are adding plant and it seems that the company is not interested in putting in the money to expand new tech"
good,"The pay is wonderful, as well as compensation, PTO, and other benefits. The Downside is the lack of job security, if you can't meet the sales goal you will be fired, even as a new hire that's on the right track."
good,"The pay and benefits at CenturyLink were great. However, the staff at CenturyLink did not take into consideration some of my health defects. This along with the want to get out of Idaho Falls resulted me to leave CenturyLink."
good,"Culture is promoted but not followed.  Advancement is typically given to those that are not the most qualified, but to those that are part of the original CTL framework and organization."
good,"Average, products were somewhat uncoordinated in that they did not seem to have a clear marketing goal, messaging to customers was muddled. Support channels for frontline employees were not innovative."
good,It is a great place to work if you go into work and don't get involved in the salesperson dynamics of others. I worked for the union so this place has turned out to be anti- union.
good,"Very busy and exciting challenges to solve every day."
good,Your work life during the day is fast paced. Somewhat average training. Typical call center job. Overall expendable. Hardest part is balancing all the requirements per call.
good,"I was always busy. More work than time to do it in. Management was good on some levels and down right awful on others. I learned to do things most other people don't do in their entire careers. I built relationships that have survived long after I left. The people there can be some of the hardest working and most undervalued. "
good,"good company to work for but requires dedication and long hours. Management is detached and does not care about employees only results."
good,Level 3 was acquired by CenturyLink and all leadership from CenturyLink has been replaced by former LVL3 Exec. The whole company is in a state of uneasiness due to the constant restructure of the company.  Many Customers are very frustrated.
good,The raises were inconsistent and rarely covered cost-of-living. The bonus structure is OK. The benefits are about what you would expect from a large company. It’s very hard to get a leg up or get into management. Overall not a bad Company to work for but certainly not the best either. I have no real issues or grievances with them. I feel I’ve been treated fairly and I have been there 20 years.
good,"the pay is livable. ever changing environment. you have to network excessively to remain viable in this environment. survival of the fittest based on who you know, not what you know."
good,It was a great place to work.  Over the past few years the industry seems to be struggling.  Most hourly employees that have more than 10 years with the company believe they had a long career ahead of them.  It has become harder to keep a position due to work force reductions and the lack of investment into facilities which is needed to drive increased revenue.
good,The recent merger with Level 3 provided new opportunities for the company to merge multiple business process and systems. Work in this area has been slow and has increased the challenges for employees to comply with metric evaluations
good,Not a good fit for me. Since the merger the new management is destroying some of the programs that helped to make them successful. This is going to be the downfall of a lot of good employees.
good,No strategy that links employee performance with business goals. Attempts they made at getting employee input were not responded to our investigated. They had no process to determine the profit of the agreements after a client signed an agreement
good,"The position is a key support position. Line Supervisors load product and merchandise into the concession stands, check dates on existing products, and ensure the cleanliness is up to standard. Leadership and communication skills are also crucial to the job. "
good,"Very dedicated company, undergoing a lot of great transitions.  Very segmented and cross functional teams do not communicate well.  However I believe with the acquisition of level 3 a lot of great changes are to come in the gaps that were present during my time of employment."
good,"Company worried about losses but does not seem to know what is good or bad for business.  Instead of attempting to sell a product they dump a ton of money into, they scrap it and just let it go to waste."
good,The job was rewarding. I worked four different jobs during my time there. There are wonderful people working there. Training there is beneficial. You are able to use it readily
good,"The management was really interested in the metrics.  The environment had a very cliquey and not real good team work, their was a lot of attitude that was interfering with the work or training,"
good,"Though the company provides employees the opportunity to apply for internal positions, Managers are able to prevent experienced employees from getting interviews and moving to other areas of the company.  This is very discouraging, especially if you work in business unit that is not growing."
good,"As a former employee of CenturyLink, I would say the typical day involves many meetings to discuss integration with Level3 products, systems and processes.  The culture is one of acquisition, and the company is struggling to merge Level3 with the CenturyLink CLEC side of the business, while the ILEC side remains basically static."
good,"No Comment I refuse to talk about the company publically, even with anonymity. I believe that it can be taken both positively and negatively and don't wish to have that displayed in a forum related to job searching. Everyone has their own opinion and I don't believe in influencing others in that way."
good,It is still a bell head run company / days are stressful and long . the people that actually get the work done are great and willing to help right now company is trying to figure out what it should be after the level 3 merger / take over
good,"Rapidly changing company with L3 merger, from reps, management and services products and systems.  Hard for selling and positioning with customers. Alot of weeks and time training constant training  Co-workers and team were great"
good,A high paced and detailed oriented job at a very large company. Focused on client needs and encouraged problem solving in a teams and on you own where it may require in-depth planning and knowledge. Many knowledgeable people willing to help and teach to provide you with additional tools to better complete your tasks.
good,"Due to a recent merger, and the fact that experience wildly varies from team-to-team, I can't accurately describe the company. Currently, my experience has been rushed, stressed, and with a lack of vision/leadership. This is primarily caused by upper management either not fully understanding or not fully caring about the reality of what they're expecting. People are failing to meet expectations due to expectations being created with incomplete information."
good,"In an 8 hour shift, I took anywhere from 700-1400 calls per day. I was able to do either directory or operator assistance.  The variety was good.  The high pressure of so many calls per day was detrimental to my health."
good,"I never saw my manager except during the one disciplinary meeting for attendance after I came back from a medical leave for a leg disorder. Never had a one on one, despite being scheduled for one every two weeks, which he was always ""out of town"" for."
good,"Daily meetings, admin work and support, write requirements and processes and meet with clients. "
good,Good pay with decent benefits but don;t expect loyalty or any help when you need it.  No plan for career advancement or mapping and unless requests align with the company then assistance will njot be given usually.  You best be out for yourself and not there as a company cheerleader.
good,A large diverse company that is going through the aftermath of a large acquisition. The middle management structure is staffed with a team that does not fully comprehend the entire portfolio or fully understand the radical shift that major corporations are having to address with respect to information technology. Senior leadership has their roots and understanding based on the technology approach from 15-20 years ago.
good,"Care not to comment on any portions of my job, the management, the corporate culture, a typical day on the job, any hard or enjoyable parts of the job."
good,"Company is currently undergoing restructuring, somewhat friendly environment.   Procedures are in constant change and management makes an honest effort to communicate expectations."
good,"The local office is great,  unfortunately the executive team runs the company like a telephone company in the 1980s.  You will need to chase down and implement projects of your own initiative here."
good,"I took the position @ CenturyLink as a Data Center Engineer even though I was ove qualified for the position."
good,Working for century link is good. They are going through a lot of changes though and I feel some of the practices are unfair. The manager I have is very supportive and loyal to his employees. Because of him I appreciate century link more as a whole.
good,"I have worked at first Sprint/Embarq/Centurylink. It was a great place to work when it was Sprint, when the local company changed hands it went some place else. It drastically went down not family oriented like it used to be. Overall the company served it purpose I have obtained skills and work ethics that I can use in the future."
good,"I do not recommend anyone to work there. CenturyLink isn't a fun place to work at and is stressful, and most of the time you are fixing mistakes from other coworkers that just slammed customers with products just to make a profit."
good,They are constantly changing objectives. They will look company wide to see if you are hitting your numbers and even if a huge percentage of employees didn't even make half of the quota assigned  the company would continue to raise the quota. They would write people up for it.  I only missed quota once or twice in my time there- however they pushed you to sell internet to customers that already had 1 or 2 connections already.  In the retention department it was very common to have customers call complaining that they were set up with internets (and other services) that they never asked for.
good,"Mostly residential work, some end users are more challenging than others. Company does not want to invest in copper plant, some areas are only able to get 1.5 ADSL...."
good,I loved my job but was not willing to use some of their sales tactics to lure the customers in. I was constantly praised for my customer service and had the ability to make my customers satisfied and happy.
good,"Most days at work are a scramble to attend to the most urgent needs.  It's hard work to carve out time for strategic, forward thinking.  There's a pervasive attitude of fear of repercussions and failure, and current integration of merging corporations is a source of much frustration and blame."
good,stressful and hard management was great first few years were fun always games and contests with great prizes free lunches they had a management person whos responsibility was just to ensure morale
good,"Company pushes sales, rather than correct constant information. This is do to sale requirements. Has little care for employees. It has small discounts to long term customers. As the company grows it is hindered by profit building and low pay for quantity employees or quality. Overall the majority of the employees are upbeat and great to work for."
good,"Not all jobs are this way, but I work in a call center supporting large business customers and it is rather stressful. The job requires a lot of cross training knowledge which is not provided in a meaningful way so we're expected to ""wing it"" which is not ideal to say the least. Also, we are graded on how many tickets we work or calls we take which puts us in a situation of having to decide if we want to really help the customer or move on as fast as possible so we can get a better review. Communication from management is also lackluster at best so there are always processes changing without notice."
good,"Many employees only did enough to get by.  Loyalty practically non-existent.  Due to having several wirecenter responsibilities, I put in a lot of hours, a lot of mileage, and I worked many a weekend.  Problem is that I was working for a supervisor that was not as dedicated, who eventually threw me under the bus, and tried to use me as a scapegoat for failures in my area that I had inherited.  Eventually, that supervisor was replaced; but the damage had already been done to my reputation.  His replacement also inherited a mess that this supervisor had left him."
good,"I learned a lot about customer service, sales techniques, managements... In general it was an enriching experience. I left the company because for the last 2 years the compensation plan and the sales quota have made it very difficult to maintain the level of income we were used to obtain from our efforts. "
good,"The best part of working the ETAC was the co-workers. The worst part was the supervisor. Learned about many procedures and products associated with a large ISP. Example; QOS, working with LEC's, Fiber and GPON."
good,"Had a good experience here. Really enjoyed working with upper management. I am very appreciative of the experiences I gained here at this job, and the partners I got to work with."
good,"This company is really behind the rest of Telecom from system, process perspective. They lack strong executive management, due to the many mergers and aquisitions this company functions as several silos in one. Benefits package is not good and career growth does not exist."
good,"Good work life balance"
good,"poorly managed company. unsure of the direction in which company is headed. other than that, actual network infrastructure has to be improved so speeds can be competitive. lots of 4 mb, 8mb, 10 and 20 mbps areas."
good,"Fast paced, competitive work place. Receiving incorming calls from customers and/or representatives. Do have monthly sales and quality quotas.  The hardest part of the job is that it is repetitive.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers that you bond with. You also are able to see the improvement in representatives and the excitement when they reach their personal or company goal."
good,"Achieved business objectives by initiating new accounts with product knowledge, solution and services to consumers."
good,"Robust, challenging environment.  Plenty of opportunity to dig into interesting projects.  Environment is always changing due to multiple acquisitions."
good,"I worked contacting customers due to missed appointments. They were transitioning over to a new system which did not meet expectations so it was tough dealing with irate customers. "
good,"Be on time, stay consistent and always meet deadlines. The work place is very relaxed other wise. I loved the interactions with customers and co-workers."
good,Company had acquired several companies and also outsourced the Healthcare Benefits. They continue to work with a company that was in adequate and poor.
good,CenturyLink was my first experience in a call center environment and overall I managed to learn what was expected of me rather quickly. The job had it's challenges because we were required to retain customers from disconnecting services all while trying to sale them products. That was a bit frustrating because most times clients were just ready to discontinue with the company altogether.
good,"Meeting quota is stressful due to management changes, but people are fun to work with, not mundane, talk to interesting people, decent pay, great benefits"
good,Many projects on your plate at one time.  Seem to like quantity over quality.  Date driven and not quality driven.  Cut a lot of corners.  Terrible health insurance with very few if any merit increases.
good,Level 3 is not a bad place to work. The only thing is once you get in to this kind of career there is always the  chance some company out there is ready to buy it. The hardest part of my job was them stacking new processes on us without warning and without help.
good,very stressful position driven by unrealistic sales expectations with emphasis on making revenue rather than solving problems.  Culture problem in the post sales organization which equates to always over promising and under delivering.
good,"It is not what you know, but who. There are those who advance that should not have and those who are let go and should still have a job. I am all for change, but not the changes that effected me directly and the ones who were a great value to the company."
good,"When I worked there it was under huge transformation as it had aquired many other companies."
good,"It is a call center. "
good,"Hardworking people. "
good,"This is a good place to work, the pay is good, nice environment, friendly people, the benefits are good. located in a good location."
good,Employees must be willing to adhere to strict guidelines required of the job.  Mandatory overtime was necessary daily.  Employees must meet sales objectives while adhering to a number of calls to be taken per day and length of time on a call.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the other employees because they had an understanding of what each employee was subjected to.
good,"Good work environment and flexible work hours. The pay is decent. Some managers really care about you,  your work and appreciate your talents. But there're other managers enjoy people who can sweet talk more than who actually can do the work. "
good,"Trainings is horrible, management unknowledgeable, and scheduling/Policies are not up to date. Only good thing? The pay was decent for the amount of verbal abuse being used."
good,Very very stressful. Multiple system layers to sort through to accomplish tasks. Jump in and swim type training.  Difficulty acquiring needed information to complete projects from other groups. Ever-changing work systems. Band-Aid type quick process rather than fixing issues
good,"You are on the phone selling to businesses. You have to get along with the sales engineers. If you don't, you will be out of a job as the sales executive position is almost 80% reliant on the sales engineers. This is an extremely high stress position with the company."
good,The best thing about working for CenturyLink was my boss and my peers. They were always available to answer questions and assist with whatever I needed. I truly miss working with my boss and peers.
good,This company has many layers.  They have a very aggressive approach to sales and combining companies however they do not take account for the affect it be have on the customers.
good,I was treated very poorly by a supervisor for no grasping the information as quickly as others. Was knit picked on reviews for speaking up for myself and overall isn't a place I would go back to.
good,My hours at the time was great. I worked 7-330 that was a great shift. Worked really hard and it seem not to be appreciated. Everyone should be appreciated  for everything they do.
good,"Bellevue office is great, but Upper management shows no love to the people there and re-orgs have caused many problems. There are still some very talented people there that could make it work."
good,CenturyLink as a company has been a decent company to work for. Great benefits and options. However the work life balance at times can be challenging.
good,If you are working in those place it's a strong through job until you find something better. This job is not a great environment and it's very dull. Broken furniture has no positive vibe.
good,"Tough job, sales quotas were ridiculous. Most salespeople had to lie to the customers to meet the sales quotas. Fellow workers were good people. Management did not care about the workers at all."
good,"job was good but dealing with issues,the better you get,the worse it gets,they need to adjust overall job for high turnover/burnout"
good,During the last couple of years CenturyLink has decided that we should not pursue telephony and the quality of service to our customers went straight down hill.  I believe it may be cultural differences between what was then Qwest and CenturyLink.
good,Working for CenturyLink I have been given the opportunity to let me skillset shine. I moved up within the company after putting in a lot of work for 1 year. I began in an entry level position and was offered the trainer position thereafter. I have learned much about the business and myself as a leader. I have had difficulty establishing meaningful relationships with my management group but my peers have been wonderful. My training as both an entry-level rep and a trainer was mediocre. I know that CenturyLink is capable of better work in their training department. The most enjoyable part of working with this company has been the people. I have had a chance to meet traveling directors and other interesting folks that help build my network.
good,A typical day consist of talking with customers and clients with new or existing accounts. Maintaining good customer services and providing other sales opportunities. Making sure that all the customers needs are met and making offers for other services to increase revenue for the company and ourselves.Setting up new accounts and building a strong bond with you and them.
good,"The management at the call centers are pretty decent, but the higher ups really couldn't careless how well they take care of their call center employees. More interest is placed upon receiving calls than is on ensuring the proper tools are provided for the customers to receive exceptional service."
good,"It was a process trying to get outstanding bills paid from CEO's of Communications businesses, but at the end of the day, accomplishing all my tasks assigned was quite rewarding. Staff were split up into sections, so I only knew people who worked around me. We were given breaks which opened up time for conversation. Outside vendors served lunch in the cafeteria which meant we didn't have to leave work to grab a bite. The management team was very supporting and were there whenever we needed assistance."
good,"Company is still working on integrating several companies together.  Sometimes it feels like upper management isn't clear on the direction the company is going. I have learned a lot and been given several opportunities in the past. However, due to recent efforts the Minneapolis office is getting smaller and opportunities are getting less and less. "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was even though we had several employees we were like family.  The toughest part of the job was we were an office that was open 24/7 365 days a year.  Due to that fact the hours that we worked varied and it was difficult to get into a routine at times.
good,"In my career I've never stayed at a company for less than 4 years, but I've decided to resign from CenturyLink in just over one year."
good,"Great products, great technicians. Very poor training and no guidance provided by upper management. Expectations are never made clear, training is not available and any attempt to seek help is looked upon with derision."
good,Good Work Life balance. Rest all depend on your lead.Salary Hike is not good. Previously Salary hike was good when it was Qwest.
good,"On any given day I will have work that is due both that day as well as later in the week that needs to be wired and tested. These jobs include telephone, dsl, ds0, isdn, and T1 type circuits.  Along with those responsibilities I also test and assist with other technicians across a wide range of workgroups in the company.   During these test and troubleshooting calls we narrow and clear troubles on the above mentioned circuits.  We also may make necessary design changes to get services working properly as soon as possible.  I am also responsible for the yearly certification of this office and its equipment.  Those responsibilities include the cleaning and maintaining of multiplexers and switches which are crucial for the deployment of our services to customers in the general area and beyond. maintaining proper filing, labeling and storage of all components related to our equipment."
good,"I worked with an amazing group of individuals.  However, the company as a whole has some work to do.  Disconnected leadership and a clouded view on strategy has proved to create some major gaps across the corporation."
good,Company has gone downhill since being bought. The managers did allow me to work the latest shift so that I did not have to work weekends.
good,"Good work environment and very good peers to encourage"
good,"Not a fun workplace at all, management has no real vision. Competitive salary, and benefits, but healthcare and movement within the company leaves a lot to be desired."
good,Due to company downsizing and low seniority I was bumped out of my position as a Plant Technician and my only option was to take this position or leave the company.
good,The job had some perks. I was over 10 different apartment buildings where B2B selling was my main objective with all Qwest products. My main location was the kiosk where we targeted customers in the mall. We also took many sales orders over the phone from customers either from our apartments or surrounding businesses that we build a relationship with. The job was fun but career growth was not there.
good,Reorganization seems to be the answer to falling short on Wall Street Expectations.  Leaves employees fearful for their positions.
good,A good place to if want to start in the telecom industry. A good work environment with a lot of great people. The office started to make changes that affected compensation so I had to leave for a better opportunity.
good,"In this day and age when so many companies are outsourcing to cheaper foreign countries they have made their profit margin more of a priority than their customers or their employees.  They prefer to make our technicians work 6 days a week 10-14hr days and burn them out, make them sick rather than hire the extra bodies to alleviate missing our customers appointments and keep the employees they do have healthy. i have resigned to find another company that has more focus on customers rather than line its pockets with the almighty dollar. Don't get me wrong, I understand a company needs to make money but there are so many other ways they could be achieving this goal besides outsourcing and working the techs to death.  It is not the worst company to work for but yet it is not the best by any means."
good,Great pay and benefits.  Co-workers are great and all pretty much get along.  Most enjoyable part of my previous job was having the freedom to multitask with no set schedules.
good,Stressful work load is unmanageable.  Training is a joke.  Hard to find people who know the answers.  End of month is a nightmare because of the amount of orders that come through.
good,"Productive and fun place to work. We had  monthly recognitions co-workers were great. "
good,"I worked for centurylink 15 and a half years from centurytel to centurylink i enjoyed my job and felt that the work i did mattered, after many aquisitions and mergers the person no longer matters at centurylink only the number, a company with so many technical jobs should understand they are not all the same and if you wish to keep customers happy your technicians should be allowed to work the jobs as needed and not be expected to run as if on an assembly line."
good,"I enjoy my day-to-day tasks as well as the unexpected tasks to help my internal clients. However, when I asked for a raise/promotion I was told the VP wants more entry level positions vs. leads / seniors."
good,"Very good company to work for, lots of good people. New management needs more skills in being supportive and open to those that have done the job since before they were born."
good,It was a good opportunity to get entry level experience but I never felt that I was valued fairly as an individual and after two years it's time to move on.
good,"It was a great place to work but the bigger that they have gotten the less they care about their employees, pay and benefits are good but the immediate management is horrible."
good,"It was a fun place to work, we had a pool table, gym, game room and they had free lunch every friday. Worked there for 7 years seen alot of people come and go, they had a very high turn over rate."
good,"was the only POC at onshore with two offshore resources for big project given to me when all my team member got rolled off from project with budget issues."
good,"The company overall offers a vast array of career paths. Unfortunately, my manager is a joke. He lied about his previous management experience and was promoted. He sends his staff to other employees to answer questions because he has no clue what he is doing."
good,"Although very frustrating to work for a company that is so heavily regulated, I can say I had fun and enjoyed working for the organization. It was impossible to get promoted and their bilingual department is heavily controlled by a small group that does not allow others to get ahead."
good,"Great industry with good exposure to high speed internet technology, Great co-workers. Management style is a bit rigid."
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere for the most part. When I was hired, I was told after 90 days I would be out of probationary period and permitted to ""bid"" on the schedule I was hired for. After SEVEN months, I was still not a full employee (on paper), therefore, the company wouldn't change my schedule, give me days off, or get my benefits in order. This was the case with all in my training class, as well as the class that followed us. I was hired for first shift, but ended up working until 9pm; which the company was unwilling to work with me on. Also, every month, our quotas for sales were increased, putting too much pressure on us to sell; strange, considering I was in the Retention Department, whose main concern was to prevent disconnection and appease the customer...not to sell DirecTv, Verizon referrals, internet, phone, and CenturyLink's TV, Prism. I was not hired for Sales Department. I felt the pressure was unfair for our department; if quotas were not met, you were disciplined and if you couldn't ""save"" a customer, you were disciplined. Other than the ENORMOUS amounts of pressure, our team tried to make everyday the best we could. Another thing, if you went to the bathroom for longer than 6 minutes per day, you were disciplined, so make sure you don't have any medical issues causing you to use the restroom frequently or eat something your stomach doesn't agree with."
good,"The campaign assisted customers with billing issues and setting up new services. "
good,this position as a technical position working for the phone company gave me a chance to learn about usocs and fids which is its own language
good,"Nice place to work, but tends to keep using old technology.  Advancement opportunities are almost non-existent."
good,"-High Expectations for Sales"
good,"good to work, nice culture."
good,"No job security, great incentives. Cal center, lots of angry customers, micromanaged."
good,It has provided good learning in my career where I was able to change my profile
good,"Built circuits and supported field technicians."
good,"CenturyLink is all about sales. They treat employees well as far as compensation but if your not selling, your out. They say they will work with you to get your sales up but don't."
good,Very high pressure to adhere to performance standards which I always excelled at!
good,Centurylink does not have a flexible work schedule you have one set schedule and you are not allow to change under no circumstances..pay was good and bonus.
good,Hard to advance at this job. Job security was an issue. This job is for those whom do not have children.
good,The job is quite different than what is portrayed at the time of hiring.
good,"	Configuring and installing of HSRP, VRRP on Cisco 6509 switches"
good,a typical day was taking call throughout the day .the hardest part of the day is be cursed at thru the day and having to keep calm .
good,"Centurylink was a very fun job. People call in with their internet problems and I help fix whatever it is. Every Day I would learn something new about either the internet or computers in general. The co-workers are very fun to work with making it a great place to work. the hardest part of the job was having to figure out what a person was telling you was wrong with their internet and trying to fix it. However, the best part of the job was having such fun co-workers."
good,"SAVVIS was responsible for carrying the Stock Exchange live all over the world, in every market. Responsibility was high and work load was very detail oriented. Triple redundancy was the corner stone to their success with keeping clients happy with the service."
good,Daily management of call center reps. Multiple metrics to coach and develop.
good,This was a contract/temp assignment right around the time of some HUGE upper management changes.
good,Nice place to work pay is great policies are ever changing which can at times be frustrating. Work schedule is pretty hectic in the beginning prepare to have no life for about 4 months..sales was the biggest issue either sell or get fired. simple as that if you have the skills this job is a great fit and pay goes up after you become permanent. a typical day includes taking up to 50 calls from irate customers about a bill. you have to explain theyre billing in a way they can understand and then gradually try and position some product to sell to them. that's about it.
good,After a customer has called in several times and you have to assure them that the problem is corrected. 
good,"Typical Day:  Come into the office make excel spreadsheets and work on various projects making sure the fiber and systems installed will not fail."
good,a lot of fun. Co workers were like family. Great spiffs and bonuses. Pay decreesed drastically with change of system
good,A typical day at work consisted of taking calls from customers that were having problems or needing service. I learned how to solve most of the problems and to upgraded them when possible. The management didn't push but consistantly watch numbers. There wasn't much chance to get to know co-workers because in spare time you spent it catching up on details. The hardest part of the job consisted on working 12 hour days six days a wee. It left little time for family. I enjoyed being one ot the top salesmen in the region.
good,"CenturyLink is based out of Monroe, LA. If you like a laid back pace and environment. This may be the place for you."
good,"Working at Qwest just before its acquisition by CenturyLink was a mess, but I was well-compensated and had an excellent direct manager who was able to help her charges weather the storm."
good,"I currently work in a call center opening trouble tickets for customers from Sprint, Verizon, AT&T, TMobile, US Cellular and many end user customers. We open tickets when customers DS0's, DS1's, DS3s and higher go out of service. Typical day call volume is between 30-40 per 8 hour shift. My Availability on the phone was remained over 90%, for 2012."
good,I was at Qwest for a very short time. This was due to having a newborn at home and then Management telling me that travel would be more than I was told originally.
good,"A typical day at work started on the phones, and ends on the phones. I learned how to best manage my time and I learned how to sell. Management was okay, but because I had some medical issues, there was certain policies that I was unable to uphold. Hardest part of the job was the strictly sales. Co workers were nice, but seemed to be unhappy all the time. Enjoyable part was meeting new people, and learning new skills."
good,"Decent pay, could have better training and use less pressure to sell."
good,"Really hard to get days off at the first of the year. Difficult to get multiple days off around holidays. Pay is not worth the stress. Management doesnt seem to help you in areas of concern other that to tell you, ""We need to hit this area harder."" Keep a bottle of aspirin in your desk drawer cause you will need it every day."
good,"An extremely deep focus on metrics and customer satisfaction surveys, at the expense of the ability of the employee to do their jobs. A typical day starts with a 10 minute period to get logged in, and read emails followed by open time taking calls. Management is present and observes calls, and is more concerned with meting badly defined metrics than actual call flow. The hardest part of the job, is tools or systems that fail often, incomplete training, incompatible policies across departments, and an obsession with ill defined metrics. Even with the difficulties of a day, it's a really good feeling, when you can help a customer get working properly."
good,The company had many disgruntled customers and employees. Overall was not a great place to work. Would not suggest it.
good,"The constant change is invigorating. However, the balance of work/life ratio could be much improved. Centurylink has laid off about a quarter of its workforce recently and there doesn't appear to be much room for advancement. I am seeking new challenges to build and add to my existing skillsets."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time (12 + years) at Qwest/CenturyLink. But the company has lacked stability for the last decade, and has struggled financially during that same span."
good,"A difficult place to work because of how many systems they have and how many products you have to learn just to be able to move business. If you're willing to climb a mountain every day, this could be for you."
good,I was treated well.  I would have liked to be more strategic than allowed.  It was difficult to simplify since CenturyLink took control in 2017.  They have undertaken a transformation effort that could be a great thing in the long term.
good,Being able to work at home is wonderful for those of us who have health issues and can't work outside the home.  Also the people who work there are a great group of people.
good,"When I was there, a lot of politics which delayed customers receiving the support they needed."
good,I am looking forward to utilizing my experience and RMO license in the future.  i see myself as a potential leader and also have no problem being a member of a team of engineers running a facility
good,"This is a Telecommunications Company that services most of the United States.  The company is headquartered in Monroe, Louisiana with other major operations located throughout the US."
good,"In my view, operational excellence is achieved through accuracy, efficiency, and a customer-centric perspective.  Through automation, we  create a better customer experience by improving operational responsiveness to legitimate alerts and decreasing user impact."
good,"You must be open to fast moving environment and change.  Continual change in business practices with a moment's notice.  Multi faceted work goals, that are all very attainable when one applies themself."
good,"Provided support to sales teams at events including web page design, printed invitations and handouts, and emailers. Attended meetings to obtain input from sales team re: marketing needs"
good,"While Centurylink provided great benefits and compensation - the tools and support teams required to deliver client deliverables was lacking."
good,"Wonderful company to work for, great people there. They have potlucks every Friday or every other Friday let you have time to meet and enjoy each other as well as working together, training just don’t provide you with everything you need to know before you’re on the floor by yourself!"
good,"Great Introductory Job to IT & Telecommunication Sales and Account Management.  Job is predominantly account management, even though sales is stressed moreso.  Unfortunately, I have found myself in the position of taking over 425 billing accounts which is going to take a long time to extinquish all the fires currently taking place amongst them."
good,It was fine at the time. Overall the people I worked with were good and the relationships were constructive. Would have liked to complete my work experience there.
good,"CenturyLink has gone through many M&As. It is trying to reinvent itself with it's core fiber capacity. It is a half decent place to work and like any large company, it depends on if you have a good boss or not ;)"
good,"Great culture with the product development organization"
good,"it is a decent place to work, however it seems that at times the right hand doesn't know what the left hand does. For example, you could ask the same question, worded the exact same way, to 5 people and get 5 different answers, each of them pointing you a different direction."
good,A typical day at work is 2-3 calls with customers.  I learned quite a bit about Optical networking.  Management is fair and balanced and the culture is humble
good,"Since Level 3 has taken over, the focus on employees and customers has greatly diminished (it's spoken of but actions don't prove it) and it is all about the shareholders."
good,Solid work days great coworkers I have friends for life that I had met at centurylink . There are times where you work life will interfere with family life.
good,If you can meet sales quotas it’s a decent place to work. Fast paced environment. Fellow co workers were nice people. The pressure of meeting sales quotas was no fun though.
good,The job is very good you have to be a people person cause you get all type of people that call the center you have to be able to adjust to each customer
good,NO transparency between sales and service groups due to lack of comprehensive systems and poor communications.  Antiquated systems created huge redundancies to execute any level of quote or system order(s).
good,Its an ok place I just missed working face to face with customers. Decent money for the monroe area. Just really depends on what department you work in and who your supervisor is.
good,"My immediate co-workers were all great to work with.  They were very professional, and were always willing to work out differences.  That said, the company, as a whole, is very bureaucratic, with lengthy and very complex processes.  Upper management is becoming increasingly detached from the realities of the day to day challenges."
good,"Experience started off good but all contractors were unexpectedly released within 90 days due to merger. "
good,"Dealing with angry and disrespectful customers, working to fix problems the company created by improperly scheduling installations and repairs on days when technicians were already back-logged or technicians were NOT EVEN WORKING. The system regularly would tell us that customers qualified for internet speeds that weren't available in their areas and we wouldn't find out until the technicians arrived onsite for the install. To make matters worse, the technicians would tell the customer we lied to them, even though we were giving them the most accurate information provided to us by the system."
good,"Although I have enjoyed working at Level 3 / CenturyLink, their paid salaries for my position are way under the median for other companies and I have no opportunities for advancement.  This pretty much forced me to look for other opportunities elsewhere."
good,Productive. Great. People at CenturyLink are great people. Many job selections available with a large company. International opportunities to work with or position available.
good,"Good pay, you can work on your own. Fellow employees are encouraging and help when they can."
good,It is a highly stressful place to work but pays well enough to possibly handle the stress.  The company is Union and thanks to the Union they helped pay for my education so I could pursue another career.
good,"With CentruyLink and Level 3 merging there is still a lot of confusion between systems, products and internal support.  These problems can cause issues with customer sat."
good,"Usually very busy, not a lot of feedback from supervisors. Very helpful co-workers that can answer questions or assist with customer issues."
good,Good place to work if you like to work with management not following their own policies and procedures.  benefits are not as good as they were when it was Qwest and not CenturyLink.  Healthcare cost are being passed on more and more to employees and Retirement matching as much as before.  Salary is below market levels and upper management does not know what is going on with Enterprise or Business Customers.
good,"This is one of the best companies in Monroe. However, company is like an old PC:"
good,"It's a job specific for a sales person, I realized while in training I wasn't a sales person it was hard to convince/ persuade someone to do something I wouldn't do."
good,"This company is going through a lot of changes, but if you do your job, and apply yourself, you can make a decent living. You will be working in the elements, so be prepared."
good,"Centurylink has very high turn over in fact they only expect half of the people they higher to pass training, and of those they only expect half to pass the on boarding process.  If you make your quotas you can earn quite a bit.  If not you won't last long."
good,Process issues other than that great place to work with lots of smart committed people. Management needs to listen and implement suggestions from the field for them to be the most effective
good,"Working here as an Operations Technician was fun, however, it seems like management doesn't care too much about whats going on as long as customers aren't complaining."
good,"A typical day at work involves telephony engineering."
good,"Was a great company, however through multiple mergers, and cost-cutting, is no longer what it once was.  Benefits are worse than ever, no room for growth or advancement."
good,"When I first started here it was the best call center I've ever worked in. The bosses were very knowledgeable, professional and empowered their subordinates and worked with them to succeed. After the Level 3 merger, things started going downhill and all they cared about is their bottom line. They wanted us to just get off the calls instead of help the customers. I don't believe they're even hiring technical support anymore since the spring of 2019. Every time I run a search on their job site for the position I held I don't find anything. I'm glad I got out of this company and call center work in general and got a real office job."
good,Overall morphing from one company to another type all together. L3 Acquisition was ill-advised and creating challenges. I felt that the changes were not positive and chose to leave
good,"The past 3 years has been challenging to say the least..Once Level 3 management took control, CenturyLink has been on a slow downturn..however prior to that they were a fun, productive, and rewarding employer."
good,The company was a good company till they merged with another company and I lost my job.  They believed in their employees and always knew how to challenge you to make you improve.
good,CTL is changing their company image. Moving away from landline and consumer business to focus more on being a technology company and supporting small and large business.
good,This company is so unorganized and the management have no idea how to do their jobs. I’m not surprised the stock has dropped. They change everything every quarter. Imagine learning a new system & out of nowhere they discontinue it & make you learn a new one. They’ve promoted & fired most of the upper management. It’s a very unstable environment. They pay structure changes constantly and has dropped. I started off making 60k a year & now I’m making about 45k. Im still performing the same.
good,Was a great place until they acquired another company. That acquired companies management took over our Right of Way group and didn't give us any guidance.
good,dont have a lot to say about this company it has changed so much since I was there. I can only remember it being a challenge when us west purchased the company -
good,savvis was ok to work for they are like any other copany they look for numbers so if thy think they loo better wit out you then you are gone keep your resimue up to date
good,With the company mergers there is always a new challenge around the corner.  So if you like challenges then Century Link is a good fit for you.  Hardest part is compensation.  Company does not seem to match market standard per position.
good,"A lot of change within the past 5 years,  CenturyLink has gone t a workload metrics system that is more cumbersome than helpful to field technicians.  work load per technician has become overwhelming due to work force reduction."
good,"Hourly positions have the biggest variance in work environment and culture.  Some managers are exceptional.  "
good,I am filling this out  because indeed.com requires a minimum of 150 words in order to create an account.  For my scenario this is silly because I will be entering a completely new field and none of this is applicable.
good,"Through acquisition Centurylink has built a robust network with a complex and comprehensive product portfolio. "
good,"Pro: for the most part, management is moving the company in a positive direction."
good,New hires are coming in from outside the company with no sense of commitment within and support roles are almost non-existent BUT offers great flexibility and ability create your own schedule.
good,I liked working there but a lot of things could have been better. They need better management. And better systems. I need to watch for other reps stealing sales
good,Overall I enjoyed my time at CenturyLink.  In the 21+ years there too many weak leaders in the lower levels of management that cannot execute the corporate vision.
good,"CenturyLink is a good place to work."
good,Nice place to work. Great benefits. Would look great on a resume. They offer great incentives and many activities. I recommend this business to those who want to work in marketing and engineering.
good,The job is all sales. If you can sell than you belong there. Be on time and have enough motivation to get through the door and handle calls associated to an over decreasing industry of traditional TV sales.
good,I was laid off often 19 years of service.  It was a great job but recent events at the company have caused problems with head count.  I wish to still with in this field.
good,"Working here is what you'd expect of a company still going through a significant, multiyear merger.  Company is very understaffed in all key areas both internal and customer-facing.  Field sales receive very little management direction.  Overly focused on administration of metrics rather than developing a functional sales environment.  Plenty of product resources exist within the company, but you're on your own to determine what's beneficial."
good,My work day begins early in the morning and occasionally spans the rest of the day and early evening.  I enjoy the position I have and the people I work with.
good,"Lots of opportunities especially in the contact centers (also known as call centers) and in sales positions, both inside sales and outside sales. Internships too."
good,This place is great if you don't mind sacrificing your morals in order to get ahead.  Cram and slam is the norm in the call center as everything is commission.
good,"Centurylink has continued to grow thru various acquisitions, but has failed to properly integrate the systems of the companies they acquire. Consequently everything is patched together. Order entry and services need to be entered into as many as 5 different systems PER ORDER!"
good,Great place if all you care about is money compensation is great but not worth the stress to most. Burn out is very common. Benefits are some of the best I have heard of
good,"The job was rough on days and good on others. Customers always needed the reps help to make them happy, enjoyed the job the most. didn't intend on leaving but family emergency came up"
good,"The company was merging with Level 3 at the time I was there, so it was a changing environment. I would be open to returning to Century Link in another role."
good,"The organization has recently completed multiple acquisitions.  As expected, anytime an acquisition occurs, it is accompanied by uncertainty and some turmoil while trying to consolidate systems/processes."
good,This was a tough and fun place to work. Meeting sales goals and aiming high is what I thrive in. Fun atmosphere and a very competitive work environment.
good,"The job consists of doing much of the same things day in and day out, or working on special projects for several hours, only to have the directive change and your work to be for naught at times.  There is little to no opportunity for professional development outside of internal outdated webinars or things that you are willing to pay for yourself. Those are the cons. The field marketing organization is filled with a lot of great people that are a joy to be around and work with. Management is amazingly smart and there is a ton of wasted talent amongst them given the lack of confidence senior leadership seems to have in our organization.  I truly just wish there was the opportunity to grow more professionally and that our hands weren't tied financially so that we were able to do our jobs more effectively."
good,It was a nice place to work while going to college. Decent paying for a college student. Learned many things at the call center while helping people troubeshoot their internet needs.
good,Qwest was a different experience as it was a hardware company and had a hardware company mindset.  It was not a place for software developers to grow and learn.
good,Good Company to work for.  Raises did not come as expected. They did not promote from within.  Qualified employees on the project were not promoted when supervisors left.  They chose to bring in people from the outside.  This created ill feelings toward new managers. When an employer does not promote from within I feel it shows a lack of employee loyalty.
good,"I much preferred the support role I had for 17+ years. I was able to increase my product knowledge not just with the company but at an Industry level. I got to travel, form connections across the company, and had the option of working remotely.  The department I'm working in now seems to be a bit behind the times and requires presence in office even though the job could be done remotely just as effectively."
good,An ideal company that offers job skills for younger workers. CenturyLink has grown from a private owned company that experienced extraordinary growth the a variety of partnerships and acquisitions.
good,"I worked in a network center in Kansas. Advancement was non existent, pay was low with no merit or salary/yearly increases for years. CTL did not promote or offer training classes for technical or professional development"
good,Not Availalbe -  A review of this company is not available here at this time. You are encouraged to continue to please seek elsewhere for this information/
good,"The company can be a great place to work, just depends upon the specific discipline as well as leadership over that particular silo.  Operations seemed to be the best place to be."
good,"CenturyLink is a great company to start or find a career at. They are open to all ideas, and continue to promote within their own company. It's pretty amazing"
good,CenturyLink seems to be focused more on what they can sell rather than can they deliver. Example...the goal is to hire ~100 more sales people and only a handful of PMO types over the next year.
good,"Gave internet support to customers, answering calls, open 24 hours a day 7 days a week including holidays. Fast paced atmosphere taking a lot of calls per shift."
good,"CenturyLink is a good company, but in an industry that has been consolidating over the past two decades.   So it's a constant environment of mergers and company integrations every couple years.  Although the company currently has strong leadership, it's still an environment with lots of layoffs and challenges to provide a good customer experience while working to combine multiple companies into one."
good,I enjoyed working there until the acquisition with Level 3 and then it became rather cut throat.   There have been a lot of layoffs that were unfortunate.
good,Used to be a good place to work years ago. The company stopped looking out for techs and customers.  Pay was good. Good co-workers.  Had a nice guy as supervisor.
good,"Telecommunications is a fast paced ever changing environment. Many mergers allow the company to continue to grow. It has many different types of benefits; compared to Seattle not as competitive, but for a non metropolis the beni's are solid."
good,"Level 3 was a challenged environment due to multiple acquisitions over the previous 3 years of my employment.  The leadership provided you with all the requisite tools to perform the requirements of your position.  It was face paced environment which was challenging on occasion, however the professional and personal rewards were worth the opportunity."
good,"The tech world is changing so fast that the legacy companies and structure are going away.  When I worked for the 'phone company' that eventually became Centurylink it was great.  You could work hard and move into other areas of the business so it was never boring.  The last merger with Level III seems to have changed the culture.  There have been a lot of lay-offs, no bonuses, commission cuts, change in contractor usage and pay; not sure what kind of place it is to work in now."
good,"Good place to work. A lot of good times but no where to move up unless willing to relocate to another market.   Pay is average, and health insurance continues to rise"
good,"Good benefits, good work life balance.  Great co-workers.  Wages not increasing and  need to make more money to keep up with housing and medical costs."
good,It was great to work for Qwest while the company was active.  The benefits and pay were great and the work was not stressful.  It was an operator center and believe it or not payphones were used back in the day.
good,decent place to work with some advancement opportunities.hardest part of the job was trying to navigate the constantly changing processes. they did a decent job of training employees.
good,"I worked with a lot of data and databases and the management was very traditional and hierarchical. Old school approach to managing talent and few opportunities to grow, with a political environment."
good,"I didn't like working at Centurylink.  It was cut throat sales, where the company would say that you made sales that you didn't make, and they would put them on costumers service."
good,"Overall this is a good company to work for, however when jobs are outsourced to other companies overseas, there are no other options in which to utilize your skill sets."
good,OK for transitional job. Layoffs due to corporate buyout. Company is transitioning to 5G for local service and emphasis on business customers. No job security.
good,CenturyLink was a nice workplace but it had limitations in he way of advancement.  Basically once you began a job you were sort of defined by it and there was little room for advancement.  It was not impossible but the culture was to bring in someone new from the outside to fill upward positions.  In general if you liked your job it was great and I did love my position.
good,"Quest was a leader in Telecommunications, The management I worked under was lacking, and caused a breakdown in the productivity.  But, there is always the experience and knowledge you can with a high tech company like Qwest"
good,"Posted anonymously on Indeed, Please guys tell me the links to prepare for centurylink networking jobs what quesions they will be asking and how much indepth we should know?"
good,Great employment policy training was provided as well as constant CRM training and focus so that all data collected regarding opportunities could be captured and managed.
good,"I worked for Centurylink for 11 years, and my colleagues were amazing!!!!  My departments hours of operation were 7:00am to 7:00pm ...which was AWESOME!!!We could count on one another to not only go above and beyond if the workload was heavier than usual."
good,A hard working group of people who want to provide the best possible service to each and every customer. Workplace culture is in flux due to ever changing market.
good,"I recent merger with another company has led to a large number of technicians and management getting laid off and fired. The stress in the crew rooms is constantly up, and nobody is confident in how long they'll get to keep their job."
good,Currently with integration with companies there is no clear direction. No clear market penetration plan. A lot of tools available but there are too many processes to implement anything consistently.
good,"Company should focus on customers need, deployment process efficiency, proper planning, long term solutions and improvement processes. Management should start using internal customer expertise to achieve above mentioned goals"
good,I started as a Retention Consultant about a month ago they switched the entire department to sales. We were not given any options to stay in our current role.
good,"Short tenure in my hometown with CenturyLink.  Starting over from  Manager when taking buyout package with GTE/VERIZON."
good,Empresa multinacional en proceso de consolidación mundial y definición de los medios y recursos necesarios para alcanzarlo
good,I enjoyed my time at CTL.  The company has taken a much different cultural attitude after the acquisition of Level 3 and there is no care for the CPE portion of the business.  Major cuts resulted in layoffs across the portion of the business that I supported.
good,Lots of long term employees waiting out retirement. Need to infuse with new employees and a fresh mindset to compete in a new era of telecommunications and competition.
good,A good place to work with limited career advancement.  There are not a lot of opportunities that come up and the pool is supersaturated.   If you are looking for a job and you are satisfied with what you are being hired for then you should be fine.
good,Communication company on track for success in the future with competitive pricing and strong core values. In a current time of change with the merger with Level3.
good,"working at century link was very fast paced and the goals expected from me were very high but there was a lack of support and consistency from the management teams. The pay, bonuses, and commissions were good but the stress the job came with is extremely high."
good,"The CenturyLink family is outstanding however, there are elements impacting them since acquiring Qwest they did not anticipate.  The huge RBOC was much more than even the well capitalized smaller Qwest could absorb.  What I felt this did was to facilitate the rapid need to contract employees out on temporary assignments far too often.  That option did not necessarily create loyalty for long term success.  Although that business model is necessary in some cases, even at CenturyLink, it is now Level-3, and I do hope that it will not follow the same business model.  In many circumstances when products and services become relative similar, the company must differentiate by service and that includes execution upon commitments.  With a high personnel churn rate, that does not always solidify quality assurance measures needed to grow market share."
good,"It was so long ago, and I don't really remember much about the place other than it was very stressful and the shifts changed on a regular. Would not go back"
good,"Have some great employees I have learned from and have taught me though out my career here. Good work environment, flexibility on schedule, good benefits but upper management is always changing."
good,Centruylink is a good company going in a new direction.  No longer feel comfortable in my position.  As a business tech CenturyLink is striving for global business and letting smaller businesses go.
good,Unnecessarily stressful place to work.   Upper management imposes techniques that anger customers and many calls require diffusion and unnecessary time-wasting.
good,"No comment at this time regarding CenturyLink as a company, its employees, nor it's customers.  Information is protected for any kind of disclosure mandated by the FCC."
good,Company provides good training and experiences across various sectors of  finance and telecommunications. Benefits are relatively good and there is a degree of flexibility.
good,"CTL moto is ""do more with less for less"". Stress of too much work and pressure to keep it caught up. Not fun place to work. Continuing down sizing while not refilling vacated positions. No change in the work load, but fewer people to keep the work done."
good,The only reason I am leaving my job or project play out. I total enjoyed my time with centurylink. I had a chance to work with this team for 14 years.
good,"The engineering team at Qwest was the most talented group I've ever worked with as a whole.  The management was the most unethical (there were some true exceptions).   "
good,My overall experience was ok. I learned about sales techniques and marketing. The hardest part about the job is walking around the neighborhoods and going door to door.
good,I enjoy working with the people at Century Link. I learned a great deal about communication and troubleshooting of network outage. The only reason I left was due to the contract expiring.
good,Some of the best benefits you can get if you have a family or even single. Weekends off as well which is hard to get. Straight 8 hours only unless you get approved for more. Quite a bit of paid time off and the sick time out is very reasonable. 
good,none to write about typical fast changing pace good pay future of company looks good mergers recently will help thic company thrive well into the future
good,"fast past, interesting place to work.  Ability to work remotely is a definite plus.  Work with different people from around the globe.  Interesting work that keeps you busy."
good,I found it to be stressful when speaking with customers and I was frustrated with the fact there was nothing I could do to resolve the problem with the system.
good,"Installation and maintenance of telephone lines. residential and business. I learned gaffing, networking, customer service skills and working with coworkers and dispatch to clear work loads."
good,Company was not well run.  Various organizations did not practice good communications skills.   Often had to setup meetings to define in use in application development.
good,Poor management and employees seem to run the show.  Management team does not seem to care about the customers or the products CenturyLink offers.  Loosing more customers than gaining.
good,the job was fun although I think this position is no longer available. a laid back environment with very little actual work. good benefits with advancement. good overall job
good,Try for yourself. This is a job hat builds character and skill. Many workers are ready for the same positions. The work is hard and seems to take toll on the workers.
good,"Performed duties as a contractor for Century Link.  Unfortunately, the contract was pulled 3 months into the contract.  Long term employees were quite helpful during my time at Century Link."
good,"Being a SCSSA at CenturyLink is very hard work, requires amazing determination of will, the ability to be rejected and keep going, and often climbing over the intense sensation that you are focused more on selling than on helping people, which is tough if you care more about Service than Sales."
good,"Nice facility,relaxed.  Work is done on time to no issues.  No flexible timing.  Nice cafeteria  and food.  Managers are good and helpful. No career advancement."
good,benefits are good and pay low. job pretty redundant but i work from home so no advancement unless your back in the office. didnt learn anything new. typical day same as the day before. i felt stuck.
good,With the sale of Level 3 to CenturyLink it is difficult to predict the culture and environment going forward. If history is any guide the integration may be slow and painful.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere at the early stages at my job when we where in sales. We were headed in the right direction. My co-workers, peers, agents and manager felt the same way and we enjoyed coming to work. It was great at that time. I learned more communication skills and gained more experience technically and managerially. The hardest part was watching the results of a bad decision and watching the company revenue go up but the financial benefits for the employees went down until most of all of my peers as well as myself got laid off."
good,"Great company with benefits and allowed other to raise through the ranks. They put too much stress on getting and meeting our numbers, management style was very stern"
good,"You have to have a mindset of helping people and displaying patience. Although you are given tools to assist customers, there are times where you have to think outside the box and have patience for changes that occur intermittent"
good,"Level 3, which is now part of CenturyLink, was a very time oriented place to work,  to to aggressive customer service delivery, and internal infrastructure pmi requirements, there was very little time to catch your breath between workload assignments, which very often led to extra work hours to complete the daily workload."
good,It was a good place to work. Advancement was nonexistent. A lot of times management did not have a consistent view of objectives at the lower levels. I enjoyed the team environment that I was part of on my last project.  No upper management support but my coworkers were great.
good,Very stressful to make the sales quota every month. Most stressful job I’ve had. Best thing about the company was the rewards for making the sales goal.
good,"Had to travel far distances in order to sell. Every day gave us a sheet with our ""turf"". We would travel door to door and try to get our customers to demo our product"
good,I have not worked for this company for such a long time. I can't say that it was a bad place to work because I left the company to stay home and raise my kids.
good,"Overall the company is better than most. However, people earning high marks in reviews are still overlooked for advancement unless knowing someone in the inside circle."
good,Enjoyed working here it is very faced paced considering the amount of incoming calls that usually come in.Have to be patient and personable to effectively communicate with customers.
good,"A typical day at work was locating , digging up, and repairing damaged copper cable. Ordering supplies for our work center, "
good,Being on a strong team allowed me to develop a marketable skillset.  We worked long hours but got the job done.  I will miss supporting our internal clients
good,"Its a good telecom company,Very challenging task i have faced here.work environment was nice.i learned a lot with advancement in technology.Eventhough we worked alot they didnt make permanent."
good,It was a faced paces sales environment. You had to meet your goals every month and if you did not they would coach you. It was an ok place to work the hours were good.
good,"Fast paced, intense environment with scrutiny placed on tactical initiatives employed to achieve plan.  Tools utilized were comprehensive, however, sometimes challenging relative to accurate information."
good,The company was solid until the telecom downturn.  the culture then become combative and cut throat.  People were looking out for themselves upon the backs of others.  Very dysfunctional
good,I didn't mind working at Centurylink but they are behind with there compensation and have a lot of catching up to do. They also need get some better training
good,I advanced very rapidly. The pay is equitable to the job for this region.  They offer great benefits.  All the employees work very hard.  The workplace is conducive to productivity.
good,"Great Place to work for."
good,"There was only one bad boss in the bunch, she has been demoted. Everything else was good. I'd go back if I wanted to try again."
good,Standard telecommunications company. Just got purchased by another telecommunications company. Co-workers are friendly and management is helpful. Staff is always helpful and supportive
good,Good job but stressful and security are concerns. I would stay if I felt like my job were not at risk with the acquisition of Level 3. Changing of management is a concern.
good,I really enjoyed working here because i was fast paced and the questions customers had when they called in were not usually the same. Did not run into a lot of angry customers.
good,"I was only a contractor which did not last long due to a budget cut the company was about to partake in. Me and fellow co workers/contractors were informed that we would still be able to work for the company until full-time positions were open, but that wasn't the case after being informed of the budget cut so that left us contractors to exit the assignment."
good,"Centurylink provides their employees good pay and benefits. They change management often, so it might hurt the cohesiveness and teamwork. But there are many opportunities to advance in your employment"
good,"Level 3 Communications was a good place to work...good pay, vacation and sick time, medical benefits. Not too much drama, sometimes stressful but overall a good place to work."
good,"CenturyLINK is not a bad company to work for. Plenty of advancement opportunities, good co-workers for the most part.................................."
good,Can be a little stressful when you have to handle billing questions all day and all they want you do di is make sales. But they try to make the competition fun.
good,"overall centurylink was fun to work at, I enjoyed my job for the most part, as far as some of their policys as far as attendance , I don't feel  like they care about the employees unless they are in the seats .."
good,ok place to work if you are into sales. A normal work day is dealing with upset customer who experience ongoing billing issues. I learned how to sale and the most enjoyable part about my job was meeting new people and being able to assist and resolve ongoing issues.
good,"Confidential, under confidentiality agreement.  I am unable to disclose further information without violating my confidentiality agreement.  I prefer not to disclose this information."
good,"Level 3 can be a good company to work for. It's a company made up of several other companies along with their employees, policies and systems. Your day can be very convoluted with trying to keep up with all the changes and processes."
good,"One of the things I really like about working at Level 3 is that we work quickly. It's a fast-paced environment and we process a lot of new customer circuits every day. The technology we use is robust and impressive. We have a diverse working population, and there are plenty of interesting people to get to know. The headquarters has a cafeteria, gym, and parking garage - and a ping pong table!"
good,Need to implement more customer feedback. The company is still going through some changes on merging with or acquiring US West. The employees are top of the line to work with.
good,"Working for Century Link, the money wont come to you, you have to come to the money and do all that you can to get that sale and close that deal. Over all the job can be exhausting but the money makes up for it."
good,N/A - Nothing to add. A good company to work for and the team was one of the best I've worked with. Their knowledge and ability to share that knowledge helped to create a fantastic team.
good,"Most of the people I worked with at Level(3) had been there a long time and were not ambitious in their careers - some had come back repeatedly after layoffs, which were routine. The Broomfield campus itself is soulless to the max - you sit in these gray walled cubes with doors they call ""offices"", but it's more like a sad beehive. Your ""office"" provides neither privacy or quiet, and discourages collaboration at the same time, so it's kind of the worst parts of both being in an open air environment and having an office. Hopefully that has changed in the 5+ years since I worked there. If you want to get out for a bit, there are plenty of strip malls around where you can drown your sorrows in some chain restaurant soup."
good,Wired communication is a declining industry. Managing a company down was not fun anymore. I was in the operations department and they reduced the work force by 10%
good,"Decent major corp to work for. I was in eChat and the teams worked well with each other. Non-sales position relieved alot of stress. Working over the phone was more stressful as there were obscene sales quotas and the ""number crunchers"" seemed to not care about fair quota practices. Training was better than most. I had better training at Qwest though, before CenturyLink took over."
good,I loved that it was part of the union. I wish I could go back. I was on the 11th floor. They made sure training was at our own pace. I'm glad I got the chance to work there.
good,"A lot of change for this company in northeast Indiana.  A large proportion of the work my department handles was recently transitioned to a center in Salt Lake City.  The remaining work could easily be sent to centers in Des Moines, Iowa and Duluth, Minnesota."
good,Worked there many years ago before becoming Centurylink. Things have changed Im sure since I worked there. When it was Qwest it was a great place to work.
good,"The company definitely compensates you well for the work that you do. If you meet your required monthly goal, you can earn an substantial amount in commissions. It is a call center however so naturally the job comes with pressure."
good,"This was a standard retail environment.  Good management was hard to find, and when they were found, they didnt stick around long at all.  It was a bit hard to get recognized for any above and beyond work."
good,"The money was excellent and the people are fun. Beware of some of the managers, they seem to step on folks to make it to the top. The local, CWA 7019, will have your back like no other."
good,"Benefits, package, medical and salary is at par if you are working in mid-West. If you are working in any city, it is way below par. "
good,"Working at CenturyLink has a lot of challenges. In certain groups like mine, you do have a lot of flexibility which can help with work-life balance. However, work loads within teams are uneven and pay is unevenly matched as well."
good,shady reps and ctl they preach customer service but dont care at all.b its nothing but sales wich i like its deffinately not for the people that cant handle mental stree
good,Would come in and would take phone calls from customers who had their services who were having issues getting them to work. i would find out what the problem was and would try and fix it remotely if i could other wise would send a tech.
good,"Benefits are good.  Coworkers are friendly.  Typical days are spent retrieving work from various systems, and insuring all work is done correctly.  Thanks."
good,Didn't really get an opportunity to understand the Level 3 way. I was working with a company that they had acquired. There is not much I can say positive or negative about this experience.
good,Centurylink is like any large corporation with a history of layoffs.  The people that remain there are the good workers but ultimately are being asked to do the job of those that have been dismissed over the years.
good,"In all it was a very good company to work for, had worked there over 17 years. A lot of changes which often times was not in the best interest of the employees. There was no employee loyalty, yet they expected the same.  They chose management staff according to whom they liked not whom was qualified. If you weren't a favorite of the manager that was over you, your job remained in jeopardy."
good,CenturyLink was a good job with good benefits as long as the employee was a union member. CenturyLink seems to be moving away from employing union workers and the newer job titles do not have the salary or benefits that make this company an excellent employer.
good,Culture crawled to a standstill.  Acquisition resulted in the vast majority of corporate functions relocating to CenturyLink HQ.  This had a significant negative impact on morale and opportunity for career advancement.
good,you go into work you make your sales you go home you need to meet your quotas and i mean the working environment it great if you know people and you get in good with the management
good,"It is a good paying job, but requires a lot of patience and being able to meet the sales quota is hard. Trying to solve customer issues and turning the compalining call into a sales call is hard."
good,"Good Work At Home Program"
good,Some aspects were awesome and a lot were not. Micro management kills most support reps. It seems to be the same for the call centers no matter tech or customer service.
good,Overall decent company not a lot of positions to move up to and advance to make it a career. I enjoyed being part of the union and sales with rewards. I was lucky enough to have started with Qwest before CenturyLink bought them. Very demanding on Sales with no wiggle room. So if you're not comfortable with sales it is not the right fit for you. I still think they have the best products and pricing in our local area. Definitely need to have more training for new employees and have a lot more calls listened to live while people are selling and not covering all the details. Way too focused on sales and not details and disclosures and commission and rewards should not be given until after 3 months of customer keeping it.
good,"Centurylink is a good company with vendor management issues, which is typical for a company this size.   The salary and benefits are good."
good,when I worked there it was during a time of significant industry consolidation due to technology advancements.  I was there for 5 years and for 3 there were consistent layoffs
good,Good culture with a decent chance to grow and advance.  Company has since merged and evolved through acquisitions and from what I have heard has become more stressful in regards to the organization structure.  This negatively effects the culture and has lead to more turnover.  Solid financially and has good benefits.
good,It was a pleasent place to work. A very positive team environment the staff and management were very helpful and positive. They do both sales and customer service for the phone company and the customers always seemed very pleased with there services.
good,"Daily prospecting to small business owners selling telecommunication solutions. "
good,I really enjoyed working here the only down side was the shifts. I enjoyed learning different things such as starting out working with internet only customers and was eventually trained to work with television and phone customers.
good,environment is good and relaxed.  Would love to move forward.  Like my coworkers and there is teamwork involved to help with productivity.  Able to obtain manager feedback.
good,"Merger activity lead to a bit of management being overwhelmed.  Culture was not promoted as priority, only consolidation activity and doing things according to corporate desires.  Good people though."
good,"Good job, extremely easy work.  However, no job security with company.  They were doing a lot of layoffs with people hired onto the company, along with getting rid of the majority of the contract workers as well.  My supervisor was amazing and the vast majority of the team I worked with were great minus 2 or 3.  Just need stability in a job and not have to fear going in and wondering if our department is being laid off that day or not. Money wasn't great either."
good,Good work/life balance the projects are very big you got work on the same project throught  due to which has to work on same things for the years
good,training process was very thorough however employees were constantly told that if they don't reach sales goals they will be fired. Very high pressure.
good,It was the fourth company to but the baby bell.  their southern idea of work was never in tune with  modern work/.  they did value getting rid of the old and bringing in newer and less experienced people.    However even thought the stock dropped over 50% in 18 months they did not replace the CEO. So i would be worried about this company
good,I worked there during a period of management-employee strife. There was a strike during my time. Management was not supportive of employees and vice versa.
good,I cannot really comment on Qwest (now Century Link). I assume management's approach to employees and service has changed over the years. I would not be comfortable commenting.
good,"The hours were challenging "
good,I think the company should employ more Americans instead of continually finding new departments to offshore and lay off Americans.
good,a typical day at work. what I learned. management. workplace culture. the hardest part of the job. the most enjoyable part the job
good,"I was at Qwest over 15 years ago, so I do not know how much of this still applies.  But, the company was innovative and in my experience there was plenty of growth opportunities for those individuals looking for advancement"
good,"My shift started at 5am with a 30min. lunch and two 15min. breaks."
good,I worked for CenturyLink for sixteen years and was a good company to work for. Due to losses in Land line revenues the CenturyLink needed to trim it's work force.
good,Its good but not that friendly customers. I have enjoyed while working with them.  Work culture also good .. But more pressures by the managers while handling the complicated seniors
good,"Typical day involved adjusting to outages due to assorted circumstances. Manage call volume with quick accurate diagnosis of trouble over a 14 state region. Learned how to troubleshoot internet congestion, dns resolver issues. Management was rotated, had a new supervisor every 90 days. CWA Union job. Co-workers were very knowledgable, some with over 40 yrs experience. Hardest part of the job is maintaining your patience with a customer screaming at you. Most enjoyable part was the work from home opportunities."
good,"Compensation was great. Work environment was highly stressful."
good,"To aid a company in many ways in my abilities and qualities. Skills in customer service, bridge monitoring and all aspects and necessities in a company. I am a great self-starter, able to work well in a growing team and can bring a positive hard working attitude to the work environment."
good,most inbound sales jobs are fairly straight forward.   talk to customer be nice and sell.  Centurylink is so much transition that rules and policies change so much that most departments waste a lot of time trying to figure out how to do the job not actually doing the job.
good,"Savvis was bought by CenturyLink.  It is a subsidiary of a larger company.  The company that I worked for was bought.  It does not exist.  The people, the management have largely turned over."
good,I was contracting at level 3 and thoroughly enjoyed my time at the company and the people I worked with. Looking after the French side of the collections was a great test of my abilities and forced me to push myself daily.
good,I would prefer not to review CenturyLink while I am still employed with them. They are in the process of determining employee layoff and I would not want to be let go without a job lined up.
good,"I worked with the public and assisted them in billing and product  enjoyed working with internal reps and assisting them in solving their problems.  I was rewarding,"
good,"Good company and good work culture....Lots of learning.."
good,Management decided to change the focus of the company from telecommunications to a hosting company.  This resulted in 1300 employees being let go last September.
good,"Good company, good people.  Hard to keep up with technology changes in the market.  Customer care is top priority but not always well executed."
good,CenturyLink is in a system of change; so the jobs goal will differ from quarter to quarter. I work with good employees and manager
good,"Typical work day is correcting Billing and Sales! This company is not up to date with Technology and the Training is not great for Work At Home Employee. Some Trainers are vey cocky and Rude. No compassion for the Employee. The some Employees are fun to work with, while some are shady. The hardest part of the job is to get Leadership to Listen to issues and problems. The Best part of the Job, is working from home."
good,Dubuque and Decorah technicians are the best techs that I have worked with in my career.  There are technicians that will go 2 miles to help a customer not just 1.
good,"No matter what you helped the customer with, you always had to try to end the call with an upgrade or a sale. If you didn't reach your quota you were basically told you are were in the risk of losing your job."
good,"Qwest Communications was acquired by CenturyLink after I left the company. When I was there, the culture was decent and compensation and benefits met the industry standard. Vacation time accrued quickly."
good,"Large company in a big transition, with great ideas and goals. CTL is struggling to deliver, and meet customer expectations which make it difficult to keep customers and employees happy."
good,"its a good place to work only if you do quality work, some managers are good some not so good the overall company doesn't seem like it will be around long because it is ran very inefficently. many employees are unhappy and moral among co workers is very low"
good,"it is a good work environment to learn troubleshooting networks, can do a lot of troubleshooting and learn a lot about your field."
good,"Typical days consisted of config work, but mostly phone support implementing new customer installs and turn ups. We were exposed to a varied set of products provided by Centurylink as well as customer topologies and needs. My immediate team and management were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was trying to interpret the customer orders and exact needs and fix the many problems that arose from issues in the order process or even the customer needs being fully understood and clarified by sales. The best part of the job was overcoming the challenges and making happy customers."
good,"Regular working hours"
good,"average experience overall - considering opportunities with a more progressive, forward thinking organization that offers more substantial, cerebral challenges to help client businesses."
good,i had a good experience  until I was laid of 9 months after the merge. Many techs and outside plant quit in Houston during this time due to the culture change.
good,Great company. Sold out to another company. Made numbers more important than the Personnel. Could have done better with managing crammers. Overall great management I learned a lot from upper management in Idaho Falls
good,"Centurylink is one of those old Ma Bell companies that has a lot of potential. But potential is all that seems to be it. "
good,I only worked for CenturyLink for two years.  My whole division was laid off in a company reorganization.  Those who have been there for 20+ years seem to love it.  New hires seem to have a hard time feeling at home.
good,Lack of cooperation and coordination between various groups and numerous legacy company organizations. Little respect for others talents and skills. Poor information dissemination.
good,"Good work environment and very good peers to encourage."
good,This isn't a place that embraces small sales (ie: 3-5K deals) If you aren't putting up big numbers expect to be put on the chopping block.
good,"Working with customer, vendors, internal customers to make sure they receive all Network products in the correct manner."
good,"An Average work environment with moderate benefits but burdened with too many processes. The company, though, has many skilled professionals"
good,"Relaxed environment, Pressure from management, Lack of leadership. Casual work environment,Work from home, Lots of work, Time to study."
good,Didn't work there long enough to form an opinion.  It seems they have gotten there house in order.  Good luck to them and their employees.
good,"Speaking with the customers was the best and, sometimes, worst part of the job. Customer complaints were sometimes tough but rewarding when the issues were resolved."
good,Good staff and giving work in frequent time. I learned a lot in Level 3 as an intern. I developed my skills in SQL while working as an intern. Colleagues were very helpful.
good,"good place to work if you want relax environment, flexible work hours. In fact lots of people work from home. However, no challenges at work."
good,"I was able to utilize my skills and at the same time learn and strengthen new skills.  I enjoyed working with my colleagues and supervisor, this job helped me to pick up new lessons and sharpen my existing skills."
good,It was a competitive place to work. I have lots of fun with setting goals and competing with my fellow co-workers. Enjoyed working with my lead supervisor and finding ways to improve my goals.
good,"CTL has the right idea as they transform into a true industry leader in the IT infrastructure space.  The challenge we face is managing thru the implementation and providing a clear message about our direction and capabilities.  Many organizations still don't know who we are or what solutions we can provide... Once that all comes together, we may become unstopable!"
good,"To install telephones, internet and prism tv. Work on lines in and above ground to trouble shoot issues. Work with various depts. to get the job done."
good,"Good to learn technologies , Poor Management , Poor facilities , Well it depends on your manager to get work from home , Favoring depends on how good you are with your manager"
good,"A typical day at work, would be just come in, log in, start taking notes and help customers with their needs. Hardest part of the job, was the training. Reasons, one, as soon as you are on the phone, you are part of the center, so you have the pressure to learn everything in a short amount of time. And since CenturyLink, is always in queue you must be fast or else you are threatened that the FCC will fine the building. What I learned about Centurylink was how to up sell and ask questions and to close the sale, How to build trust with the customer in a professional manner."
good,"i have not really been given any chance to advance and they are in a hiring freeze, so it's time to move one."
good,"I was a contractor for TEK Systems, working in an old windowless building for Century Link.  My job of building a phone data base and call center groups was not being done by anyone else.  I worked on a project I enjoyed for the learning experience."
good,A typical day with this agency was enjoyable. Spent mostly indoors and remoted into network devices. Not physically demanding but mentally challenging. Co-workers were knowledgeable and assisted each other often. Management was hands off unless it was required to be hands on.
good,it would be nice to be appreciated and not as much pressure for numbers not in your control and to provide the necessary tools in the chat flow and atmosphere to be successful.
good,Fun work place with friendly management. Really great experience with analysis as well as learning new skills both technical and analytical.
good,Energetic team that is only fun if you don't need a work-life balance and thrive on fire drills and manual work.  Company culture is not my cup of tea.
good,"good place to work, large opportunity for long term career if you can survive M&A RIF. Not sure now with TW the culture how the things are going. Co workers in general all good. Hardest part of the job is lookign over shoulder for next RIF"
good,"The company has done some major restructuring in their inside sales departments, multiple years in a row.  Usually not for the better.  They are still stuck in old business practices that don't appeal to the millennial."
good,Working in a clean environment with interaction with a lot of customers on daily basis. I was able to improve upon my customer service skills
good,"No direction... Ego driven. The culture is a me, me, me culture. Every department is only concerned with themselves. Only a few people who know what it is to offer support."
good,Century Link is  a great company with great benefits but unless you are truly fit for a sales position and are a great talker I would not recommend it. There is more hard driven sales than customer services.
good,"I started as an Access Services Rep, the transition to circuit design was a natural.  I specialized in Switch Access and was able to continue in that function.  Work with alot of great people, both internally and externally."
good,"Great manager, co-workers, steady flow of projects and suport is always there. equipment is well rounded and easy to troubleshoot and repair. Company trucks are wll built and have all the tools needed."
good,Left after company aquired our department.  A/R was moved to Shreveport LA so unable to give review of company. Good severance package though.
good,"Answering questions and concerns new and existing customers  had, Learned great deal about Internet, cable and phone products and services. Management and the co-workers overall were friendly, "
good,I've had the opportunity to work with people and equipment that have exponentially increased my experience in the networking field.
good,If you like customer sales in service jobs this the perfect place for you.  The supervisor were all very knowledgable able the systems used.
good,"SAVVIS boasts to have one of the largest data center networks in the country.  Their sales force is ultra competitive, which has created a lot of turnover in their staff over the years."
good,People that work with you higher seniority don't want to retire. You won't get vacation around holidays. Parking is awful you have to pay to park your car when you work.
good,"Good place, but they really don't exercise diversity as they say they do.  Company went through a lot changes (buy outs).  They were unstable when I was there."
good,"very aggressive in bringing numbers up.  lots of overtime.  It has been a long time sence I worked there, so I don't have a lot of good information."
good,"I would take incoming calls and manage customers billing and accounts, while selling them either a higher speed of internet or internet or television or cellular phones or a landline or home security, always looking for something to improve their account to have more products to make them more ""sticky"" to the  company. Then on to the next call to do the same thing. I enjoyed speaking to the customer, however I did not enjoy the way they made us sale to the customer no matter what."
good,"The best part of my day is when a new agent calls into my queue with a question. I love helping people and answering questions to help them grow in their job."
good,"Centurylink is a good company to work for if you can get on permanently there.  If you are working through a Staffing Agency, it is very difficult to get the the same benefits through the staffing agency than when a person is hired permanently.  "
good,Although Sales are their focus the customers concerns rarely get resolved. Being a sales driven company the lack of commitment to customer service is bothering. Very strict by the second clock ins and clock outs. Felt almost like we were kids and were micro managed. Love the pay but not the job.
good,"This company was going through a major transition and overhaul while I was there which contributed to a great deal of mismanagement, volatility, multiple objective changes, and executive shuffling. The people were great, there was work/life/family support initially. They have since been purchased by CenturyLink, so I don't know what the environment is like, could drastically different."
good,"Lead duties twice a week, work from two Kissimmee stores, team environment, provide customer service face to face and over the phone, process payments, handle returns and exchange, answer and resolve customer inquiries, sales position with quota, help maintain store appearance, check voice mail, check office supplies, stay on top of company news and training."
good,The company before the sale was a great place to work. The employees were respected and valued. After the sale to Centurylink that all changes.
good,"Large company with wide variety of telecom offerings, currently in flux after merger/acquisitions activities."
good,"Must be ready to field inbound calls constantly through out the day, sometimes longer than eight hours."
good,Working for Century was a great opportunity. I was provided with a great sense of belonging and felt invested by the company. Being a sales and customer service company it has it pros and cons. Best pro was the team felt atmosphere. Worst con was the management of customer accounts.
good,"review customer accounts, process complaints, adjustments, calculate rates, work with other departments, Partners, Sales reps, repair and all other co-workers."
good,"going to work, scheduled breaks same time every day, very routine. Took calls in a customer service setting while having a sales goal as well. Selling other products for other companies and managing multiple systems at once."
good,"Assisted service customers via phone, which includes billing questions, service questions, repair, and upgrades for tv home phone internet and cell phones."
good,closed my department no longer within the company small biz was closed in the company
good,"Answered incoming phone calls from different regions regarding billing and account issues, resolution of billing and customer account issues, trouble shooting for basic repairs prior to sending out a technician, processing work orders for repairs."
good,"Building relationship with clients to secure new revenue, to maintain a steady revenue flow and acquired new accounts including Grubb & Ellis Management, UnitedHealthcare, Rocky Mountain Surgery Center, St. Michael Archangel and ASI Constructors."
good,"I've worked for Centurylink for 18 years and they have just advised they are closing their Seatle office as of September and we will no longer have jobs.  I've enjoyed working here and I love my federal govt customers who I have worked with very closely.  I am able to work independently with minimal supervision.  My manager is there if I need him, otherwise he leaves me alone.  He knows if he needs help with anything he can come to me as well.  The hardest part of the job is working with a customer who is very upset, yet the most rewarding part of the job is solving their problem and turning the situation around."
good,I learn the company give great rewards for jobs well done. I had great coworkers who unilaterally shared information to insure success.
good,"Per the terms of the settlement, I am not allowed to discuss."
good,"A day of work is very intense, you have to take care of your customers in every aspect in order to resolve any situation about their accounts."
good,Good benefits but old corporate mentality. They do things because that's the way they have always done them.
good,Its a call center environment. Provides the opportunity to learn a lot of different computer systems and service offerings to enhance my skills. We handle incoming phone calls from the customers to help them with their orders. Between calls we review and process the orders.
good,Enjoy working here. It's a good place to work. The people make the work environment enjoyable.
good,"I have been learned a great deal on enterprise level applications and support structures. I have really enjoyed my relationships with co-workers, and the opportunity I have to work with so many different groups of people."
good,"Typical day at work consists of some troubleshooting, sales regularly, and some complaints. Management is fair and will work with you if you are willing to progress. Co-workers can be anti-social at times but it depends on the person. Hardest part can be selling due to cost at times."
good,The company was nice to work for but the sales goal requirement to pass training was high.
good,"Fun place to work, trained people well and everyone was very nice."
good,company is expanding from a smaller regional carrier to a multinational telco. With this there are obvious growing pains that at times made it difficult to service the customers.
good,Learned to use many different computer systems.  Hardest part of job was trying to sell products.  The co-workers were very nice for the most part.  I loved my boss.
good,"no job security, is a revolving door.  nice work environment.  great co workers. schedule changes a lot have to check schedule daily due to changes."
good,This was a great company. They offered many different contests and set goals for employees. They were focused on creating an enviroment that was fun and interactive.
good,"As a specialist, I really enhanced my interpersonal skills while working here."
good,Monitored increasing growing live network daily.  Increased productivity despite
good,"Inbound calls, customer inquiries regarding the accounts, billing questions, disconnect service and add new services.   Must calls are from irritated customer because the bill is higher than the representative told them. "
good,"Good money, good hours, good people, GREAT job overall. Too bad they closed."
good,"I was responsible to train Qwest employees on all of the OnFiber processes I managed and maintained. Complete customer billing, customer service and collection of accounts and many other duties. I was recognized many times as employee of the month and for my collection success."
good,CenturyLink was a good place to gain valuable experience on networking technology and to keep abreast of changing telecommunications trends.
good,Centurylink was a  job  where learning something  new was a everyday task. It  was great I loved  speaking and  dealing  with the public assisting  their  customers  with billing issues and walking them thru different  ways to better their  service. The  hardest part of the  job  was trying to sell to those that were calling in to  remove  products due to loosing  employment.
good,"A typical day usually involves interacting with customers in person or by telephone to process telephone and other telecommunications-related orders for new installations, disconnections, moves, adds, long distance carrier changes, customer record maintenance, and other telephone service arrangements. Complete and process service orders, as needed, and ensure timely installation or service for the customer."
good,"Variety of work was typical and could change hourly; frequent customer interactions were very rewarding; the long, hard work was personally rewarding. Safety was key in every aspect of the work, tracing down and repairing electrical problems, and learning about air flow and air pressure."
good,Company was desperately looking to be bought.  It finally happened.  Very tough years leading up until then.
good,"1. Lead a team of 6 members"
good,Overall great place to work at. Management needs to pay more attention to employee feedback. Some changes are not well thought and make duties harder than improving efficiency.
good,The more it changes the same it is. Always trying to reinvent the wheel. Not proactive. New company has no interest in having QA to ensure their reps are treating customers correctly
good,"Each day is very productive and I enjoy working with all staff and management. I am someone who loves to learn something new, retain it and be able to apply it. This company is constantly changing and growing so it has been great to be a part of so many advances with technology and services."
good,Moral was terrible- managers cover their own resulting in loss of jobs on the agents- high stress causing many employees to go out of leave of absence.
good,I learned a lot working for Qwest because I was able to do so many different jobs there. Managment needed work because there was a lot of survival of the fittest mentality. Not a lot of working together.
good,"CenturyLink is rapidly acquiring other companies and in doing so, they are not using due diligence to assess the skills and experience of employees at acquired companies before laying them off. As a result, CenturyLink has lost a huge amount of talented, skilled and experienced people that could have helped the company move forward and gain credibility in the geographic markets they are expanding into."
good,Duties include demonstrating a strong focus on retention and growth of the customer's business
good,"Responsible for preparing and facilitating difference products for business and residence needs. Internet services, high speed DSL, local/long distance telephone service. I was the direct contact person for introducing new solutions, negotiating and reviewing contract for new and existing clients."
good,"THere is healthy environment at Centurylink , management is good , get time to relax apart from work."
good,"A typical day at work was to log into all required systems, and take incoming calls. Calls ranged from questions about billing, technical service issues, or to inquire about different products offered through Centurylink. I learned how to persuade people that were on the fence on purchasing a new product into going ahead with the purchase. My co-workers were great and I enjoyed the relationships I created with many of them. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the angry customers that were not calling for help, but to vent. The most enjoyable part of my job was connecting with my customers and being able to help them with any or all of their issues and enhance their communication / entertainment needs for thier families."
good,"i enjoy my position collecting balances and payments from customers, sometimes the collection is hard because customers always have an excuse as to why they cant make a payment but I always find a way for a promised payment.Everything at work is great as far as the environment and my co-workers. However with this company there is no stability."
good,CenturyLink is a decent place to work. The director of the call center does not micromanage the Supervisors which is very appealing to me. The hardest part of the job is making sure that each of your representatives get the training that they need. The most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships with your representatives and watching them become successful.
good,i loved the job but communication was lacking about new sales opportunities knowledge is success
good,"I work directly with small businesses across the nation. I set up their business phone, internet, and TV in the most efficient way possible. I get them started with realistic product analysis and appropriate account review. We work together to find the most productive way to increase revenue and widen exposure. On a daily basis I work to satisfy my customer needs through an understanding of their common goal, success!"
good,"Daily interaction with customers to employ product knowledge. A great place to develop customer service skills. Learned a great deal regarding order posting, tracking, and auditing. Able to develop personal skills regarding the training, motivation, coaching, and development of newly hired employees throughout the initial training stages. A great place for challenges."
good,"Each morning I log into our Avaya phone system and do customer support from 6am to 10:30am with a 15 minute break in between which is one of the perks in my job in my mind, then go on split where there is a gym located in the building and rest area to eat lunch and take a short nap after a shower. I then start the second half of my shift at 1pm working to resolve customer internet, pc, and e-amil issues including troubleshooting customer lines through remedy and determine if a tech is needed to the home or if I can resolve the issue myself. I also implement sales into my calls to meet a monthly quota. I then get off work at 6:30pm and do this Sunday through Wednesday with Thursday through Saturday off."
good,Typical work day began at 7 and ended at 4. No weekend work necessary. Flexible work schedule days - 2 in Whiteville and 3 in Hope Mills. Trained myself when company switched systems we were using and taught company folks as necessary to complete closings. Most management great. Hardest part of job was dealing with folks who did not know their jobs well and had low work ethics. Most enjoyable part was setting and accomplishing goals in a timely manner and working with co-workers with same work ethics to accomplish the tasks.
good,"Centurylink is a Sales driven organization who focuses on products and sales and not the people that surround it. They have a knack for gaining new business but they often suffer when trying to maintain the customers they work hard to win. In a nutshell they have great products and services but if they became more customer centric they would probably dominate in any and every market they compete in large or small. The company seems to have some strengths such as great service, experienced in merger acquisitions, and a network of highly dependable engineers and tech services, also with great training programs. If you seek a highly competitive job with good pay and no work life balance Centurylink is a great starting sales place for anyone."
good,has no future. Almost no job advancement. Sales goals are almost impossible to hit.
good,"This is a good place to work if you are trying to get your foot in the door to the IT world. Everyone starts out as a contractor, and the average person here is a contractor for about 2 years, with little pay and no benifits. 24x7 work environment in a NOC with 3 different shifts."
good,if you like high pressure selling in a non sales environment then this is the place for you
good,No longer in business. Bought by Century Link. Was union so wages were high.
good,"I call this a 9month job, because unless you are a super seller, you will not make it. I had 30 people in my training class, when I got fired after a year, there was only 8 people left. Most people got fired after 4 months and then after that it was 2 or more people a month. They just kept disappearing. Its not a very stable job. But I will say that the money was excellent, even for just a year."
good,"If you are a ""hunter"" and will really put in the time and effort, the compensation, at least in the past has been excellent. That being said, what the effect of the recent purchase by CenturyLink will be on that is hard to determine. Sales management and senior sales management tends to be weak. Focus is more on colocation opportunities than managed services, but still the compensation is good."
good,This is a good job... The only thing that is wrong with the job is that you have to meet sales levels and the levels were pretty high where it was at time really hard to meet your #s.
good,I was employed at Level 3 before it was acquired by CenturyLink. Many of us were laid off once the acquisition was announced and as it neared. Very low morale for the people that were let go due to corporate politics!
good,"I grew professionally working for CenturyLink, but it was very hard to get through the process. Tough to learn new things. The company has purchased a lot of good performing companies. Unfortunately, they still struggle integrating the operations"
good,"The work environment, building, offices, and cafeteria are primo nice. That is where it stops because beyond that, they only want to hire in contractors in 12 month positions and often times your individual supervisor may work from another state altogether. Tier II NetEng was not as expected or interviewed and ended up only being a glorified call center job at the enterprise level remotely checking T1 and mostly T3 circuits and nothing was hands on or even required any real prior experience. Very slow upward movement and promotion opportunities were quite stagnant."
good,"Offices furnished to modern designs, works well, flexible on working locations and WFH options. "
good,This company is disorganized and complex to work for. There are a lot of really nice people who are willing to help though. It just takes a long time to get anything accomplished.
good,"Best Job Work/Life Balance."
good,"I was deployed at client site 100% of my time, so this review is not for folks working at and with CTL employees in their corporate office locations. Non-barganing side of the business was trying to grow with lots of struggles, usual for a company of that size in telco vertical. People are, as usual nice, management wants to get things done without roughing feathers too much. Expectations are manageable. If you're driven in your own career, or trying to make a difference, expect and embrace frustrations and learn how to work the ropes. It's hierarchical for sure. Individual contributor roles are probably far more satisfying, than mid to upper leadership roles."
good,"I've been working for CenturyLink since Jan/2015. During this time, I  discovered that there are many benefits aside from the pay and medical services such as events, networking, and a management team that keeps you up to date on the latest innovations in the industry."
good,I worked for what is now Centurylink for 38years.  It was a good company to work for.  Now there is not much room for movement as there was in the beginning.  I appreciate all that I learned from working here.
good,Job started out great changes got made not so good anymore I don't reccomend anyone to work at CenturyLink looking for jobs on indeed  even part time cost of living goes up wages dont at CenturyLink
good,"Ability to work autonomously and remotely at times for regional executive team members. Had a great opportunity to engage with community organizations - chambers, economic development organization, etc. - as well as opportunity to work within the community volunteering for various organizations."
good,"Cant stick for long term."
good,A typical day at work involved pulling AP reports out of SAP.  I would then verify the bills were coded correctly to the dept I supported.  At month end I prepared journal entries for reclasses and accruals.  I worked with G/L to ensure proper coding.  I met all my deadlines.
good,The work and teams were great but the constant layoffs and rightsizing practices added stress and insecurity to the overall experience. In order to get ahead you must be willing to relocate.
good,I made decent money working for CenturyLink. However the job was usually stressful and there was no job security. From one day to the next day you did not know if your job was going to be there. There are goals and in the beginning they seemed attainable but then there was alot of changes within the company which made it difficult to get the required sales to keep your position.
good,"I have built cloud solutions for private and public cloud providing  Infrastructure solutions ( IAAS) . "
good,Nice company to work for with average benefits. Work life balance is good. Management is not great due to acquisitions. You face a lot of turmoil and confusion.
good,CenturyLink is real tough to work for their training is always done on the computer by yourself there's no hands on training. They teach at a bare minimum.
good,The Company purchased to many companies in a short span of time and in doing so there isn't one way of doing things as far as process. Alot of talent left and the management of the Company could improve.
good,"Working there is great for benefits and services.  However, stress is extremely high.  Sales is a high priority, even though most of my duties were billing oriented.  Most of their services still run through copper wiring, very few fiber optic regions.  Due to being an aging technology form was a difficult sale, and difficult selling to upset and angry people after discussing their bill.  Do able but not for the weak.  Not meeting those sales goals or QA got you booted quickly, many co-workers came and went."
good,The organization needs to hire more people in order to be more effective and less stress on current personal. Management is very good thought. Always willing to help
good,"I've enjoyed the people I've worked with, the different roles I have worked in and the benefits are very nice. My department changed around a bit in the time I have been here but it has been good."
good,"I was allowed to work remotely from home, which was a big bonus in my Senior Billing Coordinator position, and allowed me to start and complete projects and daily work functions more efficiently."
good,"Great Sales Team who are confident and capable in what they do."
good,While working at Centurylink I learned a lot about the security field as far as how to trouble shoot systems and dispatching on alarms. I also learned how to bill and schedule technicians properly. I learned a lot about data entry. I had an adequate experience at this job. Management was very scattered and I did not ever feel like effective decisions were made with job duties or in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that were difficult to deal with although that did not always happen. The most enjoyable part was learning something new constantly.
good,CenturyLink once had promise for becoming a top tier place to work in technology.  Senior management has experienced high turnover.  Difficult location for headquarters in Monroe LA.  IT manager services group managed by technical evangelists which has it advantages and disadvantages.
good,"High Volume calls, Monday thur Friday work schedule, friendly coworkers, growth opportunities just depend on what department you worked for in the company."
good,Century Link was a fun place to work in my 20's. I made a lot of money then in commission. the hours however  when you start can be challenging if you have kids.
good,I worked with a really close group. I had been there nearly ten years and leaving was not a choice. We were very competitive and loved working with our customers. It was a feel good environment that I miss very much
good,The people you work with and your direct management it great. Upper Management and their lack of support not so great. The call centers are causal dress and that's awesome. The job is not hard and the pay is good as well. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers.
good,"Overall it was a good job but management you haven't been in the field should spend time out their so that they can understand more. Most of the time the only down side is the pure lazyness of the high senority woorkers because they have the low men as a cushion the due less then the bare minimum and force most of the work on those that actually do their job, however their is no reprocutions for that and when it come time for lay off they get to keep their jobs while the hard working lower guys lose theirs."
good,"I come in at 10:30am which you have to be ready to take your first call at 10:35am. You are on the phone answering each call until your first 15 minute break. then about 3 hours you have a 30 minute lunch and your last 15 minutes about 1 hour and a half before 7pm. Sometimes the marketing department will have blitz, power hour, or contest to win lunch, gift cards, uploads, or CenturyLink gear. You have to be mentally prepared and on your A game as I work in the sales and care inbound call center. You answer 28-40 calls a day and have to transition to a sale. It can be mentally draining and the hours as I'm a mom and student so I'm strained with time. The hours are not really flexible for students or parents. You are on a point system when you miss work but they do have ""flex"" time. Yo will work a few hours before or after your shift and can have a day off within the week. You cannot miss Mondays as it is double point day. Major holidays you have off and within the day the company has little surveys or quizzes which you get food."
good,"The hardest part of the job is the limited resources due to the focus on mergers.  Primary job duties and objectives are subservient to merger related activities, resulting in a mismatch between job objectives and job activities and results."
good,"Management is fine, co-workers are great, pay is pretty good, too much work to do in too little time, stressful. Position is very technical, yet requires people and sales skills, very challenging."
good,Ok company but needs to update with the time as far as internet service so they can compete with other internet providers across the board and keep jobs local
good,"CenturyLink was the last company that acquired the former Mountain Bell Telephone Operating Company. Unfortunately through the years that followed the ""Break-up"" of the Bell System each time the management changed the end result was worse for both the customers and the employees. CenturyLink has very little regard for employees or customers. The telecommunications industry is still a great environment to work in and offers lots of opportunities."
good,"Centurylink starts at a fairly low pay, but as you progress in tenure and sales, your pay and commission increases. Good opportunity but very stressful and mentally tolling. Benefits are great and some of the managers are amazing. This job is a classic example of micromanaging."
good,Work is not too demanding as long as you stay on top of your duties; pay could be increased a bit for off-line staff but health benefits were excellent; good efforts to build team/dept morale and engagement with out of office activities and team events
good,We have an event 2 to 3 times a year but this is new. Level 3 was bought by CenturyLink but they keep some of the same management from Level 3 in key places. The same people that was not growing the company are still in charge.
good,"My work day was extremely busy. I answered several calls per day and had to multitask often. I enjoyed the ladies I worked with and overall, the work environment was laid back."
good,Consistency is key and self motivation is ur focus and u can win here. The commission is nice and so is the pay but the inconsistency is not motivating.
good,This company is a good place to learn networking skills. There are many groups working together to get the activation of a customer's service successful.
good,"Telecom companies are in a bind.  They are required and continue to get revenue from legacy services such as voice and DSL.  But the take rate on voice is today very limited - even on DSL, leased circuits, and video.  As a result, the company has to quickly change to become a transport provider only , which requires retaining legacy expertise, while at the same time adapting systems, processes and people to low margin transport-only models.  Think of the huge cost switching to a SDN network for transport when, in fact, your revenue is eroding.  It is a complicated business model that requires nearly constant cost optimization."
good,"Within my own organization, I feel safe making suggestions, or even providing feedback about processes, decisions, and even management."
good,CenturyLink is a good place to work.   There is good opportunity for advancement and training.    Excellent network products and managed services.   Overall a good place to work.
good,"Having worked at 4 of the at that time 6 stores, I got to meet and get to know many customers and employees.  Some more enjoyable than others.  Throughout my 3 1/2 years with Century Link I learned the essence of getting along with co workers.  Specially when dealing with a sales job it is important to be able to communicate with fellow co workers in a well tone, professional manner.  Management was my breaking point as I did not feel the support of my superiors.  Favorite part of the job was meeting new and existing customers who all have their own unique stories.  Creating rapport has always been second nature to me.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with co workers on disputed sales.  Conflict is always troubling.  All in all grateful for the opportunity Century Link helped provide."
good,"Centurylink offers a good work environment and pays well. Opportunities for advancement are there but not always available."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time working at Qwest/Centurylink."
good,"This company is trying to advance into the new age, but still has the ways of the old phone company. They provide a ton of training in the beginning, in fact it's one of the best. However, actually putting the methods to work was tough. "
good,I did not like working with multiple customers at the same time; having one caller wait while taking care of a difficult situation with another caller at the same time.
good,Telco company trying to be more than what it can support internally with archaeic systems that consume ingenuity and time. work life balance was great although many offices frowned upon remote work even though no team collaboration daily.
good,"Managers are awesome, co workers are great. Shift hours are strenuous with little to no room for advancement in the the company. Customer service is an issue."
good,CenturyLink is a great place to work in but it's currently going through merger acquisition of Level 3 communications.  This has produced an extremely stressful situation for all employees since there are new products and processes to be learned and there's no quota adjustment for the sales teams.
good,"Not familiar with the work place since I worked from home, however, a lot of changes with management, therefore a lot of lay offs, no Christmas bonuses or raises"
good,The responsibilities are challenging and constantly changing so it is a fast-paced environment. Employees can grow great working/personal friendships but this isn’t truly encouraged unfortunately.
good,"The benefits are awesome. The pay is ok, more than most call centers. You can be promoted and get raises. Just stressful in the call centers.  But if you need to save money to get where you are going, this will work."
good,Good people to work with.  In this location there are down to earth hard working individuals.  Manager cares about the people under him and listens to ideas and/or suggestions.
good,I excelled in sales and leadership. The comp plan allowed me to make close to 200k in 15'. Advancement was hard as they liked to keep their top performers in the field.
good,"Able to surround yourself with great, hardworking and intelligent people.  The pace is frantic at times and requires strong navigation skills in very challenging work environment."
good,Quest Communications has been sold and they are no longer in business. They were the phone company in a fourteen state wide area. Great training program.
good,The culture has changed.  There was a point where working at CenturyLink was fulfilling.  Now it's basically everyone is walking on eggshells.  Communication to employees is poor.
good,"Great company, management direction lack sometime, moral low specially merger taking place but overall surviving is hard due to constant pressure and fear of reduction in force when missing the street numbers."
good,"Work Life Balance is a challenge at CenturyLink.  If you are willing to sacrifice it might be the right company for you.  Talent is a revolving door.   The company is selling one culture to new hires, but delivering something different.  Bottom line, I've sold my stock.  I think that says it all"
good,"Qwest was a pretty good place to work, but once Centurylink bought Qwest the work atmosphere went down considerably. Upper management is out of touch with the overall company."
good,Decent job but expect layoffs to happen every year that hit all departments.  You get used to the layoff cycle but it is still stressful and demoralizing.
good,I worked at the old Qwest side. It was a Union job. Subsequently rules are blindly enforced which is great... until it's not. Oppertunity for advancement seems random. Company is split between a Qwest and CenturyTel/Embarq side. Very odd. Will be interesting to see how the Level(3) merger plays into this.
good,This telecom industry has a diversity issue and Level 3 is no exception to that rule.  They try to put on a good show when it comes to senior level management diversity but that is all it is.  The men rule the roost here.
good,If you don't mind a stressful job century link pays very well. But my son was hit by a car and they would not work with me on time off. My direct supervisor was great but there is defenitly no wiggle room when it comes to emergencies.
good,job is suppose to have commission but there is not alot to make and the hourly was really low the only good thing about this job is you get to work from home if you live in the right area i moved to california and had to quit.
good,I was very fortunate at Qwest to have excellent managers that gave me a lot of freedom to explore new ways of providing software to our business partners.
good,"Level3 is a good place to work with good benefits, good colleagues, and good opportunities. However, especially with the pending Centurylink acquisition, the culture & consistency of the general environment have been growing worse. Many talented people are jumping ship & management seems out of touch with hourly workers."
good,CenturyLink's workplace culture allows for a quality work/life balance.  This has created a very productive environment where employees work to produce results in a multitude of ways.
good,Was given misinformation by recruiting company about commission payment. Management not understanding of health issues. My manager was great above all others. I observed many who have no guidance at all.
good,I am a people person and I love helping people but don't like to feel like walking on egg shells like to feel like coming to work is the best the customers are great just upper management and all the changes that keep coming
good,"Large Company, Process Heavy"
good,This company only cares about its management. If you decide that working in a call center environment is for you then CenturyLink is your cup of tea. If it's not then I highly recommend seeking other means of employment. The managers and supervisors make it sound like they care when then really don't. End of story.
good,Day to day requirements include sorting and working locates. Contacting contractors to coordinate meeting for excavating or clearing tickets. performing preventive maintenance on all equipment and sites as well as working any assigned trouble tickets.
good,"Centurylink pacifies the customers too much and it causes the company itself to suffer because of it. When you allow customers a chance to have services for 6 months without paying, it causes the company to be financially unstable. Centurylink also needs to do better with turnover rates, The company does lay-offs with employees without providing the options to switch to another department. But will hire someone else in the same position."
good,"Good work life balance, good for fresh graduates, good training, management can improve, Can provide more benefits for the employees"
good,"I have no regrets working at centurylink, other than the fact that the sales reps are abused by the callers, the ridiculous time management metrics that are impossible to please. Overall the pay was great, good benefits, but the workplace itself wasn't very receptive."
good,"Loved this company as US WEST and even QWEST was still family among the workforce ranks. Lots of title, departmental division during the last 5 years, made it very difficult to succeed."
good,Centurylink is a wonderful place to work. This company cares for their employees and it really shows. The paid time off and benefits are wonderful and the work environment is always fun and positive.
good,"this is not true for all employees, but for myself and others in my department."
good,"My summary says it all, the corporate office is not local and any issues that may arise that impact your job or home life are handled very black or white."
good,"Good company, stable work environment. Great network minded co-workers to learn and grow from. Can improve documented processes, and structures promotion opportunities. Understaffed NOC with high turnover rate."
good,"Everyone there was very friendly and kind. The trainers do their best to make sure that they have the best staff ready and available to help and the Work At Home position was an added bonus. Looking for every opportunity to make a sale is understandable but requiring a sale be made on every call, and if not, penalizing the agent for not being able to meet their sales quota of 75% makes for a tough environment to work in when your main goal is ""customer service"""
good,The things I learned and skills I sharpened while under their employ will prove to be very useful in the future. The company is a great start for anyone wanting to get into the tech field.
good,"Good people to work with and the pay is , however to many internal processes and procedures.  Spend half of your time dealing with internal obstacles."
good,the benefits are great with the company. if your not into sales there's no point in applying. Direct management is very helpful.
good,"I worked as a service desk technician. They were wise enough to understand that no service desk technician needs an office. In the 21st century we were able to work from home. "
good,"Currently my days consist with building VPN configurations and deploying them to their appropriate devices, there are some variations to each configuration but they all include VPN. The difficult aspect of the job is the fact that certain customers require tiny little things that are different yet immensely important to them so you have to remember what those caveats are."
good,"Top down driven hierarchal sales organization that is trying to shed it's legacy of telecommunications and pivot to a technology solutions provider.  "
good,I was an account manager and maintain my accounts and grew my territory monthly until Level 3 bought out tw telecom and they switched up everything.
good,"When I worked for them they had just taken over Qwest who I was working for and when they did this they raised the sales goals.  The new goals were quite a bit higher and for a lot unattainable.  Great hours, hours pay and benefits."
good,Company continues to realign approach to continue to meet the challenges of a competitive landscape. Departments manage employee relations very differently from one another sometimes creating frustration between employees.
good,I worked with a really great team. We all got along great and were very supportive of each other. The numbers part of the job was a disadvantage because we were problem solvers and it takes time. A three minute phone call may not solve the issue right away. If we do not take care of our customers somebody else will.
good,"I had to take calls from customer who wanted me to setup their new account, fixed their account, or disconnect the account. I sold them new and improved internet packages and was compensated for it."
good,CenturyLink fails in comparison to its predecessor Quest. Quest promoted a healthy and happy work environment and fostered relationships between employees and management. With the take over by CenturyLink the environment and level of employee appreciation and loyalty has deteriorated and in return the employees have become less motivated to perform and lack loyalty to their employer.
good,"CenturyLink required learning how to be responsible for various facets of a business while still being challenged with the challenges of being a traditional phone company.  A typical work day included balancing loads for the technicians for increased productivity to approving payroll, inventory of tools and stock, coordinating rehabilitation of outside plant, customer relations, and meeting service metrics.  Upper management challenged each supervisor to manage their own shops with decreased personnel and decreased budget for the third consecutive year.  "
good,"Acquired experience in fast paced environment, supporting diverse clients all over world in dynamic profession of Information Technology."
good,The only things that I really found good about this job is that they cared enough about their employees to compensate them well and provide great insurance.
good,Was responsible for retaining customers calling to disconnect services while also providing value in additional products to help benefit their lives
good,"It is a good place to work, however it is very hard to advance  and the job responsibilities are always changing. I have a learned a lot about the telephony company, i loved my coworkers, management was management, some more people friendly than others. The hardest part of the job is adapting to the always changing processes."
good,"It was great to have flexibility in the job.  However, the expectations of management were hard to achieve due to a lack of support."
good,"Normal work environment, but with aim of selling off. "
good,I started with the company as a customer service operator and later stepped into a management roll with Centurylink. I had the opportunity to learn and experience many new things. I gained a large amount of knowledge that will carry over with me in future jobs.
good,"Over 4.6 years of experience in software testing with a thorough knowledge of System,Functional, Regression and Performance testing methodologies. Hands on experience in design and development of QC Test Plans and execution of Test Cases for both Automated and Manual Testing."
good,"Working in a call center with internal customers can be challenging...determining and prioritizing emergencies above other requests. Multiple systems used to provide tracking, and entering orders while answering multiple phone lines. I learned to listen more closely to customers concerns and work diligently to solve them."
good,"sat in cubicle all day (10plus hours). staff was great, but hated being yelled at by customers."
good,"The last duties I performed involved the Network Inventory Consolidation (NIC) Project.  With the merger of several companies over the past 5-6 years, processes and standards are still being ironed out."
good,"I have learned about the business in my work, how important to have customer satisfaction. Got together with my co-workers and got an opportunity to learn from the as well.."
good,it's a typical large company call center with metrics. I worked with some really nice people and was fortunately enough to be able to work at this company
good,"I loved working for CenturyLink, lots of tenured employees. Excellent management. I loved that higher execs would take us to lunch and wanted our input. Sales engineering was sometimes hard to come by if you're in a remote location. It took too long to generate a contract."
good,"There is certainly room for improvement. The consumer sales floor is EXTREMELY competitive driven and often times VERY stressful. Pick your battles carefully, go into this position ready and eager for a challenge, and expect to be challenged. There is a lot to learn about the telecommunication's industry, and lots of room to branch out. Not a whole lot of room to grow from entry level positions, but for the most part the job is pretty secure. Best bet is to take advantage of all the benefits they offer, get some school, then look at other opportunities. It is a really good experience."
good,Shifts would very every month. Mainly answer and help customers with phone line issues as well as sales on line care. Filled out dispatch tickets for on the field technicians. Had to be detailed and prestige.
good,CenturyLink has a very good work culture. The flexi time policy helps you to maintain the balance between your work and ur personal life.
good,"Its a very large company and so you are only a number. I have to say a long time ago it was a very great place to work. And the co-workers were great, for the most part all very knowledgable. Not so much now."
good,Centurylink is not a bad place to work IF you know that sales are the main objective. If you don't maintain quota you will be relieved from your job. Company has great benefits. I am a person who typically does not want to sit at a desk with no option of getting up. You are accountable for time you are off phone.
good,"The best part about this job was learning to really care for children. I received hands on experience .The management was poor because my schedule wasn't consistent and the manger had a bad disposition ,above all it was a great learning experience."
good,This is a call center position. Your entire day you are answering phone calls from small business owners with questions about their bill statements and services. You are required to hit sales and product goals as well as maintain a great customer service attitude. I truly enjoy my co-workers and the management with the company. The hardest part of the position would be the starting salary and the time it takes to get to top pay out.
good,A typical day at work is monitoring agents daily activities. Working with confidential informaton such as processing FMLA requests. Work with schedule management and attendance correctives.Partner with meeting service level requirements of the company. Positive atmosphere. There are oportunities of advancing. Benefits are good. What I learned from this job is that you can do anything you want as long as you work hard and be passionate about it. I enjoying working with the employees.
good,"Typical day was checking trouble ticket bucket, email, project or staff conference calls, working tickets"
good,"it was a great experience to work there for over 17 years. it was a fun place to thrive and excel for the most part."
good,"Technology and expertise wise,  few years behind some of the top companies in Data Science field."
good,"They have competitive pay , with raises ever 6 months until you reach the cap. You will likely love the people you work with. But the company itself, changes constantly; some policies do not make sense even to management. Hard to get promoted. They have ""supplementals"" or layoffs frequently."
good,"Whenever Rob from the home office shows up... someone is about to be robbed of their career."
good,"Unless you like getting yelled at every day then go for it. Unfortunately, This was not a great job for me. The environment is very stressful and competitive. The management and benefits were great, but not worth the stress."
good,most managers in tech support dept could did not know how to help with tech issues. Understaffed in many states. When CL bought Quest they bought an operation that had a lot of old cables and etc. This was causing very long times for repairs
good,"immediate management is good and healthy, but overall corporate decisions can make your position work harder.  Great benefits, great coworkers, advancement is available if you are willing to relocate.  You will learn a lot about order and conflict resolution."
good,CenturyLink is a great second level job for anyone that has previous call center/customer service experience.  However the job is relative to your location. The Tarboro branch seems to be the lowest on the totem pole with information given last and the grunt work issued first. Communication isn't that great in relation to why or how the tasks are distributed and often leaves agents feeling under appreciated.  However the culture in that branch is next level. The skills that you learn here overly prepare you for any other call center that you'd wish to go to.  There's a strong family vibe with laid back supervisors and team support. Unless you end up on the one team with the supervisor that acts as the music and fun police.  Overall I would definitely recommend this job.
good,"I enjoyed what I was doing when I had a job there, I was laid off due to reduction of workforce. Everyone I worked with for the most part are nice people."
good,"Company downsizes the employees and doesn't back fill. is flexable to getting time off and has great benefits, but falls short on pay. Work load its timed down to the second even the breaks. you are encouraged to work harder for promotions but they only come if someone quits, not seeing openings appears unless you are in sales."
good,Promotes from within and salary range is very competitive.  Overall a good company to work for and continue your career.  Environment is laid back and managers are all pretty much hands off.
good,Good place to work at. I miss the people I use to work with. Management needs to improve more. Great potlucks and holidays parties....................
good,"I am well compensated in my role for this company, but believe I can no longer balance my home life with the demands of my overnight position. I commute 120 miles a day and work 10 hour shifts, to include remote off shift meetings around the clock. I do enjoy the culture of the company, but can longer handle working nights after doing so for a solid decade."
good,"Learnt new technologies here, workplace culture is good, flexible work timings, work environment depends on the project allocated to you. Many things can get better though."
good,Overall Centurylink is a place that I have enjoyed working at for the past 9 years. I have gained a tremendous amount of knowledge and have really grown as an employee and manager during the 9 years. The company has many opportunities to get involved and offer a very competitive living wage.
good,"It's a big company and there are a lot ""micro"" cultures, so hopefully you get a good supervisor in a good organization.  The good news is that if you don't like the organization you are in, there are often other opportunities withing the company so you can change positions but still get to keep your vacation (& you don't have to start over again at 2 weeks of vacation as if you just started).  Also it starts with 4 weeks of vacation (so that is awesome), & when I left 2 years ago they still  had really good benefits.  I made some really good (& life long) friends there & the pay was really good too, but I also encountered some really bad Supervisors, Directors, VPs and Organizations as well.  Overall I would still recommend working there (if given the opportunity), especially if you end up with a good Supervisor in a good Organization."
good,"A typical day at CenturyLink started with dead-eyed ""good morning"" and a high chance of two people arguing over something that happened the night before outside of work. There was more drama there than I experienced in high school.. The company is constantly firing people due to their performance or the company can't afford that position anymore, anyone could go at anytime."
good,"Worked there prior to new CEO, it's a different place to work"
good,"Fun job to work at and enjoyable grate team work and support system. Teams are very helpful and always available for any question, Supervisors always available for support"
good,"This is a great company to"
good,"The Help Desk constantly shrank through attrition leaving a heavy workload for those left on the job. We were micromanaged as the workload increased and encouraged to compete for bi-yearly shifts and work at home privileges. After watching a dept of 140 shrink to 15 over the last 10 years we were laid off and the Help Desk was outsourced overseas."
good,"A typical day in my role involved working frequently with clients as well as colleagues to sell new services and manage the existing base of revenue."
good,hours vary from day to day you are guaranteed 40 hours per week with opportunities for overtime. they do have a mandatory overtime policy in place and when its activated you must work it. The management is knowledgeable and do help you when needed you do have a supervisor that cares about you while working there.
good,"There are a lot of systems and processes that have been added with Level 3 merge. It has never been easy to process orders, but management helps...just slowly."
good,I was offered a early buy out and now I am seeking a new opportunity. I have extensive telecommunication knowledge and am willing to learn even more. I look forward to the chance of working for you.
good,Face past environment and constant changes. I have developed my professional and communication skills at Centurylink. The people who I work with are great and are great resources in helping in my career development.
good,"I learned immensely from working with CenturyLink, and enjoyed growing myself professionally, but there was a clear precedent that you were to learn from the managers when they were available to you as interns. The most enjoyable parts of the job were certainly when you'd get opportunities to actively acquire new accounts, or act on your work, especially with the group efforts that were involved in campaign advertisements for new territories receiving availability for new services."
good,"When I started in 2001, Centurylink was the place to work.  Now in 2018, there are at least 2-3 floors empty and they are no longer hiring.  This was a great place to work.  I enjoyed the positions I held thru the years and the people I worked with were the greatest."
good,Increased use of contractors is the new company direction so internal employee population is shrinking. I really enjoy my job here and would love to stay but job security is very low.
good,It is a challenge to get things done.  CTL is not investing in my area of the company so it just gets harder.  We are losing our ability to deliver a quality service to our customers.
good,Level 3 Communications was a good place to learn and grow into a telecommunications environment from an infrastructure and project management perceptive. The were recently acquired by CenturyLink.
good,I loved it in the beginning but after not receiving a raise or a title change. I am tired of working for a company that doesn't seem to have me in there best interest anymore.
good,The expectations are high and the hours required on my particular position were very high. Ever since CenturyLink took over Qwest the overall atmosphere in the company has completely changed.
good,"A lot of on call work do to lack of employees, to much territory to cover.Learned a lot about communication business.Management was as big business goes. Work place was customer based.Hardest part was travel at all hours. Most enjoyable was pretty much self managed"
good,"Overall a good place to work but lack of progression. Friendly staff and enjoyable atmosphere."
good,"It is a job..Not a bad job, but sometimes the things that are asked of you are insane. I am a person that can adapt to change, but this company does to much changing without explanation. Job security for the last 2yrs has not been comfortable, you work for an entire day then asked to go into coaching meeting with your supervisor and then get fired at the end of your shift..Thats not fair at all. When I started the job I loved it now Im there because I have to be to take care of my family"
good,"Good place to contract with. Pay and communication was good. Support to customer was not good, and therefore, jobs in the engineering for fiber optics were few and eliminated because of customer relations."
good,The Internship at CenturyLink was a little more flexible in the jobs that I did. I was able to take my coding knowledge and apply that to problems I would try and solve.
good,"Centurylink was a very interesting job to have. I liked that it was fast paced, and challenging. When a customer would appear on my line, it was a different scenario than the last, and to be able to relate or to even commit to having a conversation while trying to assist in the issue at hand was very mentally stimulating. Not every person on the phone is happy to speak with you, so it was very fun and thrilling in that aspect. When it came to trying to pitch a sale to someone, that was the most challenging portion of the job, trying to convince the person that our product is the best, and they'd be crazy not to buy into it. Overall, Centurylink was not a bad place to work, a new management team would have been a great option for growth."
good,"Typically work 7-4 with an hour lunch. Management is fair and my teammates are great, like family. If it wasn't for needing to relocate and job security I wouldn't be leaving."
good,"Fast paced, never the same issue or problem. One of my favorite parts of the job was figuring out the solution and providing it to the client.  Overall a good place to work."
good,"Company was constantly changing structure of positions.  confusing.  team managers are like baby sitters, with no real power or influence to make changes.  all situations are run by union contract guidelines.  very impersonal."
good,"Nice work life balance."
good,"Its a good place to work and the people are really good to work with. The only problem is that lay offs happen literally every year. sometimes two times a year, which makes the job very fragile."
good,"Company is sales driven, learned a lot from the company, just very sales driven, very stressful company when in training it was great and during green house was awesome when going on the team was told not much help besides telling you what you are not doing right, but not taught how to fix the problem. But company did teach me a lot and we got a lot of free food and the pay was good as well as benefits. Job is for some people that are sales driven."
good,Long Hours and followed you home. Not much to add but that it was most stressfull job I have experienced and they didn't have much of a training program.
good,"Typical company, if you are a don't rock the boat type, you will fit.  If you show ambition and a go getter which tends to make others look bad, you probably won't fit in."
good,"Worked for this company for 17 yrs. Good Management. Advancements available. Good working atmosphere. "
good,Back office systems needed to do daily chores were continously being changed with alot of disruption to daily work.  Required alot of additional time every week to keep up with new features
good,"answer phones"
good,"Lots of freedom, management was flexible and easy to work with. Mergers and acquisitions created a very confusion environment and processes were changed in some markets and not in others."
good,"Great incentives to do better. Upbeat and good place to work, but when it comes to flexibility on life situations that arise. If a person enjoys talking on phone and has good customer service skills, this is a great direction, but if you get sick or have family emergencies miss a few days, it doesn't matter how well you do at all other duties."
good,Hard work they expect a lot from their employees. Union environment mandatory OT. Good pay and benefits. Some advancement opportunities however as a big company they need to have a better development strategy for employees wanting to grow with the company.
good,Started the day off making sure all the work was dispatched to the technicians.  Make sure techs were logged in for the day.  Monitored workload and moved work around if a tech was not going to get to it to ensure customer satisfaction.  The technicians and co-workers in other departments were great to work with.  If I had to communicate with overseas reps it was very hard to understand them and to communicate what needed to be done.  Supervisors and Manager were always there if you needed them.
good,I actually liked working for CenturyLink. Worst part was Tension between manager and employees. I came into a group that had a lot of hate and discontent between the manager and my co workers. It was not a fun place to be. Too much back biting.
good,"CenturyLink is an okay place to work. There were constant changes and demands required that seemed impossible at times, but somehow it was always managed."
good,This company has a lot of good qualities and some that are not so good so review for yourself when applying. Make sure to take advantage of the union there they really help.
good,"Great benefits and perks! Requires a sales attempt on every call, which was my least favorite part of my job. If you are good at sales, you'd like working here."
good,I enjoy working with the public to provide great customer service and many of my managers are quality employees who are there to help their employees. The company is high stress and intensely negative where sales are concerned but has great benefits and decent pay.
good,"Level 3 provides a suite of great products with a good price, however the constant change creates a below average work culture and a lack of team continuity."
good,Qwest was a very nice place to work with many nice people. The work days went fast because you were always busy.  You learned something new each day and strived for success as well.
good,"While working at CenturyLink, the work load has been stable and manageable, but I am slightly underpaid for what I do, and there is little room for advancement."
good,"The money is great of you really push forward and wanting to take it seriously. However, the systems are messed up along with many many customers accounts are in a big mess without a resolution"
good,"Management is not helpful, loved that I didn't have to work weekends and was typical 8-5. Overall a great place just not a great place to make a career"
good,"Horrible hours. Favoritism. A lot of lies and promises. Watch others around you get easier teams and better hours. If you are not a favorite, you will have the worst shift. and they lock calendars so you cannot take off"
good,Performed regular telephone contact with providers to discuss status of rebuilding and reimbursement process to ensure account resolution.Provided efficient customer service to clients.Created databases and spreadsheets to improve inventory management and reporting accuracy.
good,"I would wake up and drive to the shop from my house in Eatonville to Seattle every day and then go off to multiple different places from there throughout the day depending on what jobs my boss needed done for the day. When i got to the job and install would usually take someone 4-6 hours and a repair is about 2.5hr. I would complete 3-5 full installs along with a repair or 2 every single day and only charge my boss 8-10 hours for the day. when i easily could have been saying it took me 15 hours daily without him knowing or being able to do anything about it because Century Link payed him to do so. I still only got paid for what i took on the job to help the company make more money and get him to trust and ensure i was actually there for the company. He never care, and constantly screamed at us over the phone and in person, while we were already in stressful situations out of our control in the first place. Dealing with a P-D off boss when you cant do anything about the problem and he is 50 miles away not able to see anything but a picture you send him was most definitely the hardest part of the job, when hes very short tempered and the opposite of patient, when you as a tech sometimes have to wait on other people. And do what Century Link Tier III tells you what to legally do. They are just vary willing to take any cuts to make their company money. I loved the job because of the freedom of being on your own, while your not sitting on the phone with your boss or dispatch."
good,Work and life balance not so great. The positions was easy going but being on-call was horrific. Salary should be bumped up to 20.00 per hour.
good,"I have learned a lot working for this company and have grown even more, What I don't like is there is no parking and you have to pay to park with no reimbursement"
good,"Company never utilized the talent that was available on staff. You were expected to just put you head down and work. This company is great for employees who do not mind being seen and not heard. Upper Management was great at giving directives and assigning tasks. Any opinions and observations from Mid-Management was not welcomed by Upper Management. Only the most Senior Managers and those in the Boardroom had a voice. Round table discussions often never yielded anything substantial because, employees were not allowed to give any real input."
good,"When I started in telecom it was all about the P.O.T.S. lines - plain old telephone service.  But as the years went by, the industry became a leader in advancing technologies and making hi-tech available to the same people that had been staples of the P.O.T.S. marketplace.  CenturyLink has continued to look forward and develop better, safer and less expensive product, expanding the telephony model to include entertainment and cloud services.  Telecoms that haven't adapted to the customer need have lost their place in today's business environment.  CenturyLink is working to continue to be relevant and to offer customers the best product possible."
good,Initially I was unqualified for the position. Through daily problems and help from very capable people I was able to get on the right track to figuring out problems on my own. I was able to learn some skills that others did not have.
good,"Typical day included many conf calls, emails, and urgent calls on cell, or via email. Supporting 40+ wholesale customer at 3rd tier POC. co-workers were great to work with. hard to get a minute to engage with situational things happening that day. mgr was out of state, so interaction was very limited."
good,"Good place to work but unstable for employees.  Lots of consolidation and relocation going on."
good,I was employed during CenturyLink's purchase of Qwest.  As expected there were plenty of changes and a fair amount of chaos within the management at the time.  As time went on the planning improved and CenturyLink was an enjoyable place to work.
good,CenturyLink is very different than USWest or Qwest. Change is the only thing in life that is constant and it is something that we should get use to and accept. That makes life easier...however the CenturyLink changes were a downgrade and getting something done about that was very difficult. I left to spend time with my two kids and to look for opportunities to advance in my career.
good,"Qwest was a great place to work, unfortunately they were sold and I was laid off."
good,greet co workers and manager and then stress rest of the day as to how calls where coming in and making she that you made you sales quota or save rate quota or make sure that your time waSN'T OFF
good,Industry leader in products and service cunsomers can trust.
good,"CenturyLink has a been a delight to work for.  The culture here is very open, promotional driven, and has an advanced training enviroment.  However, the enterprise sales division is a tough place to start out.  You're essentially put on an island, to sink or swim right away.  It definitely puts you in a stressful position leaving you very little room to make mistakes and learn from them."
good,"Im getting laid off which is why im now searching for a job. This has happened with Centurylink in the past. They are preparing for a merger and has to downsize. They will start hiring again, however I will not be returning. They change companies to often, Sprint then Embarq, Captiontel, Now Centurylink."
good,good to learn if you are a fresher and lots of oppurtunities to explore....
good,"Savvis was acquired by CenturyLink and is in the process of moving the Finance Department to Monroe, Louisiana."
good,"Moderate pressure"
good,"Great company to work for except the fact that they are not willing to work with personal emergencies even medical emergencies, not willing to fully help the success of the workers"
good,"The people that I worked with were great.  Really, they just did a poor job of onboarding new employees and giving them the knowledge and tools for which they need to succeed.  As a result, they struggled to hang on to their new hires and are stuck in a bit of a vicious cycle that will only improve when they invest in a more robust training environment and/or consolidate some of their cumbersome systems into an easier-to-use platform."
good,Manager was dishonest.  Benefits were good.  Pay was very good.  Company support was poor.
good,I learned about NECCA routes and a new application they implemented for better access management.  My manager was easy going and a pleasure to work with.  My co-workers were funny and there were not too many days that went by that we did not get a laugh in. The hardest part at times was getting to correct location of addresses for service delivery & and who would have control of managing the installed circuit. Was getting it done.
good,"Savvis, an industry leader no doubt, has a very bad reputation amongst customers and potential clients for arrogance. The culture has not changed much, albeit the solutions are very mature and competent. Working at CenturyLink was a great opportunity, until I realized there are still 3 very large multi-billion dollar organizations still having difficulty years later in assimilating solutions, cultures, and selling strategy. Earnings potential is great, but it just depends on how much discombobulation you can put up with. I tend to lean more towards a streamlined organization that might not pay as much on a base, but has more maneuverability. "
good,"good place to work if you can over Come selling yesterdays product to today, customers. "
good,"Low compensation at the time however, good work life balance."
good,"As tech support for CenturyLink I answered and troubleshooted calls for 8 hours with short breaks and lunches. I learned great phone handling skills, how to deal with irate individuals, and how to sound calm and assertive without face to face interaction. I enjoyed the possibility of overtime when I got financially tight, but did not enjoy the demand of mandatory overtime during the busy seasons. The requirements and high volume calls for my position did not allow me to get to know any of my co-workers. I sat next to a few women for almost a year and only knew their names. The most profitable part of my experience with CenturyLink was the $1 raise after good reviews. Allowed me to save a generous amount of money for school."
good,"as time goes on the job gets harder, more rules, more things to sell, more things to meet, higher quota every month. love working here but it just gets harder and harder. you would think you would get a raise after awhile. i havent in 3 years. and i do very well in my position. if you meet your monthly quota which is very hard to meet you will get about 210 in commision. for the mid large dept. not much but it helps."
good,"Third party harassment. You cannot leave work for lunch and say something without someone going back to work and complaining about what you said. Good insurance, but bad place to work if you have a free spirit!!"
good,Savvis is a strong services company with a good portfolio for the reseller and distributor community.
good,Working for CTL was a great experience in the call center industry.
good,"A good place to get a start in the telecommunications industry. Unless you want to get into management, will eventually have to move on - progression paths are woefully inadequate to maintain and retain talented technicians and engineers."
good,i loved the company and my co workers. Excellent pay and generous vacation
good,"A good experience overall. I learned a great deal about selling, and all that it entails. I was part of a team, all of whom were great people and a joy to work with. The company, however did have very high quotas for sales, that just got higher and higher and there was really little to no job security at all, which made for quite a stressful time if you weren't doing well."
good,Working for CenturyLink has overall been a positive experience and a great jumping off point in telecom. The downside here is that the company is very disorganized when it comes to comision although it is certainly headed in the right direction with the Level3 takeover.
good,Es gab viele hoehen und tiefen. Contact zum Manager war recht schwer.
good,"Great opportunities to earn money, but the customer experience is often negative due to hidden costs and promises of services that ultimately cannot (or are not) delivered."
good,I only worked closely with 4 CenturyLink employees. My direct supervisor that I never met in person and 3 colleagues I worked with in person. My supervisor was amazing however. He treated me very professionally plus he gave me updates on anything CenturyLink related on-time or ahead of time. My colleagues were also amazing. To say the least my time with CenturyLink was hard work but with good people.
good,"This job is stressful, I cant deny that but the pay is good. There is always a chance for a big commission check each month but you have to sell and save customers that are calling in to cancel the services. This is a percentage based on how many calls you take how many services you cancel, your upgrades/sells, and whatever the company says counts as extra cash for that month. The amount changes each month, so sometimes you can save a lot of customers, make a lot of sells and make a lot of money and other months you can save the same amount of customers, make the same sells and not make hardly any money . The different teams there are very competitive when it comes to selling. Management all depends on who your manger is and your sells will determine how you are viewed within the company. There is not much of a chance to advance, you would have to work there 2+ years and if you become a manager there is a chance they will lay you off. Both of my managers were laid off the years I was there. The job loves to throw pot lucks, so you will eat good and also there are a lot of cool activities that make it interesting to work there. Oh yeah, whole lot of drama there too."
good,".Watching load other areas load tech work assign orders for installation "
good,"People here are laid back and just like in any major Telecommunication carriers, they work in silos. Not to blame the work culture but the number of employees (over 50,000) that work in different hierarchies and geographical locations. It's hard to know where and how you're work is getting utilized especially if you're in those marketing divisions that provide advisory to internal stakeholders."
good,The key to a successful career at CenturyLink is to put the customer first and foremost.  Success is measured by developing long lasting relationships with the customers based on trust and superior service.
good,Direct management  chain is awesome and very approachable. The workplace culture is good and most people look out for each other and there is a good opportunity to grow.
good,"Complete MAD tickets, answer calls from field techs, assist the techs in locating available ports for new services, complete new builds in the systems."
good,A cutting edge technology company. Advanced deployment of fiber Optic has helped to maintain a robust network to provide the highest possible speeds to rural Montana.
good,CenturyLink is a good employer and has a very broad scope of employment opportunities. If you can connect yourself with the right group or right job scope- give them serious consideration.
good,"I enjoy working here and most of the people are great to work with, there isn't much in the way of advancement or assistance in progressing in your career."
good,"great work environment,great work life balance,great company.Tnhe management is good and overall work experience is learning and great. Good learning experience"
good,"My team manager has been excellent, but company policy overall is inconsistent and poorly communicated between teams. Changes are made within systems that are not coordinated with team members so the changes can be implemented smoothly. Company is trying to automate service where the systems cannot handle it. Ultimately, automation will lead to reduction in force.  Extra work is added without comparable salary adjustment."
good,"The nature of the industry of telecommunications is a fast paced and often demanding work environment. After the acquisition of Level 3 Communications by CenturyLink, the company became disorganized and our CEO at the time, had to make a ""tough"" decision to not allow any promotions or raises while taking a $3 million personal compensation bonus. An already stressful job became even more stressful, with no clear end in sight other than the companies bottom-line goal of revenue growth. The overall morale in the company is ""too much work to do, not enough time"" , which makes it very difficult to get things done and achieve your goals."
good,Ok position.  Cannot make it with a family starting in job. Long hours.  Single mans job from start.  Good benefits.  Provide tools and equipment needed.
good,"Series of conference calls, e-mails, follow-up and planning for projects - remote location so challenges to be included in central planning at headquarters."
good,Great benefits. Rules change quickly. Sales a must or no job. Most customers calling in are frustrated. Time expectations on each call are unrealistic with the quality expected
good,Lack of Development Opportunity in localized area. Company got large fast and lost a lot of great employees while shifting positions. Provides great benefits.
good,Typical day consists of daily functions assigned by mgmt. Plenty of on the job training therefore became very proficient in excel. Management has been great in all departments I have been in.
good,"SAVVIS has unique solutions to offer. They have a very talented development team."
good,"I did customer service and sales. Had great management. Fun work environment we would have a lot of contests and stuff, like we had the big game Guitar Hero and the site director which was fun and competitive would put together contests on who was the best player , so we would play util the last person that beat everyone won. Hardest part would be difficult customers."
good,"Reasonable amount of work, good work-life balance. Post-merger in 2011, fewer development projects. Good coverage of the telecommunication space and domain."
good,Very Stressful job. 
good,"Love my boss and peers.  Lots of confusion due to recent merger with Level 3.  Internal clients are fun to work with.  Flexibility in remote work (half in office, half remote)."
good,"good benefits, good pay...there for 15 years because of my coworkers and the environment...more stable call centers in the city until recent mergers caused major restructuring"
good,"The company offers excellent pay and benefits; however, they could do more to elevate the customer service experience. The work environment is comfortable and coworkers are great."
good,"Centurylink is a great company to work for but a stressful environment  for many people who do not like to work with upset customers. You are in charge of providing great customer service to customers who need help to repair their broken modems. And although the systems are completely outdated, the experience was not all bad. You must have multiple windows opened up on a computer to see everything you need to help the customer. But working in such a quite environment with so many upset customers due to the fact that their internet is down can be very stressful. The management is extremely nice and well supportive to anyone who may need help with their tasks. And just like any other business it has busy times and slow times. But the work felt to slow for comfort in such a fast paced environment. You need very strong communication skills and a fast paced attitude to complete your work efficiently and on time. Overall the company has many great benefits and attributes for the right kind of worker."
good,During my stay in this environmeat it exposed me to many challenges that i have previously faced in life and today it is thanks to this my first job that i can defend myself without any fear
good,Long term position Over 40 hours in a work week 6 to 7 days a week Pay vacation and personal time off Health medical and dental benefits tools Sufficient training
good,Level 3 is a telecom network consolidator that has acquired many companies.  Its diverse employee base has created a patchwork of incredibly smart and talented workers.
good,"Large Telecom provider.  Seasoned employees, many with 40 years service.  Great people to work with.  Limited opportunity for advancement. Financially sound and will be around far into the future."
good,I had a good experience with the company. I had an awesome supervisor and there was a monthly bonus depending on if you met certain requirements. I also payed well.
good,"My direct supervisor was amazing but the building manager was not. The sales qouta is usually easy but the company has been raising prices of products but not changing the qouta. The number of sales u have to make stays the same but they increase prices making it harder to meet those numbers. the pay is great when they dont screw you over. always full time hours though. and if you get fired they fight your unemployment claims with lies. The term letter i got said one thing but they told unemployment something else completely. It is also really aggravating when there are two-three break rooms but management takes over those rooms for their meetings but yet you cant be on your phone on the floor so you are forced to either, not check on people or make important calls or go stand in inclement weather to make them. Oh and If MODOT is stressing to stay home and businesses to close. they will not and if you cant get in or get stuck in traffic from a wreck verified by modot they give you points and fire you. there is horrible employee care and support here"
good,"Fast paced, with the chance to move up in the company.  I learned that working as a team player helps solve most concerns."
good,Great company.  Management was a little confused and rarely communicated to the employees.  The company was just bought out by CenturyLink.
good,"can be stressful at times but fun place to work. if you are looking for a stable place century link is right for you. the supervisors are all very nice and supportive. century link focus more on the quota you make, if you are not making quota they will let you go,"
good,We can work for 2 or 3 Years as Developer / Lead But It's not a company to provide you to build your career with new technologies
good,"very nice company, very friendly people and managers. I would recommend any to apply with them. The compensation is the best part. Can be stressful."
good,"I would arrive 30 minutes prior to my shift in order for sales for the prior day in order to attend a daily mandatory meeting.  After the meeting.  I would serve as the primary point of contact for the sale of Qwest products and services. "
good,"- A typical day was monitoring circuits in a NOC, and troubleshooting circuits with issues. At times the troubleshooting involved coordination with field techs to fix hardware issues."
good,"Good job! However, the Union makes it so strict and so childish at times."
good,"Challenging, motivational, skilled and professional environment"
good,AT SAVVIS made some great relationships with great people.
good,"I have learned a lot about the latest technologies such as:-"
good,I had great managers & a great team to work with. The hardest part was dealing with simple requests that customers turned into a bigger deal than needed to be.
good,"The payment is lack luster which causes problems like strikes, but they overall have great managers & trainers. The people where great. but compensation was bottom of the pile."
good,A typical day consisted of me knowing I had to make my sales or I could put my job in jeopardy
good,Lacking support. Support tools not working. Great training. Need more sales support. Reporting tools a little challenging.
good,"The future outlook is questionable for managed services employees as the Level 3 managers had no visibility of the business that generated half the profit of the company. To ignore the potential up and downside of proposed changes, that needs to change. Great employees and technology to work with (for now)."
good,"Great benefits but seems to be an unstable choice for longevity of career. If you are seeking to work for more than 5 years, this might not be for you because for the last 8 years they have been downsizing the Columbia office"
good,"I enjoy a work/life balance.  I would like to see some interest in flextime for employees.  It is super hectic trying to get kids off to school, husband and wife are picking up and dropping off kids.  It is so difficult to find a good job who really understands this.  It's impossible to get a DR or Dentist appointment after 4pm?  CenturyLink was very good about this.  If I needed to leave to take the kids to the dentist/Dr etc."
good,"I believe in honest hard work, but I also believe parenting in this time is completely hectic.  If my employees need to take an hour off to take children to Dr or Dentist appointments during the weekdays is almost impossible.  If your work is done, and they can make up the hour (flextime) or flexibility at home and at work as well."
good,Level3 was a great company to work for. when Centurylink took over job security was not very stable. mid level managers were excellent. Team was expected to know everything about the company and how all processes worked
good,"CenturyLink has growm through acquisitions.  This creates an environment where you are working with no less than 20 databases and applications on a daily basis, and working with colleagues from varied backgrounds and experiences.  It can be stressful, as the learning curve is high.  There are no SMEs to reach out to, so you must create your own alliances within the company to assist you in day to day operations."
good,"Who you work with and who is your manager is quite important in Centurylink. I've heard some amazing tales about other teams, but our team was always very mellow and laid back. The hardest part of the job is that with the many changes and conversions, there is not a lot of structure around their processes for developing and maintaining software. The people are the most enjoyable thing about Centurylink. They have a great company culture. However, this is not always reflected by upper management, and it makes it quite hard, especially on managers and supervisors who have to relay bad news more often than not. Also, do not expect to be promoted in ANY capacity. If you want a raise, find a new place to work that pays more."
good,I would say the company is a good company to gain experience in the field. Not going to stay here long-term though. Pay was decent and benefits were pretty good.
good,This was to be my job for life. Life cause this employer to down size therefore the life this company change. 
good,"Good for someone who wants to hit refresh in their career. The company provides opportunities to learn and expand on your experience, but everything is hinged on the team. Overall, the culture prohibits collaboration and team interaction. So, if you work best with teams, this is not the place for you"
good,"I work on Enterprise class I.T. environments for Century Link's Hosting customers and Century Link's Cloud environment. In a typical day I can deal with all sorts of issues, such as DDoS attacks,URL outages, application outages, issues with Server OS and  the network environments they live in."
good,Great employee relationships and teamwork. Minimal management assistance resulting in poor employee development resulting in a lack of advancement opportunities.
good,"Pay is not inline with national averages, not a lot of growth allowed, promoting from within is far and few. "
good,"The management tree is ever changing and there is no good structure. The culture and the people are great, but the sales process is difficult to understand and there is no accountability."
good,"I so enjoyed the position of Information Specialist.  Working with the internal customers at CenturyLink was very rewarding.  The pay was enough to support my household.  The facility on Mineral was nice, big and the company hosted many different companies to come and sell their goods, the café was open for breakfast and lunch Mon-Fri."
good,this job would be great for someone who learns by reading. I am a hands on learner. the training was all reading for one week. There was no interaction between management and trainees most of the time and I felt there should be a training module to learn off the floor but on the equipment and software we would be using on the job. The turnover in our training group was 90%. 2 people remained at the end of the week reading and on floor training for one day. I only had one day on the job and it was a day of being yelled at by customers because I had no one to assist me with the software use.
good,I love the job itself however it has its usual pro and cons.The people I work with is awesome great supervisors and all however this company is not secure every year its a big lay off this year I was apart of it other than that the benefits or great.
good,CTL is excellent to their employees and they pay rather handsomely.  However they are a numbers crunching sales machine that tends to chew up their customers and spit them out.
good,Quality company to work for. Company is a laid back environment depending on your manager. Company has a lot of good benefits but the major downfall is advancement within the company and getting a pay increase. Level 3 really sticks a glass ceiling on you.
good,The co workers are friendly and great to be around. Management does not do a good job of keeping people updated with current polices. Spend most of the time correcting other peoples mistakes in different departments.
good,"This was a sometimes stressful job, but the tried to reward employees now and then with little perks.  Not a very fun job and they sometimes put a lot of pressure on you."
good,"it was a interesting call center, the employer was merged with another company though"
good,"Is a very stressful job for the paid, but the benefits are worth the job."
good,Being able to work from home is a great positive for Centurylink. I also have the option of a split shift or a  8 or 10 hour shift. The hardest part of working is changing schedules every 3 months.
good,"I personally disliked pushing sales onto customers that were already having problems with Qwest. Sales guidelines are very strict.  I went into the position thinking it was Customer service and later found out I had to push sales as well."
good,Wonderful place to work! I loved the call center environment!
good,"I really didn't mind working at Qwest (Now CenturyLink). The only problem I had was with moving up and being accused of making people look bad because I wanted to do more to improve the place..yes, I was accused of that by several people and it really left a bad taste in my mouth. Other than that, the pay was pretty good, I got plenty of vacation and my direct manager was one of the best managers I ever had."
good,There was no room for learning. You would be shown something once and if you asked to be shown again supervisor would very loudly in front of co-workers state that he had already showed you the procedure.
good,I worked in the Consulting field and really enjoyed the employees I worked with. The management was good at giving praise when it was due. I just wish I wasn't laid off.
good,"Constantly having to track down answers to questions that are tough to find. Due to the integration of Level 3 many systems and processes take a very long time to sort through. Delivery can be tough when it comes to a product. The pay is good, but the work is tough."
good,A typical day at work would be coming in 30 minutes before store open to ensure safe count and store functions were up and operational. Over the years i have learned patience dealing with the public. I have learned never to take anything personal that one may say out of frustration or anger. The hardest part of my job was not being able to help everyone I came in contact with. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to make a customer happy.
good,Management showed lack of safety and equal rights. Learned a lot of skills from co workers and on hand experiences.  Learned customer service and team work with co workers
good,"A typical day here, is a meeting with management and team about how we can let customers try our Century link products. IT was pretty amazing if you bought into it. Everyone was a team member and friendly towards each other in every way."
good,"I worked for a company that was acquired by CenturyLink. I had no plans to stay a long time. The culture was a bit stuffy, with most long time employees having a difficult time learning new cloud technology."
good,"i have worked for them for 5 years and the first 4 years it was great and then they had a major change and sales opportunities dropped and was focused more towards customer care, which doing so made the care reps lose bonus money. it also made the care reps lives more stressful as well because we didn't have those opportunities for sells and only had to deal with more issues. pay should be raised and different style of bonuses."
good,"Stepping stone, for some a home. It was a first time experience for me doing tech support for voice and data. It was something new and in the beginning I enjoyed it emensly but as time went on I started to realize for me this is my stepping stone and not a permanent home."
good,"This is a good company that values its employees, but the job wasn't one that was a good match for me. As my coach said it wasn't that I couldn't do the job, in fact I proved I could and better than the other trainees I was hired with, but for personal reasons it just wasn't a good match for me. The customers could be very friendly or down right mean. Your supervisors would be there to back you up in the times where the customers would not work with you even if it wasn't because of anything you personally did. A typical work day Monday would be mandatory overtime with 9 1/2 hours on phones and a half hour lunch break. Tuesday through Friday would be 8 hours on phones and 1 hour lunch break. The hardest part of the job for me was trying to sell more to customers when they were trying to save money and didn't want more. The most enjoyable part of the job was when my costumers expressed their appreciation that I would take the time to listen to their questions or problems to find the best fit for their needs."
good,Great Benefits and the money was good . Management  could be better. Sales goal can sometimes not be met. nice environment tho ... Great co workers and staff!
good,"The job is ok. Its definitely not for everyone. its a great way to make money. In order to work here, you must be a peoples person and able to transition calls into sales calls."
good,"CenturyLink was a great place to work before the acquisition of Level 3.  Now, the place is very unorganized.  Upper management needs to be revisited."
good,"Great benefits, good managers that care about employees. In telecom though, so job security is iffy. Easy to slack off and not much encouragement to go above and beyond"
good,It is too early to make a comprehensive review. At this time I am interested in seeking opportunities with accompany that recognizes hard work and loyalty.
good,"A typical day at Centurylink consist of me taking incoming calls from residential customers having troubles with their high speed internet service. We go through a set of troubleshooting steps to fix the issue and if we can't, then I dispatch out a local technician to come to the location and fix the problem. The most enjoyable part about the job is being able to solve the customers problem and making their day better."
good,"Great opportunity to learn new tools, new environment , and nice people."
good,"The day of work was always different never the same alway a new challenge to work on. After 25 years of working for the same company, I loved my job. Management was always fair, do your job, get things done, they left you alone. The hardest part was you were always learning a new system or the newest product to be installed. "
good,"I enjoyed my job in Seattle very much when CenturyLink was QWEST Communications. those of us who did not support the lazy union worked hard to try to keep our office open., the union was dead set on teaching how to use FMLA Disibility"
good,My job had me covering a large area of Montana. The opportunity to learn various analog and digital systems was a challenge that I enjoyed. A lot of time was spent on the phone re-engineering jobs to meet the customer and company's  needs and to assist fellow employees around the state. The hardest part was the call outs in the middle of the night to meet the customers needs.
good,"Centrurylink has the most thorough interviewing and training process I've ever experience. They really make sure you are prepared for the floor before going out. The staff is nice, the managers are approachable and the normal work hours are reasonable. The hardest part of this job are the hidden fees in the packages. Sometimes you'll explain monthly charges to a customer to a T there would always be overages which they would complain to me about and sometimes cancel. As far as job culture the bonuses are awesome and you have a lot of freedom as far as breaks and lunches which is great. They are flexible with paid time off and the commission is uncapped and awesome! The ONLY thing I didn't like was the inclement weather policies. Its like UPS which in my opinion didn't seem to prioritize employee safety if it hurt business."
good,"working at centurylink there was lots of oppounities to advance. there was always prize give aways. There was even awards and bonus gi.ving.If you wanted to relocate you had the option to,"
good,"Did calls for Directory Assistance and O operator calls from various parts of the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada.  A fast paced, friendly environment.  A challenge to strive to do the best at whatever task was at hand."
good,best work from home opportunity. advancement and bonuses. Plenty of Overtime for higher tears. Managers easy to work with. All meetings and training done from home.
good,very stressful so many metrics get write ups for every little mistakes great benefit great people to work with and great supervisors i dont know what else to say
good,"fast paced work environment with supportive work culture. Lots of customer contact with opportunity to solve variety issues including service, billing and sales."
good,"Century Link is very generous with their commission. They have good training. They are very thorough. Management is always available to help out. The office environment is beautiful. It is surrounded by windows with a beautiful view of downtown Boise. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to customers."
good,Management
good,I was lucky enough to where many hats for this company. There was always much to learn and copious amounts of meaningful work. The management was very supportive of the employee expanding their skill set.
good,"I love the environment and the vision, i'm just not a great salesmen"
good,"Great place to work. Compensation is good the culture at centurylink is great.Working by myself was great, Management was decent and understanding.Working outside is nice if you dont mind the elements."
good,"I love the team am on, we are on a roll when it comes to collecting and also the team work ethic we have is amazing! We do have daily goals which helps you get through the day to day lifestyle."
good,"Hard work, organized, great place but theyove moved to Arizona"
good,Great job everyone needs a great deal of time and money. The first week of orientation is the best. Panel interviews and discussions of your drivers and their benefits.
good,"Centurylink used to be an amazing company to work for- to help customers with their billing questions and help them get the services at the best value we could offer. Times have changed and now they push sales more than anything else and it hurts the customers. Trying to sell something to every call you get is impossible and in some instances it's down right wrong. There is always a chance of not having a job if your sales quota is not what they believe it should be, regardless if you are offering on every sale."
good,Great place to work if you have a reasonable manager. The pay and benefits are excellent. The work is very easy. I am just not sure of teh management at the technician level.
good,Leadership vision does not translates well to managers that are facing customers. Sales people running around rampant with complete disregard of recommendations from elite engineers.
good,TW Telecom was great place to work and atmosphere was great. Very challenging but healthy competition. Level 3 was very different culture with and a management style that was very demeaning to their employees.
good,"i think is some how hard to work in this place or a least in this position that i was at because you have to walk for hours just to get one client and if you don't get a customer you wont get pay so in order for you to get pay you need 10+ customers,this is not a job for you if you don't like the heat or people to be closing their door in your face."
good,"Decent company, work life balance is good. But as of now no projects are coming."
good,Worked 3rd shift so I'm sure my views are skewed.  Decent pay and working conditions.  Some nights the call volume would be overwhelming with various outages taking down entire cities.  No real opportunity to advance or get off 3rd shift due to seniority.
good,after only a year I got laid off when the company bought Level 3 and restructured. Upper management was a mess and had no way of providing a clear path to success.
good,Working for a CenturyLink was the most stressful job I have ever had. The daily goals they had were insane and the management only cared about themselves
good,stressful not help poor systems very stressful at time no job security very little help from managements. upper managers don't care about how it get done just demands results
good,A very good place to learn New technology. Have lot of option of growing in technical and Managerial streams. Provides training to keep the employee upto date (depends on the project as well)
good,"Everything was good, except very strict rules for attendance and not easy getting time off even unpaid time off; this culture became from the past in most telecom and IT companies because most of the jobs can be done at least partially remotely"
good,Amazing how a public utility gets bought out...really thought I would be there for the rest of my working life...buyouts buyouts and more buyouts...oh well
good,"I worked at the Downtown SLC one and the location was perfect. My supervisor was very nice and the managers there were very nice. The training was terrible. It was all on the computer and the trainer probably gave one lecture. I was on technical support so it was extremely confusing information that was taught in the least effective way. The customers were horrible, I got screamed at on almost every single call. It was nice because you could have your phone out and go on social media websites between calls and you could read or do other quiet activities at your desk. But the customers were absolutely terrible to deal with. If you like the freedom of doing your own thing and don't mind dealing with a******* all day, this is the perfect job for you."
good,"Supervisors have the idea that you are a new employee every day and you need to be watched every day. If you have similar job experience of 35 years it does not matter. Your work ethics are not important if you are not a favorite.  Supervisors goes to the ones that work and ask them to do more for the ones that don't carry the weight and they are not consistence in their supervision.The monthly meetings with them are at the point where they look for something to point out your errors and this will come back to haunt you.  Employees that leave are not replaced so the loads continue to be distributed unevenly.Supervisors  are not reduced as the employees leave and this leads to who supervises who a constant battle. Their daily emails are overwhelming.   Expectations are that you work more than 40 hours with no overtime. Working at your desk is a must if you want to complete your work for the day, breaks are out of the question.  It is a sweat shop and employees call in sick so others must do their work for them.  It is nothing less than a sweat shop."
good,"CenturyLink were built as a telephone company. Telephony has become very competitive & this has put a lot of pressures on CenturyLink. "
good,good company to work for in years past but times have changed over the years. . good benefits. loved working with my customers and coworker as they were like a second family.
good,"When I first started at CenturyLink (formerly CenturyTel), the company was family friendly and you always knew where you stood with your managers and co-workers.  Now that we have gotten so big and the culture has changed, everything has changed.  The insurance has gotten worse and cost have gotten high.   The bosses are more demanding of your time outside of normal work hours including late night and weekends."
good,This company has a problem with diversity among the management ranks and sales executives! They merged with SAVVIS a few years ago and it seem SAVVIS executives took over the larger company CenturyLink for some reason.
good,"Bad work environment."
good,"It was a call center job, I was in top 10 sells for two years, winning lots of awards. Call centers is also the reason I decided to go back to school... I never want to work in one again for the rest of my life if possible."
good,"CenturyLink is a very stable company. CenturyLink has merged with Qwest and has a bright future ahead, but there some challenges that lie ahead, such as data integrity and record keeping. CenturyLink is going to be at the forefront of the service provider arena."
good,Overall good experience with the Enterprise Acquisition team because the manager was a joy to work for. When promoted to Sr. Relationship Manager for the Government Division it was less thrilling due to multi - layers of aged legacy back-office systems to support the customer.
good,The culture at Century Link was one of that no matter the level of experience everyone was willing to bring something to the table.  Everyone from supervisors down to the senior technicians were great to work with.
good,Not good after merge. Not good at all. System issues. System tools were horrible. There was much confusion with engineering teams and tools we needed to use to figure out both networks
good,.Responsible for prioritizing reporting alarms based upon severity outages take presents on lor .answering tech calls monitoring incoming alarms. Being proactive and troubleshooting.
good,Tends to have to many chiefs and not enough indians in my workplace. Would like to see more methods and procedures documentations on  functions and responsibilities of job.
good,I left on my own due to no advancement in the direction I wanted to go. Worked a lot and work/life balanced leaned toward work. Benefits were good. Management team was good. Just wished there was upward mobility. I did attend and graduate from the Level 3 Emerging Leaders program. It was very beneficial.
good,"Level 3 (now CenturyLink) has been a great place to work. The people are driven, smart, and dedicated. It was better before it was bought by CenturyLink, but management changes are happening (more Level 3, fewer CTL in management), so the culture is evolving for the better. Pay is underwhelming, benefits are meh. They'll take every hour you give so it's easy to lose control of your work-life balance."
good,"CenturyLink is a great company to get in the door with and has many opportunities for lateral movement and career development that would lead to great resume builders. They compensate fairly - in my experience- and have better than average benefits with not excellent, but fair or just above fair pay. However, after undergoing their recent merge the culture is taking a drastic shift and the secondary company has taken almost entire managerial control. The culture and job security for all is shaky at best. This is the 3rd merge in eight years, and the company does annual layoffs."
good,"Great place to work if you in with the right cliche.  If you're not in the cliche, no chance to get ahead.  Must know the right people and suck up to them in order to get ahead or anywhere here."
good,"I arrived around 5, and set up for the season ticket holders. I had drinks ready and made sure the buffet was ready to go. I also cleaned up and bussed tables."
good,"CenturyLink cares about their employees and if you start as a contractor through a recruiter, CenturyLink's default position is to hire you unless you give them a reason not to.  Pay is somewhat low relative to the marketplace but is a tradeoff for relatively good job security.  The environment is more friendly than competitive, representative of the Oligopoly of the large service provider market."
good,"Centurylink is a well established corporation. Outlines or expectations are clearly expressed and reviewed. "
good,"work culture is good. I must recommend to join this company even if you got a good manager over you."
good,I really enjoyed my job prior to the merger of CenturyTel and Qwest. After the merger I had a manager that didn't pay any attention to his employees. I rarely heard from him or could get him to respond to me. I was my own manager and made all the decisions fro my team.
good,"It was a temporary position, I enjoyed the people I worked with, slightly sloppy management.  No room to move up. I learned how to manage a building with 400+ employees."
good,The hardest part of the job is not having any support to get the job done correctly. Things ran smoother when Management was not micro-managing our job.
good,"Sales was the name of the game here even if the job title says customer care.  "
good,There was never a boring day at the office. You were faced with different challenges that made the day go by and kept your skill set sharp.
good,There was not really any opportunity for advancement.  It was locally owned and eventully went out of business. There was a high turn over in management which made it things difficult.
good,The job was great and has a lot to offer. The sales opportunity is endless and the vacation and benefits are great. If you're looking for a career or advancement this may not be the place
good,"I like working there, the environment is great I like the people I work with although not being sure if I will have a secure job for the next year due to having to meet a high quota is very nerve racking. I need to know that even though I'm it my all, trying harder every day to meet the expectations of the company,  it can be rough meeting those goals at times. I would like a job that will pay well and I know will always there for me as I am there for the company."
good,"great place to work as far as the customers and benefits. beware of the management, once they have it out for you,  based on something as simple as a text message or if you cross one of their favorites, your gone. union is no help, they all work for century link to so you know where their loyalty is. good job good benefits, just don't make a mistake because you are  expendable. don't buy the no discrimination either that's not true"
good,Sometimes you come across places that you just don't ever find the groove you fit into.  That was the case here.  I love working with the consumers and addressing their needs.  I just did not seem to find my nitch there...
good,You get weekends of the pay is okay . Attendance is very important if you have an emergency it best if you take care of it after work.
good,A Standard Business to Business Sales Position. Sales Process Procedure is Major Focus for all Sales Professionals
good,"Demanding job with customer service, but good benefits, very little chance for managment."
good,Working with peers across the country trying to implement various products and strategies. Great people. Challenges were working with peers in different countries/timezones.
good,"Due to the M&A, job stability is in question to varying degrees at any time. Raises employ the nine-block method and manager's are required to provide extensive justification to give a rating outside the normal, and thus protecting the ability to extend raises."
good,Company struggles with diversity and employee growth opportunities.  Customer service is struggling based on lack of internal follow up and ownership of issues.
good,"Centurylink is a great company but, there was a general lack direction.  Unfortunately the leadership came across as more interested in the process than the results of many projects."
good,work at phoenix location had great views. there were some good incentives and the cafeteria was nice. management was supportive and they liked to develop
good,You can definitely tell the favoritism with the Supervisors at this place. However money was my favorite part about it. There is absolutely no job security. Each month you fear that its your last.
good,"Good company with good values, the   ""merger"" of Level3 and CenturyLink has brought change  in uncomfortable ways for some, but it's part of the business of staying competitive. I see CenturyLink keeping the best of both companies and trying to find balance."
good,"New CEO wants wireline work force to be 80/20, contractor/in house. Forcing people out to get to that level and also trying to sell that side of company off"
good,"Normally 9 to 5. Very good if you were running late and not in by 9am."
good,"Very by-the-clock, stressful. "
good,"No Paid Holidays, No. Sick leave, zero tolerance for mistakes (auto Fails) no consistently in commission structure changes all the time"
good,early retirement downsized company was going in a different direction so better for me to take early retirement also took a lot of responsibility out of on site supervisors and gave to micromanagers
good,"from my understanding & experience, you would need to work for the company 12 to 18 months  to get any type of benefits or hired on full time with the company."
good,"Messy with a recent transition from Level 3 Communications to CenturyLink. As an IP Deployment Engineer changes to the network are requested by planning, using the outline to work with field tech to complete the request."
good,"Although CenturyLink has some great perks (matching 401k, PTO, WFH, etc) raises and promotions are few and far between. The company is on the low end of the pay scale for telecommunications, and raises are very infrequent. It is a good company to work for for a little while, but if you really want growth, you have to look outside the company."
good,"Looking for a part-time job as a driver picking up people and helping people,business repairman ,customer service.Retired from centurylink after 43 years."
good,It's actually been a great place to work and have some really close friends there...it would be nice to have better pay and benefits for their employees...
good,Lack of advancement.  Management needs more training.  Too many in office meetings that took away from customer meetings.  Commission structure changed frequently.
good,Job used to be fun but now it has become too stressful. hings are changing and not for the better. People that have been with the company for over 10 years are just retiring when they had plans on being there for another 10-15 years.
good,"While it is quite a good learning environment as I am working on products and services that I have not sold before, the role is very stressful. Not just because of carrying a quota which I have done my entire career, but because there is too much post sales work that is placed on the shoulders of the sales team, and we lose commission if a deal does not get delivered. Yet no one on the service delivery team seem to feel any los or impact to their way of life if a job fails or not, which means that they have no stake in the outcome like sales does and yet we don't have control over their portion of the work."
good,"Friendly place to work, but pay is not up to other positions at other companies. Schedules are bid on in 3 month increments and sometimes your work hours will change dramatically."
good,"Poor management, company techs sabotaging contractors work, lack of support by management for contractors when work was vandalized by employees. Favoritism in assignments for employees over GC's and Contractors. Forced to work in unsafe areas with threat of firing if there were any complaints to management. More worried about the numbers than people or even customers. More new customer installs than taking care of existing customer base."
good,"A typical day at work consists of collaboration with numerous union employees and management, and consultation and mentoring on system and job function issues.  Management of customer escalations, including installation and/or service disruptions and disaster management project management.  Analysis of order workflow and production of reports capturing center productivity."
good,The managers and General Manager are great to work with. I was recognized may times for my customer service abilities. I left Century Link because it was very technical for me.
good,". I worked for the company for 2 1/2 years and I worked hard answering calls on an inbound basis. After resolving whatever the issue was, I successfully would transition into the sell. The promoted a new supervisor who managed to eliminate most of her team members- reducing the team of 22 to just 3."
good,As a company CenturyLink is a solid company to work for.  The typical work day for me was to show up around 8:30 am and work until 5pm or after.  My job intelled working after hours due to the fact that I was a salary employee that worked outages.
good,"I worked here for 5 years, because in the end they were willing to work with me regarding scheduling, and other things. At the holidays we got nice parties, and giveaways, but in general the job could be very rough and tolling."
good,Growing company with multiple services. If you enjoy challenges and keeping up with new technology this is the place to start. You will need to be a people person and solve problems daily for customers.
good,"Worked on selling to non customers or selling products to customers products they didn't have as an outbound rep. When I was crossbound rep, we called customers that got new products added to their account to make sure they were not sticker shocked of new bill they would be getting."
good,"Loved the family of friends that I worked with."
good,Good place to work with a good company culture. Projects are varied and interesting but the hardware tools are old and lack the current technology
good,"Employees are hard working and are asked to do a lot with little direction from management. Empowering employees to own the processes leads to a good sense of accomplishment. Company has had a very aggressive merger and acquisition strategy that places a lot of stress on people, processes and systems."
good,It is a good job if you are very comfortable interviewing and can handle loud angry customers or even new customers. co-workers are all nice and relatable
good,Good Values.  Wonderful employees that have worked through all the ups/downs of the mergers  and still have a positive attitude.
good,"If you don't hit your sales quotas each month, get ready to pack up your desk! Sales quotas rise each month for the length of employment so if you're not meeting your sales demands, no if ands or buts, you're SOL"
good,I loved working for this company! They were easy going and easy to communicate with. They truly understand their employees and are willing to work with you.
good,As time progress there was too much emphasis on sales. I could not maintain my ethics and make their un-realistic sales quota the way calls were routed. Giving the same sales quota to a rep who is being routed calls ONLY from saturated markets as the reps given practically virgin markets is an unfair business practice.
good,"Service account holders with billing, cross-sell additional products. Motivate team to perform, run reports and data entry. Received award for highest sales in center two months in a row, won laptop and cash."
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,Hunter position. Company does not support the division well.. Computer programs between different rntities do con communicate well..
good,"Create a promoter experience, and sale to the customers benefit as well as the companies. "
good,I would love to still be working at Qwest. I enjoyed building the network and repairing cable. I loved the customer interaction and being able to spend the day with colleagues that are more friends than co-workers. The management always did the best they could to keep us up to date with any information we needed and generally seemed to want to work with us instead of against us.
good,"First thing in the morning come in address any issues from previous nights emails or ecnounters, check voicemails, complete daily reports, and set goals for the day."
good,"Taking Inbound calls from businesses having trouble with features or lines on large or small phone systems. Reporting the trouble concisely and directing the issue to be dispatched on, sent to programming or long distance."
good,It’s all about sales so you need some thick skin. Overall not a bad job for call center work. CenturyLink also has a union environment/culture that is unusual in the state of Idaho
good,Good place to work & liked my peers. Lot of growth potential and opportunities with opportunity to learn new technologies. Had good support to implement new technologies and update the infrastructure
good,"I am very dependable. I can accomplish anything that comes my way. I love learning new things. I get along with people ver well, and ready to start a new journey"
good,Good company in a volatile industry (Telco) with main problem being outdated infrastructure (WIN 98) and HQ horribly located in Louisiana instead of Denver.
good,"CenturyLink is a large, global corporation but the immediate team and internal customers are great to work with.  I have had competent managers who are great to work with."
good,"This company is a good company, I love the job that I am doing but, I believe that I am under paid. As a technician I also answering phone and dealing with customers."
good,"Lots of highly skilled coworkers dedicated to providing quality service to the customer and in-house."
good,"A must try. Good work environment. May perks like food, outings and events. I had a well-knit team and manager. Training benefits were at par with industry."
good,"Good Pay/ Benefits, working with the community, enjoy working with different organizations within the company, working on different types of technology"
good,Was a contracted job and was ok overall; was passed up by Centurylink by other reps that I feel like were not as qualified or as technical as me. Thank you
good,"Constant worry about layoffs.  I enjoyed the company but took a package.  Morale is very low.  Once we purchased Qwest in Colorado, CenturyLink kept most of their employees and the culture became terrible.  We kept most of Qwest's managers who ran Qwest to the ground, yet laid off good Embarq managers.  Oh well...time will tell."
good,"CenturyLink sales and customer service is a very challenging work environment. The management tries hard to keep the environment light and fun. However, due to the constant changes in their workflow they experience high turnover rates. CenturyLink sells multiple products. As a result, the systems are intricate and can be complicated. However, CenturyLink internet and TV services are good products, so it provides a good opportunity to be successful."
good,"Pay is excellent.  Working conditions are above average.  Company has changed names over the years.  US West, then Qwest, then Centurylink.  In January 2019 Centurylink merged with Level 3."
good,"Centurylink offers flexible schedules, personable leadership, benefits and salary could be better, great culture and job/work balance. I would recommend this employer."
good,"As Android developer, worked at client site in Airtel Payment bank for around three years. Being a good performer at Client, Centurylink Management never recognise that. Overall, people working at client site could feel total disconnect from parent company, with just some big talks from upper management."
good,Many great people that work for CenturyLink. Have worked here fr over 10 years total and would recommend to anyone. Great benefits and always care about their employees.
good,"It was a shock to all, when we were laid-off, but otherwise it was a great place to work.  I loved supporting the customers, and we had a thight-knit team."
good,Culture and focus of the company has changed since merger with Level 3. Alot more contention now vs. work enviornment pre-merger. Still a lot of good people doing good work but culture is not as positive as it used to be.
good,"A good place to work."
good,This was an enjoyable fast paced job that I could perform while working from home.  The training period seemed a bit long but I did enjoy my time working with them and those I worked with.
good,CenturyLink was a comfortable and supportive work environment. Co-workers were friendly and worked collaboratively. Unfortunately for a global company they were not comfortable or innovative in supporting alternative work locations or remote work. They targeted everyone to move to the corporate headquarters and would only hire in that location regardless of the challenge in finding qualified candidates in other major cities where we had a presence. They offered little advancement opportunity for women even when qualified.
good,This company has great benefits and a chance to grow. They also do various things and jobs in the communities.  Volunteer in various parts of the communities and schools
good,"The benefits are great! 401k , some Tuition reimbursement. The money was good it has gone down since I’ve been here and that is the bad part as well as you have quotas that you have to meet watch month that does change each month for products you have to sell. Unless you have seniority the hours are later rather then earlier. It pays the bills but takes a big mental toll on you. The Amount of PTO you get is great!! There is a point system... but is probably a good thing to keep a job."
good,Since the purchase of Level 3 a lot has changed. I have worked and enjoyed this place for 16 years and too many things have changed. The Centurylink folks are being forced out.
good,They're just another large company. Lower tier employees dont have many options. In legacy Qwest markets you're held by a union conract. The union is a double edged sword. I protects your job but removes a lot of benefits available to non represented employees
good,CenturyLink provides a fun workplace with several incentives to get in on.They are good with being flexible with to scheduling  issues and do offer overtime.
good,"CTL is a progressive telecom/technology company focused on digital adaptation and assisting customers on their path to be 100% digital. We work with some of the largest companies in the world. The culture is good but morale could be better. Hardest and most challenging part of the job is navigating the multiple systems due to the many acquisitions over the past few years.  This is time consuming and can interfere with performance. However, when things work properly, we succeed."
good,"Great company to work for. Excellent benefits. Unfortunately losing position due to department closure, lack of work in company. I would have applied for another position within the company if there was an opening. I worked here 5 years and loved it."
good,Report first thing to the warehouse and check your workload for the day. load up accordingly with all the necessary materials and equipment. Once loaded you begin your truck roll from site to site performing installs and repairs from residential to small business.
good,fine place to work if you're a technically oriented and not terribly motivated toward self-improvement. You can get hired and coast without much trouble.
good,"Great company, with excellent benefits  Wonderful people.  Recent merger has caused a bit of a turmoil and our job descriptions have changed and are not very clear.  Additional responsibilities have been added but nothing has been taken away as yet.  Almost impossible to complete our tasks in an 8 hour day."
good,"centurylink great environment, and great management. Team members came together and worked as a team to meet the sale goals to put our team at the top."
good,"When I started it was a great place to work."
good,"This review isn't up to date."
good,"The job is great the benefits are affordable as well."
good,I worked there for 12 years. I got bounced around a lot due to the never ending force adjustments. My teams were good though. I learned a lot in my many different roles with the company.
good,"Had an onsite gym, and outstanding benefits.  Management was horrible and treated us like dirt for the exception of one very good one. Sales goals were too high and they changed things even when things were working they would mess with it and just made working there difficult, but the benefits were the best I have ever seen."
good,"Highly accomplished professional with 7+ Years of experience in IT industry with imperative concentration in Infrastructure automation, code migration, Configuration Management and system administration and a strong technical background in deploying and maintaining the Cloud Platform (AWS & Azure). Expert in DevOps tools such as Chef, Docker, Puppet,Ansible,"
good,"I learned a lot about how to interact remotely with customers who dont respond based on the smile you put on but the inflections of your voice and how well you actually listen to the customer. "
good,Centurylink is a pretty good place to work however there are inconsistent when it comes to paying commissions. My typical day consists of calling customers hunting for new business. Building relationships and creating solutions for current and future clients.
good,Work and pay are good but the people are great.  Too much turnover with upper management.  Too many systems that are not intergrated.  Too much manual processes.
good,Started in 2000 as a call handler and progressed to a shift noc technician in 2009 working days and nights. The shift rota was very good and the work itself was good.
good,Don't really have much to say. Laid off 3 times from this company after giving my entire career to walk away with nothing!!! I have nothing else to say
good,"At CenturyLink, I found it to be a great place to work.  I worked with so many talented people.  I loved my 11 years that I worked there until my job was eliminated."
good,CenturyLink is one of the largest telecommunications companies on the planet and has the depth and breadth to support the largest companies. CenturyLink also has products to support small to medium business as well.
good,"Working at CenturyLink has been a great learning experience for me. I have learned much about telephony, the way the internet works and how it is provided to customers around the world."
good,"I spend a lot of time troubleshooting network issues, and traveling to different sites around town. We have a great team of Technicians, and Management"
good,Learned a lot of technical things in this company. Very good place to work with.  Good senior management. They will be around you if you need anything or any help.
good,"The company has been purchased by another, and is no longer in business.  We had a great team, and developed long term friendships.  We worked well together, and assisted each other as needed to complete a task."
good,"Centurylink provided opportunity for growth with a great company culture. A typical day for a supervisor is attending morning, afternoon meetings, monitoring agents and providing consistent motivation."
good,"Overall, working for CenturyLink was ok, but I got tired of placing orders for new orders and the techs never show up to install the service which results in customers constantly calling in and complaining because they have taken time off from work and the techs don't call or show up."
good,Working here was good. Over all the company does treat employees good. If you did your job good you would get a pay increase and a Bonus. I would tell anybody that it's good company to work for.
good,"A typical day at work included taking both regular and escalated calls from customers and customer service reps.  Also, trouble shooting with all departments within the company was a regular occurrence.  The job was very fast pace and time went by quickly, though it's never fun to be yelled at by customers for things out of your hands."
good,"A good place to work. Not too strict with deadlines. You can have fun while continuing to learn."
good,"The opportunity is there to learn new things and meet new people daily. The telecommunications industry has taught me a whole new skillset that I value and will use from now on.  Being able to find jobs for people that they love to go to is what I thrive on.  Working with them, learning their strengths and then matching them to the right position is amazing.  To help a business unit strengthen by bringing in the skilled employee that will help drive the unit to their fullest."
good,"I believe this company is a sinking ship, management is making poor decisions that are costing employees their job and long tenured people are being laid off with very short notice, with minimal severance."
good,"Nice place to work. Management is questionable but other than that, it's laid back. You have your own station so you don't have to worry about getting sick from someone else's germs."
good,good place to work in general. nice offices for the workers. business changes constantly.  Ppl should be prepared for a fast paced work place before applying.
good,"Attend calls for critical and medium scale projects.  Capture status from offshore teams before their shift ends.  Hold swat calls for critical blocking issues."
good,I learned a lot working with this company.  It was very competitive but very enjoyable.  It was a comfortable environment and could get a bit stressful.  Overall the job was a great job
good,"Centurylink is a good company to work for. The workplace and my co-workers were always nice. The job could be stressful at times, but I would not say any more so than any job in telecommunications."
good,"I truly enjoyed working for the company.  Unfortunately they had to downsize and being on the lower rung of the union, I was laid off.  I would definitely work there again."
good,"Innovative, challenging , fun place to work. Great group of people, learned so much on a daily basis. Great pay, unfortunately once CenturyLink acquired Qwest, bonuses were stopped and paid time off was cut in half."
good,"Took incoming calls from the various CLEC’s. Verified order status, checked on number ports, how to process orders and submit them in the systems.  Knowledge of vast products from Centrex, LNP, EEL, working left in accounts, PIC changes and ownership of accounts. Issued, installed, disconnected and changed orders on complex resale and Centrex orders.  Contacted resellers to verify service ordered and clarify if there were other products that they might need for their customer. Issued all region orders for CLECS for resale services. I learned that there is always room to improve your skills and should not be unwilling to push yourself out of comfort zone to learn new things."
good,Culture change and loss of benefits and no increase in salary was not what most expected with the merger to Level III. Work and home life balance along wit ability to take time off and vacations does not balance out.
good,The ground is shifting under your feet as the company struggles to adapt to a very competitive environment.  Frequent M&A and outsourcing activity.  Some great people to work with.
good,Excellent technical expertise people to work with. Good learning experience. It would be helpful to hire the capable contractors as permanent employees and good to provide sponsorship.
good,I assisted customers with phone bills and taking payments also had to sale products and services that was provided by the company. The work place was always upbeat.
good,"Cool people, relaxed atmosphere, great manager. A little less pay and overly compensation/benefits than other jobs I've had. Contract ended after 12 months."
good,great family environment.  Constant change which can be fun to learn and grow in your company knowledge and position reliability.  everyone is customer focused.
good,I didnt really like this position because it took me 90 minutes each way to get to/from work on public transportation.The training wasnt long and the changes came do frequently.You were penalized for every little error made.
good,"Each year the benefits decrease as we see executives take huge bonuses for themselves. They send emails saying that we are struggling as a company and let hundreds of employees go, then hire a new VP who makes more than all of them together. The say that they cannot afford standard of living increase (1%-5%) and then announce an event where they are sending many sales team members to a resort in the Bahamas (both communications were literally weeks apart)."
good,"Century Link has good qualities for an entry-level job and teaches all the basics such as beginner cash handling, small management tasks such as running an individual sales kiosk, maintenance, and customer service."
good,"If you can handle the constant yelling of customer at you then this is the place to work, good benefits and good pay. Most of the supervisors do look out for your well being"
good,"Nothing really bad to say they.  Clean work environment, good insurance and incentives, just had to leave because of my wife's illness and FMLA ran out."
good,"With less than a year left to reach twenty at CenturyLink was let go.  otherwise, the company is fine to work for.  Fair wages, hours, and benefits.  Would have like to stay for twenty-five or more."
good,Cognilytics was a delightful firm with good people. CenturyLink is a sinking ship.They are ending the consulting operation and want to be a hosting managed services company.
good,"Typical office environment, was introduced to telecommunications. Hardest part of the job was the learning curve, having no prior experience in telecom it was a challenge starting out."
good,"Overall job was great, it just interfered with my personal life. I missed all my children's sports actives the year I worked there. "
good,"I actually worked for five different telephone companies.  I did not flitter around.  These changes were made by government interference, mergers and corporate greed.  My retirement was based on employment in all of them."
good,"My basic job remains the same daily.  But depending on what components are sent, determines how my job is done daily.  Management doesn't listen to their employees.  It's almost like whistling in the wind.  Benefits are great. Workers are either occupational (union based) or management."
good,"The company culture from my perspective at the data center is very relaxed. You have exposure to different applications, networks, and systems that you can choose to specialize in at your leisure. Productive and challenging workplace with great work/life balance."
good,"I cant give an opinion on working for this company since I work for Century Link Stadium. Not, CenturyLink. I really cannot say anything about this company because I have never worked for them."
good,"Loved working at Qwest. It was a very competitive position and I loved the people that I worked with.  It was located in Salt Lake City, UT which is one of the most beautiful cities I've ever visited."
good,"good culture, advancement is currently hard to come by due to merger with Level 3 communications. would not be looking outside the company if career paths where more readily available. departments will block opportunities to move from one department to another to preserve personell"
good,"Not a bad place to start out. Last couple of years job advancement opportunities have been limited, salary freezes are commonplace. "
good,"Great place to work, challenging job, but management makes decisions without considering all of the impacts on the employees. Learned to adapt quickly."
good,"Everyday in Level 3 arrives with a particular challenge. This experience teaches you to deal with pressure keeping focused on the short and mid term results. Management and overall working environment is highly professional. With operations all over the world the company offers a multicultural atmosphere.  This is perhaps the most enjoyable part of the job, having the chance to collaborate without boundaries sharing the same goal."
good,CenturyLink is a company of great people who want to do the right thing for customers. The unifying vision and principles make the company culture great.
good,"I enjoyed working for Centurylink, however I applied for a customer service position that was more a sales job. I worked from home so that was great as far as commuting but I missed being able to vent to co-workers about the day in order to relieve some stress. Believe it or not, but those breaks and lunches with co-workers make the job something to look forward to. I also had to work mandatory Saturdays which was ok, however when a family member passed away and the funeral was on Saturday I was not given that day off."
good,"Nice place to work, Zero Advancement unless you've willing to be there for ten+ years. They have a ridiculous incentive package, barely a bonus and the raises are not on par with their competition."
good,"I began at LCI International before it became Qwest Communications.  I supported an IT department with an Executive Administrative Assistant that supported the Vice President.  I learned a lot with this company as it was my first Administrative Assistant position after completing my PC Specialist Certificate.  When the Executive Assistant left the department, my responsibilities grew, but my salary did not.  It was a very difficult department of 300 people to support while I was working 2 peoples jobs.  When Qwest Communications took over the company laid off people without notice by walking them out of the building with security.  I still had my job, but knew that it was being replaced with Qwest staff.  "
good,"Answered customer emails then I would make outgoing customer calls. Viewed my daily tasks through CenturyLinks Master Treatable Data Base. "
good,"Good ethical company in Sales approaches."
good,Centurylink is a very demanding place to work if you are in IT. Work-life balance does not really exist if you work in IT. The company is doing a lot of 'acquisition' conversion related work and the hours are long and the workload is demanding yet the management team is very supportive. Unfortunately as acquisitions are made then company priorities change as well so changing priorities is common these days.
good,"Qwest afforded me to significantly advance my career by actively providing continuously ""Challenge by Choice"" corporate philosophy.  Probably the best company I have worked for."
good,"Typically arrive at 8am and begin checking on which machines were successful and which failed their software updates."
good,"This is a contract position.    In the short time, I have been here.  I like the culture.  I work in a group that supports the re-grooming of circuits for cost analysis, along with the removal of Legacy circuits."
good,"The company prides themselves on self learning techniques for training. Can be complicated to get the flow of the job, but it is typical call center work for technical support. Little to no workplace culture, but a perfect place for someone who wants to go to work and leave work at work."
good,"I learned a lot about working in a call center and the benefits and disadvantages which were pretty equal. It Is a very eclectic place to work , full of lots of many different types of people."
good,"Loved the position, management was awesome. You could transfer over to any department after 6 months. Great work culture, that held a lot of outings for their employees"
good,"It was a very easy job and I learned a lot from doing it only 3 months. The hardest part of the job was meeting the sales quota. I didn't have any sales experience so I struggled with it, but if you're good at sales then this is the job for you!"
good,"CenturyLink is a good place to work. They have an excellent product portfolio and for the most part talented resources. "
good,I started in a building with windows and remember that we had to move to another office that was in a warehouse.  The warehouse had no windows and the morale went down quite a bit.
good,Its a good MNC company with with huge clients and we will work under various clients so we will gain good knowledge with this type of work culture and improve our skills to deal different situations
good,"Its good product based company with good working culture and other facilities"
good,Like most companies they are watching there check book. The people there are great with the amount of exp they have it is a good place to work.  The middle management is very good.
good,"loved the atmosphere of the work place, was very fast passed environment which I love, many different challenges on a daily biased. would defiantly recommend employment"
good,"a typical day at work for centurylink would be to help customers with their phone lines dialtone or internet trouble .Working with the customer would be the most enjoyable part of the job, the hardest part would the cold weather in the winter."
good,"Although sometimes a stressful environment, working in the MES Group was overall enjoyable. The immediate management in my group were supportive, and helpful, as were most of my peers."
good,"In the department I worked was very stressful, the morale was very low, people did not get along with one another, poor management."
good,"Work day included a variety of work to be performed and management of  direct reports."
good,Qwest Communications was a good place to work. Learned a lot about process and worked in a number of areas.  The best part of the job was the team and building relationships.
good,Casual place with good flexible hours. Working with offshore is very challenging. The most enjoyable part of the job is the team and building relationships.
good,"Work quality and experiences vary greatly depending on business unit.  Focus right now is expanding enterprise offerings, integrating acquisitions and maintaining stock dividend.  Other areas suffer from neglect and minimal investment.  Progression/advancement must be initiated by individual, no path in place to assist."
good,Great place to work. Has a lot of overtime available and is union friendly.  Lots of coworkers that are friendly and helpful to you when you are stuck.
good,"Had to leave to hard on my body, I was ridding my bike an hour to the bus stop and an hour bus ride, then working 8-12 shifts. I have no complaints about upper management, I think there was to many people in charge, and they all wanted things done differently."
good,"Century link Treats their Employees well, I would enter Disputes into the system for the wholesale Department and also review payments that were posted to see if credits can be issued and adjusted on client's accounts"
good,"CenturyLink is top employer for Sales Engineering opportunities. If you don't mind long work hours, they have several divisions to provide roles facing global and small enterprise accounts. SEs get exposure soup to nuts in design - from CPE pricing/design to cloud based Xaas services."
good,I enjoyed my time with Level3. The people were good and everyday was an adventure. The work life balance is important to the culture.
good,"They say there are teams in the workplace environment. By teams they mean this supervisor gets a good bonus if these people do good, but the actual people under the supervisor get no bonuses. No one is there for anyone else, it constantly felt like HR was looking for any excuse to catch you and write you up. Had a flat tire in the morning? Had to drive an hour on a spare? Your written up there is no leeway for being late or missing a day."
good,"a typical 8 to 5 job has its up and downs but co workers will lighten your day. managment it  kinda of non exsitant but can be real tight some days, best part is commision its a good way to make your money and off on weekends"
good,"CTL has gone thru a lot of downsizing in the last 2 yrs making, because of this your responsibilities have grown but not your paycheck.  Also, this has lead to poor customer service."
good,"Supported and instructed customer service representatives, defused escalation calls, account research, escalate corporate issues, sales promotions, sales level overrides, data entry."
good,"I am contracted to another company by Centurylink, but the people I interact with from CenturyLink are easy to work with."
good,"At GE marketing it was a very up beat, we would have morning meetings to get everyone pumped up for the day, that is something I really enjoyed. The hardest part of my job was the hours, I worked from 8am to 9pm, 6 days a week. Also I didn't enjoy going to different nieghborhoods to sell Century Link, a majority of the time i felt unsafe."
good,"Fun customer service oriented job. Great people and services. Very nice compensation and benefit packages. Successful, help oriented management team."
good,"Reached out to prospective customers to arrange sales consultation with regard to network infrastructure. Presented customized IT solutions, collaborated with internal and external resources needed to address customers' needs."
good,Working at CenturyLink was great.Staff was great. Thanks for the experience and opportunity. I was able to meet some very knowledgeable people working at CenturyLink. Long lasting friends even after the contract was over.

good,Working with phone and internet line is a challenging and hard job. Because of the technology and the working conditions.
good,"No such thing as a typical day at work."
good,"Working at CenturyLink was a wonderful, fun and challenging experience. No two days were alike. A typical day is full of working with various groups and teams throughout the country on various projects and operation improvement opportunities. My team was very supportive and we worked well together for the common good of the business and the team."
good,"The union is great, the old time Qwest people were a pleasure to work for. I enjoyed my time before being laid off as my department was shut down."
good,"I learned a great deal, and improved my knowledge and skill set.  I was hired off the street with no skills, and was trained up to my current expertise.  I'm not the best COT that CTL employs, but I consider myself to be above average in skill, knowledge and competency."
good,"Typical day at work, would include speaking to multiple customers having pleasant and unpleasant daily conversations. Learned a lot about billing and the details of telecommunication services provided to a customers home. Management is very relaxed and aside from discipline equal to their employees which was enjoyed. Co-workers were very fun, very entertaining throughout the day in the midst of taking multiple calls a day. Hardest part of the job would be sales, and meeting quota. Mot enjoyable part was the time in between calls enjoying my co-workers throughout the day."
good,"Over all work at CenturyLink has been good. Top level management is somewhat lacking. A typical day included review and processing of requirements to update or deploy a new DotNet application. Co-workers were always helpful."
good,Centurylink is a large company with a smaller company feel. We treat every customer large and small with the same dedication to top quality service and reliability.
good,Level 3 is a great veteran friendly employer. They have highly competitive salaries and benefits for entry level and senior employees
good,"A lot is expected of you but as long as you do your job you are rewarded."
good,"Different culture than tw telecom."
good,"Fast paced, competitive company.  Forever evolving in the marketplace. Constant internal change.  Always looking for competitive edge."
good,This company uses a lot of contract employees who work from home. All jobs are time sensitive with some being due sooner.Turn around sometimes requires long days.Overtime nor usually paid. Need to know company specific programs for designing jobs.
good,I would recommend working here because of the team environment.  Manager and co-workers both sources of information and very helpful when needed.
good,My job is good. I interact with a lot of people internally and externally. I have learned to work independently. The hardest part of my day is reaching out to people and no response. The most enjoyable part of my day is resolving issues and moving on to the next one.
good,"I answered incoming calls from customers searching for account information, finding the location/phone numbers of people they are looking for."
good,"I started each day working on locate tickets from one call. I would run route to each location of sites and preform PMs on site, from batteries to fiber management, at time i would add or change cards in equipment to accommodate circuit builds."

good,Co-workers were good and helpful. Flexible work schedules.  Learning on the job was easy.  Pay was about average for the job.
good,Lots of good people who work here.  Good team atmosphere.  People take ownership of their problems.  Company is attempting to be on cutting edge.
good,"This was a high stress job, but the people I worked with were amazing. The management was awesome and very understanding if you didn't hit your sales quota for the month, but some months the sales quotas were very hard to reach."
good,Poor employee resources in regards to training and referencing information. High rewards. High volume. Schedules rotate every 3 months.
good,The company was a great company to work for! They used to be employee friendly however they became more numbers oriented after the merge.
good,Level 3 is in a growth period with the purchase of tw telecom. I'm learning new systems and processes every day. My co-workers and peers are an excellent group of people. They are dedicated to their job and take pride in their work.
good,"As an infrastructure engineer in a development organization, I have a mix of duties: operational tasks, architecture, design and engineering.  I get to work with great teams of people and on many different types of technologies.  It can be hard work but also rewarding when a new product gets launched, or a problem gets solved."
good,"This is a great place to work but stay out of inside sales. The managers are working from 1 set of guidelines, then the director is working from another"
good,Great place and environment. Just really overworked. I loved the culture just you really be overworked and not compensated from the standpoint of missing your family and missing life outside of work. expectations are that you need to work 24 /7 because the work calls for 24 7 365 type of atmosphere.
good,"Take inbound calls"
good,"To give customer service and problem solve for online banking needs and to sell banking products such as, checking and saving accounts to loan banking products."
good,"I would meet at the shop to receive my jobs for the day and equipment. Next, I would travel to customer homes and install Cat5 cable to complete the modem and set top box installation"
good,Fun place to work. I want to further my education so i am looking for further careers otherwise i would love to stay here and work if i did not have all the college experience i obtained.
good,"Non-friendly atmosphere between management and non-management. Discipline of non-management employees is sometimes severe. Breaks and lunches are timed on the computer. Tardies are given for coming in 5 minutes late in the morning, and for coming back late after morning and afternoon breaks and after lunch time."
good,I loved worked at this company.  They have great opportunites to further my career
good,"good environment, co-workers were friendly and co-operative,"
good,this was a good company but bad management they would not accept responsibillity for the things that were done in the office
good,"I'll miss working for this great company but look forward to continuing my career, my role has been eliminated due to reduction in workforce (RIF).  My work day was always a challenge and never mundane and it allowed me the opportunity to collaborate with many business functional teams.  Working with these various teams throughout my tenure expanded my communication, analytical and computer skills to that of expert levels.  The most enjoyable part was the dedication of the employees.  They are always willing to tackle even the most difficult issue while keeping the customer as priority number one."
good,It really depends on your job title & supervisor. I had assignments where I was nearly in tears at the prospect of having to go into work and others where my job was truly a joy.
good,At level 3 there is great work-life balance and the people are a pleasure to work with. There is a lot of changes going on so there is never a shortage of things to be done.

good,Had many jobs while working for this company.  I had numerous opportunities to advance in the company and I took them.
good,"As an Account Consultant at Centurylink, I am tasked with balancing sales and service projects daily. The many resources provided by CTL empower me to keep my customer base happy and growing."
good,Working customer service is for some people and not for some people. I loved it. I enjoyed working in a large facility and getting one on one time with customers.
good,"-	Accurately receive inbound calls from CenturyLink residential customers."
good,Just had to listen to customer and solve their problems. If you are goal oriented and do not have a problem pushing yourself it is a great company to work for.
good,"I liked that there was no ""typical"" day at work, each day I handled whatever new inquiries that came in.  Some requests could be completed the same day, others required more complex research and documentation.  I also had monthly recurring audits occurring throughout each month due to multiple billing dates for multiple customers.  I learned flexibility and time management.  I learned multi-state tariffs, state statutes, and FCC regulations along with individual state accounting regulatory practices as they pertain to state and local governments.  I had excellent give and take support with my co-workers.  I worked with minimal supervision.  The hardest part of the job was never being ""done"".  I always wanted to do more faster, although my assigned customers were very satisfied with the service I provided to them.  Both of my assigned state governments have offered to provide references.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the very pleasant working relationships I developed with both my assigned government customers and my peers.  The most satisfying part of the job was the resolution of the very complex billing problems that arose."
good,"Okay place to work great benefits"
good,"My job is highly stressful, I am in charge of employees, and trusted with company funds."
good,"You must sell products to be able to continue working, while there, you are taught how to pitch products and overcome objections from customers while trying to sell products. The management staff is kind and friendly as well as very helpful. The only hard part about the job would be working on overcoming objections from customers and continuously hearing the answer ""No"" and having to find out how the product is beneficial to the customer."
good,I learned a lot for the last 16 years I worked for this company. They provide enough training for all the new introduced  technology.
good,"the job was good, only down side was you had to sell a product to every customer or you get repremended."

Researched, ordered and provided summaries for Title and Appraisal Reports, and resolved insurance issues."
good,"Centurylink provides great incentives, benefits, and pay."
good,This was as good job. It called for a strong person willing to take action to sale and provide great customer service. This job wasn't for a person who didn't have a strong will and attention to detail. A person had to be self driven and a thick to work there for a long period of time.
good,"Qwest was a great company to volunteer for. There were many"
good,Communicate with supervisors via phone/email/chat on work that needs to be done.  Run daily reports. Update technicians schedules. Complete damage facilities claims.  Enjoy corresponding with coworkers.

Here in US the work is more in the area of technical and Application Support. Excellent Co-workers but now I want to earn more and want to have my hand on Development projects as well. I am having around 12 years experience around all the phases of project right from RFP till Implementation except Automated Testing and DBA work.
good,Many multi-tasking skills to conquer including several computer software systems as well as handling irate customers while trying to sale them something.
good,"Reviewed and rearranged technicians workload for the day to ensure customer commitments were met.  Answered phones for customers to advise them approximately what time technician would arrive at their home and for technician to report what was done at each home and what the charges were.  Entered data in computer after each technician call.  Made daily reports on different types of missed commitments.  Also was a repair and installation technician in the field for a time, repairing and installing telephone lines.  The hardest part of the job was carrying the ladder and climbing the poles.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the happiness on the face of a satisfied customer."

good,I enjoyed Centurylink because of the extra benefits and incentives such as competitions that were always helping to strive to work that much harder for a great payoff. I enjoyed the management and all my coworkers everyone was always so friendly. I learned to be a better multitasker and improved many of my computer skills while I was there. There were some hard parts to the job such as having your typical upset customer but I learned to make upset customers happy by first listening to their issues then solving problems.
good,ACD Call Center environment. Fantastic managers/supervisors & co-workers.
good,"Daily job sort of adds, moves and changes as well as brand-new installations of communications at Denver Intennational Airport. Dispatched over 15-20 technicians daily. Created spreadsheets to track all work orders."

good,Really enjoyed working for the technical side of a call center I learned alot and would love to work in the field again.
good,inbound calls. awesome management. hardest part of the job was the high call volume. i enjoyed the incentives.
good,"Typical day at work consists of making your call and speaking with customers, consulting with them on their future expansions as well as their future downgrades. I get to work with a lot of great companies. Hardest part of the job is the workload, sometimes there just isnt enough time in the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people i get to work with."
good,A great company to work for. Self paced working environment that required you to stay on task.
good,The opportunity to learn new and innovative technologies. Had my on cubicle and desired shift to work. Also enjoyed the people that I worked with. Location was not to far from my home.
good,There are key benefits of working here including training and working with accomplished leaders. A large organization and very difficult to support customers. Aligning with the right people will help to navigate challenges
good,"Effectively managed sales funnel to analyze pipeline activity and sales resources, including sales engineers, channel resources, solution architects and internal sales team, to help implement successful strategic account management"
good,"I was an external Contractor on temporary assignment so it's difficult to make a quality assessment, it seemed like a good place to work though.  "
good,"Though the work culture was really cool but the job security is bit low due to lot of accusisions. "
good,"While the work is varied, customer contact  can be a challenge , and there are more tasks being assigned for fewer workers , sometimes creating more work load."
good,Centurylink is a good place to work if you like working on your own and self motivated. They will not hold your hand when getting your work done. Work days are long and most of the work is done outside.
good,Overall the company is good. At the time I was there management was all over the place that was the only con about it really. Great environment good people and good opportunity for good money.
good,CenturyLink is a Telco without a wireless business. Given the current trend toward wireless services- it's easy to see that CenturyLink's business model needs to evolve. My concern for the Company is whether they can evolve fast enough to take advantage of emerging opportunities.
good,"Perform initial troubleshooting, problem analysis and isolation of network and system events in accordance with MFN NOC incident management guidelines"
good,I had been working at centurylink since past 6 years and this is one of the best company which gives overall satisfaction when it comes to work life balance.
good,"High energy, fast moving, union work environment. A chance to make money above your hourly rate. Must be a talker and be able to just about anyone. Union environment so women and minorities have a safe work environment"
good,Customer focused position. Dealing with installation and repair deadlines for customers. Ensuring processes are followed and collaborating with various departments.
good,Centurylink NOC is a great place to start with a lot of knowledge to be soaked up. My only gripe would be that it is hard to move out of the NOC is desired.
good,Great people at the job and fun to work with. Company has great 401K but the benefits could be better. There are some great managers at the company that will train you well.
good,I enjoyed working at Centurylink prior to the reverse acquisition of Level 3. The prior work culture was inclusive while the current makes employees feel more like ponds.
good,"Great company allows growth and learning various aspects of the customer service industry, treated very well in accordance to my performance within the company"
good,I have been with CenturyLink for 20 years. Originally starting at Qwest in 1998. I have worked Mid Shift for all but one month of the 20+ years I have been with the company. I enjoy what I do and the people I work with. The merger with Level 3 is the fourth merger I have been a part of.
good,"Over all good company to work for"
good,"The work, people and culture was fine.  The never-ending acquisitions and mergers with constant career restarts can be exhausting. Time and again, I had a great job - which I excelled at and which aligned directly with a strategic initiative -  essentially disappear and get re-org'd into a job without any real direction, meaning or even MBOs."
good,Good company overall. Management is engaging and takes an interest in your personal development at the company. Benefits are fairly decent from what most companies offer. Some high stress days but most minimum stress.
good,"competitive , Sometime micro management , Good 401k and salary, "
good,Working at a call center working with angry customers is very challenging.  CenturyLink made it better by being a fun place to be and rewarding their employees with different incentives such as gift cards.
good,"Good for work/life balance.. Not pretty good for monitory benefit. It was pretty good for increments too ,few years back , before merger with CenturyLink ( when it was Qwest ).."
good,Left due to poor management and lack up a clear and defined advancement path.  I would work there again in the right situation and if there were new management.
good,The hardest part of the job was negotiating internal processes. CenturyLink acquired many companies with disparate systems. It took a lot effort to learn the many systems to do your job.
good,"Good people to work with. Usual issues found with large companies in regards to changes and growth. "
good,"As a Senior Sales Engineer, my role was to understand our client’s business goals along with their technical requirements, and to align and implement CenturyLink’s products, services, and solutions to them, demonstrating a compelling value proposition to meet a clear business objective."
good,Great company with charismatic leaders back then. Budgets were available to entertain and travel to earn business. I was wooed away by AT&T with the ability to get back to Scottsdale. Easy choice.
good,"Qwest was an innovative up and coming technology/ telecom company. In Florida I was given the latitude to build the office, its personnel and select  location for the office. Qwest provided enough latitude to grow the business as if you were the CEO."
good,It's like most giant companies. They are very strict on policies but overall it's fine. Things change slowly and management is not great at being transparent.
good,"Great place to work, the people there are very friendly and nice.  Take really good care of employees.  Need to work on work to personal life balances for employees"
good,"Good job security, competitive work environment.  Sales and bonuses are lackluster.  Outside sales have more autonomy, inside sales is too much time on phone, and culture has changed in small business."
good,"Had worked in planning and engineering so a very varied experience. Unfortunately toward the last 2 years of my time there it felt insecure because there was constant downsizing and we were given responsibilities that changed frequently, had too many company and policy changes. we were given very little time to learn and excel. there were constant budget cuts so had to work with our hands tied and for the most part did not make too much sense."
good,The pay was fairly good for the cost of living in the area. The facility was clean and well maintained. The commission structure was designed to help motivate and reward good efforts.
good,"I have enjoyed my work life with Wiltel, twt, and Level-3 over the years although stressful many times.  This is due to many processes and many undo and confusing, the company does try to improve, but before we can let the dust settle on one merger, there is another starting to happen.  I enjoy my job and the employees try really hard to do everything asked of them, but some days it is hard to find the team or person to get information you have to have for a customer."
good,"Great company to work for. Only concern was layoffs. Work was sometimes challenging. If you get the right manager, you will enjoy this company. Negotiate your pay and raises"
good,The company has spent over a decade trying to figure out what it's core business should be.  After the Level 3 acquisition the current focus is on the enterprise business.
good,"I liked it quite a bit actually. Its a union based company so your wages meet with the co-workers you have. And they give you feedback on your calls, allowing you to grow as a provider of customer service"
good,"The company is constantly changing and makes it difficult to know which way is up.  Several recent changes may make things better. The benefits are decent, the culture is good, and the pay is average.  Overall I enjoyed working here, but unfortunately my job was eliminated and I was laid off."
good,I worked in the field and planned my own routes.  I had an office space at CTL and at home.  I was paid for my mileage separately and paid overtime accordingly.  I was provided with all of the necessary tools to do my job and was able to expense things that I developed a need for.
good,Easy job with pretty good pay. All you do is take calls from people having issues with phone or internet and you determine if a tech needs to come out or its on their end.
good,Very Nice place to work.   I have learned a lot.  I would definitely recommend.  Even though I am a contractor I felt like we are all one big family.  Great location too.
good,Centurylink was a very family and employee focused company to work for up until the most recent merger.  It still provides opportunities for many people surrounding the headquarters.
good,"They are loyal to their people and stay cutting edge with technology. However, there is more that can be done to be more transparent with employees with bonuses or company direction in local areas."
good,"When it's time to find experience in the service provider space, there is a lot of growth potential available here. The positions here will push you, will drain you, will have you rethinking your career choice. This is the forge."
good,"Centurylink seems to be in a constant state of flux with buying and attempting to integrate work cultures often before reaching stability from the last purchase."
good,I was a contractor for 18 mo . Company is hard to get a permanent position due to most employees have been there for several years. The supervisors are good and try to make working there comfortable.
good,"I have been working in a datacenter environment for the last 18 years.  Over the past 6 months the datacenter environment has changed to include facilities operations related tasks including: rack installations, cage builds, and move towards maintenance of facilities operations equipment.  Our datacenter now has a new manager and our work culture is no longer an enjoyable, relaxed environment, but is now a tense, work intensive, work culture, as the manager is more intense, and he requires additional training.  This is in addition to what was before an already stressful work environment.  The hardest part of the job is now going into my manager's office for a review of training requirements."
good,Solid communication from leadership of each lines of business. Focus very specific to the month or quarter but not as much shared vision to long term goals and company objectives.
good,"arrive around 6 am do all approvals that are needed in SAP systems then start on the 5 email boxes which I manage. Go to meetings and then read a few contracts, create orders and assigned license until the end of the day around 730 pm."
good,Enjoy working here.  Currently working as a delivery manager at a client site we had to mine and close on the opportunity. Difficulty with Sales actually selling and finding opportunities we can actually win.
good,"It can be exciting at times, and it can be demoralizing.  As long as you have a mentally tough attitude when it comes to upset customers you should be fine.  Now the ever changing environment can pose as a challenge, but as long as you're adaptable you'll manage.  You may feel out on an island because of the constant turnover rate leading to the constant need to hire new reps which therefore puts training new hires above sharpening the skills of more tenured representatives."
good,"Too sales focused and not customer service focused. Supervisors didn't care about a customer they only wanted to know if you sold anything, and if not then had to redeem yourself or be called out."
good,busy work day's  enjoyed worked there coworkers are awesome and enjoyed my job and do and working with other ... I was with the company for 18 year and was let go
good,"A typical day involved calling the first customer in the morning,it was good to let them know you were heading to their house first.The hardest part of the job was carrying a 24 ft ladder thru many of the back yards."
good,"Prior to Qwest this company was U S West.  I started when prior to that when it was Pacific Northwest Bell. U S West was a great company to work for. Once Qwest bought U S West, the company changed drastically."
good,I was a broadband technician. I worked business and residential customers installation and service. a typical day would consist of 8 to 12 jobs. Your jobs would depend on your assigned area you worked that day and could very from easy to difficult.
good,"My typical day was spent managing various development efforts, as well as tracking problem tickets and prioritizing production support work.  It was challenging at times working with development teams composed of local in state, remote U.S. and remote global development team members.  The work day would start very early to accommodate the remote team members' availability."
good,Very stressful never knew if your campaign was going to be there one day to the next. Being moved from cubicle to cubicle throughout your shift did not feel team leaders had enough training
good,"Management seemed to lacked leadership and proper training knowledge, required to lead a team productively."
good,"Started out full time, however work and hours were cut through company acquisitions."
good,Hours were 7:30 AM - 4:00 PM. Day spent both in and out of the office.  Office setting was typical. Great group of employees which made the day move quickly.
good,Management is good.  The pay is decent.  The atmosphere is ok.  It can be stressful at times.  The hours are shift work which is rotating and so you lose your pay differential.  Tools and equipment not always not available.
good,"Good place to work, but limited advancement.  There was a distinct lack of training, and no training budget.  you are really your own manager, and manage your time and PTO yourself."
good,Interesting work with great people. The level of stress is very high due to sales requirements relative to the products and services available to be sold.
good,"Awesome people, there are great perks working out of HQ.  Solid PTO, benefits, and a feel of a small company."
good,I enjoyed my work at CenturyLink and looked forward to going to work every day.   I just wish that there would have been more of an effort to keep prism going.  There was so many issues with Prism orders that could have been resolved and Prism would have been a productive asset to CenturyLink.  There was nothing resolved it was like the company just gave up and wrote Prism off.
good,Good place to work. Good benefit packages. Team work needs more improvement. Jobs are stagnant. Not much room for advancement. They have good locations that close to home.
good,This position is great if you are a college student and plan to move on after you graduate. DO NOT plan to work this position as a full career or the stress will greatly ruin your life and shorten your life expectancy.
good,Tends to be very numbers oriented as to work you push out rather than customer satisfaction. There also tends to be quite a bit of favoritism when it comes to promotions.
good,CenturyLink is making strides in their community involvement and outreach. CenturyLink is a well balanced corporation that is leading the industry in human resource investment.
good,"This company is all about profit and aren't afraid to hide it, I have had multiple roles in the company and always the same thing, if they can skirt costs and get customers in they will do it any way necessary."
good,"Overall good Company to work for long term."
good,"High paced environment, with unrealistic deadlines, made it hard to achieve work life balance. People and management teams were great to work with. Long work days for some. Workloads not fairly balanced between employees."
good,Work environment was nice. Training was complete. Benefits were good. Culture was good. I didn't like the amount of pressure applied by management to sell existing customers new services.
good,It is Java-J2EE based application. Application is provisioning platform that will be responsible for managing the fulfillment of equipment and service orders from end to end.
good,"Good career. Great benefits and co-workers. Lots of changes, i.e mergers, and new systems and tools, however, some managers are very aggressive and don't recognize their employees."
good,"Workload was hectic and fast paced due to customer escalations and service targets."
good,CenturyLink has potential to become a great place to work if management would  be organizationally introspective.  Fast expansion has caused very real  issues with it's ability to maintain high standards of service and reliability.  Such issues can be overcome with honest evaluation of frontline activities.
good,"Typical retail sales environment, compensation was very aggressive, bonuses were strong, companies seem to actually care and wanted feedback.   I was hired at a time that they were relaunching their retail division, it was challenging, but a very fair environment.   Goals are firm and hard, but fair in the tools to obtain them were available, help was available 24 seven."
good,"A typical day at work would be me going in at 1 in the afternoon and not be home until 10 at night. I would assist customers with any technical issues they were having with their cable or internet."
good,One thing you'll learn quickly here is change happens. Everyday there is a new challenge but there are peers and managers who are more than willing to help.
good,"Nice environment to work. Challenging goals, good work culture, encouraging colleagues. It is overall a good place to be."
good,"The job was great minus the job security, you were always worried if they were going to make cuts or find some other reason to lose you."
good,"CenturyLink is a company in the process of transforming from a Telecommunications provider into a Cloud and Managed Services provider. Working at CenturyLink was very fulfilling and rewarding. I was empowered to make difficult choices and decisions, challenged to learn and grow and surrounded with support."
good,"Typical day at work: Multi Tasking, taking phone calls, working emails, chatting on the online portal. "
good,I worked at Century temporarily via Modis Temp Agency.  I enjoyed my time with the company and look forward to possible assignments if needed.
good,I lasted thru 3 major corporate changes. Too many management personal that could not perform daily tasks. Too many changes made by people that did not know how the job was actually done.
good,CenturyLink is a good company to work for.  It has a strong company culture and treats it employees and cuatomers with respect.
good,"The compensation was very good with incentive bonuses but once purchased by CenturyLink, the bonuses and salary were throttled back significantly.  A typical day involved customer meetings, following up on email, developing solutions, and tracking time spent on accounts.  Director and above were very temperamental and seemed at odds in a political game that took its toll on the resources."
good,Good working environment with the ability to grow finacially. I have learned alot working for this company. I have a good relationship with my coworkers.
good,"good place to work."
good,It was good place to work people were good to work with over it was a good environment.Hardest part of the job if prints are not right it delays the job that your on it takes time away your day the best part of my is finding solution to make work.This is were my skills come in play what I learn and experience in the field I no what to do
good,Qwest was a good job with a good company that was bought out by Century Link.  I enjoyed working there but it is now something else entirely so I don't know what it is like there.
good,Good work environment but the management's political agenda at the upper levels was questionable. The company changed hands 3 times within 8yrs. It was difficult for all employees throughout the 80's and 90's because the direction of the company was not clear. We were all part of AT&T's Bell System with one set of guide lines. There are now several different start-up companies from AT&T all over the United States and overseas.
good,"multiple incentive programs"
good,"I do enjoy working in the retail environment, building a close personal relationship with my customers on a daily basis. Downside, there is no room for advancement at my current location."
good,I enjoyed working at Kone. With what I did there I felt there was kind of limited room for growth and moving up in the company. They are definately tight with compensation adjustments and promotions dont come very often. My co-workers were all very nice and a great team to work with.
good,"If you like to be pushy this is the job for you. CO workers were great. Some of the managers were awesome and understanding, others not so much."
good,"Good Team to work with but compensation is not good."
good,"Relaxed environment, able to work at your own pace.  Very hands on.  Required lots of traveling in and out of state."
good,"troubleshooting, just helping the customers with there phones."
good,For the 13 years I have been employed with Centurylink they have treated me alright most of the time.
good,"Setting up companies long distance "
good,My job is to protect customer identity and review accounts to protect revenue.  I love my job but it is very repetitive.  I have asked for new task and more responsibilities but it doesn't happen.  They have there favorites and everyone else just get passed over.
good,"secure place to work for some, decent compensation, challenging to advance."
good,"I found this job to be very busy and hard. I think if you don't have other responsibilities outside of work, this could be a great opportunity if your into a fast paced job. And long hours. This job was hard from me because I'm a part time student. The long hour shifts did not leave much time for me to be successful as student. The staff members where very smart, and supportive."
good,Qwest had some major upper management issues when I worked there. Overall the company was great to work for just had some integrity issues.
good,I liked to make the customers happy.
good,"Work was great, but unfortunately, ran out....that was the end of the"
good,Managers and supervisors are Average to Poor. Co workers were wonderfull. Work consisted of dealing with internal customers and managing outside plant workforce. A typical day was hard but rewarding. I learned leadership skills and Authority. The company is an extreme Authoritative company.
good,i had the chance to interact with new people and i learned that you have to want something and other for you to work for it and it was great having more experiences even though i sometimes deal with rude customers but it was worth the work.. and i really enjoyed it
good,"At Centurylink I really got the feel of dealing with customers over the phone. This was something that I had not done before except to take orders over the phone. While working here I learned to call customers and give them the bad news, like they can't have dsl and explain why and let them know I was sorry. I got over my fears of having to talk to them daily. I learned how the phonebooks are actually made and how it is really not a simple process. Customers can get very mad if their information is incorrect. I have a really great team I work for. I have made lots of new friends along the way. I am at a point in my life where I know this is not where I want to live. Houston has always been one of my favorite cities. I love to go an visit. I know Houston is where i belong. I would like the opportunity to be able to find a job and finish my studies in Criminal Justice."
good,"Overall, was a nice place to work. great supervisor, great coworkers"
good,Good place to work.  Lots of responsibility.  Operates sectional ly because it’s many companies that have become one.  Bonus is a little low.  Pay is slightly below market value
good,"Descent pay. Long physical hours. Hot summers. Medical and Dental benefits. Some growth within the company. Profit sharing. Vacation time off and Holiday time off. For the most part, most of the technicians and managers are easy to get along with and helpful."
good,"great work culture, people are very nice, no work pressure, great opportunity to learn new technologies, no dearth of technologies being used, great support from management."
good,"Start with 4 weeks of vacation.  Challenging environment because of the multitude of processes, and continuous change in processes.  The many companies that have come together over the years has many systems and processes that have not seen much consolidation."
good,CenturyLink workes very hard to care for their employees. Provide several programs built around work life balance which allowes empoloyees the abilty to manage both aspects of their life.
good,Very good benefits but company changed hands and the whole environment changed.  They changed my job title and started to surplus those with my job title.
good,"The place is a nice environment cool colleagues, supportive supervisors and team leads. No flexible time in cor cs.salary in COR is stagnant no increment"
good,Good company to work with at the end of IT life. Good co-workers especially a good management group working towards company benefits. Salary structure not that satisfactory but can be manageable.
good,"Just like with most company the benefits were reduced over the years. "
good,CenturyLink gives job opportunities to different departments in different locations. They give you an opportunity to move to different offices or call centers to accommodate your living situation if it happens to change. They work with your personal time off request and any immediate family situations that occur.
good,Daily meeting and work allocation followed by meeting with stake holders and making sure that the project is running smoothly within budget and on time.
good,"Great people to work with, you will learn how to handle calls. The management is meh. But the team mates where awesome. It is a comfortable job. It is extremely hard to move up in the company."
good,my biggest complaint is that it is a large corporation that does not care about there employees. it is normal to show up to work and have 20 plus hours of work on your dot log. the company expects you to call the customer and tell them that you will not be getting to there order and they will have to reschedule.
good,Great company but still struggling with integrating the former Level 3 and CenturyLink together. Many systems and process issues still exist. Implementing services is a painful process for both account teams and customers.
good,"The people are friendly, and the environment was pretty typical of a corporate office. I worked with several departments in my line of work, and most managers were professional and fairly pleasant. As with any place, there were a handful of ""challenging"" personalities, but not anything out of the ordinary compared to any other large corporation."
good,It was a lot of team work and dedication to keep things clean. You got to work many events and be around your co-workers to get things done. Nothing to complain about here.
good,"Able to work remotely and have a good work/ life balance. Have to be a good self learner as training is mostly "" here you go!"" and youre off on your own."
good,NOC environment is busy. Good work culture encourages working with others. Manager for our group was excellent. It feels good to find solutions for problems and getting things fixed
good,"Need to be able to make changes on the fly. Technologies changing and the demand for service always changing with it. Great people to work with, busy all the time."
good,Learned a lot about call center environment when it came to the numbers game. Handled inbound calls that related to everything from paying bills to upgrading services.
good,"Despite the name on the building, this is Level 3. We went through One Company, One Culture training and I was extremely excited for the future and was recently caught in the latest round of Lay-Off's which was a staple of Level 3 in order to get in the black for investors. However, this is a cyclical trend in which they often cut too deep and ask folks back or throw warm bodies at an already convoluted and system challenged business model. I loved those who I worked with and for and would reuturn if the right opportunity arose once more for me."
good,Focuses highly on numbers and consistency such as retaining high service levels. Overall pleasant place to work. Definitely urges to keep personal life separate from work life to maintain quality of work.
good,"I enjoy going to work day to day. We have a cohesive department that works together, and we get along well. We also fill in for each other if someone needs to be out."
good,Up until recent reorganizations and mergers I was very happy with my job at CenturyLink.  I was unfortunately moved from director to director and not given a chance to prove my worth and was laid off during a recent cutback.
good,"A lot of employee churn due to expansion/contraction and desire to achieve forecasted budget numbers.  Some buildings are old, some are new, it just depends on which location you are assigned."
good,Overall a great company to work for. Management always tried to provide positive feedback. I loved the convenience of  being able to work at home. The monthly goal requirement changed which could make it a little more complicated to meet the goal requirements.
good,most of the time non stop calls from customers that need help with there accounts. i learned about the internet and how it works also how to trouble shoot most problems. read and fix problems with billing. and how to build a relationship with the customers
good,"If you are looking for jobs where you have to apply yourself, you might find something that works for you at CTL. I would have liked to have seen more interaction with management in recognizing those employees who go above and beyond and who are looking for advancement."
good,"When i worked here it was Qwest, century link purchased the company then shortly after shut down my location. I left before Century link was able to truly integrate is company beliefs and culture"
good,High pressure environment where multi-million dollar deals are waiting for pricing and negotiation when you start your day.  Coworkers are great and management is supportive in navigating difficult contracts.
good,"Union position. Working outdoors is enjoyable in the summer, miserable in the winter. Front-line customer contact skills important, but technical abilities are necessary to be successful."
good,"Very flexible when needing to work from home, very understanding managers. People treat people with respect.  All the employees are willing to help each other out."
good,Responsible for hiring and managing a team of 14 to 16 customer account managers.   Reps were required to maintain and grow a customer base of 600 to 1200 accounts by increasing existing services and looking for total solution applications to bring more business
good,I was working for another company that was acquired by CenturyLink. Lots of moving parts. Long lead times on decisions from management. Fair pay but expensive benefits.
good,Management was easy to get along with. Your work peers are all very nice. The working hours were good as no weekend were required. If you did a good job they would recognize you for your hard work.
good,"my review of centurylink is good overall. most techs are great guys to work with, assist others. unless it was the couple of guys that were very egotistical about their knowledge."
good,"Could be a great job, but the paperwork and micro-management is extreme.  You are constantly watched and monitored for production and job performance.  Unrealistic expectations and pressure are the norm."
good,"I was interviewed by the CEO, EVP HR/operations, EVP general counsel, and SVP government affairs in 2003. During my 15 years at Qwest/Centurylink three additional CEOs lead the business. At times we had very good growth opportunities however the core business of voice communications has been declining Which affected the larger trajectory of the business. Without a full product set including wireless the company was hamstrung. However solid acquisitions in the global/national business fiber area enabled good growth prospects."
good,A typical day consist of pulling up the computer and the multiple systems. Then run all required reports and once that is completed start keying orders.
good,"CenturyLink is in a transition state right now, moving from a rural telecommunications company to focus on metropolitan areas.  This makes working in the rural areas harder as a technician."
good,A typical day at work consisted on answering phone calls from inmates loved ones to resure them they had the correct phone services to recieve calls from loved ones.
good,I keep the team focused on their sales goals and their quota attainment. The company provides all the necessary training and tools to be successful in sales.
good,"CenturyLink is a quality company that has good health insurance and Paid time off.  Employees are treated well, and are encouraged to share their input on how to improve the company."
good,"its a nice place and environment, but i'm working remote and sometimes in the office to present the project and discussion for the problem encountered"
good,"Call center environment.  Sales, customer service, data entry, billing.  Talking on the phone with customers.  Great training.  Great management. Great benefits.  Some cutthroat people out to make a name for themselves.  Laid back environment."
good,Company is great but is constantly going through mergers and changes are consistent. You never know what will be reqeust from above. But company has people that have stayed for over 15 years. The people is what makes it great
good,"Benefits offered were good but there was a lack of career path and moving up within the company."
good,"CenturyLink was driving their new Managed Services offering which was competitive in the MS industry. Their training was top-notch, and the management was helpful and focused."
good,The company as it has taken over other companies became bogged down with procedures caring less about the customer and results of the company and the customers perception of the company
good,Great bunch of people to work with but the hardest part is getting help from other departments. Its as if they have their own set of goals and are not in line with the overall company's.
good,CenturyLink is about average overall. There are some real benifits if you are a union employee. But in order for you to change jobs or move up there are requirements to meet within the contract between the union and CTL. This made advancement complicated and frustrating.
good,CenturyLink can be a tough place to work. Lots of systems to learn and a difficult product to delver. Customer service is lacking to say the least. If you can handle the pressure you can make good money and the benefits are really good.
good,Really enjoyed working at Centurylink meeting new customers everyday and making new friends sometimes the work was very hard and other times it was not learned new skills all the time.
good,CenturyLink has a great culture and great people.  It is well positioned to compete with other network providers since the acquisition of Level 3.  Organizational challenges with merger and archaic systems and processes are inhibitors to their success.
good,"I think many employees in my position would find the job extremely stressful and overwhelming.  I found it to be an awesome challenge and I grew accordingly as a result.  I'm grateful for the opportunity the company gave me, but wish the corporate culture wasn't so stifling and conservative."
good,I worked in the retention department.  CenturyLink made a big deal about taking responsibility to solve client issues but did give the agents on the telephone the authority to fix the issue. I took several calls where the fix I placed an order for was ignored.
good,the job is good about pay however there are times were i feel job advancement is not an option. Really good benefits such as 401k and medical insurance.
good,The workplace culture is good for self motivated learners.  There isn't much training offered. Management is hands off mostly.  Until performance reviews there isn't much feedback. The hardest part of the job is not getting recognized for contributions. The most enjoyable part is the flexibility to take time off when needed.
good,CenturyLink with the merger of Level 3 Communications positioned as the number 2 domestic and number 3 global communications company.   Just beginning to formulate name recognition globally.
good,Aprendí mucho acerca de sistemas y tuve inducción básica sobre redes lo cual me ha ayudado mucho a mi desarrollo profesional.
good,"great coworkers and management we were like a family. Would still be working there if we had not been outsourced."
good,"Good job for self motivated workers. Very independent culture."
good,"A typical day consist of installing and repairing high speed internet, pots lines and Prism television services.  I work with multiple customers on a daily basis making sure their needs are taken care of.  I have learned from this role to have more patience with people as some customers do not understand certain things the first time around."
good,"Good place to work, excellent employees, big changes with merger with Level 3,"
good,"Union provided for good pay and benefits, but limited upward movement.  Still overall good job with good benefits.  New changes in dispatch system may cause future issues."
good,"I enjoyed working there and learned alot in the process"
good,The only reason I left was for better pay. The working conditions and treatment by management were both fair and supportive. Working conditions were very good. Relativly roomy work space with good resources as needed..
good,"My company was acquired by Century Link and this is the first year we had to take Century Link medical.  It was a major hit compared to previous company.  It would have been ~$300/month over what I was previously paying to keep what I had.  I ended up having to take less.  Raises have also been at ~1% on years when you did get a raise which was not every year."
good,I enjoyed my time at Century Link. The environment was good and my coworkers were a great group of people to be around. The compensation wasn't all that great
good,"Our team is 30 sales reps, all are extremely professional and collaborative.  Work is very challenging on a daily basis.  Work-life balance is excellent."
good,"This was a great internship. I earned great skills to apply to my future workplace, and had fun with my co-workers. I would consider working here again"
good,"This job can be very stressful. Its best to stay on your Ps and Qs. They just recently laid off supervisors and TSCs. Doing this job on a daily basis you have to try to save every customer and offer on every call. Pays good, just stressful and never know when you will be without a job."
good,Typical day at work is the same as any office job. Relaxed atmosphere with great people to work with. Hardest part of the job is dealing with different city municipalities.
good,"a good place to work if you only care for money, and time off. supervisor's treat you badly and expect our loyalty while giving you none. change there minds by the minute and will not supply you with resources to do your job, you are on your own."
good,Had awesome team with good work ethics. Not sure why need to add more I am not looking to be hired were I already work................................
good,yes i would go back and focus on training and management always obtained 100% of quota obtainment and I would highly recommend this position for all sales
good,It was overall a great place to work. Fellow employees also made the work environment a lot more fun and friendly. The management was also great while working there. They work with their team and make sure you have as much knowledge as possible.
good,"Good place to work at the beginning, they let you do your job. Then new management came in and started to micro manage everything and work slowed as a result of this."
good,Telecommunications job on the phone all day.  Competitive position and not as much customer service focused as sales focused made this job a tough one.  Lots of contests for prizes and was able to win a trip to Hawaii amongst other gifts made this job enjoyable.
good,Working for a large company that has a very diverse product offering allows employee's to gain experience in a wide range of technologies. I was always pushed to learn more and further my career.
good,I was impressed with Qwest. A very dynamic group of developers. And the project engagement group created a cohesive client and delivery of project deliverables. All in all a great experience.
good,Centurylink is  a  highly paid place to work. The income is great. Great place to earn a lot of cash. I think it is a great place to start your career
good,Was Great Place before acquisition. Level 3 became a workplace of fear and uncertainty with being acquired this led to no advancement opportunities within Level 3.
good,I've enjoyed working with Level3 Telecommunications.  Previous experience in my history only set the stage for me to learn so much more about the telecom industry today.  I would recommend this company to any newly graduated telecom student/Engineer seeking  to collect the experience of day-to-day support of a competitive company.
good,Enjoyable place to work as Quality Assurance Manager you have the opportunity to provide feedback and coaching to sales and service consultants.  Ensuring calls are in compliance with rules and regulations. Management created creative environment to discuss upcoming changing or ways to help develop consultants by encouraging discussion thru team development and table games. It also provided flexibility to work from home.
good,Exciting and challenging projects to work on.  Long days and a would typically work each weekend to deliver projects on time and budget.  Had a great team to work with.
good,"Qwest was a good company to work for."
good,Good to work and gets chance to work on multiple platforms . But it is quite regional languages dominant and management is supportive.  You come out with one new technology learnt. Over all good experience to work with.
good,"Enjoyed working and learning from co workers.  Good training to improve abilities.  One negative, company went away from quality to quantity.  Company should have focused more on customers problems"
good,I went in everyday knowing that i was going to have a good day and I was going to learn something new. I really looked forward to expanding my abilities.
good,Fast paced atmosphere with a lot of product to sell to customers. Management in my experience is there to help when needed as well as other employees.
good,"Worked 12 years and dedicated many unscheduled man hours to various projects.  Great benefits and lots of paid time off, however because of the work load, unable to take much time off."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job is flexibility, management and peers.  Worked there for a number of years.  I moved up within the company and there is opportunity for advancement within the departments."
good,The IT department employed employees who are dedicated to quality while ensuring each project is on time and on budget. Working with highly talented IT professionals at CentryLink was motivating and enspiring.
good,Fun company to work for. Great team environment. I learned how to manage calls more efficiently as well as learning how to provide great customer service.
good,"Each department is like an extended family. Not being on the phone much gives you a lot of time to learn the people you are working with. Hardest part of the day was finding a place to park if you didn't have a garage close by that you paid for. Hardest part of the job was working in a dull atmosphere. Work was steady, but the building atmosphere would dull your energy."
good,"Made a good living at Qwest Communications and enjoyed the work.  Did not enjoy some of the Corporate policies that were in force.  The Union, (CWA), was not strong enough to protect and support employees."
good,I really enjoyed working with my team at CenturyLink.  They have a strong dynamic of working together to be successful and work hard and play hard type of environment.
good,"A very large company with operations throughout the US and some international.  A previous ""traditional"" telephone company, CenturyLink is moving to a global cloud company."
good,Pay is figured with base pay plus commission.  If you put in a fair days work you get a fair paycheck.  When the team is meeting goals the SLA for the goals are higher.  Which is totally unfair. VERY stringent on time adherence.
good,There is currently a certain amount of instability due to recent acquisition and divesture activity.  Otherwise and interesting field (IT/Telecommunications) to get involved in.
good,"Fine organization with good work/life balance. Nice to have job here. agile practices are in practice, so leaning also in progress organization wide."
good,"I worked for centurylink for almost a year, all I can say was the pay was great other than that the things and people I had to deal with was unacceptable... I left February 23, 2017 and have yet to receive my pay check.. I'm at a total loss of words.."
good,"Enjoyed fixing products and customers"
good,Always something new to be learned with deployment of new equipment on the cutting edge but often without formal training.
good,"CenturyLink has great benefits, and if you have the right co-workers, a nice place to work. They have an onsite work out room. They do give out a yearly incentive bonus. "
good,"I joined CTL as part of a new team focused on moving our customers toward cloud based managed voice and data services.  We had the support and commitment of the COO and VP of Marketing to develop these services.  My role was to support the sales organizations within a six state region, to educate and inform our teams of the benefits of these managed services and engage in direct customer meetings.  One of the challenges was gaining the trust and engagement with each of the Sales managers to encourage the sales teams to shift from a traditional network and CPE sale to a MRR model.  With long time relations with CPE manufacturers, resellers and business partners, these new cloud services were viewed by some as disruptive. For those teams who ""got it"", the rewards were Large.  A multi-year contract for providing managed services on a MRR basis was much larger than the one-time commission on a router.  I was blessed to have a wonderful Director and Marketing organization that was supportive of the uniqueness of each customers requirements.  In late 2015 there was a major change in executive management and I noticed a shift in the enthusiasm and commitment to our program."
good,"	Interact with customers/account representatives via conference calls for escalated Issues."
good,Fun place to  work lack leadership.Enjoyed my co workers which lead to great friendships. My job  was very challenging but exciting..
good,"CenturyLink is still trying to find its footing in a rapidly changing technical world dominated by cloud and hosted services.  Specific front line managers in this transition are spectacular, but company has too many overlapping teams, and areas where there is insufficient coverage."
good,Had an exciting career that spanned over three decades.  Worked with friendly dedicated people.  What I liked most was the fast pace and variety of job duties.
good,"Worked for a large organisation located in a different state. The organisation at San Antonio was relatively small, so it was not represented very well in the overall scheme of things."
good,"This is definitely a good place to start out, and step up from the retail job experience. The environment and people I have worked with, including management are very nice. The compensation is not too high, but if you are willing to put in another 5+ years the rate of pay would increase enough to make it a decent paying job. I would recommend the sales consultant job for those just out of college in particular, to get some experience at business to consumer sales."
good,Job relocated to Phoenix and was a great job until the powers that be didn't want the location open and they worked on getting rid of employees.
good,Fast paced operation with an overall very experienced staff. Must be able to learn and be comfortable working on multiple networks with various types of equipment.
good,Got to travel to southern cities in Arizona and meet interesting people. Worked with knowledgable engineers in Phoenix.
good,Was very happy working for Centurylink and when I had a family life change they were very good to me and when I had to resign they worked with me to come back due to my abilities and understood of family crisis
good,"took 70-100 calls a day"
good,"Excellent Benefits, but sales quota is almost unobtainable."
good,"environment challenging and rewarding most days, no real direction from management, lack of enthusiasm from co workers, not kept in the loop on upcoming projects"
good,"If you work hard, do you part, and respect the other team members, you can do well on this team. I can't speak for much of the rest of the company but the Corporate Physical Security company does well in retrospect. If you contribute the best you can, they will take care of you in the end. Even if it takes years to do so."
good,"Decided to retire, Kids out on their own and ready for a new challenge in life.  Enough said -at least that's what I believe."
good,"Typical day starts early morning creating a daily report that includes weekends, this report contains a substernal amount of data, graphs, charts and metrics on the IPTV platform.  This data is collected from many reports created and scripted by myself and also used by engineers and the leader ship team.  In addition, Weekly, Monthly and leadership decks are provided by me.  Trending, daily performance, outage and monitoring tools are created and maintained.  All of the reports are emailed and posted to an executive dashboard that was created and maintained by me."
good,"Great job and a good company to work for with excellent benefits. However, the company moved out of Fayetteville, North Carolina."
good,"A typical work day consisted of answering the phone to sell CenturyLink's services and (secondary) to help their customers solve their CenturyLink related problems."
good,"Competitive sales, customer service environment.  Grew out of another company with union type structure which created additional internal culture issues that increased stress level for associates."
good,Good work life balance but the company is big and with that comes lots of politics. per management not willing to listen to lower levels even if they were right.
good,"I have enjoyed my 10+ years with CenturyLink. The company has grown and evolved over that past 5+ years. Through two major acquisitions CenturyLink has definitely lost it's hometown company charm, but it had to grow to succeed. Now the feeling is that we are more a number than a name. It is the cost of doing business. I am thrilled with CenturyLink's success and growth. I learned so much in my time at CenturyLink in the marketing department."
good,My department was a good place to work.  Awesome work life balance.  Co-workers are very helpful and management was well balanced.
good,"Good to work at work place"
good,Was a good place until they started to send all their work to China and the Philippines.  Company has made several finically errors and now can't afford to pay people in the U.S.
good,CenturyLink in the post buyout of Qwest in 2011 is a very financially driven organization. Money is chosen over people. Layoffs and low salaries are very common.
good,Very upbeat co-workers always trying to push you to do better and also same with bosses. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to talk to people all over the U.S. and being able to solve any problems there having.
good,I worked with great people who were passionate about their customers.  An environment that was always changing that required people to be flexible and always willing to adapt.
good,Good company going through changes as a result of multiple acquisitions. The cloud group is growing and they will be very big in the years to come. Good company
good,"A very large company, however the individual offices was a great working environment. I learned how to manage my time, how to handle various personalities and received an understanding of the products and services of the company."
good,Overall most definitely a company to work for.  Lots of work and even Over Time.  Great training and I worked w/a really knowledgeable and professional group of people. Definitely learned a lot here.
good,"none at this time, position was deleted. They said it was a reduction in work force."
good,"Company full of dedicated, hard workers who care about their peers and clients. Compensation is far below scale."
good,"Static schedule, desk areas very compatible and ergonomic.  Co-workers are excellent sources of information."
good,"A typical day at work, I worked different systems for Centurylink, Directv, and Verizon. I helped with billing, setting up new sales/accounts, and knowledge of all products and services. I learned about the different products and systems. The management were good at helping get information. I loved working with my co-workers they were all outgoing. The hardest part of the job is having to maintain sales in order to have job security. The most enjoyable part was helping customers with issues and making sure they have what they need."
good,I came to Centurylink for a new career. I started from the bottom to work my way up but growth within the same community I lived in wasn't a option. The center closed 2014
good,Good job to have in today's economy! The weather makes the workload's very busy. My direct boss is very awesome!
good,"calling customers to make sure they are home,listening to what their needs and concerns are.give them an approximate time when you will be done.Co workers help out with big jobs builds good teamwork.Handling unhappy customers with problems but putting a smile back on their face after you have corrected the problems was very enjoyable to me"
good,"Qwest now Clearlink was a great place to work at. Schedules are based on seniority. it is a union job, so almost everything is. I had a 10am-7pm shift for almost my entire time. Mostly because I moved positions twice and went from $11.00/hr to $17.00/hr in 4 years. There is some room to move in the company but not a lot. Lots of offices are being closed and consolidated due to the merger. Its a large corporation so it's harder to make any meaningful contribution. I know a lot of people that stay there 10+ years."
good,"A typical day here would be coming in to one of the sites within the city and reviewing installs and maintenance for the facilities projecting out several months. Interfacing with the lead engineers and account managers was a big part of this. The team was very cross functional and we all new how to do every job required of the team. I learned a lot of what I know now about Data Centers while working here. It was very hands on and required participation and team work to get the job done. Management typically allowed me and the team to perform our jobs, with little micromanagement. I worked very closely with my co workers. We accomplished a lot together. Most difficult part of the job was keeping up with multiple client installs at the same time, but not too difficult to handle. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with the professionals I worked with and being able to do a lot of the hands on work that helped develop skills we all now have."
good,"Call center position -fielding calls from customers with questions on the account and solving any problems or questions they may have."
good,Typical day consists of upselling products and services to existing and some new customers. Required to close sales of new or additional products and services on each call.
good,"The best part of my roll as a Sales Manager with Century Link was the ability to coach and grow my Sales Professionals.  The ability to strategize and think of out of the box solutions that could be implemented to best fit the customers business needs."
good,"Great job, but, unstable future with no chance for advancement"
good,"This has been one of the better jobs I have had. Management is fun to work with, the company really cares about their employees, and it is a fairly easy job to handle. They do their best to work with you with time management and achieve certain goals while giving incentives."
good,"day at work is easy going, learned about communication trade, computer, utility services, very good co workers, hardest part of job is when customer traffic gets slow."
good,"If you get the right trainer you can go far in this job. The environment is fun and friendly, with a little competition thrown in. Everyone is friendly. Its a great place to work if you want to focus on sales."
good,Overwhelmed with work.  Way to many task and meetings and conference calls.
good,A typical day is very fast paced and is challenging working through different and at times disjointed departments.  Overall a good place to work.
good,"Duties include processes and/or handles high volume of paperwork including bills,vouchers,payments,claims,documents,service orders,reports,trouble reports/tickets,answered customer request to solve problems with the systems."
good,"Key-in to the systems , a total of 8 systems daily. Log-in to Phone and receive customer solution escalated calls. The calls are directed to resolve the customers concern and and evaluate their account to assure we are providing the best possible service. Any Products and services available that may be suited for benefit to this customer is offered with the benefits.Making sure that their escalated issue is resolved first. Hardest part of job on escalated call is knowing that you cannot make the customer happy 100 percent of the time. The most enjoyable part is being efficient in the needs and wants of customer thus, providing the best customer service. Periodically Training is provided to maintain knowledge of the newest and latest technologies in the Telecommunications industry."
good,This is a great company but to move up in the ranks it's more about who you know than what you know. There is very little racial/gender diversity at the management level.  For the most part it's a good company to work for.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of taking calls from customers that were having trouble with their phone service. There were times that sales could be made in this position. I would either fix the problem with the customer over the phone, ie; trouble was their actual telephone equipment, or put in a report for a technician to be dispatched. Some problems were instructing on features or programming a feature that was not working."
good,"A typical work day is check the queue and work on priorities orders assist global teams in order to close the order."
good,"Overall, working there was good. After CenturyLink bought Qwest, the corporate culture changed and not in a good way."
good,Good people work for the company. A lot of support and help. Peers are excellent and everyone is always helpful. Tough part of the job is getting the CenturyLink name out there
good,The most important part of the job is superb Work-Life balance.
good,"The Savvis culture is collaborative and supportive; teams meet weekly via conference call or in person; most sales executives have offices, not cubicles. There is a real effort to foster collaboration and friendships with lunches, celebrations, etc."
good,"Good overall, needed a lot of field work to be done to keep more of its customers, needed to listen to its employees that really wanted to do good for customers. Also needed to review its supervisory staff more closely."
good,"CenturyLink was a good place to work. I had worked there for 13 years, but due to new management coming in I found myself without a job."
good,I really enjoyed workigng there and the pay was great but the risk of losing your job each month if you didnt make sales was a nightmare.
good,I enjoyed talking to the customers on the phone on a day to day process. I was guided by my supervisors well.I really only had one problem and that there were long pauses between calls which made it hard to keep up with quota for sales. I was laid off becuase i did not make sales quota.
good,"I would start my computer, sign in, and make my phone available. I am supposed to screen 1000 ""call before you dig"" tickets a day and take, and make phone calls. There are assigned emergency times, where we each have to handle all emergency tickets right away, and respond to all emails concerning techs being off work, for three hours each. When we recieve an emergency, if the dig area is in conflict with the fiber we have to call the locator right away, because the work will typically take place within 24hrs. Pretty simple you just have to stay focused inorder to reach your productivity goal each day. My favorite part of the day is lunch. I had an excellent manager she handles everything well, she just lacks planning."
good,Great company to work for. Great group of people. They give you everything you need to succeed.
good,"I enjoyed working for CenturyLink, unfortunately the company had corporate wide down sizing and I was affected."
good,"CenturyLink (formerly Qwest) has some of the most incredible people working for them. I have established some friendships, at all levels of the organization, that will last a lifetime."
good,"The company is working through all the issues attached to purchasing other companies, particularly systems."
good,I enjoyed working here for the last 11 years. Benefits were great and pay was good as well.
good,A good and growing Telecommunication Company. I have working with this company for about 5 years and I'm looking for new opportunity now.
good,Century link has really stepped up and made the workplace competitive as far as  compensation and really making a valiant attempt at making all install and maintenance user friendly
good,"I want to grow with a company, and look long term. I am in charge of entire area of 15 union techs. I cover multiple cities. I work with customers daily on orders and trouble tickets along with repair tickets. I work with customer surveys to make sure that customers are happy with our service."
good,It was a okay job. No supervision. No training. The pay was good. No reward for being a good worker. My coworkers took advantage of the system. We had a boss that was remote so coworkers would leave early and come late.
good,The company offers an unmatched product portfolio. Team sales engineer support is outstanding. Corporate level changes were disruptive to the implementation of sold solutions
good,"I love my job, but it is being surplussed, The other positions are tedious, but really great people to work with.  They offer great benefits to their employees.  And it is full time, Monday-Friday."
good,"Great easy going job and work enviromnet. Goals were attainable, work loads light, management was very friendly and easy going enviroment to work inside of."
good,"It is close to my residence, and I like my co-workers. In the INOC we don't get a lot of feed back from the management group, unless something goes wrong. Having 5 different managers makes it difficult to get all the procedures done the same way."
good,"A typical day consists of updating user accounts, monitoring and troubleshooting dropped calls from CDR logs.  If the company provided better training for new employees this company would be a dream come true."
good,This is a telecom CLEC that is expanding every day. growing and expanding. taking over new markets and improving on the other ones. great place to be working.
good,"CenturyLink was a great place to work with lots of seasoned professionals.  Their client support model was great and they had a great team of dedicated individuals in both pre-sales as well as post-sales to assist.  Multiple management changes during a short period of time made things a bit challenging, however, I'm certain that with the most recent acquisition of Level3 and their leadership team's insertion, the changes should have slowed down since my time there."
good,I love working here. The last 6.5 years have been wonderful. It is unfortunate they are down sizing and I will no longer be able to be employed by them.
good,"Product Managers at CenturyLink have P&L accountability and lead a core team of key stakeholders including Sales, Marketing, Development, Legal, Regulatory, Finance, Operations and Support. CenturyLink has a positive culture with good people."
good,It was the most stable job I’ve ever had. I wouldn’t mind returning due to my immediate & sustained success. I’m looking to find something that’s comparable financially.
good,"Casual dress code."
good,Positive environment. Peers and coworkers were nice to work with. Lot of growth potential and learning opportunities. Environment was friendly and balanced. Good management.
good,"Attending meetings and provide feedback with regards to job responsibilities."
good,CenturyLink has plenty of opportunities to advance your career and move up inside the company. The pay is competitive and benefits are great. Only complain I have is about management.
good,It's about what you can expect from a call center job. Most of the management is very helpful and friendly. You spend the majority of your day answering calls and setting up appointments.
good,Enjoyed working there workload was well managed time off was easy great family balance was lots of training opportunities  and knowledge to be gained.
good,"When I started at Level3 Communications it was a wonderful place to work. With the Company intergrations with other companys things became very fast, confusing and alot of changes. When CenturyLink bought out Level 3 about 1.5 years ago, it became more micro managed and the stress level had become very high."
good,There is a lot of work to do but there is great help between management and peers to assist when and where needed. Your ideas for process improvement is also taken very seriously and reviewed and if it fits it gets implemented.
good,Excellent platform and opportunity to furnish people and process management skills. Handled an IT ServiceDesk for a US based Process - CenturyLink. Got to learn a lot about the key metrics associated with a project and managing a team of 30 reportees
good,"Great company to work for. Never a dull moment, every work task is usually different. If you love dealing with people, you will love this job. Management is stressed for results in numbers, but if you get the manager that supports his or her technicians, then you will be ok. Great benefits."
good,"Gran oportunidad de aprendizaje, atendiendo proyectos de planta externa donde se va creciendo como profesional constantemente."
good,Great Company to work for. In my current position I just had no room for advancement. Wonderful coworkers and management. Relaxed atmosphere. Would recommend.
good,Overall a good place to work.  Work from home has good advancement.  Inadequate communications in emergency situations.  Good insurance. Schedule availability was ok.
good,"Good place to make a decent wage. But very stressful at times. Next to no flexibility and point system definitely needs work. Basically if you don’t have children or raising them alone, then this job would work for you because new comers are expected to work 11-8pm during the weekdays with no guarantee of a schedule change."
good,"Pull SUPP orders from que and review request. Determine if I had all the information and approval documents to proceed or if I need to return for missing information. "
good,Mostly self-motivated environment with discretion and responsibility left up to the employees regarding responding to network alarms and contacting customers. Management was very relaxed with a very stress free appeal. Great opportunity to learn various WAN technologies and OSI Layer 1-3 troubleshooting process. The most difficult part of the job was responding to all customers and telcos during multiple major area outage scenarios. The best part of the job was the corporate learning center and free training material.
good,My experience with CenturyLink was very good.  I had an opportunity to expand my horizons and experience new and exciting opportunities there.  I would strongly recommend others to experience the employment at this company.
good,"The time I had at CenturyLink was great, i wish they didnt do the forced reduction because I was really loving my job there and wished I could have stayed."
good,"A typical work day for me is Monday - Friday, from 7AM-3:30AM in an office of about 30 other Finance Specialists. The environment is laid back, but there are high expectations to meet our key metrics, and providing a satisfactory outcome with Large business customer. The difficult part of that process would be having to Negotiate delivery terms that benefit both the Company, as well as the customer. However, it is rewarding to be able to collaborate with my team, and peers in other organizations to help resolve issues. We all learn different techniques from one another"
good,"I would have rated Centurylink all 5s if the option to choose your hours/schedule was a thing, BUT its not. Everyone is basically given the same schedule & are not willing to work with you at all if their schedule is inconvenient for you. Also, the training class is poorly put-together & the teacher was not very good at her job. Literally half of my class did not graduate [& this has been a trend for some time, I was told]."
good,Flexible schedule for a work/life balance.  The culture is currently changing for the better. Compensation could be better aligned across all organizations.
good,"CenturyLink is customer focused, fast paced company. The employees are some of the most talented I have known. The company is supportive of career pathing."
good,"CenturyLink was a good place to work. The telecommunications industry is always changing. My days consisted of the processing and follow up of orders, coordinating installs with customers and sales. What I learned was to always put the customer first."
good,Back when I worked for them they were still a union company so they were great to work for.  I thought it would be cradle to grave.  The CEO at the time decided to take from the company instead.
good,"I've been with the company for quite awhile, and I've definitely had my ups and downs, but ultimately your experience with CenturyLink will depend on the immediate levels of management above you.  I've had awful management in those layers and despised my job, and I've had excellent management in those layers and had a wonderful experience.  Recently the company has changed a lot, and it's uncertain if it's for the better or worse, but our Stock Prices look bad, so Wall Street doesn't have confidence in the current leadership or direction."
good,"Coming in during the integration with Level3 Communications has been challenging, exactly the kind of environment I thrive in.  May not be the best fit for everyone."
good,Some days were monotonous repairing standard network and telecom issues while other days were putting out fires and unique challenges. Hard to get support for unfamiliar systems. Benefits were great.
good,The typical day included taking calls from customers at a rate of 32 seconds or less to be proficient. Maintained god customer service skills. Management worked well with the employees. The workplace environment was good. I really didn't have any problems.
good,I feel like I didn't get as much out of the time I worked at CenturyLink like I wanted. I know that people I worked with were very professional and courteous.
good,"The pay was good. But I was always confused about what I need to do, and what am I doing. "
good,"I really enjoyed my job while I worked there. And the people that I worked with was a good group to be in. Unfortunately, I was one of the many that were subjected to a ""RIF"". Reduction in Work Force. No warning, nothing! Not even an opportunity to find another position, after I was relocated here as a direct hire from MI to work there."
good,"Great company and trying to do the right things. Combined Level 3 network will keep CTL competitive for the future. Great network and will improve provisioning once integration is complete. "
good,"I've been a technician on 4 different crews during my tenure for CenturyLink. Although the workload demand has forced adjustments to coverage areas and crews, each one I've worked for has had a great group of technicians. Many have even become friends outside of work. Being able to chat before shift in the morning and at end of shift. Even during the day to discuss work assistance or delegation if necessary. Having the ability to communicate with 15-20 peers during the work day is probably one of the best resources in the field"
good,"A typical work day at Century link were to be punctual and accurate. Follow all company protocols, assist with all of the customer's business needs. Management worked the escalation Que, and monitored all of the agent's metrics. The workplace culture were organized in team units. Teams were changed around periodically. The work shifts changed every three months. The hardest part of the job were the frequent equipment failures. The most enjoyable part of the job were the available online classes and tutorials available to enhance our careers."
good,I enjoyed working at CenturyLink with all of my co-workers and my immediate manger is very helpful and supportive.  I would appreciate if I would have more opportunity to be trained in another job field.
good,"CenturyLink gave me an opportunity to work with Unions, and a few different lines of business.  For this I truly appreciated the ability to work there twice as a contractor."
good,"Legacy CTL was a fun, God & family oriented place to work. After buying L3 lots of things changed for the worse. Employees are numbers not people. Bonuses are cut. Promotions promised but bot given. Raises are cut. Employees are taken for granted."
good,"Management need improving, no one was available if you work past 6:00 pm. And you didn't have your supervisor desk # or cell #  if you had an emergency"
good,"You're always busy, there is always something that need attention. The hardest part of the job is keep up with all of the changes that will occur. The most enjoyable part of the job is the feeling of accomplishment each day."
good,"Centurylink is definitely a good company to work for; the benefits are great and you also get paid commission on top of your base pay. Centurylink its strict on attendance and it is a huge factor in terminations. Sales are pretty smooth if you can actually hold a conversation, and it's a very relaxed place."
good,"It is a solid, fast paced place to work. Must be self motivated to be successful. Pays well and the job isn't too challenging if you're willing to learn."
good,"it is a very fast passed enviorment very stressful and work load has become very hard to manage. I have learned allot about telecom and enjoy my job if the load was not as it is. I have learned many things about the services, Ethernet, data, cloud ect..."
good,"The job is very technical and 90% customer facing."
good,"Everyone there is good, Learned how to interact with clients with that smile  in your responsd. Above all had great experience and helped in developing my skills I used and I'm using now and in future."
good,Ability to offer numerous solutions to both SMB and large enterprise clients. Several online and on-site training options to stay relevant in ever-changing technologies. Management is experienced and knowledgeable.  Overall a good working experience.
good,Sales and customer service call center. Work environment was friendly but not very helpful. Co workers teach each other and help new employees when needed.
good,"Its mostly a call center but you do get to do some testing and Ethernet troubleshooting.  Its a  good place if you have no experience and want to ""cut your teeth"" in the network administration field."
good,"I really enjoyed assisting customers when they called in and talking to all kinds of people who called in. I'd learned more about how I interacted as well as ways to improve those interactions. Management was iffy at best, they seemed very capricious on when policies were enforced. The workplace culture was pretty good, team environment. Hardest part was that they never seemed to have stability in the handle times for tasks."
good,Typical day starts at 5:00am I validate all work commitments and assignments for all technicians. Then validate payroll from previous day. Review and Look over previous days results and address any questionable data and provide coaching as needed. Attend 2 conference calls to assess the needs and amount of work to be taken for the previous day to ensure all company commitments to the customers are met. Review all Current or outstanding repair jobs for my area to ensure they are on schedule. Review all engineering jobs for network upgrades to ensure cost and schedule. Review supply orders to ensure all necessary parts and supplies are on hand to accomplish all necessary jobs. Review all performance numbers and vehicle reports for my Team and address as needed. Spend the rest of the day in the field with technicians or job sites reviewing work knowledge and approach and providing coaching as needed. End of day staff call to go over our numbers and addess any questions or priorities that might have occured
good,"It is a great place to work,Great benefits, Management was good to work for and recognition for accomplishments was encouraged., Was great to be able to take classes after work.even if it didn't have anything to do with your current job."
good,"CenturyLink is very competitive with salary/benefits, but the management needs to be better.  Most of the employees can't trust what upper management communicates to the organization.  There have been layoffs every year I have worked at CenturyLink."
good,Great Benefits but a very strict work environment; call center environment and restroom breaks are monitored. Low level staff are treated very differently than staff that work at the corporate office.
good,"I worked in the wholesale side of the company. I learned to be a self starter and create my own opportunities while there. If my office hadn't been closed for consolidation in another state, I'd probably still be there."
good,Century Link is a good company to work for. I feel I  need a  change to see the outside world. The company does take care of their employees. The management team is great to work with.
good,"Benefits were fantastic, pay rate was very good (union), but management would work you on overtime with no hesitation, regardless of seniority or position"
good,"This is the least stressful job I have had.  It's also the only place I've ever worked where they asked  you what shift you wanted to work and then within reason let you work it.  The culture there used to be the best around, then they merged with Level 3 and things got really shaken up.  I've been part of other mergers before, but none like this.  It felt like a hostile take over instead of a merger and it changed everything about our department.  They cut a lot of jobs, which is to be expected, but it is the overall atmosphere that changed.  More work for less people and the demand is that the work still MUST get done."
good,"Typical day- Log on at 6am, check and respond to urgent emails first. Make calls, Open the standard 14+ systems to work in and begin working. Process all order requests, provide quotes, escalate any issues, send requested account info and all related account management activities and follow up on all of that. The hardest part is trying to keep all the Partners and customers and Management happy all at once. There is a plethora of process and systems to work in and this job is Very Dynamic."
good,Good company to work for. Most of the management was easy to work with. Good policy on communication up and down the management chain. If the opportunity presented itself I would work for CenturyLink in the future.
good,"No company is perfect to work for, however the management and my peers really made the job worthwhile and I didn't want to leave. I advanced from my entry level position and although the wages could have better reflected my position, it wasn't a horrible place to work."
good,"Great place to work, on sight management team was great, supportive environment, continual education a plus, opportunities of career advancement overall compensation package was good"
good,"Very structured and strict but they try to make it more enjoyable to their employees by doing giveaways, drawings, free lunches, etc often. Is a stressful yet fun place to work"
good,"Overall a good place to work, however lately there has been no prospects of career advancement and pay is low for information technology workers compared to other companies"
good,The company had continuous training. We worked with the latest technology. Benefits were the outstanding. Met many people. Strict attendance policies.
good,Great place to work that provides advancement and good work life balance.  Approachable management team and informative communications with HR.  Would highly recommend.
good,Qwest was integrated into CenturyLink which makes this review something of a historical artifact.  Qwest's culture was subsumed by CTL's and as a result many dedicated and happy employees moved on.  Very few talented Qwest employees remain today as a result.
good,Great place to work especially with the team I have. Lots of changes going on right now and employment is not to stable at the moment. I have been through 2 two mergers now and I think we just need the dust to settle.
good,"	Collaborated with customers and provided assistance with phone lines internet & cable"
good,The atmosphere at this company was very fun and energetic. management was very easy to work with.  Pay and benefits could have been better but it was easier to look forward to going to work everyday.
good,"good place to work with:"
good,"people were always willing to help eachother, challenging job, got to work on multiple platforms. i was a contractor and was hoping to become an employee."
good,"When i was there, the calls weren't to bad in tech support. My Manager was awesome, they went from good to better. My co workers were awesome and we used to be able to use the wifi and bring our personal computers for in between calls. If they paid more i would still be there."
good,CenturyLink is a great work/life balance company.  The people are friendly and easy to work with.  Work at home options are common and the demands were not high.
good,I liked the last job I had at Qwest and I was sorry to be laid off at that time. I worked in a great group of people that seemed to work well together.
good,"Lots of opportunities to use the latest technologies, variety of career opportunities, challenging work, great team mates. A variety of jobs and a great opportunities."
good,A Global Telecom company ready for the future to compete with other local carriers to support every companies ethernet needs. The have a transatlantic fiber routes supporting Europe.
good,It was a good place to work just need better supervisors. My encounter with my supervisor is I feel she was more focused on building a friendship rather than doing her role as a supervisor.
good,Qwest was a great opportunity in a very challenging industry.  The support from upper management and fellow sales engineers was very helpful for large projects proposals.
good,"Good place to work.  I would consider going back.  The culture was good, and management gets treated pretty well.  The job was enjoyable and I had excellent colleagues."
good,"I loved working for Centurylink.   It was a fast paced environment with  the opportunity to design solutions for customers.  It allowed creativity and problem solving on a daily basis with each day with customers bringing new  challenges and as a team creating solutions for our customers,   delivering great value to our customers. This was enhancing there businesses and lives and very satisfying to myself ans an employee.."
good,"Good company to work for. Maybe not the best of paymasters, but good potential for individual growth. Good people to work with. Competitive environment."
good,Very stressful and many different tools / databases to work on. Seemed to be in a continued escalation / expedite mode. but very supportive from others great people.
good,"In the nearly 4 years I was with the company, I held 4 different positions due to company restructuring.  This constant restructuring led to multiple setbacks in career advancement and multiple management changes to individual supervisors.  Due to these changes I would not fully recommend working for the company."
good,"receive work for the day, complete work and go home."
good,"Loved the team i was apart of it was like a family, we laughed we joked we did our work and at the end of the day we was happy no matter what had happened that day."
good,"They were a good company to work with; however, the communication from management was quite often incomplete. This led to misunderstandings and poor performance for some. Personally I did not have many issues though."
good,"Ensured bills are paid, closing packets from contractors have been up loaded, worked with contractors and Engineers on permits for all entitles. Learned how to review Engineering prints and county maps. The workplace culture where I particularly reported to was a very dry. The hardest part of the job is the lack of scenes of humor people have in the building, mind you we have only about 10 people here all day long. Again, very dry. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of getting the job done in a timely and effective manner."
good,"Typical call center environment. Sales requirements in a customer service based environment. Occasional high sales expectation. Required to make sales offer on every call, even when customer has time constraints or is losing money from services not working before sending customer to repair."
good,"It's a telecom, you know what it's like.  Disorganized, competitive between projects and divisions, clueless upper management.  But on the floor it's cool, bosses are chill and other employees are cool."
good,Challenging work in collaborative environments.  Vendor professional training not too easy to secure even if job related.  Work culture is great and employees are encouraged to take time off to support family and community events.
good,"awesome, work life balance. pay is good on the basis of hot technologies and really a fun place to work. Accommodation are really good related to cab and shift."
good,"In the position and department I was at, the job allowed to work from home often. Growth and promotion is slow and limited. My manager treats me fair, however, he is limited in his ability to promote people."
good,Performed daily duties to successfully perform my job but a lack of job advancement was the most important issue. This job may be beneficial for others but I am looking for something  a bit more advanced.
good,It was a great place to work but after 8 years i needed a change.  the culture is very southern and very friendly but I went to high school with my boss
good,I have been laid off from Broadwing Communications 2 times and have worked there 3 times. They always called me back and they were always unhappy to find me on the layoff list. My wife and child moved back to Houston and eventually I had to follow them.
good,"Towards the end, so many office closures sparked discontent and nervousness.  Prior to that, opportunities for advancement were great."
good,"If you want to develop your skills this is a great place. Loads of  new technology great colleagues."
good,"Manager was great, extremely knowledgable and very supportive when I needed help. Great guidance and ver flexible. Very challenging requirements and changing all the time."
good,"Started through the Ops academy and learned very quickly, though my potential was noticed, it was never utilized. Tried to move to other groups, but its more of a tribal enviroment"
good,"its your typical Call center, there are minor issues that could be addressed but over all it okay place to work and start over. I worked in Collections and the job isnt hard its pretty funny at times"
good,"I was promoted 3 times and was given the pleasure of being a National Account rep.  I traveled to San Francisco, Seattle and also Las Vegas.  My sales partners were very good except for one and he was sent back to engineering."
good,The best and largest telecom company in the South.  Pays well and coworkers are among the best around! The competitive landscape of telecom makes it difficult to enjoy job security.
good,"Very Good company to balance personal and professional life."
good,"Very good company to work for with understanding management, like every IT many departments and many people most of them are collaborative and helpful."
good,"Productive and challenging workplace with great work/life balance."
good,Good Work-Life Balance. Much recommended. Definitely give it a try. Helped me build my necessary skills. Awesome people and a lot of opportunities available within the organization.
good,I am only relocating to be closer to family   The job I did was fun and stressful at times. I work with a lot of great people. That is all I am willing to say at this time.
good,"Though it is usually difficult for all beginners in environment , i thank God for the people i met in this team who tirelessly mentored me as a  fresh as i was in the field . today i can proudly say am a great aspiring dba"
good,You'll be working with customers trying to solve their technical problems. There are a lot of uneducated customers.  They are part of the Union so you can get union benefits which are awesome. There's no guarantee that you'll get a good supervisor. There's educational reimbursement after three months.
good,"It was a great company before Centurylink. A decent company to work for. High turn over. A lot of office politics, instability with upper management, directors and VP's. Communication can be inconsistent and misleading at times."
good,"I spent  nearly 29 years there, so I obviously liked it. I enjoyed the Union/Management interaction.  I had the opportunity to be involved in many conflict resolution situations and gained great perspective"
good,"A typical day at work would be to answer as many inbound calls as possible while concentrating on satisfying the customer and provide them with as much information as possible to understand their bill.  Advised customers of various promotions and services that were available.  I experienced working from home for the first time with the centurylink.  The hardest part of the job was upselling products when the customer is already complaining of their bill.  Working from home I had minimum management and supervision, that was excellent for me.  Being able to have flexibility was the most enjoyable part of the job.  There were always different situations, with every customer, that allowed me the opportunity to utilize my customer service, and problem solving skills."
good,Almost all the managers I've ever worked for at this company have been great. There always seem to be new opportunities if you're willing to work for them.
good,"You get to help people with any issues with their billing and also try and see about possible upgrades to their current packages/setup. Great place if you like to sell, sell, sell!"
good,"Level 3 is a great place to work, but with all of the uncertainty of the coming acquisition things are starting to get very tense.  Raises are rare here, too"
good,"This company actually lets you have a life outside work. There are no freebie like free meals, but if you get to work in shifts, transport is free which is very helpful. Positive work environment and the chance to improve on one self is given at all times."
good,"Family oriented environment with family values in mind, high diversity, culture built with family values in mind, great health benefits, 401k company match, stock options"
good,"Working in any telecom company is very fast paced. In addition, mergers and acquisitions are the norm.   Level 3 was no different.   "
good,"I was given a lot of leeway to create new applications to help solve business problems, or to increase productivity and accuracy for my customers (which were mostly other technical people). I had a great relationship with the people that I worked with in that my focus was always on helping them to do their jobs more efficiently and accurately and with less stress."
good,Many mergers and many layoffs. Loss of talent and more work for those remaining. Most enjoyable part of the job are the people I work with. Hardest part of the job is taking on the work of the 3 people on my team that were laid off.
good,This was a sales position that was very lucrative.  The company kept the atmosphere fun even in a fast paced environment.  Benefits and time off were generous.
good,"Great company to work for, great people.  Always learning new processes or new technology and how it fits into the company.  Great people to work with."
good,"I managed a local retail store where the atmosphere is entirely different from their call centers. For the retail side, the company cannot decide if it wants a corporate model or a local model. The corporate model of upper management dictating everything down to the local level is not productive. The local business model works very well, but only if the local managers are committed to their own success."
good,Overall it was a great experience. Immediate management was pleasant and easy to work with. The atmosphere was not stressful and we cultivated a family within the department. The hardest part of the job was not having the appropriate training tools at times.
good,Nice Place to work and the work environment helps in collabarating with the people and solicit the knowledge as well and disseminate the knowledge and information as well.
good,While I worked here the atmosphere was very relaxed. You will find yourself surrounded by very smart people here. I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,"Great company to work for if you like taking calls from irate customers and then following a script to attempt to appease them. It comes under the heading of IT but you will not be using your skills for anything more than following a script. "
good,"I loved the job but they closed the doors on 9-4-15. I was helping people and they pay was great. I made good hourly and then I made a commission check once a month, I hated they closed their door in Asheboro."
good,I love it but the pay and benefits could be better. The corporate environment is super laid back and you can work from home in some positions. Overall I love it.
good,"Qwest had lots of products in the Inventory and, there was always a product for about 80 percent of customers. The Organization has great Benefits, Health Care is affordable, Employee Visa Credit Card"
good,"You have the opportunity of resolving customer concerns each day. The management is very nice, and there a lot of good perks and incentives to be at the company. If you do not enjoy sales, this is not the position for you."
good,"Great benefits/compensations.  Depending what group you are in, your work/life balance could be very hectic.  I always had to bring my work with me when I am on PTO.  It was non-stop (escalations) and I didn't feel comfortable taking time off.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with.  Although management continued to change the processes/business rules I've learned a lot from the different groups I was in."
good,Enjoyed working closely with the Corporate customers and keeping them updated on the equipment received on a daily bases also solved shipping and receiving problems with their equipment.
good,"Leadership was very helpful, the atmosphere was amazing, lots of perks and prizes for good performance. i would work for this corporation again positively."
good,I quite like working at the stadium.There is a diverse amount of coworkers and plenty of opportunities to improve.  The hardest part is when it gets busy and multitasking is a must.The easy part is when the game is over
good,"Like any large corporation it has its good and bad but for the most part its a pretty good company to work for, lacks diversity in upper management..."
good,"Basically, you have to get the luck of the draw. It is not as fun to work there as it use to be. if you get stuck with late hours, you will stay there, even though they tell you seniority is everything, it isn't."
good,"A typical day for me was troubleshooting user issues and responding to system alarms.  Lots of meetings.  Systems evolving constantly, hard to keep up with documenting everything as things change. Lots of process changes too, just beginning to use the Agile methodology.  Co-workers are great."
good,I have enjoyed my time with Centurylink and would like to continue my career. However the draw of moving back home has become to strong so this is the only reason I am leaving.
good,"I am part of century link family since 01/02/2016, working in a collaborative team will always helpful for fresher. Company follows agile culture and XP engineering practices."
good,Work at Centurylink has been fun and informative. I have learned more about communication and troubleshooting in real world situations.
good,It started as a great work environment. Company made bad investments which affected our sales department. It is a churn and burn place for the people who count the most. The Sales team.
good,A typical day included speaking to several (up to 100) people calling for repair issues with there home or small business telephones.  Some customers were very irate which was my least favorite part of the job.  I acquired the skills to do troubleshooting and at times determined it would be required to send an outside repair technician out.
good,"highly motivated call center, sales environment. In my job I learned effective sales techniques and highly advanced skills. Mgmt was quite driven, yet supportive of exceeding sales objectives. Co-workers were very competitive to meet or exceed required monthly sales objectives. Hardest part of job was the fast paced environment where sales objectives were tied to performance evaluations and job security. Best part of job was the employee support the company provided for stress relief programs and events."
good,"When I was in Operations at US West, it was a great stepping stone to get to where I am today.  Granted Operations work is boreing, for the most part, but it was a good job.  The People it worked with were great, and management was... well management."
good,Nice to place work with a good job culture. Average management and remuneration as well as average prospects for future growth.
good,"The typical day started about two hours before a sporting event with cleaning, stocking, cooking food and preparing the cash register. I learned a little more about movement in really tight quarters. The management was different every event. Overall, good management. Co-workers also switched around but were usually friendly. The hardest part of the job was pouring the beer because the pressure was always fluctuating. The most enjoyable part was the crowd."
good,It is a good place to work and learn. It gave a good start to our career in USA and quite accessible to all the facility in terms of children education and work.
good,"A typical day at work consists of installing and repairing Prism tv. I leave the garage with a full load consisting of about 15+ hours of work to do in an 8 hour day. The days are busy but times flies. Which is not always a good thing. The hardest part of the job is trying to complete a quality install/ repair while staying on schedule to complete the 15+ hours of work in 8 hours. However, its not all bad. I enjoy working on my own and being able to take my lunch and breaks whenever I feel. My co-workers are very helpful. I can always count on someone to answer their phone when I am in need of help or advice. Management is tough. Management does not really understand that it is difficult to balance quality and quantity with the amount of work that the techs leave the garage with."
good,I valued the company's commitment to giving customers good service.  The employees reflected this on a daily basis with the focus on improving efficiency and processes.
good,"Great place to work, lots of opportunities for personal growth. Good mid level managers that strive to better individual teams while maintaining a good work/life balance."
good,Working at CenturyLink was great. Management was always on top of things and i worked with amazing people. I have learned so much by working for CenturyLink and there are many opportunities to move up. Co-Workers were so nice and pleasant to work with. The hardest part of the job was to make your sales goal each month. We were given the right tool.
good,"Worked every day until work reports were completed when possible."
good,"A very challenging and interesting mix of responsibilities.  It was a demanding and rewarding position.  A typical day included coordination/meetings with counter parts such as co-workers and other representatives from pertinent utility company workers, checking in on, advancing and updating steps in each project, and finally working in the field visiting each destination for auditing, identifying, documenting, measuring and assessing new violations."
good,In 2011 Qwest was taken over by Centurylink and this small company still can not figure out how to run the largest provider of fiber optic services .
good,Worked for company for 26 years and was a good place to work.  Headquarters in Monroe LA and Business Operations Center in Denver CO.
good,The company has gotten so big and there is constant change among management and reorganizing departments.  I was impacted by the reduction in force after almost 28 years of service.  I don't miss the work but I do miss the people.  There is not much of an opportunity to advance unless you have a 4-year degree.
good,"great place to work ! had a great time working for this company , great atmosphere and great management to work under. hardest part is dealing with the customers"
good,Assisted in making arrangments for companys to pay bills. Learned different ways to work with difficult people.The hardest part of the job would be dealing with difficult customers.
good,"Great place to work, helpful management and employees. Good work/life balance. Good benefits/perks. Learned many different systems."
good,Work closely with customer to determine design of network and system standardization. Vendor training was provided and installation support
good,"sales competitions, supervisors and marketing make it a fun day with sales goals and challenges, such as, with every 2 sales we get to either put a golf ball, or throw a bean bag in the hole for points."
good,Qwest was a great place to work but CenturyLink acquisition destroyed their culture. CenturyLink culture feels more like a large legacy company than Qwest.
good,"Everyone loves the cable guy but some reason hate the phone tech. Installing telephone service in residential housing was never a dull moment, meeting new people every job and trouble shooting there issues was always a fun task, but with any service provider you sure to meet a few disgruntle customers."
good,"sitting at a computer for long periods of time taking inbound calls,"
good,"Great promotions and contests. Great working hours and flexibility. Effective training and business practices. However, lots of sales and quotas involved, even though I had applied, and was hired as a customer service associate."
good,I enjoy working at century link because as long as you are hard working and driven then everyone gets along with each other.
good,"I enjoyed this job. Many different people you work with, and opportunities to learn different aspects of the job. Steady 40 hour work week. Management was hard to work for."
good,Had positive experience working at Centurylink. The people were great and the exposure to new technologies was informative.
good,"Level 3 Communications has grown substantially in the last decade.  I personally went through 6 mergers, each with baggage that exists to this day.  The people I worked with are all terrific, and I was truly impressed with the professionalism and knowledge base that the employees there possess.  The mergers have each carried their own set of unique problems and rewards, but as these began to pile up, the overall culture slowly changed.  The biggest negative I can attach to the company is that is has grown too big.  It no longer can nimbly dance around the lumbering giant competitors, and has instead taken its place among the slow monoliths.  Still, you'll work hard to find a better company to work for.  I really enjoyed my time there."
good,"There are some good and some not so good things about CenturyLink. I've been here for nearly two years and one of the best things about where I am is the environment of the office. Generally speaking management is pretty laid back. Everyone has numbers to hit but they're not down you're throat shoving down heavy doses of quota. We have a really fair amount of freedom. You're not tied to any any time restrictions other than you need tot be in by 8:30(ish) and no leaving before 5. But if you've got a cool manager as long as you let them know, you're good and if you're at or above quota, they won't say a thing. There are some drawbacks though, the comp plan is complete BS, you sell products with no guarantee that they will be installed and if they don't install, you don't get paid. The product line is tough to learn at first and even then they're complex products with a number of moving parts. This is what makes the job just okay. Overall though if you're looking for a solid company to work for CenturyLink is solid...just not a place where you'll be for long because there are better options."
good,"Management and benefits is good. Most coworkers are friendly, very informative company, very concerned with the employee wellness and overall health."
good,"Centurylink is poising itself to be a major player in the high speed internet and television markets. They have gone through a lot of mergers in the past 5 or 6 years, and have had a lot of reorganizations. My time here has taught me much about databases and the telecommunications industry."
good,"I have great latitude in the decision of work to be completed for the day. Computer work involving job management, and completion. My supervisor shows great trust in my decision making capabilities, and project management skills. I work alone with a lot of responsibilities, in maintaining continuity in the services of our customers."
good,Management can be somewhat unflexable when dealing with personal (health) issues
good,"Working at Level 3 is different than any of my other opportunities, the culture is good; the management team empower the employees, and encourage feedback. Level 3 provides the training and tools you need to be successful. I have learned a lot about the products and services, and really enjoy the customers. My co-workers are always eager to assist, and that is the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"Was a great place to work, Unlimited earning potential.Best benefits package I had ever seen."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job"
good,"Assisted customers with billing issues, selling products company offered.."
good,"Working at CenturyLink was a great experience, the employees were friendly, and helpful, and the supervisors were very understanding and helpful as well. The job itself was not so hard, the hardest thing n about the job was dealing with irate customers. Most of the customers were older and had been with the company for awhile, so they were used to the old way of doing things and weren't to happy with the changes that the company made. I learned how to de-escalate irate customers and how to empathize with people to get them in a better mood so they would feel like talking and finding a solution and maybe even making a purchase. The most difficult part of the job was waiting until the end of the month to get paid for our sales. The sales weren't being counted on the biweekly paycheck, so it would be a full month and we would have to keep track of our sales to make sure that the compensation was correct. there were also metrics put in place to monitor call length, and if the calls went too long there would be a coaching session. If the long call resulted in a sale, the employee would still get talked to and told to expedite the call, no matter how happy the customer was with the service they received or how long winded they were as a result of the sale.The best part of the job was when a customer called that was calm and allowed you to help them. By the end of the call the customer was happy, feeling like they got something accomplished, and that left me feeling like I reached someone and actually helped them. That was a great feeling. There was always a raffle of a giveaway for"
good,"Interacted with all employees on a daily basis"
good,"I worked in several different groups, learned alot, got to meet new long lasting friends."
good,CenturyLink is a stable company with good work life balance.
good,"only worked on the weekend and it was a decent job for my age at the time, just not enough pay for everything we have to do."
good,"A typical day at work consists of customer communication, repair and installation of voice and DSL service. Customer consultation is required to ensure the customer receives the best product and service. "
good,"The typical days are spent configuring, testing, and activating  customer circuits "
good,Great place to work until the corporation was found to be misstating it's financial reporting. This greatly reduced the stock values and the company suffered for years and cause many people to be laid off as a result.
good,Salary and benefits are competitive.  Constant reorganization of departments since merger creates a unsettling environment.
good,"Global Company and a great place to work."
good,"Overall a good company.Good people around. Friendly managers."
good,worked with highly skilled co-worker and management. weather could and did hamper work from time to time. Enjoyable customer contact.
good,There is a lot to like about CenturyLink however be prepared for frustration as well. The company is working hard to merge the Qwest and CenturyTel companies and the result often isn't pretty.
good,"Support over 1300 users across the US. Spend the day on the phone fixing things, imaging computers, and running around the home office."
good,"company is moving to contractors. as per my management ""there isnt a long future here with us."""
good,Loved working for Qwest. Treated there people great. I would work for them again.
good,"Current department (NROC), its a busy place.. Enjoy the work, enjoy the amount of work, just ready to move up to a higher position."
good,"CTL has good benefits, they treat their people well, but they have high productivity requirements in sales. If you are gifted at selling this is a good job for you. It requires a sense of professional aggression to accomplish the sales goals set for you. "
good,Highly competitive company in a commodity industry with small margins.  Tasks was to grow new services to increase revenues and margins.
good,i am having a wonderful journey with CTL. i joined as a fresher now i know multiple technologies.
good,Took calls throughout the day and learned amazing customer service skills. Supervisors only cared about themselves and not the customers. Hardest part of the job was hitting the retention rate of 78% that was required. The most enjoyable part of the job was being the top salesman and getting MVP 2 months in a row. 
good,"Long days of work, great pay, just away from family a lot. Has its days but I look forward everyday being at work because I put pride into what I do"
good,lots to learn and good work life balance. good to learn of telecom and networking topics. how services are activated and monitored and how different devices work
good,"My job was very stressful, but the kind where you know you are helping someone have a better day because of it. I learned how to actively manage my time to get the most customers helped efficiently. I had great co-workers who were always ready to lend a helping hand, and give advice. The best part of my job was people showing genuine gratitude and knowing that I helped to the best of my ability."
good,Customer service. This job taught my to appreciate differences in others. My manager D. Butcher was 5 star! Most enjoyable was the satisfaction of giving my customers what they were asking for: their request with respect.
good,"Schedule based on seniority, could get the late shift for over a year. Good training. not focused on customer service. You could have poor performance on every metric, but good sales and keep your job. Most everyone is friendly."
good,I was surplused after 28 years of service.
good,A very great job to work for with great potential for advancement and growth.
good,"A typical day at work for me meant taking calls and giving information to customers regarding their account, when their payments were due and if any changes needed to be made. As well, taking payments from customers, and restoring their service. I learned to be patient with customers who were no cooperative. I also learned a lot about customer service as well. Management consisted of team leaders, who were the supervisors for a certain part of a department. your team leader were the person you were directed to regarding any questions about the job, or any other work related questions. Co-workers were very friendly and fun to work with. The hardest part of my job was trying to deal with angry customers, and still maintaining professionalism to portray my company as a good company. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with many different types of customers, and learning how to satisfy customer needs."
good,Responsible for expanding existing market share with customers by up selling the entire CenturyLink portfolio of products and services.
good,"A typical day at my current employment is handling new clients for outside sales representatives and maintaining accounts for current businesses that have high spending contracts. During my 13 year tenure I have learned that the customer is the main priority, regardless of what may be happening within the business itself. Management within my company works very hard to keep a balance of production while holding company values. My co-workers are very family oriented, and each employee assist one another to maintain the core values within the company. The hardest part of my job is that there is so much information and change just to keep up in the telecommunications industry. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to make decisions that are business affecting; which in turn keeps a happy client."
good,Qwest was a great employer but is no longer a company. The benefits were great but the department I worked in there was no real place for advancement.
good,"A typical day at CenturyLink includes collaboration with various teams to align CenturyLink's products and services with with our enterprise customer requirements. The teams includes Account Director, Service managers, client support manager, solution architect, Identifying and managing solutions that add immediate value is very rewarding. The culture at CenturyLink has always been one of support."
good,I love the ability to work remote. You have to be great work structure to be able to work remotely. My position doesn’t have a lot of supervision and you can wait for awhile to get responses to questions.
good,"Great being on steam, good benefits and hours.  Just wish there wasn't so much issues with billing and third party company sales. Many unhappy customers and no solutions."
good,A typical Review and process internal customer work orders from receipt to delivery to end user and then posting shipping and receiving  Hardest part was dealing with incorrect work orders from internal customers. Get satisfaction from aiding internal customers meet deadline needs to external customers even though they were not often realistic.
good,"A company in transition with the acquisition and then take over by Level 3"
good,Never work weekends or holidays.  Great pay great benefits and a great product . Best internet on the market and even tho you get no discounts for being an employee you do get free home phone service!
good,"Company has good benefits"
good,"Report to office update weekly and monthly forecasts"
good,"Never boring, always something going on. Treated fairly and with great support and little to no micromanaging as well as faith in your capabilities. Skills growth and physical activity, with no stagnation. A huge plus if you’re a football/soccer fan as well as other top notch events."
good,I worked for CenturyLink for a few years.  It's definitely a company you can retire from if you put in hard work.  Once in a position they will give you lots of training for that position.  It's difficult to move up in a short amount of time.  Most positions require at least 2-5 years before you can move up or laterally.
good,"Sales,sales,sales, even if your hired as a customer service rep you better be ready to sell or find a new job, busy almost all day, pays pretty good so was comission and spiffs"
good,"The Management structure is good. The work is challenging and very interesting."
good,"There wasn’t enough training for the job, shortly after training your put on the floor with limited to minimum help. Although it was a great working environment and management was nice."
good,most managers in tech support dept could did not know how to help with tech issues.  Understaffed in many states. When CL bought Quest they bought an operation that had a lot of old cables and etc.  This was causing very long times for repairs
good,"Great Job Culture"
good,"The company itself has alot of great benefits, its the customers that are so bad you dont want to be there. I would recommend not making it a long term job as it burns you out badly."
good,"I worked at the Helpdesk, Tier1/2 support.  Fast paced, and very little downtime.  Centurylink is top heavy and bonus and merit increases were minimal towards the end.  My office was outsourced to a India company after 17 years of dedicated service."
good,I enjoyed all the bonus and gifts that were offered in the sale department.  It was fun and fast paced.  Local markets involved travel 70-80 percent of the time.
good,"This is a nice place to work, with a nice canteen spread over two floors. Car cParking is a problem here and if you are not in by 8.30 you will have to walk up the road 10  mins"
good,"One of the best jobs I ever had. I loved my management team, my support staff and my colleagues. It was an exciting atmosphere, good pay, good benefits and an opportunity to learn, grow and advance my career"
good,I really enjoyed the work environment. I was a consistent top performer in sales and have won many awards for my excellent achievements including the annual circle of Excellence
good,"Centurylink was full of opportunity and advancement for me.  I enjoyed every step that I took and every person that I worked with. They sent me to other states to train and even to another country, but it was hard to watch the constant turn over and unforeseen change.  In the eight and a half years that I worked with, I saw hundreds of people come in and out.  I worked with about 15 new hire classes and it was always a struggle to get the time required to prepare them properly.  If I had the ability to stay in my role, I would have for as long as it lasted, but in January, I was given my two week notice when they decided to lay off 176 leads across the nation.  The process is never fair and for someone that had dedicated their entire professional career to becoming the best call center leader possible, it came as quite a surprise, that I am not quite over.  A typical day will include a lot of stress.  The customers are normally quite frustrated, either by the long wait it takes to get to someone or over an unresolved issue.  Most of the technology is antiquated and there are better options out there, but I loved every minute of it."
good,"workday is stable , management is ok , never get comfortable cause always laying off  been back and forth for 10 years off and on , not going back need to stay in one place , people are always in bad moods due to so manyprocess changes that happen"
good,I was afforded the ability at CenturyLink to be promoted and recognized for my hard work and dedication.  Management is flexible with workplace and family life.
good,"I worked in a call center / NOC environment for business customers, we provided repair support across the country remotely, using a multitude of Vendors to include Cisco, Juniper, RAD, Alcatel Lucent, Ciena, Calix, Etc. and operated in a 24/7 365 environment. hardest part of the job was broken processes that made helping the customer more difficult than it should have been, and most enjoyable part of the job was that even after 4 years of working there the network was so large and diverse that there was something new to learn everyday."
good,Great company filled with good people.  I work with  people from technician to Senior Vice President daily and all are outstanding individuals.  Lots of opportunity for advancing for those who are willing to prove themselves
good,"A typical workday is fast-paced, prospecting, learning and working through complex systems to get things done. I learned all kinds of new technologies and things to sell and how to sell. The workplace culture is a collaborative one and the hardest part of the job is navigating though all the complex systems in a process from so many company acquisitions. The most enjoyable part of the job was selling a successful solution that is implemented on time and correctly helping customers achieve their goals."
good,"Technical fast paced, Good job with a lot of resources to aid you in your goal of customer satisfaction. Good pay and some times stressful but over all a good place to be."
good,"a typical day at work will include handling 10 different busy Queues, processing orders for new and existing customer, handling supervisor escalations."
good,"At the time I was there, it was a very good place to work with good job security. Challenging work in Wholesale Markets call center environment. Great"
good,Manage day to day operations for nationwide telecommunications network.  It is a union environment with a delicate balance of productivity and complacency.
good,Great Company.  in 10 years I was promoted from an analyst to Director.  It is a good company to work.  I was able to work on many issues and gain a wealth of knowledge.
good,Delivers what they promise has potential for improvement. Though a good place to grow and develop skills to continue skills. Offers structure and stability that will allow for an individual to grow.
good,It was a terrific place to work. The right people are hired and promoted into management positions. The people are friendly and open to new points of view.
good,"Able to advance from collector and technical writer to team management and then trainer manager over 3 training teams."
good,"A typical day at work involves many emails to review, research, and reply to.  I manage several daily, weekly, and monthly reports, that keep me busy.  "
good,"Working this job has taught me how to communicate with customers, take in detail, and how to be persuasive. This was one of my favorite first few jobs."
good,Nice place and most of people are friendly and most of the job from the book and you get every help you need and they train you in moderate pace so you can pick it up easily
good,ive been here for 4 yrs and its a good place to work good money benefits and great time off open to close for parents. they have two tv rooms for you chillin
good,"In the past, CenturyLink was a great place to work, but due to recent management changes (Level 3 merger), it has become a frustrating environment. They have lost the 'human element' through growth."
good,"The culture was open and friendly.  The management gave everyone opportunity for advancement. The intranet had a wealth of information and training.  SalesForce was the main tool I used, and when I first started I did not know how to use it. With dedication and focus, I taught myself how to use it, as well as using the training."
good,"Pre-merger, Savvis/CenturyLink was a great place to work.  Post merger, there was little direction from upper management, and a lack of trust from much of the workforce.  Eventually, this lead to morale issues, and ultimately lead to much of the experienced staff to leave the company or look elsewhere.  "
good,I have been with CenturyLink for 24 years and met amazing people. Centurylink is going through a significant change right now and I hope they are successful.
good,"answer phone calls. sale internet service, phone cable and cell phone. bilingual center. manager very helpfull. gain a lot of knowledge of sales and call center."
good,"Very competitive pay for the area, relaxed professional atmosphere, self-paced work speed, nice friendly people, relaxed management philosophy, decent benefits."
good,Was unimpressed with the professionalism of one of my managers. Lacked tact and was very cold when a question would present itself. Enjoyed most of the individuals. Worked with escalation calls. Even though stressful enjoyed work. Had to leave due to heal issues. I'm diabetic.
good,This experience was very productive and fun work.  Opportunities for advancement are great especially with the recent acquiring of Level 3 communications.
good,"The customers will be your undoing if you can't keep a cool head. They will lie, swear, yell and accuse you personally and the company of many things. You can't let it get to you. Someone who would spend 2 hours on the phone arguing about a $5 difference in their bill obviously just wants attention."
good,"Great place to work "
good,Productive and fun place to work great team and respect the staff are really helpful to other just they dont paid enough and no benefits it just by call
good,"Great team to work for, while at the company I created a real good work/office culture. Great groups to work with, everyone was so helpful and willing to go the extra mile to assist. Everyday was a pleasure to be there, no down side of my position."
good,Days at Centurylink are self paced. You must be able to push yourself and run your own inside sales business. There are stress relievers such as ping pong and a basketball arcade. Lunch times aren't monitored and you have to monitor your own sales in order to confirm that you get paid. CenturyLink has acquired several different companies or employees so the fact that some of these systems do not communicate with each other can grow frustrating. Outside of that management is supportive and there are several things that the Apopka office does to keep employees happy.
good,"Not a bad place to work. Fairly laid back. Work is steady, but rarely stressful. Difficult to stand out. Leadership often disconnected from workforce. Exactly what you would expect from a company with several thousand employees."
good,"Pretty good place to work, I started with embarq and went through the Centurylink transformation.  Management could use some improvements but heck everything does right?  I went contracting for last 5 years or so and now hoping to get rehired with Centurylink."
good,I enjoyed the 6 years I worked at CenturyLink. I started as a contract employee and converted to full time after 1 year. I learned a lot while there and saved the company a large sum of money on my most recent very large project.
good,Good family/life balance. Provided 24/7 support and very dedicated. Company was good about allowing for optional time off when heavy deadlines were met.
good,Not much advancement opportunity. My management team was very helpful and hands off. They would always back me up. The learning center had great information.
good,Not much advancement opportunity. My management team was very helpful and hands off. They would always back me up. The learning center needs to be updated. The classes were sometimes a few years behind with the OS systems we were using.
good,"I have worked from home nearly 20 years. I am trusted to manage and prioritize my day with minimum supervision. I coordinate meetings with the sales teams, customers,,, I manage customer contracts for compliance. I check status of of orders to install/move/change/disconnect services as initiated by the customer"
good,"Greta place to work,. but due to a merger in 01/2018, there have been rolling lay-offs affecting a lot of departments.   In 6 months to a year, then I'd recommend the company again. "
good,"Overall a great company to work for!  Compensation and benefits a plus.  Steady work pace with modern technology, working in the real estate and finance arena for them was a great time!"
good,Workplace environment is supportive of collaboration across many skill levels. The company has a competitive benefits package and continually strives to outperform its previous marks of performance.
good,A typical day at work would include many hours of sitting at my desk waiting for a customer ticket.  The occasional hard drive or memory replacement.  The occasional network cabling installation.
good,"The benefits of working at centurylink are great. The health insurance is amazing, the paychecks are great, but if you need time off if you have kids and they're sick, you will be punished for it. I ended up needing to go home because someone violated the no diffuser policy and I had an allergic reaction to it, and I was almost fired for it. Great vibe from the company though."
good,CenturyLink was a wonderful corporation to advance my skill set.  They provided me with the ability to make my own decisions and schedule.  With the RIF that is currently underway this company seems to be faltering.  I can only hope the new CEO can right this ship!
good,"Typical day: Challenging and never the same. "
good,"CencuryLink is a great place to work.The work environment is lovely and the encouraging."
good,I enjoyed working a Centurylink which was formerly Level3.  I worked from home so it allowed me a lot of availability.  I would recommend working at Centurylink.
good,"Typical day exist of assisting client's with their billing, ordering problem solving. Ordered supplies from vendors. Worked with peer training and assisting them. I learned to listen to my client and try to fulfill their needs as best as I could. I stepped in as worked in charge as my supervisor would need me. This was a very multi culture environment. There actually were not any hard parts of the day. I just did my job. The most joyful time of the day was working with my peers."
good,"Worked with the  erate team, RFP team, legal and management meeting with new and exciting customers. Cold calling and warm leads. Worked closely with all the high leave C's as well as decision makers. "
good,"Was a god company to work for. The company provided decent year end bonuses, and the work vehicle was a big plus. I would have recommended people to the company, until CLN took over."
good,"Great pay, will always get a minimum of 40 hours, Maura cw is expensive and seems to go up every time our union contract gets ratified. Overall very good job"
good,"I have worked with CenturyLink for 2 years and they are a great company to work for. Management is supportive, environment is relaxed and the company is good aboit listening to its employees in an effort to better the company inside and out"
good,The company was great. Merged with CenturyLink. Level 3 was a great place to work. Laid back environment. Comfortable. my onboarding was choppy at best.
good,"Great place to work, focus on developing each employee skill set. They invest into their employees. Great compensation plan. They care of the ROI of their employees"
good,"Century Link has been one of the client of our's and it's been really fun to work for Century Link while associated with Tech Mahindra."
good,"This was a great work from home job!!  The excellent customer service and systems training was above par.  Loved working from home,  Century provided excellent tools and resources."
good,Good training but needed more for most employees. Employees generally loved each other that worked in the field; helped each other. Mass overtime as a Cable Repair Tech/Network Tech.
good,"Great core values, customer always first, very respectful company, and extremely technical and expert personnel. We have fun monthly activities, team building, and small award systems in place for performance."
good,"Fun and competitive professional environment. Good team and great communication and accountability. Benefits are pretty solid. I worked with energetic and professional managers. Driven upper management."
good,Company positioned to take advantage of streaming media boom.  Telecommunications company with a streaming media company's focus on technology .  Consistently among the top 3 CDNs
good,"Overall Centurylink is a good job; however, some of the supervisors can make the job difficult. A typical day at work is to clock in and bring up all of your applications ti get ready to assist the customers."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was getting it done and being recognized for the effort.  Bosses treated you with respect and as a person.  Something that has been lost over the years.
good,"Worked from home. Schedule work day according to assigned tasks. Preformed preventive maintenance on monthly schedule. On call 24/7. Conduct site audits for engineering projects. Receive project material and provide shortage reports. Also ship, receive and inventory failed and repaired equipment / modules. Install, test and commission transport equipment. Complete FOC testing on OSP fibers. Turn up and trouble shoot DSO through 400G circuits."
good,"Good place to work.  I would like to stay however my job is changing and commuting is not an option for me.  Not enough training, you need to be resourceful or a fast and competent learner."
good,"My background is Level 3 which is a very network-focused company.  Our objectives were to provide network services primarily to customers by displacing or augmenting legacy carriers such as Verizon, ATT, Sprint.  Excellent focus on network - which led to longterm customer satisfaction."
good,"This place has good and bad. It is definitely a company that has helped me grow as a person. The best part of the job is the people I work with, best people I have ever worked with. Worst part is all the politics, hope you liked high school. I learned how to discipline myself in regards of wanted to do a job and do a job well. This job has put me in my place many times and to be quite honest I need that from time to time. Overall, if you're looking to grow as a person and have a company grow on you, this is the place to work. Benefits and pay are great, they treat you well here."
good,"the company is product base, they have there internal project to work no pressure during the work. you can balance you work life and professional life here. the company culture is good. some of facilities are really good in Centurlink like mobile bills, transport."
good,"working at centurylink is good i joined here as a fresher 6 months back,but now job is not secure."
good,CTL is a class organization.  I thought the culture was encouraging.  The work days were long with a lot to learn.  Expect a learning curve of 18 months but in sales don't let that stand in your way of making quota.  With the merger of Level 3 I am not certain that the culture will remain the same.
good,"I come from a heritage company, but the pace is pretty fast and the pressure to produce in short timelines can be stressful.  However, I dont know of many successful companies that arent like that to some degree."
good,"I was blessed with having excellent sales people who performed tremendously. The travel was a bit of ""killer"" being about 80% of the time up and down the East Coast. The company, at the time, was caught up in the telecom mergers and anticipated it too to be purchased by one of the others or vise-versa. Their cable for the internet was superior to any in the industry with a great strategy of putting it down paralleling the railroad. Unfortunately, there was a major investigation at the very top with the CEO, who fled the country to never return. it trickled down to everyone and made growth very difficult."
good,"Centurylink is a fun place to work, but they are behind the curve with their competitors. They are slow to innovate and get new products to the market."
good,"productive, high demand internet, TV and phone company. great company to work for to start a career in customer service. great for young people with no kids .company normally offers lots of overtime."
good,"CenturyLink was stressful but definitely rewarding. Your success was totally up to you. Great people and great compensation. Sales heavy, which was what caused me to leave but definitely fair."
good,"I would get to work and sign into my computer and you would here a ding in your ear and that was when your day started. You would get calls from our customers about billing or potential new customers and you would set up new services. You have a quota you had to meet, so sometimes the job was stressful. Working for century link was good at times they had a lot of contest and also a lot of bbq's for the employees."
good,"I was responsible for the monthly close and financial statement preparation of six  international companies.  This included making sure monthly account reconciliations were completed,  journal entry preparation and other projects.  Each day usually including working on one or more of these tasks.  "
good,"Good company, great team of knowledgeable people, good positive attitude on the part of many who work there, including the management and staff members."
good,"Management was often not in the same state. Had no idea of work being done by help desk, and most times, did not care."
good,"This employer offers great benefits, the pay is a little mediocre for the amount of call volume and call types that are handled. You must have  tough skin and patience to endure each call."
good,"I would train new employees, have daily meetings with the financial account managers.I would handle customers financial accounts and sales accounts. Very fast paced and long hours."
good,"Working with cutting edge technologies, diverse culture,. Vendor training on leading technology. Interaction with customers and third party vendors were positive."
good,I think that we need to re-organize management. Not a lot of room for growth. Management should be more diverse. I think the pay could be a little better. It is an overall great experience and a great company to work for. They will will lose a lot of great and educated  people. We cant move up.
good,"* Learned to work with various small teams to achieve goals in rapidly-changing company."
good,Excellent training and management is always available to help.  They kind of throw you into the deep end after training to see if you have what it takes.
good,"Work life balance, New LEarnings"
good,Overall the company is a good one to work for as most managers will work with you to advance you along in your career.  There are many good benefits at the company such as up to $600 in additional rewards for using the supplementary health programs.
good,I advanced from a rep in the residential sales center to a screener in the DSL repair center to a supervisor and was a Senior Account Executive in Large Business Sales when I left. I was treated fairly and well compensated.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my job. There were a lot of good people. The drive for more productivity adversely affected the plant, I believe. I don't know if or how the merger with century changed things. I was retirement eligible so i didn't hang around to see."
good,"Typical office job.  Has many perks, time off, good insurance etc.  Convenient location in downtown Omaha.  Management does listen to concerns and addresses concerns."
good,I get to work 15-20 minutes early every day. So I can be ready to log in all my screens and start on time. I enjoy help customers and other employee's with updates. I try to take my breaks and lunches on time and mingle with other employee's to keep up with any changes. I try reading company website to see how we as a company is doing.
good,I personally loved working with my co-workers! they were awesome! I would get their around 830 and log in to my systems around 845 to go online. we fielded around 75 calls a day and most of the sales work was easy.
good,"The Company offers a very calm and comfortable Environment for all it's Employees. The Work Pressure is hardly faced sometime once in a year or may be not. The Client is the same company placed is the US. So, this is like working for it's own company. "
good,"Love my Management team fantastic Local experience, but overall still major corporation. The job itself was pretty normal for a NOC job. The pay was lower on average than other companies."
good,"I was surrounded by some of the most talented professionals I've met in my 20+ year career.  My manager was firm but fair; his manager was the same.  I was given freedom to try new things, and held accountable for my performance."
good,"I worked here as a call center rep. I was originally hired as a retention specialist, however after about 6 months they told us that retention was no longer existent at that office and that we would need to find a new job or take a pay cut and become an inbound rep. This involved a large pay cut in commissions as well as hourly and our hours increased to about 10-15 hours of mandatory overtime as well. My manager was the best though, he stuck up for us with every single thing that we did not agree with as far as procedures and Metrics we had to hit."
good,Growing into a globally robust managed services technology provider.  Good leadership and open door communications. Alot of longevity and tenure exists here.
good,"Working at CenturyLink taught me a lot. It allowed me to grow and exceed, and also has provided for many opportunities. "
good,I started my career at CenturyLink when it was U S West in 1996!  Spent many years growing and learning.  Recently left to pursue other avenues but would recommend CenturyLink to anyone wanting to start an adventure in Telecom!
good,"Each morning upon arrival work was waiting for me. Very busy and many customers to handle with needs and complaints. The management never would say good morning just look the other way and ignore us."
good,I enjoyed working for this company for many years. I learned a lot in the two positions I held from advanced technical support to creating metrics.
good,"Mountain LTD communicates well with employees, and has a reliable, easy to use timekeeping system.  The representatives of Mountain LTD made the onboarding process easy."
good,"Typical day had many interruptions and ""fire drill"" situations which over time makes it exhausting to continually having to refocus on the important work, which there is a lot.  Management would question your commitment to your work if you worked less than 12 hours a day."
good,"This was a great place to work. They had competitive pay with bonuses. They took care of their employees. They worked hard to help the employees when it came to anything. I learned a lot from this company. The people were great. What I liked most about this job, the ability to make extra money for my hard work"
good,Great experience in a work environment that has many challenges.  Friendly coworkers who actually care about each other and their families.
good,"My review, is that I went through 5 re-organizations in 5 years.  CenturyLink is a telco without a mobile play.  They then bought many companies and have done a real bad job in intergrating the companies that they have gobbled up."
good,"A typical work day was taking 80 to 100 customer sales and service calls from a cubicle in a call center. The list of things I learned is far too long to be written in a short review. Management: the reason this only got three stars is due to management was constantly changing so consistency was challenging. Job security also only got three stars because is you look at the dates I worked here, the Recession began in October of 2008 and by April of 2009 I was downsized without being subject to recall. My co-workers were great, again, large diversity culturally, gender, ethically, education, family situations were all unique. The hardest part of the job was the constant policy/requirement changes especially in terms of the monitoring of calls. I believe if they would have been slightly more flexible on the monitoring many representatives could have ""saved"" more customers from cancelling or disconnecting their entire service or making better sales. The most enjoyable part was just talking to the customers, from all over the country, hearing their stories, even the ""difficult"" calls could be interesting and satisfying."
good,"login to my pc station at 2 pm "
good,The employees are great to work with.  A lot of team work involved here.  Made many life long friendships.  Local Management supports employees. Enjoyed working with the employees and retirees providing HR support.
good,"Taking payments for services.  Starting and cancelling services for customers.  Adjusting bills and giving credits.  I learned a lot a bout how an inbound call center works.  The management team were very helpful and great.  The people I worked with were amazing and very helpful.  The hardest part was the sales quotes. The most of the customers, most of the co-workers, all of management and the money I earned."
good,A typical day at work would be assisting customers with any technical issues that they have with their television and internet services. I've learned patience and I've learned how to find several routes to handle an issue if one troubleshooting step doesn't work for the customer. The hardest part of the job is that you're constantly seated for hours. I like to be active and up and moving. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I had great coworkers and I really enjoyed when I was able to leave customers satisfied with our services.
good,"At Centurylink technologies India Pvt. Ltd emphasis is always on enchaining employees skills, Every year minimal one professional certification is mandatory."
good,CenturyLink hires motivated people who are able to work independently. We are allowed to work 1 day a week from home and are paid above market.
good,"My typical day is to install carrier telecommunication circuits, troubleshoot servers, and project manage orders. I have learned all aspects of fiber and provisioning from start to finish. I have worked with every Long Haul and Local Loop Carrier in the state. I have extensive knowledge in service delivery and provisioning/activation. I understand how to speck out and install all types of structured cabling. I also troubleshoot servers and switches. My expertise has given me several awards and recognition over the years of employment."
good,"Good place to gain experience"
good,"Before it became Centurylink, the place and pay was good and I love my job. The people I worked around was very nice and the managers let you talk, as long as your work was done."
good,"I enjoyed working for CenturyLink and would have continued to work for them if the work would have stayed in Denver, Colorado and not moved to Salt Lake City, Utah.  We generally worked an 8-10 hour day and as a team we were extremely successful at meeting company and customer needs. "
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew and it was more difficult to get to know the new people. There was a lot of variety in what I did each day, ranging from the monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting"
good,One of the best places to work for. Helpful management and coworkers. Flexibility to explore multiple options to find the suitable fit.
good,"Centurylink is a great place to work.  Lots of promos and positive energy.  Management is very proficient.  The bad part of the job is the stress.  It is a very demanding job, with no leeway for less than great performance as a rep."
good,"Work can be somewhat repetitive but its an very good environment. Immediate management is attentive to your needs to help make you meet and exceed your quota. They care, which makes a huge difference."
good,"A company with tremendous tools and potential.  They have the assets to dominate in the business market.  The people make the difference for this company, where the legacy systems fail.  Good place to be."
good,A typical day was inbound calls from old or new customers calling about their service. They may be calling to complain or upgrade. I learned something new every day because you never knew who was going to call least long what they would say. Every call was different so for me that made the job more fun. Co workers was funny to because sometime they would share their calls and we could all laugh together. The hardest part of the job was not being able to please every customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was that we had floor gifts and we was always trying for them and I won a flat screen television once.
good,"I joined as fresher to this company. this company provided me lot opportunity to enhance my career to higher level."
good,"The Company hired over 3000 people from the Boise, Id area with a promise of full-time longterm employment, and laid all but 250 off 5 months later"
good,"A typical day at work is taking back to back calls from agents and customers. I learned how to better my skills as a customer service representative and multitask in multiple software operations. My co-workers and direct leadership team was the best! The hardest part about the job is finding a mental balance.  Because the call volume was so high, it's hard to regroup between calls.  The calls were essentially apologizing to the customer about the mistreatment from initial contact to current, on an customer escalation call.  The calls from agents, were pretty great because you were assisting an agent with navigating the operations or analyzing the situation and providing a resolution."
good,"A typical day was very fast pace and competitive"
good,"I start off by checking our BMS database followed by our ticketing systems. If there are no high probity tickets I then preform visual rounds to ensure that all systems are normal and the BMS is correct. I then address any tickets in the ques. Since starting in the department I have learned about electrical systems, HVAC both water and air cooled. The management has been some of the best I have ever worked for in both job and schooling guidance. I work with a good team and information and cooperation is shared and given across all three shifts. The hardest part of the job can be when there is an expedited change made during a build out and fitting into the given time frame. The most enjoyable part is when that change is made or a system may fail and rising to the challenge to make the change and repair the system."
good,It was challenging yet fun. Learned something new everyday. Willing to train me in an area I knew nothing about. Friendly atmosphere.
good,"I thought Level 3 Communications was a great company to work for. Flexible when it came to needing time off for family or personal concerns. Working with others in a team environment was an enjoyable experience and I learned a lot about network design, hardware, needs of business and coordinating calls with CFO's, CIO's to help them create more efficiency to cut costs and maintain or improve quality of their network. There were several acquisitions while I was there and keeping legacy systems in place while managing these acquisitions through different stages was very challenging across all departments. The CEO seemed genuinely involved and was always visiting on site to learn more about processes, listened to employees voice concerns about system limitations, ability to deliver customers the product they were seeking on a scale they could manage, etc."
good,Then managers and co workers were often great to work with.  They were all friendly and helpful. Its this kind of surroundings that made it  easy to keep going when things got tough.
good,Great management and staff. Its a hard job but it is very rewarding. You really can grow within the company and make alot of money.
good,"The work load for this company was decent paced not to fast I just wish I could have stay there long enough to be more of a benefit to the company. The manager I worked under was actually very smart and very fair about what he needed and wanted and was helpful to us provided we did what he asked of us. I wish it offered better health benefits and I wish that the security for the Job was better, because the turn over rate is really high there."
good,"While the job was very enjoyable and fulfilling, the company seemed  less concerned with customer service than should be for a service company. Supervisors were not promoted on qualifications, no given supervisory training. Too often customers are not properly cared for. Employees concerns were rarely listened to, and employee needs rarely considered. The hardest part of the job was seeing customers not getting the service they were paying for and expecting in a timely manner."
good,"a typical day would be getting on the phones and taking calls from customers about billing questions."
good,nice place to work friendly environment lots of compensation in sales  managers really want you to succeed very down to earth center manager
good,"As the main point of contact, a typical day would be to  get a telecoms service through the cycle from sales to handover solving any issues along the way. Understanding a learning new technologies such as SDH/Ethernet and MPLS. Other additional skills would be teaching and improving internal process to make like easier if possible.  I enjoying solving issues and making progress  to achieve exception customer satisfaction. I’m a very customer focused person and that for me would be the most enjoyable aspect of the current job."
good,Production support of telephony billing system posed many difficulties with the varied customer products available.  Research necessary as to how some products were designed in order to maintain customer satisfaction.
good,Great place to be if your job is in production mode.  Management is knowledgeable top to bottom.  Compensation is not as competitive as industry peers.
good,"I enjoyed working at CenturyLink.  Great products.  Great sales engineers.  Great teamwork. Enjoyed the challenge of contacting customers, building rapport, discovering needs, understanding the business goals and objectives that the customer was trying to achieve and providing solutions for data, internet and voice in order to meeting and exceeding these goals. Awesome sales training."
good,I would go back if given the opportunity. had many responsibities. Trust with multi million dollar equipment. Was always learning something new.
good,"Good team, Agile Technologies involved. Talented people to work."
good,"This was a great job with a great group of people. I learned how to review and provide feedback, write better training, and how to analyze and redesign existing curricula. I was offered a generous severance package and a chance to see what else I could do."
good,"In a typical day I accessed multiple systems to asset my customers with problems they had in regards to services and billing concerns. I learned at this job multitasking and helping customers with problems. Management was helpful in finding a resolve to problems. My co workers were helpful and I could go to them with questions for assistance if needed.  The hardest part of the job, not being able to get answers to questions I had from the help desk in a timely fashion. The most enjoyable part was having a customer that was upset at the being of a call and at the end telling me that I was the only person that listened and I was the most helpful in solving their issues."
good,"always in demand, work at home opportunity. Great training and leadership. Easy to work with and for."
good,"Lots of calls and opportunities to sell and collect. This job helped me refine my average handling time skills, becoming more efficient on the phone to stay within the margins despite taking some longer, more involved calls. I liked my spot by the window on the 15th floor. I was together with this group of folks, co-workers and supervisors, for over five years. In that time we learned to work well together and care for one another. Who could ask for more? I certainly could, but the Centurylink SLC call center closed in April of this year. Now I am ready for re-deployment. I will use the considerable work skills obtained at this job to propel me to new heights in my next capacity working with and helping people."
good,Good place to work. Good Compensation and Benefits. I've learned lots.
good,"Personally I'm in Small Business Retention and deal with only incoming calls. If you like to move around and have an active job this is definitely not a good option. If you don't mind being at a desk, then you have a great opportunity to make a large amount of money. Everything depends on your attitude there and if you want to be there. They have a pretty strict point system for attendance as well. My problem with that was my father had to be in the hospital at some points and they still gave me full points even if I showed proof."
good,Answered phones to retain customers. Most calls were angry people.
good,I liked working for this company. I ran the Central Office and was getting the chance to update the equipment in the office. The outside area was a different story. I was not able to do any upgrades to the outside equipment. Co-workers were okay. I was bumped from my position by a senior technician. I had no problem getting her up to speed so that she could complete the work necessary. Management should listen to the Technicians more.
good,I enjoyed the 14 years I worked there. The company was originally Sprint/Embarq. At that time it was one of the best places I've worked. We had an awesome work environment. The pay and perks were extremely generous. The company culture provided a seamless relationship between management and its employee's.
good,Great company vision but lacks implementation. Too many employees still subscribe to the old utility company mindset.
good,"Learnt a lot about different vendor network devices."
good,"i enjoy my workplace, very peaceful, my co workers are nice and friendly and so are the  supervisors"
good,"Loved the incentive programs.  Majority of the management staff was well equiped and trained. Loved that they implemented programs to better yourself as an employee (in a managerial capacity). Overall a good company to work for. "
good,"Making out bound calls. Learned about the product. Management was very helpful, informative and friendly. Co-workers are welcoming and friendly. The job was fairly easy to learn. The most enjoyable part was talking to the customers."
good,"Receive and key orders taken by sales"
good,"CTL has grown fast, making it to the top three service providers in telecommunications, but quality of business ethics is severely lacking in the new organization."
good,Century Link is a great company to work for. I would recommend this company to any person who has amazing selling skills.
good,Consistent incoming calls looking for opportunites to sell available products in the customers area.  Not all sales opportunities are the same.  In most cases  the management was approachable and were willing to help solve issues and go to bat for their  team.  Co-workers were willing to help and able to create a family enviroment.  The hardest part is not being able to physically able to help the customer.  Enjoyable part is problem solving and making the customer happy.
good,A great place to start your career. I got to learn a lot from this company in all aspects. The co-workers and the management was very helpful and supportive.
good,Savvis is a high-end managed hosting company with co-lo and MPLS network.  Really was a challenge to work and learn so much so fast at a highly detailed level of expertise.  Will work you hard but it's rewarding to be able to use your entire skill set all the time.  Very busy.
good,"Good employee-manager relationship"
good,"Friendly working environment ,Good employee manager relationship,good learning everyday"
good,My supervisor was very knowledgeable and relatable I enjoyed my job at Qwest
good,"I worked as a back office support for our prism and telephone and internet departments. Offered my expertise in Lifeline department and became a Subject Matter Expert regarding the process for the Lifeline applications which involved a government based discount in almost all 50 states. Management was always there to assist in any way possible with escalated calls, and they made sure that I was used to the fullest capacity so that the company utilized my knowledge and expertise.  The hardest part was waiting for my advancement opportunities. The most enjoyable part of my job was becoming Team Lead Shadow and Subject Matter Expert."
good,Help customers with there services and set up new customers with our product. My store and area managers were easy to talk and communicate with. The co-workers were fun to be around and work with. The hardest part of the job was make the unreasonable sales quotas. The most enjoyable part was helping the customer new or existing with there needs.
good,"1. Configuring CISCO 6500, Junipers, F5 devives (LTM), ACE Loadbalancers, ASA base builds, FWSM builds with VIP pool addition."
good,"A typical day at works starts with logging into the systems; answering phone calls; taking billing question and appropriately handling issues; we were required to follow a very strict sales quota; I learned that hard sales are not for me. I learned that working in a call center requires for you to be able to healthily handle stress. I loved working with the company, but I didn't like the sales portion. My managers were amazing! They always did what they thought was best to get me to reach my quota! My co-workers made the job that much easier... I enjoyed working with all of them! The hardest part of the job was knowing that I wasn't a sales person, but I knew I wasn't meant for that job. The best part of my days were listening to my co-workers tell me about all the random calls."
good,Centurylink provides a very enjoyable workplace that offers a great balance for family life.
good,I loved working for this place and I shouldnt have left. My reason for leaving was for better pay at dish network.
good,I really liked this job. It was fun and I loved talking to new people everyday. Call center environment. This job was mostly about a sales quota and that is the only complaint I have. I wish that the company could have been more focused on customer service. This was a well paying job for the sales. The management staff make it an upbeat and fun environment.
good,Centurylink is a great company to work for. They have strong christian values but they don't impose them upon the employees. They try to make things fair across the board and keep family in mind as well. Also the have great benefits with PTO and short term disability which is rare to find these days. I truly enjoy working here. It is hard to find growth in certain areas but if you are willing to move around the US you can grow.
good,Didnt like working for radioshack. Didnt pay me for any of my comission
good,"A typical day at work was to provide customers with pleasant and accurate information. Report trouble listings.Unaccountable time. Able to do business category searches, weather, horoscopes, ski conditions, theathers and movies, and text information. I learned to be patient with the customers, even through they yell at you. The management was great. They helped with updated training we needed. They also helped with one on one training we might need. My co-workers were great. They always tried to help you with trading days when need a day off. The hardest part of the job was to keep our time spent with the customers 28.5 seconds or less average for the month. And not to cut off your ending before the number goes to automation. The most enjoyable part of my job was to talk to people around the country."
good,A typical day at work consisted of taking inbound calls to retain clients who were looking to leave the organization
good,"Work was routine to some degree, with subtle variances."
good,"Working for a fortune 100 client resolving their web application issues. Management was ""normal"" typical corporation management. Nothing horrible but nothing shined either. Co-workers were all great, young, and smart. Hardest part of the job was a balance of work and life. The most enjoyable part was the employees were like minded and fun to be around."
good,"As a sales representative a typical day involved phone calls to existing and prospective customers to set appointments, preparing contracts and proposals, communicating with customers regarding billing and repair issues, input and follow up on orders, consulting with colleagues to define solutions, attending training seminars, preparing reports and attending sales team meetings."
good,"The company is ever changing; that is the challenge on a daily basis, what has made me successful through the change is my abiity to weather the storms."
good,When I first started Qwest was Northwest and I was given 100 shares of stock. My pay scale increased one dollar an hour every six months for the first three years plus we received monthly if we made our collection targets. We were on teams of of ten to twelve people My team was a great group of people. The work was demanding but interesting. We had a wide variety of tasks from payment arrangements and collections to upselling
good,CenturyLink offers less advancement and less pay than Qwest.
good,"Qwest Communications Corp National Business Markets; Tucson, AZ is the organization I worked for 2 years. Very competitive as an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier. Well structured customer support organization. The best benefits offered to it's employees in the industry."
good,I learned a lot during my contract job here. worked as a team  with all the team members. gathered requirements and worked on all aspects of SDLC. Management was really appreciated of the work I achieved.
good,"I loved working for this company when it was Qwest. Once Centurylink took over there wasn’t clear direction on expectations. I worked hard growing and developing for almost 20 years and because my new CL manager had an issue because I knew more than she did, I was terminated."
good,Good company and awesome training course. Work environment was easy to adapt to. There was always management help to employees to make sure everyone was on the same page.
good,"Average benefits. Good management. The corporate mindset was ok, but they started to take more power away from local management. workload was not overwhelming"
good,"I worked for companies that would become CenturyLink. I never actually worked for CenturyLink. At those companies, I worked in both a sales and sales leadership capacity. As with most sales roles at most companies, you get what you put into it."
good,"I have been working at Great Place To Work full-time for more than 3 years"
good,"Great Benefits and mostly flexible."
good,Pay was good but long days. I learned a lot while working at Centurylink.. Everyone given the opportunity should work for a national company one in their life's.
good,"The culture at Best Company is by far the greatest asset. You can tell that they truly care about the happiness of their employees. It's a really relaxed and calm environment, even though the work we do can be fast paced. I don't dread coming into work on Monday mornings and the managers are extremely patient and understanding."
good,Global technology company specializing in connectivity & cloud solutions with $23B in annual revenue; ranked #132 on Fortune 500. The company has good reputation.
good,"There is some much opportunity to learn more products. Our management team is second to known. The workplace is hard at time, sales people come and go. I love my job, I really enjoy work with customers to become that trusted adviser. The hard part of my job is the revolving door for our sales team."
good,It was a fun place to work really easy to make a lot of money but he sales requirements for me was too much. For one i had to exp. in it and i thought they would help me out more.
good,"Centurylink was a great place to work. The culture was diverse and the leadership was fair. I would recommend job seekers if you want to work in a rural area with opportunities to advance and progress, Centurylink should be your choice."
good,"Change was always present weekly.  customer focus was key.  benefits were good, yet medical continued to decline.  works hours were conducive to family life"
good,"Lots of learning opportunities but manager politics are worst. "
good,You can be challenged to stay on top of all the things going on.  The technology is constantly changing giving you more insight into what's coming down the pipe for the customers.
good,Ha sido una empresa que me ha dado mucho conocimiento y me ha desarrollado como todo un profesional
good,I enjoy the opportunities for troubleshooting that exist. I like to be continually challenged with respect to technology. The benefits are good and are offered to employees at a fair out of pocket cost.
good,Overall the job was challenging but rewarding.  I worked with a great group of people that were always willing to help out when needed. It became a little harder to work there with the mergers and acquisitions.
good,"It was a great place to work, we were a great team!!!  We needed to go and find company's bring on board.  I did have to go to Yakima for a couple days looking for new customers."
good,I enjoy every aspect of my position at CenturyLink. It is challenging and everyday is a new day. I plan to retire here in 15 years. How many more lines to I need write before I can submit this review?
good,If can learn well and can apply what you learn you will do just fine and have very good job security.  Typical day for me was servicing central office equipment in multiple co's.  Learned to apply critical thinking to everyday duties.
good,I have enjoyed working at CenturyLink.  The work is challenging and rewarding.  Serious and driven people do well with CenturyLink.  The culture is improving since taking over Level 3.

good,I enjoyed my learning experiences at Century link. I met people who I consider close friends and family.I will always remember my years I spent at Century link.
good,Level 3 communications was an awesome opportunity to be a part of creating and growing a new company leading the way into the fiber optic network industry.
good,"No matter the size or type of your business, you'll always receive high-quality, on-demand support from CenturyLink. But if you need additional guidance for your Colocation, Managed Hosting or Cloud services beyond traditional support, CenturyLink's Service Management team can help. Service Management takes support to the next level by adding a named team of business and technology experts to your account who act as an extension of your internal IT to proactively and strategically plan, monitor, evaluate and evolve your IT and infrastructure most effectively."
good,I enjoyed the work environment there. Company provided great staff to discuss any concerns or questions with. The company provided ample amount of opportunity to engage in team training. The company worked hard at keeping employee's comfortable.
good,I was at Century Link for 5 years 8 month I enjoyed my experience there The people were friendly and I received very good training. Due to a company wide reduction in workforce I was let go Sept 2019
good,"Had a great manager, great work-life balance and amazing team to support each other. I learned a lot an onboarding and my team always helped encourage me in my career goal even if it was not in my field and with the company. That to me is amazing and speaks volumes about the culture I experienced."
good,"Nice place to work, good people and tools. Great pay and time off opps as well. Would work here again, many colleagues from then and still there today"

good,"Very happy to have worked here. Learned many innovative processes working many folks. "
good,I worked for Qwest Communications which closed the Albuquerque office in 2004 which were then bought out by CenturyLink 4-5 years later. So my experience is more related to Qwest.
good,"If you like sales, take a shot with CenturyLink. More of a starting sales salary, but very valuable lessons to be learned. I would consider working here again, but only in a management capacity."
good,"I enjoyed my work there.  People seemed reasonable, and there was good work life balance. Very nice campus, plenty of greenery, and a lot of parking space."
good,I drove an existing team to success by presenting and establishing cloud solutions to new and existing customers. I lead a team from 38% of their yearly number to tracking over 100% withing 1 year.
good,Employees get ample opportunities to work independently and be the owner of their own destiny. Support network within the company is very good. Mergers have diluted the culture of the org a bit though
good,"Centurylink is a flexible company to work for with good advancement for work-at-home workers.  Although a fast pacesd call center, help was available."
good,"Not good in adapting tech trends"
good,Great place to work with wonderful co-workers that are willing to help out in any way possible. Work home balance is only complaint a year worth of hours in 8 months.
good,Management was difficult to work with. High stress in the department.  Layoffs were typical in the department. Also experienced difficult strike from the Union
good,Very professional place to work and people are very friendly. Manager are very fair and not a lot of micro management. It's a good place to be advance
good,CTL allows me to work remotely which I greatly appreciate.  My direct manager is really understanding and supportive both personally and professionally.
good,I enjoy my current role but am looking for something more challenging.  the advancement is also dwindling within the organization with many layoffs occurring.
good,Centurylink is a great place to work.  There are many opportunities for advancement.    I was able to learn a lot during my time at Centurylink.  I worked in many different environments .
good,"Was a great place to work.  Slow to change, though they are coming around.  They need to invest more within, keep the quality loyal talent and educate them."
good,"At the time that I worked at CenturyLink, it was a numbers driven environment with a lot of cheating where management had a blind eye.  I was actually nice getting away from there."
good,If you like to be challenged then Centurylink is the place for you. It can be quite hectic at times but you learn to just go with the flow and it will all work out in the end.
good,"The work experience at Centurylink is what you make of it you must apply yourself to the job and never stop learning more about your specific role . The technology never stops changing ,therefore you owe it to yourself, the company and the customer to keep up with it and provide the with the best service you can. Centurylink will train you."
good,"The company is leaning more toward porting than before so training is imperative to work load."
good,"The position i was in did not afford alot of movement, I would be on a CAD project for a month at a time, I was used to being on the road and this was challenge"
good,I so much enjoyed the job I had.  I supervised an outside plant crew and was responsible for their results.  I enjoyed helping the customer when they had a complaint and getting that complaint resolved.  I enjoyed having crew meetings and explaining new rules and procedures that had been issued.  I had very good results and I so appreciated the crew for obtaining those results.
good,Fun place to work.  Busy. Environment was conducive for learning.  Very smart people working there.  Middle management was great.  Higher up was a pain at times.
good,This job allows me to take my kids to school and pick them up with being about to make a great living. Ive learned a lot about fiber services and network based security .
good,I enjoyed working with my peers. It was a very positive experience. My manager was a great guy and made the workplace fun and competitive. He was honest and fair.
good,it was a nice job everyone was nice hours where nice no weekends the pay was nice with extra pay when goals would be  pto hour lunch they would pay for food.
good,"Centurylink has a strong portfolio of services and products. Unfortunately, they really struggle to implement, part of this is due to the many acquisitions they have done over the last 5+ years - in that they have not been able to integrate the platforms on the backend.  Part has to do with the process and management of that process. In addition to the failure to integrate the platforms. Management has failed to update and fix the broken processes. "
good,"centurylink was the idea work place, great environment, and great management. Team members came together and worked as a team to meet the sale goals to put our team at the top."
good,"Centurylink provided me with a lot of growth opportunities.  Working in a global enterprise backup environment allowed me the opportunity to develop scripting skills in Bash to gather and format data which I was then able to leverage in Excel spreadsheets to translate the state of backups in many productive ways.  This, in turn, allowed me to identify key improvement opportunities."
good,"Really a great place to deliver your customer service and sales capability. There are so many incentives daily, weekly and monthly. There is constant updates on new information and training."
good,"Centurylink is a great place to work. There is good work life balance. Supervisors are good. There is a lot of opportunities to learn and improve your skills and workplace culture is good. Only problem is they laid off a bunch of people recently, just like other major telecom companies."
good,"This is a fun and productive place to work.  Salary could be a little higher though.  Benefits could be a little better as well.  Management is not micro managing, which is a plus."
good,"The hardest part of working in Project Management at Centurylink is the amount of projects that have to be managed by one person at one time (average 7 projects), they can be highly complex and extremely stressful and to be able to multi-task 7 complex projects at once is overload!"
good,"Good place to work, good learning environment if you applied yourself. Not always were the best choices made by management making the job frustrating at times."
good,Good company that allows employees to make decisions and manage their workload. Employees are held accountable for their results and are rewarded accordingly.
good,It is a team environment where every person feels as important but independent and collective at the same time in terms of idea sharing. It is great!!
good,Good Spot to work! I would go back in a second. They give free money if you sign up for health and wellness checks. People are great and I had awesome supervisors.
good,"I had the ability to work with others in my group as well as work my own jobs. My manager was great, she was easy to work for always encouraged us to do our best and gave recognition and credit when we excelled on the job."
good,Good interesting work. Good pay and benefits. Best part of the job was dealing with customers and resolving issues that were magnified by our call centers. Techs are good dependable people who work very hard.
good,"Remote work"
good,"Call center customer service, handling home phone, internet, and satellite television. Most calls were for maintenance issues, or an error in billing. Workers are required to upsell products to every customer who calls, with a weekly quota of products sold."
good,The only thing that I want to say about CenturyLink is that it was a good company to work for until we bought Level 3.This is all that I have to say about the company now.
good,Check email and sell service deal with customers everyday and check orders to make sure they get done.  Also hit a sales goal for day and also take payments
good,CenturyLink link is a heavily metric based company.  There is more work than employees to cover so it can be stressful at times.  The work/life balance isn't bad with FTO available for certain positions.
good,"During my time with CenturyLink, I was interested in how the telecommunications industry works and influences our daily lives.  I enjoyed working with small business owners."
good,"Typical day:  Managing accounts, sales support, follow up regarding services, collaborate with internal and external upper management, maintain internal and external client relationships."

good,The supervisors drove the company and made the atmosphere fun they allow staff to supervise their own work and work at their own pace. The facility is nice
good,It was exciting and challenging.  It was the largest employer during my employment at Qwest.  I created good friendships and the people make working at Qwest a great place to work.
good,"After 35 year of service, I retired from CenturyLink. I've seen changes over the course of my employment there including the break up of the Bell System and mergers with a few companies. I have worked in various departments and performed numerous job functions. For the first 25 years, I held job titles working in an office setting including Engineering, Payroll/Finance, Contract Administration and Facilities Assignments. The last 10 years, I worked as a Network/Broadband Technician installing and maintaining outside facilities and providing customer service for telephone, internet and TV services.  This has been a good company overall through the years providing good pay and benefits."
good,I Truly enjoyed the 20.5 years that I worked at Mountain Bell/US West/Qwest. I held several different positions at the company and learned many skills and gained a great deal of experience working in the different positions I held there.
good,Nepotism is a very bad experience within my Department.  It should be a happy place except for a team of sisters messing up the happy environment.  Hard part of my job is we are on a loud environment because of all the machines used to sort all mails.
good,"typical day i come in, run my reports, cross reference with my other reports and go from there, i assist all the sales reps in my region with quoting, billing questions, promoting orders, tracking orders, etc."
good,Great company with wonderful people to work with.  Fair and honest culture.  My manager was very approachable.  Many computer systems to know and work with.  Administrative work was tedious.
good,"To much work to little time."
good,Always very friendly staff & management that believes in you. High goals & expectations for all staff. Customer-Service/ Sales is always the main focus. Always offer upgrades &/or new services..
good,"A happy employee is a productive employee. The work and life balance is key at CenturyLink. With client and personal support, CenturyLink has a culture that produces leader that maintains the Vision."
good,This was a great place to work - lots of benefits and good possibilities for promotion.  Good leadership and volunteer events.  Level 3 loved to give back.
good,"CenturyLink is changing it's focus from a traditional land line company to an enterprise targeting transport and services provider. As such, it will eventually become a leader in the space."
good,great place to work - good place to start and advance career - opportunities in multiple disciplines and good people - management and occupational jobs available.
good,Savvis was bought by CenturyLink in 2011.   It was a good experience.   Many fine people worked here.   Good technology and operational support.   The company was purchased by CenturyLink.
good,"Good for training, overall  advancement opportunities. Lots of classes available self paces or other. Tuition reimbursement. Travel to other sites for meetings. You can do as much or as little as you want."
good,"A typical day at work is assisting field technician's by troubleshooting. I learned more about networking and voice service to assist customers. The workplace culture is laid back and a friendly place to work. The hardest part of the job is when you learn something new. Once you've gotten the training you need, it's smooth from there. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to technicians all over the world in over 30 states."
good,"A fair amount of stress, but overall good place to work. The people (your co-workers) and management are great to work with. Allow time off for doctor appointments if needed."
good,"Great work environment, responsible for my delivery to my assigned account.  Allowed to work independently as well as part of a Team.  Overall a positive work environment."
good,CenturyLink provided both a challenging and rewarding experience that allows employees to expand their skill set while fostering an employee first culture.
good,"Day culture as per work is best"
good,"Started as kiosk sales rep, promoted up to Kiosk Sales manager before Qwest closed all their kiosk prior to purchase by CenturyLink. Liked my immediate management. Did not have a whole lot of exposure to upper management as worked in small out of the way town."
good,CenturyLink is a declining company because people are cutting the cord on their land line telephones and using cell phones which CenturyLink does not directly provide to consumers. It does provide fiber optic telecommunication lines to cell phone towers which other cell phone companies use.  CenturyLink has been unsuccessful in developing new business.  Their fiber to the home business has not been good at pulling customers away from cable providers.  They have stopped their video content to the home business.  They failed in their cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS) business.
good,"Qwest is the old name for part of the company now called CenturyLink. CenturyLink was originally CenturyTel which merged with Embarq (the land line business of Sprint), and then Qwest and several other smaller companies and then recently merged with Level 3.  It is now the third largest telecommunications company in the United States after AT&T and Verizon."
good,CenturyLink has a solid product set and a lot of knowledgeable people to get a deal done. Can be difficult to get things done internally so selling internally is a key skill.
good,I enjoyed being able to fulfill all my duties in my work at home environment. I was able to manage my time wisely. The rapport built amongst my team mates around the country was amazing. We communicated through a chat throughout the day. The toughest part was not being able to be in a brick and mortar with my co-workers but in the beginning I knew that was part of the job description. anyone that can set up a home office should at least try it once in a lifetime. its a fun experience.

good,"Typical for telecommunications, CenturyLink underwent many MANY acquisitions and mergers during my time since 2011. Naturally, difficulty to become one company with systems, products, mindset.  This is the most complicated component of CenturyLink. Makes it difficult to do your job with many hoops to jump through.  "

good,Lots of change inconsistent goals or a definition of what success is. Targets change weekly on what to hit which cause confusion on the agent and supervisor level.
good,"I have enjoyed working for CenturyLink.  The culture has been supportive and positive.  The company is challenged with the integration of many smaller companies with unique systems and processes that have not been properly integrated.  This gets in the way of selling a cohesive solutions across larger geographies.  The financial situation is challenged with networks having peaked in price.  It has become a game of slowing the revenue loss.  This year bonuses were cancelled and merit increases as well. "
good,Decent sales environment. There are many complex sales processes that cause customer frustration. Delivery after the sale is improving. Management is trying to correct the processes.
good,CenturyLink is a major player in the telecommunications and network area.  It grows through acquisition of other companies which can cause some discord in daily job functions.  Each new acquisition requires several months of trying to assimilate the new culture in the overarching CenturyLink culture.  This causes frustration among the employees on both sides of the meregr.

During my time there I learned how to manage and arrange high level meetings and presentations, conduct thorough interviews, conduct root cause analysis and team building.

good,"over 14 yrs at this company. I remained in the same position more or less since I started got laid off and came back. To advance you need to be either extremely smart, talented  and educated or be willing to relocate . In most cases relocating is a lateral move. The telecom Industry has been an up and down career for most with mergers and and layoffs a constant. I have been fortunate in that I have never made too much money or been promoted too much because in that case many have become a target for "" reduction in force"" ,"" Cost cutting and other types of demotions."

Not only just small businesses, but also large businesses, resellers of century link services (isp, clec) and providing customer service.

The environment is really laid back, you're not micromanaged but given space to perform your duties and expected to do a good job at it."

good,I advanced financially at a good rate but when Qwest merged with USWest I was moved from mainframe computers where my expertise was to the server group where I had no experience which took my career off course.  We were so under staffed I never got to recover from this move.
good,I cannot fault CenturyLink for making a sound business decision to close a call center.   I could have relocated and continued my employment with them.  I hope I have not made a mistake by turning down that opportunity.  They are a great company to work for and they have an awesome set of core values and they do value their employees.

good,My review in Centurylink is a great place to work for as a call center. It will teach you how to learn to be a team player and have fun at the same time. You will love that everyday you will learn something new. The hardest part of the job is to trying to maintain a customer based on todays economy. The most enjoyable part of my job is that you always meet new people and building rappor with the customers to help them with the best customer skills possible.

good,Great Place to work for! Clients knew what they wanted and there was always space for improvement and learning!
good,"At Centurylink, I worked as a consumer sales and care representative, and was promoted to a direct marketing sales line with very rigorous sales goals, under which I excelled. I took inbound calls relating to everything from repair issues to billing questions and new service inquiries in my time here. I have nothing but positive things to say about Centurylink as a company, as they give their employees access to excellent benefits and I feel I was compensated fairly for my work. The most enjoyable part of my job at Centurylink was being able to speak with people from thirty-three different states on a daily basis, which kept the job exciting, less predictable, and gave me an opportunity to learn more about people from different backgrounds than myself. The most difficult part of the job was that it is almost entirely sedentary in nature, but fortunately, I really enjoyed the people around me so this is not a major complaint by any means. It will be interesting to see how the company deals with changing technologies and keeps up with some of the advancements their competitors have made in the last few years, as this is something that seems to have led to many changes within the company in the last few quarters and has caused many to feel less job security there."

good,"Everyday was a new day and it was always enjoyable, you learn about yourself more than anything else, as far as your emotional and how much patients you have. Meeting new people every door you knocked and possibly earning a commission with every door is a rush of excitement, but the hardest part was coming out empty handed each door you knocked. The upside is that the next door you knock could potentially be the door that gets you your money."

U S WEST has been through several corporate changes since I left, and is now better known as Century Link.  When I think back to my days at U S WEST, I always smile.  Leaving was a hard choice, as I loved the department I worked in and the team I worked with.  I encountered significant opportunity for growth, and always appreciated the high level of respect for diversity in the corporate culture.

I know many of my friends and colleagues were let go after I left, and I can't speak for the current culture or corporation."

good,"While an amazing company to work for, seniority takes so much presidence over work ethic. not sure if that is related to it being a union position or the company itself."
good,Simple and straight forward. Knowledgeable people. Lack of career advancement opportunities. Flexible time off. Good benefits and some education assistance.
good,It was great before the new CEO came in and changed the entire mission! Not sure what the new CEO's vision is but DC's are sold and seems like CenturyLInk is moving towards becoming a networking company. People with all other skills are being laid off left and right!
good,I enjoy working at Centurylink.  My job type allows for flexibility to accomplish my tasks for the day.  I can chose to learn as much as I want with the online library available to us.  Immediate management is good to work with and will do what they can to help with corporate roadblocks.  While the industry as a whole struggles to stay cash flow positive  Centurylink is working hard to make that happen.

good,the only thing i'd change is when u bring documents and call for  a late absence they would not mark as unexcused. other than that i loved working there
good,Top management do not focus at all on the managed services division. Good workplace culture and good work life balance. Top leadership does not understand neither cloud computing nor managed services.

good,"Its a nice place to work under the right management, you will be successful. You get paid what effort you put into the job. You basically make your own check for commission. Hourly is negotiated on what you think you deserve or based off experience."
good,I work day to day scheduling a team of 13 colleges in a video conferencing department on such tasks as covering incoming help desk calls to Setting up and greeting customers over video for their conferences.  I have been doing this job as well as other types of jobs in varies departments for the last 21 years and most all of what I do comes easily.  The hardest part of my job would be when hardware breaks and we are not able to provide the service to our customers that they expect in the time frame they need.
good,"A typical day at work is coming in to your desk, logging into systems, receiving emails, chats from managers/supervisors, taking phone calls that are most days back to back. Having to focus on saving customers from disconnecting service, selling products"
good,"CenturyLink is a fast paced telecommunications and world leader in the communications industry.  It was a place ripe with opportunities of learning and development of many skills."
good,"This company was very determined to evolve and grow to succeed.  They continued to look for companies to buy and ways to build their service portfolio.  "
good,"My best review is that I look forward to going to work.  My team is like family.  Work schedule is very flexible including ability to work from home.  If it weren't for the coming integration, I would have no complaints."
good,"CentyuryLink Communications (and all of its predecessors, Mountain Bell, U S West Communications, and Qwest Communications) provided me with an excellent opportunity to learn new skills, in a wide variety of professional environments. "
good,"The company culture from my perspective at the data center is very relaxed. You have exposure to different applications, networks, and systems that you can choose to specialize in at your leisure."
good,The calls are extremely back to back but it also makes the time go by quickly. The staff are always trying to find ways to thanks us and we know we are appreciated. Keeping the calls flowing in a timely manner while satisfying all aspects of the job gives a sense of accomplishment because the job is demanding with the time given to handle each customer. Just like any other customer service job dealing with customers over the phone empathy is probably the most needed. Angry customers will respond to a persons voice when they hear sincere empathy on the other end and this helps when information the customer is given is not what they wanted to hear.  So while knowledge of the situation is a must a sympathetic ear rates high on a customers scale when they call in already upset before even speaking with a person and so many times the customers have already gone thru an automatic call system that can be extremely frustrating while anxious to speak with a human. Over all I believe that a customer service position requires a person with a truly emphatic voice.
good,I do not have a strong enough opinion about this job it did what was required while I had it. I do fell that as a company it has more options for success than others.
good,Embarq was a spinoff of Sprint Local telephone and with it came great people and a great work environment. I was allowed to design my department from scratch. We were then bought out by CenturyLink and they had no respect for the work we had done and refused to consider our way of doing business even after we proved it would save millions. Not impressed with any of the new management team I met. Was very sorry to lose this opportunity when they moved the work to Louisiana.
good,Great company to work for. Time management is critical and needed to succeed in this environment. Co workers work together to get projects completed on time. Everyone works well together.
good,"CenturyLink was a good place to work at. The schedule was flexible and I enjoyed most of the people I worked with. If given the opportunity to return, I would. I had to leave due to an at work vehicle accident. The judge threw out the ticket, but it was to late at the time"
good,losing a lot of customers. due to not installing service on time. so if you are a sales person then it will mess with your sales. Your (money) Not Good
good,"Work days were fast paced, learned patience, how to listen to people, how to solve problems, work on my own. In the beginning just about everything was hard, collecting past due accounts, talking to irate customers, selling products and services.  The company gave me the tools to overcome my fears and excel at my job."
good,"Good company with good work culture."
good,Spent my days provisioning work orders from sales to the technicians. Very engaging work in my mind. The days would go by fast. Only reason why I left was because they relocated the department to Georgia.

good,"Lot of hard work. learned about customer contact. culture is good. time of jobs they expect you to get job done in a certain amount of time, but sometimes it is hard to do! Working in old facilities. (cable) Management is young and does not no the job. Qiuting time."
good,"while the particular city and office I worked in was good, I know this varied greatly by city and managers."

good,"Everyday you had to make sure you had  your A game"
good,"My immediate manager was excellent and exemplified what a leader should be.  "
good,"Most of the people that work there have been there for years.I worked there 34 years. Most of the time I did customer service type work and gave the  customer the best possible service. "
good,"Here one day will consist of"
good,"Answering call from customer that having technical  issue with there internet, fill out a ticket for tech to come out to customer facility to fix problem if needed"
good,"Very busy,I've learned to do other projects. I got along very well with the management. the work place was nice and very cleaned. The hardest part,working where there wasn't any team work. Greeting the customers."
good,I enjoyed my time with Century Link.  The pay and benefits were excellent and the management atmosphere was great.  Very  non-invasive. My co-workers were all professionals and could be trusted to  do their part. Everyone was willing to go the extra mile to insure customer service.
good,Average day at Centurylink is assisting customers with their internet issues. I have learned a lot about wireless technology since I have worked here. Management is good. My co-worker are awesome. The hardest part about the job is determining whether or not a customer really needs a technician out or just needs to replace the modem. The most enjoyable thing about my job is the independence.

good,"I enjoyed working at Level 3, very productive company, Loved working with the people enjoyable environment. Management was always available they had an open door policy. "

good,"I have had the ability to successfully perform as a sales professional, which provided me the opportunity to be promoted to a Sales Manager and lead a market turnaround in a previously unsuccessful market. I have learned that hiring the right people is critical to the success of the team and a positive work environment. Successfully driving sales, holding individuals and the team accountable, increasing overall productivity across the team, while providing positive leadership, leads to a team wanting to succeed not only for themselves, but for me. Between the combined companies, this is one of the best places I've worked in my career, but it doesn't go without its challenges.

good,"We have 4 major releases per year and follow up with point releases as needed. My job is mostly waterfall, but I am trying to incorporate more of an agile approach on smaller task like projects. I typically handle 2 major and 1 medium level of effort projects per release. I support a front end self service portal with multiple views and accessed by users of medium and large enterprises. My team consists of a multitude of on shore and off shore developers, testers, engineers, architects and clients. My job has become process heavy over the last 2 years as this has become a primary focus of management. This is sometimes a challenging portion of my job as I try to balance process with deliverance of quality code to my clients on time and under budget. I really love being an analyst as it incorporates constant change and application of newer and better technologies to the existing user experience. My current projects include conversion of our existing coding apps to open source and with the re-write UI components to remove the Flex piece and convert to HTML5 and responsive design for tablet support"

good,"CenturyLink is a great place to work.  It comes with many perks, good benefits, and reasonably fair pay.  Every supervisor I've worked with has been helpful and kind, and the people who work there are the same way.  The only issue I had is a quarterly schedule change based on seniority.  If you were like me and advancing quickly into groups of people who have been there ten or more years, chances are you will be working night shift with Tuesdays and Wednesdays off for a few years.  I was just recently engaged and needed some stability so I had to look for a first shift job with weekends off primarily.  Aside from the schedule though, working for CenturyLink is fantastic and a great opportunity to learn as much as you can."
good,A typical day includes an average workload with an occasional crisis that needs handling. Plenty of time to advance your personal IT knowledge and work with others who share the same sentiment. The hardest part of the job is the technical aspect. Depending on the subject matter you can investigate further or assign to the appropriate team to get a task completed. I enjoy being able to focus without distraction and advance my skillsets.

good,"Great benefits, relaxes workplace, good co workers, the only bad thing is the crabby customers."
good,"Loved working with this company, however my branch in Florida was a little bit irresponsible."
good,a good company to work until qwest close businesses due to have debt
good,"Just about everyone there is great to work with and eager to help. Local management is there to help, observe, and instruct when necessary and feedback is always available. However, very little input is taken by higher management and information passed down from them is just as much a shock to employees as it is to local management. There seems to be a disconnect in communication for a ""telecommunications"" company."
good,"A typical day at work is checking email, creating spreadsheets, scheduling meetings. Always learning new processes or working to improve the process we have in place. The hardest part of my job is sitting behind a desk all day. I feel that with my personality I should be out dealing with people. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with and getting to interact with them everyday."
good,I have learned a lot about soft switches. At the time it was the state-of-art. My manager was an excellent man and also my superiors.
good,My sales manager is very supportive and escalates issues quickly when needed.
good,I would go to work and take calls for 8 hours supporting customers.
good,"a typical day atcentury link will be to make sure that the customer are satisfied and they are getting the best value for thier service.. the cowokers and managers were easy to get along with . I would really say thier was a hard part to that job , the most challanging thing would be to get the sales. I really enjoyed talking to the customer and helping them slove thier problems with everyday life as well as with the company products."
good,One of the best call centers I ever worked for. I loved working here I felt loike I had a second family.
good,"Qwest spent a lot of time, effort and resources in developing its Managers. Great effort was made to educate its workforce in diversity issues, tech issues, and a real sense of being a good community citizen."
good,Very nice place to work and great benefits are provided. Staff is friendly and also helpful. They are strict with the KPI's that you have to hit but the pay is worth it.
good,Love my job.  Just looking to fill in some spare time. This is the best job I have ever had in the civilian world. I wouldn't change a thing about it..
good,It was a good place to work. They offered full benefits and a generous amount of paid time off. Management was amazing and coworkers were willing to help each other.
good,People are great there. Unfortunately they are going into a different type of sales now. They have a one price for everything now where it used to be a sales person had some promotional things to use to get additional sales.
good,"Great entry level job,room for advancement if you're wanting to move up in the company they do promote from within,I relocated and wasn't able to transfer my job,it's hard to get back with the company once you leave, overall great company to work for"
good,Level 3 Communications was acquired by Century Link. The legacy Level 3 folks seem to have a lasting fraternity in which we all still stay in touch. I would not be where I am in my career without my time at Level 3. I still miss it to this day!
good,"Good Work life balance"
good,"The hours may be long, but the compensation is worth it.  The benefits surpass any in the industry. Technicians are represented by a labor union, so there are dues to pay. compensation is bargained for through labor union."
good,"Note: All pros and cons are of ""Centurylink India, Noida"" "
good,"Centurylink provided opportunity for growth with a great company culture. A typical day for a supervisor is attending morning, afternoon meetings, monitoring agents and providing consistent motivation."
good,Time off is very flexible and work from home is an option for many positions. Direct management is excellent.It is a large company with many opportunities to advance and move around.
good,"I have had an excellent set of peers. I have enjoyed my job for 18 years. Climbing ladders, fixing copper lines, using a boom, and enjoyed interacting with customers."
good,"Pros"
good,"Depends on the time of year, sometimes it's super slow and sometimes it's back to back calls. Training had improved over the last few years. All the supervisors are great. It's a union, meaning schedules are by seniority and all the good gifts are gone, unless you like working until 11."
good,"Centurylink and Qwest are the same company. Its a nice place to work with good work life balance and opportunities to work remotely. There is a lot to learn because they are taking in new technologies and businesses. Only problem is they laid off a bunch of people recently, just like other major telecom companies. So probably not hiring right now"
good,"SAVVIS, with its original leadership and team, was a great place to be and work in 2008/9 at the New York City office in State Street, Manhattan Downtown."
good,I learned all about networking.  The culture was very competitive.  The hardest part of the job was learning a new industry.  The most enjoyable part was being able to get out and cold call.
good,great added bonuses that added to money made. i was excited to work there and was meeting my goals and getting rewarded with financial prizes such as debit cards with pre loaded cash
good,"I was pregnant late upon hire and they trained me, and even let me take off as long as needed for my maternity leave. they didn't pay wish they did, but the team was great, the environment was great, they set you up to succeed and have people willing to work with you. they have commission, good incentives, its an environment of great mentors. I only left because my son didn't get bottle feeding down quick enough and was mostly breastfed."
good,Everybody was very friendly and helpful and always willing to teach you things you don't know or don't understand. Management is very nice and will to work with you no matter what you have going.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at CenturyLink. The company cares about its employees, as well as is customers. I will always cherish my time at CenturyLink because the company cares, and they show it often."
good,"A typical day of work as a Central Office Supervisor conisisted of:  "
good,A typical day included multi tasking with escalations and job assignment duties.  Projects and evaluations for the staff.  Hardest part of the job was keeping the team focused without being a micro manager.
good,"Sales driven team with high level of energy and competitive nature. Flexible work shifts,insurance benefits with 401 K options. Great Place to work long term."
good,Learned multiple systems and how to engage customers differently and in a more positive manner. Learned how to overcome objections when trying to sell a service to a customer as well.
good,"No real complaints.  It all depends what team you're on in these big corporations and I was lucky enough to work for a great team.  Awesome manager, great team culture, couldn't have started my career any better."

good,"Super relaxing environment. The only place I've been able to wear shorts and flip flops to work. "
good,"I helped customers with job entry paperwork and regulations.  Difficult because people don't read instruction, enjoyable because able to assist.  I learned about many regulatory issues with the FCC."
good,"Re-Design and building the client networks as per the requirements."
good,Nice place to work. I am lucky and had great managers and directors at my both positions with Level 3 Communications. Workplace culture is very nice. I really enjoy to work here.
good,"A fully work minded bunch great technical people. They actually know how to cheer their co workers. I have been involved in various other departments, i must say i have to build another resume to list i have learned in this project, i have been involved in wireless networking technology. Thanks to the management I never felt that they were on the top of employees for work."
good,CL was an amazing place to work. The management was phenomenal and teamwork was always present. The hardest part of the job was learning how every department was intertwined and the most enjoyable part of the job was the involvement the managers had in each department. Hand-on training was always available and if you had a question you would always get a great answer!
good,Great place to work and gain a lot of experience while receiving a steady income. Great pay and lots of work to be done. good management team and support staff
good,"The Company and 95% of management is incredible, I loved working for them, the only problems I had were always being forced into selling Directv rather than Centurylink products. I was hired by Centurylink not Directv."
good,"This was my first time working in a call center. Call centers are like gas stations. People come and go, they are not there to stay. A lot of my co workers though have many years in call center experience and report centurylink(CTL) to be the best by far. And I would tend to agree even based on my experiences."
good,"Qwest is a great place to work, great corporate culture, great morale and opportunities for advancement. An all around solid place to work."
good,"Excelente ambiente laboral, con compañeros que colaboran mucho para el éxito de la empresa y de sus propias metas. Con mucho tesón y ahínco se sigue parámetros para garantizar que el cliente este satisfecho con el servicio. Se aprende muchas tecnologías y esto incrementa la solvencia en el conocimiento y el desarrollo personal."
good,I really enjoy working at Centurylink. My supervisor is one of the best managers I have ever experienced. He also makes the whole team feel welcome excited cared about. Great place to make money on commission and if you take notes and actually work on the training they give you will be GREAT! The hardest part of the job is understanding people and how the work and accepting it. Most of the people that call in ask the same extremely simple questions and it can get tiring. Overall I definitely love Centurylink
good,"Good place to work with supportive management. While most of the work is about the numbers, you still have plenty of opportunity to grow and develop. Employees are treated fairly and compensation (depending on what work you are doing) and benefits are comparable with industry standards."
good,"Good place to work"
good,"A typical day at Century link was to attend the Stand up meeting to discuss the goals of the project.I would give my input to the project and also discuss the tasks I worked on."
good,I joined as a Fresher and I learnt lot of technical things related to my project. Everyone are co-operative at the workplace.
good,"Good place to work with great wages.  Opportunity for advancement is there, but may not be timely.  Like most big companies there are some ""business politics"" that you have to live through or adapt to.  There are a lot of great people that work for this company, I am glad to know a lot of them."
good,the hours really worked with me well and the pay was great. I really enjoyed working there and would consider going back if I was able to.
good,"Contact me direct for a personal review."
good,"Typical day would be: managing the workload for the day/week of phone calls; emails; processing service changes; resolving disputes; computing adjustments; and prioritizing/scheduling work for the future.  "
good,My manager was amazing. The best part of the job was the people I worked with. The hardest part was the fact was that the job was very repetitious. I was told repeatedly that I was going to be trained on something more the next week and it never developed. Having to pay for parking was expensive also.
good,"While working with CenturyLink I would take inbound calls for customer that wanted to disconnect their accounts with CenturyLink and try to retain their business by offering discounts, products and solutions. I learned how to effectively deescalate a customer who was upset with the company and turn their attitude around about their products. The management was always helpful with their coaching and support on the floor, they were also amazing at finding advancement opportunities to those who are looking for them. The most difficult part of this job was having an upset customer on the line who needed to vent about the company. The best part was when I would meet and over exceed my retention goals and make someones day by saving them money on their monthly bill."
good,Excellent wages and benefits. I worked with a lot of good people who became friends.
good,"A typical day at work included making sales calls, off site customer appointments, answering emails and placing orders.  There is a lot of potential to move up the corporate ladder. The hardest part of the job was moving through all the red tape that can interfere with customer timeline expectations and the most enjoyable part of the job is working with all the various different type of customers."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job, is the extensively diverse chance of building your skills in many different aspects of the Projects you will be working on."
good,Empowered to make decisions and provide pro-active input pertaining to security operations .
good,"I have experienced 3 company take overs during my career in the Telecommunications industry. With each take over the culture and moral of the technicians seems to suffer. Although I have been blessed with a career in which management gave me the chance to excel in several departments in order to keep my mind challenged, I have found myself at the end of all possible paths with in my job title. I have also been fortunate in my salary, work hours, OT, and life style as a result of a good Union job. Currently contract negotiations between Century Link and my Union CWA have stalled and have dragged out for several months; as a result the language coming out of corporate seems to me offensive at times regarding my work title's net worth. I ponder over a future career at Century Link."
good,I thought they did a great job. It was a summer internship for the Real Estate department working on project management and demolition.
good,Great flexiblity of the work environment and ability to telecommute when needed. Management is great! Teams are outstanding. Opportunity to learn new ways to do the job is endless.
good,"Century Link seems to be doing what needs to be done, for a long time, upgrade systems, better communication with customers, an excellent product start up with real value, from the moment I start work to the end of the day this new Company has what I believe will be a super + for its customers COMMUNICATION! You can't run on empty promises and expect loyal customers. If I run into any problem my supervisor's alway there to answer the call, with the communication ability, Cell Phones, we, our co-workers, have the ability to call one another to aid,ask,help figure out something, in a matter of minutes, no waiting for customers, real trouble starts if a customer has been given ""wrong"" information and at that point it's sometimes hard for the customer to give you an opportunity to make well the problem, mostly, they do. Enjoyment comes at the end of the day when you KNOW you've done your best."
good,"CenturyLink is an always changing environment, as they have been on the acquisitions path for some time. They have purchased Embarq, Qwest, and Savvis, growing the company to the third largest telecommunications company."
good,Great place to work fun great benefits and compensation. Coworkers were awesome and management was always available.
good,It was a good place to work and management generally treated employees with respect. Co-workers were very friendly. The hardest part of the job was to meet unreasonable sales expectations.
good,"Great people, great product and lots of advancement opps if you put the work in."
good,I loved working at Qwest now Century Link. I started out in customer service. Went to quality assurance for the company did some coaching and training of the call center staff loved that. Moved on in to the fiber side of the business and worked with the call before you dig department and the network control center. Learned so much so many aspects of the businss here. Worked to support the field operations to bring on line a ticketing system for maintenance requests. I really enjoyed the fiber side of the business at Qwest.
good,"I loved being able to help customers with whatever issues they had. I learned I am able to use many different computer systems at the same time. My team lead made thing's interesting. My co-workers and I liked helping each other become the best we could be. The hardest part of the job for me was selling products over the phone, which I was able to do. I really liked winning all kinds of prizes."
good,"In my last position as a controller tester, it was my duty to coordinate and test special circuitry with all other involved departments and outside company personnel."
good,"I worked there for almost five years and it flew by! I wish I still had this job, death in family forced changes in life."
good,This job took pure self motivation and extreme emotional intellect. While meeting with customers nothing else could matter except helping out that one person and making sure they were getting everything they needed/wanted. The team atmosphere present in the office made the experience that much better because everyone is there to help everyone and the management has an open door policy at all times.
good,"This department submitted phone statements for U S West Communications using a processing computer system that opened the envelopes, then allowed employees to see the statement on the computer which prepared the statement to be submitted. A lot of overtime was available in this department, and I enjoyed working on the system"
good,"While working at qwest communications i learned alot about technology. I learned the differences in what better benefits our company had to offer compared to other companies. I also interacted with different customers, and gained trust on many different levels;personal and professional.The hardest part of this job is working fast enough to meet quota. While the part i most enjoyed on the job would be meeting new people, and saving them money."
good,"Century Link was a fun environment to work in with all the contests, prizes & pot lucks.  There was always friendly competition to keep your day interesting."
good,A typical day will include changing hats every hour. One minute your a fireman and the next your a psychologist listening to someone rant on a conference call. Somewhere in there you get some work done. Management is supportive all the way up. You are allowed to make decisions and you are allowed to fail within reason. At this level you are not micromanaged and have some freedoms during the day. The hardest part of the job is the ever changing direction. You should be prepared for and thrive on chaos. There is always a deadline approaching or one that has past. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people we work with. First class people who are always willing to throw their hat in the ring and get things done.
good,"I didn't spend so long with this company. We had 3 days Out of office (commission Bases and 2 days in office (hourly Based)"
good,"Maintain daily performance."
good,"Yes I would like to work for my current employer further. However I am keeping my options open, and keeping this resume up . To inform any employers I work for."
good,When I worked there training was great. And the environment was amazing. I loved it but I found a job that I could make more money at. CenturyLink was suportive of my desission to advance in life.
good,I appreciate working at CenturyLink as they have a great work life balance Tuesday thru Friday as long as you can work 8 hours makes it nice to have Doctor appointments or want to go to kids concert at school during the work week and leave your vacation time for vacation.  The one downfall is parking.
good,"Great company culture and great work life balance. They are going through a massive reduction in workforce, and recently I was affected.  Aside from that fact, I had every intention of remaining a part of corporation."
good,"Great opportunity to learn specially for starters and recently graduate people, a truth connection with management and they are always approachable, many opportunities for advancement is just like anything else just to go for it."
good,"Each day at work consisted of completing work assignments in a timely manner.  There was continuous training and opportunities to learn new projects.  Management was involved with your growth. Diversity is very important and following guidelines.  There wasn't a hard part of the job, it's what you make it. The workplace camaraderie was the best part of my job"
good,"Excellent work, benefits/programs, and management. The other technicians and can be whiny or just plain lazy making the work environment for others much more difficult, customers will be customers and the work can be stressful, fast paced, and some cases dangerous but overall your compensated with excellent pay, union benefits and more"
good,"Great place to work, great compensation even if it's a bit confusing. Benefits are stellar, good team atmosphere. People willing to help, 10 week training period followed by ramp up to full quota."
good,"My experience at centurylink was great. Managers were awesome. It was fast paced, and the training was exceptional. I would definitely like to work there again in the future."
good,"One of the best company to work for in telecom domain , job security , decent management , great facilities . One of the fastest growing company in US telecommunication."
good,I enjoyed my job very much at Century Link. The only thing that concerned me is that it was a temporary position and no guarantee of full time employment. what I loved most about the job is that it was competitive. I enjoy a challenge.
good,"Great opportunities within company, great teams and staff. Nice company to work for. They keep you update with the training, They also have work incentives.."
good,"century link is a great place to work, fast paced, challenging and rewarding.  I may want to go back to work there should my attempt to change my career not work out as planned."
good,"On a day to day basis customers would call in with repair issues, some were irate and upset with the company guidelines so my job was to take action to repair those unwanted attitudes toward the company I was representing. Management was great in helping resolve difficult situations when needed. Everyone in the call center I worked in were all there for the same reasons and were pleasant to work with. There were times i could not resolve a customers issue after exhausting all my option but with alot of hard work the customer was still appreciative and I received many customer commendations for going above and beyond for the customer despite I could not get all of them complete satisfaction."
good,your job is to fix the customers problem and provide great customer service. one of the main rules was you have to offer a product on every call. once you get the hang of offering everything else falls into place.
good,"I met or exceeded sales goals across multiple platforms, with our internal products and several contracted products, including DIRECTV and Verizon Wireless. Billing Responsibilities included credit to accounts, review of all billing statements and general billing clarification for customers. Some collections depending upon account status, collection of deposits for products and services, as well as account review to determine best possible pricing for each customer. Management was above average and were directly motivated to help employees achieve. Most of the average work day was spent receiving inbound billing and sales communication via instant message and making collection calls for sales. The culture amongst employees left much to be desired; Most employees had no motivation or desire to advance or learn more than the absolute basics."
good,"Everything about this company is good, Salary hike, culture and other factors are considerable except job security. When any project slips out of hand, No promises made."
good,"everyday was always something new. New incentives, new games, new contests and new prizes. Management was great!!! would recommend this job to anyone"
good,"Working form home allows me time to do school, be with kids, and work a full 40 hours a week."
good,"Paid training was fun and exciting. Management was helpful and resourceful. Not for everyone given the stress of business customer service."
good,I was always encouraged at work which boosted me in performing excellent.
good,"Great place to work, "
good,"Working for Centurylink was always fun, I never dreaded getting up for work in the morning. Having uplifting and supportive supervisor's and upper management helped a lot. Someone was always there to help with a difficult customer, or to just let you know what you could work on to better yourself in a constructive manner."
good,"I enjoy the general atmosphere in the call center. The employees are able to interact and help each other. The supervisors work hard to help those under them and promote a positive environment. For anyone who enjoys talking to people over the phone and selling dependable products to small/large businesses, I would recommend CenturyLink as an employer."
good,"I have worked for this company for 13 years...I have had experience in collections, customer service, provisioning and call center. I have a very eclectic work history which has helped to make me more marketable."
good,Qwest was a fun company to work that offered compensation for doing your job. The managers were upbeat and helpful. The training was adequte and the trainers were helpful and nice.
good,A great place to work and grow. Residential collections is the first department i worked in. We maintained relationships with customers to ensure timely payments and offer payment arrangements.
good,"The company was fine. Commissions were great but the sales goals were sometimes tough to achieve. Meetings every month or so to ""motivate"" were annoying, though."
good,"My career at CenturyLink was very good in my opinion.  I had the flexibility to interact with everybody, regardless of their position and suggest innovative new ways to do business.  I enjoyed the ability to make decisions about my job and interacting with all levels of people within the company."
good,A typical day includes supporting upper management in the performance of their position understanding our Company unifying principles set by our Founder and performing job functions in accordance with these principles.
good,"The typical day of work looks like and sounds peaceful."
good,"Overall, it was a great place to work. I enjoyed helping the customers resolve their issues. The work environment was really positive. My supervisor was really awesome to work with."
good,I enjoyed working in the Information Technologies department as a system administrator.  Everyone worked collaboratively to meet individual and corporate goals.  I learned what being a service organization was all about.  Management was very supportive.  Co-workers were great to work with.   The hardest part of the job was when QWEST Communications was acquired by CenturyLink.  Management of the company fell apart.  It was clearly obvious that there are too many layers of management.  Managers watching managers and micro-managing everyone else to the point where nobody can effectively get anything done.
good,everyone worked as a team and everyone always got retrained on specific problems they were having. i would always like to go back to work there.
good,Gained alot of thinking outside the box and being creative in getting things done effectly and efficently.
good,"Century Link overall was a great place to work at. Benefits are excellent. You get Paid Time off, sick time, family time. Now what job gives you time off to go and enjoy your family."
good,I have enjoyed and learned so much from working at Centurylink  this was my first call center job  The money was great and they really try to take care of you
good,"Enjoyable employment, hands on, and more productive. Fast learning manger more understanding and co-worker more helpful. Each department feel like family."
good,"My time working with CenturyLink Sales and Service Center, was an enjoyable one. The management works very hard to make it a fun, and positive environment. The attendance policy is fairly flexible, I would not recommend this job to someone who requires medical care on a regular basis."
good,Centurylink has a great environment for trainees everyone makes you feel as if you are apart of a family not just a team.  The co-workers make you feel right at home and are willing to assist you if you need it.  The computer systems were very easy the training made you be proud to be apart of the company.
good,"Good benefits, very good company's culture, supervisors are well train and ease to get to. "
good,"Great Company, Great people "
good,"During my employment, supervisors that weren't directly responsible for you will always have something to complain about. When I changed to work from home, it became worse and my immediate supervisor was like a puppet that agreed with others. When I was fired, he wanted to know how I felt about it. When I didn't show any anger, he abruptly ended the call and emailed me my termination letter."
good,"Department is horrible , there is call after call. The  customers are horrible and there is very bad training within the department ! Just plain horrible , supervisor are lazy well some of then & everyday there's a change. The job was great the first two months but afterwards is downhill."
good,"I really loved working for this company, the internet and phone service is honestly great, no matter what people say, but sadly, the management, They careless about customers, except to push services at them supposedly to save them money, but actually winds up costing them more. The partner companies have 2 year contracts, while Century Link term agreements are 1 year, and when customers get that first bill of the second year.. SKYROCKECTED prices, and the only thing management cares about is getting them to spend more. Then of course, there's the ever changing policies. you get used to something and then you get told our wrong because things changed on your day off. Like I said, great company, awesome coworkers, lousey management"
good,During the time that i worked for centurylink they spend thousands of dollars to make sure each employee was adequately trained for the sales and marketing of their services as well as the affiliated companies. Management personal worked closely with their customer service reps to implement training skills daily.The hardest part of this job would be recognizing those around the office due to the high turn over rate. Some people are just not cut out to be sales people.
good,I worked at centurylink because I had no other option if you liked getting yelled at and hate life then work there I personally hated it because it sucked
good,I absolutely loved working at CenturyLink I was heartbroken when my position as well as most of my entire department came to an end. I would love to work for CenturyLink again. Most enjoyable part was the teamwork. The hardest part was leaving.
good,Good environment but some times stressful.  management is need of training especially on how to deal with people (women) in non traditional jobs. Advancement is difficult at this company unless you know someone.
good,Worked here for 12 years. I loved what I did but wanted to follow my dream of becoming a Journeyman Lineman. I did it! I would definately recommend applying.
good,Great people within the organization  but advancement isn't to be expected compensation is better than most. Has the worst marketing manager I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with.
good,"The garage that I worked  the people where always willing to help if needed for the most part.  I feel this Job took to much away from my family life, and needed a change.  Century Link will be around for a long time and at this point still have good benefits."
good,"I loved the customer service position that I held for the company. I enjoyed talking to people on the phone, however, I was not a good fit for working at home. I prefer to be around people."
good,"The typical work day was fast paced and pack with calls one after the other and always with a new and interesting search for either a business or person, and I learned how to work quickly to get each customer helped and on their way happy and satisfied"
good,Customer services to customers with billing or service issues.  was 90% of your job performance.Offering new products and services or starting new accounts were the best part of the day with CTL. The company made a lot of changes then contradict those changes. People terminated because of the information or sales training provided. The new call center is not well organized and the supervisors only lookout for themselves and no one else.
good,"Good experience."
good,"Centurty link is a productive company in North Carolina designed to sell bundles of tv, internet, and phone.  It is an exciting place to work but I am interested in a higher commission structure."
good,"Since I am no longer there, I cannot say how things are NOW.  But, the reason I stayed there for 21-years, is because it was a challenging and also eventful place to work.  BORED is not a word you would have ever used while working at LCI/U.S.West/Qwest/Centurylink.  The challenges for IT were many, varied, and endless."
good,Too bad it is now Century Link.  The union let us down by decreasing benefits over time.  I stopped working there because the benefits and commissions stopped.
good,Great company. Too many working hours at 60+ a week. Lots of territory to cover...Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good,"A typical day at work, very busy . "
good,"Helping people is the enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Overall Centurylink is an ok place to work for this day and age but as in the communications industry the production demands are set way too high. The OSP facilities are not properly maintained and the morale is very low overall in the Tech area. Although I is one of the last Union represented jobs and one of the better ones at that, it is still a tough place to work."
good,"A good place to work. They allow you to grow and find new ways of doing things. Management is fair, but firm. Do not adversly effect customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job was to learn new things and grow educationally."
good,Have worked here for 11 years and through 2 acquisitions now work for CenturyLink. Enjoy working here and appreciate the opportunity that I was given.

I learned how to effectively deal with conflict while keeping a level head to achieve the desired goals for the customers and the company. The hardest part of the job was having to say no if for example no dispatch could be allowed over the weekend because of no access. The most enjoyable part of this position is helping people."

good,"Various training opportunities for career advancement.  Stores offer"
good,"Had a great career there until I decided to be an at home mom for my young child."
good,I would recommend this internship to anyone the staff was truly helpful and allowed you to grow and develop. They made you feel the company's culture and the company's love.
good,Management was really helpful and didn't have a problem stepping up to the plate to help whenever the need arose. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with the contractors and resolving any issues they may have had.
good,"Telecommunications professional with 13 years of diversified and progressive customer support"
good,Century Link takes great care of their employees.  Family is a priority not just to you but to the management team.  The people there were so helpful beyond words.  There is plenty of room to grow if you dedicate yourself.
good,"This was my first IT job at US West. It was essentially to review the impact of application changes or new applications on the local network. I learned about TCP/IP networking and how to use was was called a sniffer at the time. This was also a closed lab, isolated from the company network. We got lots of skunkwork jobs from the architecture group and other development groups. We evaluated new hardware and eventually became the center of the effort to replace dumb terminals with intelligent workstations. Our recommendations influenced many hardware and software purchase decisions."
good,"The company had 10,000 or so Customer Service Reps working phones and logging to a variety of systems everyday, somewhere between 10 and 25 depending of the reps individual responsibilities. The company had just gone from dumb terminals to Windows desktops for every service rep, which is something I helped facilitate. The windows desktops enabled a single sign on system so the reps wouldn't have to remember 10 to 25 passwords. There many OEM packages for that today, but there wasn't in 1998. I wrote a web based  administration package in Cold Fusion that helped streamline the administrative groups efforts. I also made enhancements to desktop piece of the system in C++"
good,"Note: Qwest Communications doesn't exist anymore."
good,On a daily basis I am required to work with multiple individuals throughout the company and also independently to complete desired tasks of my supervisors. There has never been a time where I did not meet a deadline on a task and I can attribute that to the wonderful employee base at CenturyLink. Their willingness to help each other out never ceases to amaze me.

good,"The learning opportunities were endless, I love that about any place! I wish they had a call center in Oklahoma! I loved working here."
good,"I really enjoyed the job, especially being able to talk to the customers and being able to assist them.  The only thing I didn't enjoy the job was when a customer really wanted a product but wasn't able to make the deposit. The customer was not happy because they couldn't get the product and it made it harder for me to meet my sales quota."
good,"receive calls from techs from over 18 states regarding service upgrades and disconnects, new service, etc. must make call quotas, operate in a multi-screen PC environment. Lots of mandatory overtime, lots of re-training for new systems."

good,"My theory is that leading is how you would like to be lead.  Endorse the same principals, morals and ethics as you would expect."
good,"Answer inbound call regarding customers’ phone bill"
good,Worst thing were the customers. Loved the people especially my supervisor. Wish I still worked there.
good,I work with a great group of people.  I am fortunate to manage a great team in the Financial Operations organization.
good,"Highly focused and motivated Telecommunications Engineering and Construction support, able to work both independently and collaboratively in a variety of settings, conditions and environments.

Management was very helpful and attentive with customer issues. I appreciated all the help they gave us and also the friendship of the co-workers.  A great group of people. The hardest part of the job was the call volume when there was a storm. The most enjoyable was the rewards and recognition for doing an outstanding job.

good,I get to work a few hours before the doors open to the public.We have a meeting before the doors open to let us know the specifics about the event we are having for the night. I then go to my spot which is usually at the front doors and I get the patrons in as quickly and efficiently as possible. I check the bags and purses for anything not allowed in the facility. We also to pat down on some shows. I then ensure that the patrons are safe during and then while leaving the arena. I also do any other duties that are asked of me by my manager.

I was a three-time awards winner for excellent customer service."
good,"Designed in OSPFM various HiCap circuits, placed fiber and copper fed remote terminals, SHARP/SHIN rings and direct fed fiber and copper services to businesses and some homes. Although I was primarily a drafter, I handled many other aspects of the process such as pricing, project management, and implementation. And of course “other duties as assigned” such as training, group leading, and supervising when my superior was away,"
good,"Retention work, customer service, data entry, mutiline phone use."
good,"great company to work for, excellent training program, great Benefits, Promotions, Career development, Above normal pay scale."

good,"Excellent Pay, Great Benefits. Good shifts after time."
good,its a job surrouded by great and telented poeple hopefully they can keep em.
good,"Qwest was an exciting place to work, and we accomplished excelent sales results in a short period of time. After the US West acquisition, there were many changes since Qwest was a much larger company at that point. The US West acquisition was a good move since it allowed Qwest to weather the Telecommunications downturn after 2000. Qwest is now part of CenturyLink which is a fast growing and well run company."
good,"Time was short but enjoyed it overall, would recommend to others to work there. Network operations center is very impressive and people are very friendly."
good,I love working at CTL. They have a really good work environment. They love their interns and also make decisions to convert the interns into full time employees.

good,"Working to assure the Local Area Network has the backup battery power to run during unforeseen outages is the best job I have held in telecommunications.  During my tour of duty, I was able to volunteer to work in other positions inside the company.  This volunteering enabled me to further my career path.  Sometimes I wish I could return to my job, truck and the customers whom grew to know over the 5 years in this position."
good,"The company provided a great career for my family for years. Just too many layoffs to keep any job security there in this market. If you enjoy a challenging environment, this is definitely your place to work."
good,"Level 3 is not the place to work for everyone.  That being said, if you are a type ""A"" personality with an insatiable drive to succeed, Level 3 will provide compensation commensurate with how much of yourself you are willing to put in to it.  There is an attempt to support a better work/life balance, but in order to truly be successful, ""life"" will need to take a back seat.  If you are hungry, Level 3 will reward you, but there is a lot of churn and burn out unless you are willing to put 100% of yourself into your role"
good,"When in repair you all work together as a team, helping each other improve and it's honestly like having a big work family. I learned so much and you always continue to learn when new updates come out for devices. I think the worst part is dealing with the angry customers who are beyond ridiculous but as long as you are charismatic and good with people anyone can do it. The only thing I found irritating was communication, if they came out with new equipment or moved servers repair is never informed and the team just kind of figures it out as they go."
good,"I loved the company and its benefits, but the technical support department did not really invest in its workers.  It can be tough dealing with negativity all day-everyday, and it would be nice to have something in the workforce, like incentives to work toward, more goody days, and ways to know that we are actually cared for.  You can get more juice from a lemon that you actually invest the time of squeezing."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Level 3. I would work for them again. I only left because my program ended. That said, I worked an average of 60 hours per week. I did get overtime, but it will wear on you."
good,"Centurylink is a wonderful place to work. The pay is great and the sales compensation is amazing. a typical day at work is answering 30-60 inbound sales lead calls. offering products and services on each and every call and answering general customer concerns. I learned how to make sales and offer on each and every call. The management was amazing and the culture was as well. The hardest part about the job is meeting the sales goals in the first and second month, but after you get the hang of the sales business it becomes very easy. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly co-workers and management."
good,"Offered business's telecom solutions ranging from collocation, VOIP phone systems, bonded T1's , local services as well as long distance"
good,"I was a cashier and in customer service so a typical day at work would consist of checking the customers out, keeping the front of the store clean and also my area. Making sure that the go backs were organized as well. It was my first job and it taught me on how to work, how to be efficient and also on how to work as a team and also individually. My co-worker were great, there was a lot more interaction as it is a smaller store. The hardest part of the job was when I just started I had a hard time meeting my time goal on checking out the customers. The most enjoyable part was on how great the team was with eachother."
good,Good company for telecommunication company working in 30 states. Work 50-60 hours a week some time work on weekends with the fixed salary no over time for regular emplyee.
good,Prefer not to review
good,Steady job hours and constant work. Provides health/dental/vision coverage at good rates. The new center manager does care about the culture of the center and tries to make improvements when they can.
good,"When I was working at Centruylink it was a very fun place to work. We had weekly meetings and monthly dinners. On Monday we had team meetings and we reviewed our weekly schedules. We would have funnel reviews to share what we are brining to close that week. We would share why we think the deal might close.We would sit down with  the engineering team to pre game customer meetings. The sales engineering team would attend every sales call. They would help develop a plan and a solution to the clients issues. "
good,Love love loved working for century link! Loved it didn’t mind the drive either ! Thennn they had to transition us to work from home... great co workers to be around ! Great laid back work environment!
good,"Company processes and policies undergo frequent changes due to the acquisition of Level 3 Communications, so initial training can seem quite daunting at times. "
good,"I only lasted a year before Century Link laid me off.  I was a lead for my team and a lot was expected including 24 hour on call and weekend OT. "
good,"ctl is a good place to work, great money (they're all about money), they try to make it fun daily. they do push to sale, very fast paced, can get slow at times. mandatory ot every monday, paid training."
good,The company is ok to work for the pay is cool. The issue is the training. you are asked to meet multiple goals but are not provided with enough training to understand you scope of work.
good,"CenturyLink was an awesome place to work. The supervisors always had games to play against different teams which made working fun. "
good,Always have a certain amount of products to sell and also win prizes at work for most sold. commission on all sales made. Weekly meetings and monthly meetings for whole company to keep up with stats and new policy.
good,Currently are combining the acquisition of another company and eliminating many CenturyLink Positions which I don't think is fair. We purchased the other company and it seems like they are keeping more of their employees than ours.
good,Great job never missed a day. Enjoyed going to work with fellow techs. Most supervisors were great to work and knew what kind of work environment we worked in and understood the situations.
good,"Centurylink is a company where everyone helps out every one to succeed at the mission that we are tasked to complete.  Team oriented work with others that gain knowledge amongst different platforms working with Cisco, Juniper, Alcutel, VPN's, MPLS, WAN/LAN, Firewall, and much more."
good,"It's a good place to work, being outside has it's con's and pro's living in Minnesota but overall the job is good....OT is available if you want it, being forced to work OT a times gets challenging. I think upper management has too many chains, no need to have so many. Hardest part is the weather here being outside placing aerial cable in -40 degree cold. I think enjoyable is doing your own thing, working outside when it's 75 and sunny. I don't know where you can get paid 31$ an hour with no college, so thats a huge deal. "
good,Traning was availible from vendors. Had vendors on site when needed. People were good to work with as a team. Everyone will  to assist on any problem.
good,"I worked during a time of rapid consolidation in the telecommunications.  Century Link was the last buyer of the company I started with and seem to be doing well with the pieces they picked up.  During the mergers I worked, it was a time of madness and layoffs.  First madness as the current management tried to make the bought company look good, jumping from one direction to the next without a clue and then layoffs as the new company tried to trim cost and consolidate.  The 1990s were not a fun time to work in the telecom industry."
good,"fun and laid back call center, nice management and good coworkers"
good,"Responsible for fielding inbound calls from potential and existing customers and selling CenturyLink products and services on every call."
good,Getting paid to go to school. Learen something new everyday
good,"The job consisted of driving to the customers homes and informing them of service updates being done to the area. I learned great communication skills and I enjoyed what I did. The pay was great, the chance to go to different cities was awesome an my boss was incredible. "
good,Overall Centurylink was a very good company to work for. The money was good however the demand due to being short staffed at some points was very unrealistic. The pay compensation was cut back and our marketing calls were taken away so it made it extremely difficult to even get a sale. However our sales quota stayed the same and people started losing their jobs. Our pay was dropped and because of the problems with sales most people made half as much or less than what they were making in the months before.
good,"A place to stay busy. Access to the edge network along with customer CPE. Circuit testing, remedy tickets for router/switch/firewall changes and on call 24/7 for network support."
good,"took incoming calls for telephone, internet and cell phones. I had to meet sales goals while providing excellent customer service?"
good,Great company and income potential pending on sells. Excellent platform to working for a great company
good,"I take calls for sutomer service on accounts and I offer items to add to account.. I get to make my own schedule on part time, it has no benifits but is a great job till I find a ful time one.."
good,On a typical day I would answer calls and tell customers about our product and service. Advise what would be best for them. Consulted and then used a variety of closing techniques.
good,I loved working for Centurylink. The manager was very nice and understanding of real life issues. She was firm but fair and very easy to talk to. I recommend this company for employment. I wish I was still there.
good,"Good people, dedicated work place, customer service driven, good work life balance. Lots of passionate people with a deep history of customer service excellence"
good,"Fun environment co workers were awesome, Team atmosphere, Buying experience was very beneficial at work and every day life.  Started in the call center at Sprint and all of m time bridged from Sprint, Sprint Nextel, Embarq and then early retirement from Centurylink."
good,"I love this job, the employees and the management. We work closely with customers about their billing questions, new installs, new orders, tech appointments,  etc. I am leaving because I need job security, as this job relys on sales."
good,"The incentives were amazing, lots of good friends and a great environment. Would recommend for anyone who is looking to get into the call center and sales field."
good,a typical work day would include answering 60-75 calls a day employee meeting 1 hour lunch interact with fellow co workers also was able to win bonuses and end of year vacation
good,job security; benefits; no micro management; update training; pension plan; overall a good company; provide all the tools/equipment required to do the job
good,"Great Place to work. Fellow employees are great."
good,Enjoyed working with CenturyLink but am not qualified to answer questions concerning full time employment. Was given great latitude in making business decisions.
good,Centurylink is like most corporations this area. I feel I have a fairly decent job for this area but I want more. I would recommend centurylink to any one because you make a decent living.
good,I enjoyed working at the stadium home of the Seahawks. Co workers were friendly. Management was cool and very helpful. Loved the atmosphere and hours.
good,Competitive sales environment. Constant change. Metric based incentives. Managers hit or miss as to good. Weekly and monthly meetings outside of regular schduled hours are mandatory.
good,"I learned so much at centurylink. When I started there I had no idea how to use a computer and now i am experienced in Microsoft office.The work place was quiet and very friendly. Management was good, but tried to be flexible."
good,"At CenturyLink, your time is valuable, whether it be being on time or on the phones. A lot is expected, yet as an employee, you get a lot back. There is tuition reimbursement after one year, great health insurance that pays you to be healthy, and great camaraderie with your fellow employees"
good,"Working security issues at Century Link Field was an incredible adventure, never knowing what would happen next. I learned every area of this venue, from alcohol control to looking for suspicious packages, crowd control, and people management."
good,"Was gone before the merger but was solid leader in telecom and managed type services, Great knowledgeable staff and resources. Poor local management very greedy and ever changing. Sounds like things are getting better and jobs are appearing more often."
good,"Great company! They do value their employees as their greatest asset. If you want a lot of work to do and keep busy, this is the place for you."
good,Centurylink is a great place to work and start your career.  Advancement to the top is there but does get crowed very fast.
good,"I loved the benefits here, you get base pay plus commission, vacation, paid holidays, paid time off, tuition reimbursement. The sales goals are not outrageous."
good,"I have always said that the worst day at the airlines was better than any bad day at any of my other jobs. Absolutely loved this job. United however, I felt could have been better to their own employees as far as travel goes. But overall, great job to have."
good,"I was great at my job but then the company closed the call center.  I would have died there.  It was a great experience,  I enjoyed the calls that came through."
good,Qwest provides a fast paced environment with areas to expand and excel professionally.  This is a great job for goal oriented persons that like being rewarded for success.
good,"I had a great time working here, the reason I had to consider other options is that there are no methods for advancement to take into consideration within the company. Very minimalistic area of growth for the company at this time."
good,"Well paid and fun job - only downside was jobs ran in batches and always required travel. Upside, I traveled. Co-workers were fun to work with and on several jobs we were given partners to travel with. I enjoyed the travel and Job. The company paid food, lodging and fuel cost for the travel."
good,"Worked as a supervisor in the graveyard started as an operator and worked my way up to supervisor, I gave a 110 % and when I was needed I was there. I was not afraid of getting my hands dirty and was willing to go the extra mile. This job was very busy and time sensitive handling calls for long distant. With over 150 operators at any given time."
good,Great place to work at the pay is fantastic.On a typical day I would speak to 200 people and take care of basic needs.Hardest part of my job was giving the customer everything that they wanted and at cheap price.Most enjoyable part of my day is when I could make a move that would benefit the customer and save the money.
good,This was by far the best company to work for.  It is union based so job security would depend on the contract.
good,"Very funny atmosphere, Upbeat sales and very competitive and awards where good. It was a great place to work until they closed."

good,"I have nothing negative to say. Life at CenturyLink is what you choose to make of it.  If you are innately negative then your experience will be negative. However if you put the customer first, and remain positive your experience will be positive."
good,"Nice place to enjoy the work life balance "
good,"Great place to work, along the line of great compensation and benefits. The only thing I would say is that if management would not give up on their employees as early as they are they would see success in them."
good,"On a typical day at Centurylink, you could expect to put in a full day of work with conference calls, one on one communication with co-workers/supervisors, lots of learning opportunities and great benefits."
good,"Good company, needs work in company culture. Put employees more of the focus of the company and not just on shareholders and clients. This will help the company improve."
good,"I was going through a lot, so I was extremely depressed. I also have really bad anxiety... They were not understanding of how bad my home life effected me at work... They just wanted to know what was going on with my situation to use it against me."
good,"I was acquired as an employee along with all Level 3 employees on November 2017.  I lost my position when CenturyLink moved my job to their corporate location in Tulsa, OK.  I loved my job but could not move to Tulsa."
good,"If you are sales driven it was a good place to work, need to stay focused. Good pay and incentives.  The benefits are awesome and the environment was fun to work in. Like any job it has it’s down falls but overall good choice"
good,No company is perfect and Century Link has certainly been through changes as with any company in the Telecom industry.  If I could transfer and stay with the company I would.
good,It was a great experience with amazing coworkers. It was both challenging and fun. The company is striving to become a progressive and effective giant in the telecom space.
good,"Great for a fun social part time job."
good,"Qwest was an enjoyable place to work with a relatively small size work population.  Over the years Qwest merged with Centurylink and became a little more formal, but still a very good place to work.  Two mergers later after Centurylink merged with Level 3, I got laid off and forced into retirement due to a force reduction."
good,"CTL  is a very laid back place to work where you are treated like an adult . They pay pretty decent and have a lot of company discounts and perks,  CTL  is a good place to work."
good,The job is a great position with great pay. The job is high stress and fast paced. They do compensate well for the stress and time. They also paid compensation on things you sold.
good,"Security Job wise, Its nice, quiet, slow paced environment. Come in do your job and go home. Not much interaction with employees. "
good,This is a fine place to work and for some reason I can not submit a resume to indeed.com without leaving a minimum 150 word reveiw of my current employer.
good,Very fast paced days with 3-4 appointments (new business) as well as managing a module of existing customers which made for very busy days.  Enjoyed the fast pace along with great interaction with management.
good,"Been here over 36 years, I’ve seen a lot of changes over the years and not for the better. However, the work environment has also changed a great deal and by industry standards, I feel we are fairly compensated for what we do, especially when compared to other companies out there."
good,The overall job was great.  Just didn't like the management and the fact that their were no sick time off.  A lot of misunderstanding in the work place.
good,Qwest was a very good company to work for. The NOC presented itself well to visiting customers and the work environment was very balanced. Lots of changes in Management.

good,"It was a productive and fun place to work. Learned the importance of Team work within Departments as well as co-workers.

good,"Great coaching to mentor you to your next position.  Team ready to assist when needed. Reports, expenses, oh, we need more paper.  I learned to set priorities and deadlines.  I work with some of the best teams in the company.  Making their numbers means I take the administrative items off their desk and let them sell."
good,An excellent place to work at. Very freindly atmosphere. State-of-the-art technologies and system. Very bright resources.
good,O good company worked in the Union and had the best benefits of my career there.  Tough to implement changes for the good.  Tough to stand out as everyone was on the same playing field

good,Helped customers with account changes. Sold services setup installation. 
good,It was a great job with many challenges and i loved to work for customer service.
good,this company cares about their employees in the local office
good,"Most enjoyable part of Temping, I was able to experience all types of postions Admin Assistance, Receptionist, Data Entry, Secretary positions. As well as meeting new people and getting to learn what they do at a day to day basis. The hardest part was leaving that position to engage in another assignment for reason that it was only a temp position. Not long-term."
good,"the company is great they give alot for their employees they have ping pong tables, pool table, computers you can get on when your on break but as far as management they dont care to much for error"

good,"I learned a lot from my recent company like team work, learn new tools, adjustable co workers, helping each other, and flexible work environment."
good,Loved working there leaving because job is surplused in September
good,Great company with great history. Longevity of employment is very long term for many call center reps. Some with over 30 years and very easy to manage and create relationship with.
good,"I worked for this company for 3 years. Most of my work experience was positive. My only real issue was when my Mom took ill and I needed a change of schedule, it was a problem."

good,"I was there until about 6/7 months after the Level 3 Merger- my position was a casualty of the reorganization... it comes with the territory. Notwithstanding, I enjoyed my tenure."
good,"I was able to take advantage of a generous tuition reimbursement benefit. I finished a degree and within a few months was promoted to a management position. First as a supervisor, than managing my location. I was able to put into practice what I learned and was able to help others who worked under me develop skills and become promoted to other positions within the company."
good,"CenturyLink enabled me to gain a ton of experience managing my own accounts as well as working with other AM's and AD's to partner on accounts. If you work hard, you will be rewarded and compensated."
good,"I worked for these folks for 30 years…that speaks for itself!  I worked hard, was promoted throughout my career. I was rewarded greatly. The hardest part was when the union went on strike. It was hard for everyone but with great team work we always got through. I miss it."
good,No chance for advancement but pay was great for the first 2 years management is amazing Corporate aspect not so much!!! If they took better care of their current employees their turnover rate would not be as high!
good,Indeed is requesting a review of a company that I worked for years ago and it is not relevant anymore.  Centurylink has been through many changes since that time.
good,It is a great job to work for and once you have been there a while you can make some good money. Their rules do change quite a bit which can be discouraging and it really sucks just sitting in a chair almost all day.
good,"I glad to work over there., it's a good environment to work over there in a friendly manner with colleagues, workplace culture was so quiet and in a corporate lifestyle."
good,"Centurylink is some days fast-paced, some days slow-paced, since working at CenturyLink I've gained a lot more customer service and more experience on retaining a customer. The hardest part about working at CenturyLink would trying to retain customers who've heard the same thing a lot of times but the problem was never resolved as promised, but I can say that I enjoy fixing the problem when given the oppurtunity to do so."
good,"Being a global leader in its field, there are many opportunities to learn about many different jobs areas within the company. It is also a very fun place to work."
good,Centurylink was great to work at and provided a very laid back environment. The training period was amazing as well. But the management lacked direction and don't provide resources to win.
good,"many great years ,Lineman,installer,splicer and a broadband tech.Loved my job  did all that was expected of me and more. Helping customers was upmost."
good,There are initiatives that require resources. With budget cuts the resources are dwindling and projects are getting cut. I hope funding turns around post Level3 merger.

good,"Close was kind of quick paced but otherwise a relaxed atmosphere."
good,"This is a growth through acquisition company that provides plenty of challenge with IT conversion and integration work.  The local business is waning but the ever growing national and global network provides future growth and the business constantly reinvents itself.  If you like change, you will like CenturyLink."

good,"Here, I took customer phone calls about internet problems with DSL line, troubleshoot over the phone, dispatched, and helped with account information."

good,"A typical day at the CenturyLink Corporate Headquarters is marked by friendly professionals in a low stress environment. The management structure seems to be more carrot inclined than stick, and genuinely interested in each employees personal wellbeing. I'd say the people (contemporaries, and management) were my favorite part of working at the main campus. The new facilities are quite nice, also."
good,"As I have never worked in a call center before, I had a problem of wanting  to troubleshoot beyond my scope. I found that the majority of the managers were able and willing to try to assist all their direct reports and as in life some were better than others"
good,Latest Merger includes Level 3 Inc. after acquiring Qwest and Embarq in rapid succession. Challenges included the marrying of various systems. Company is currently downsizing work force by 4000

good,"Empresa com ótimo ambiente de trabalho, com uma visão diferenciada das demais, propicia total conforto e liberdade para seus colaboradores se expressar e apresentar suas visões sobre tais assuntos pertinentes ao mercado."
good,I really enjoy working at CenturyLink.  The co-workers and management are really great.  I learn more and more each day.  The most enjoyable part is the people that I work with.  The hardest part is the hours.  I work 11:30am to 8:00pm and on Saturdays with those hours.  I have two small children and being a single mother it is starting to take a toll on us as a family.
good,"Centurylink is a company that makes its employees feel valued, appreciated, and like their work matters. Management allows you into their lives all while getting to know you personally."

good,"Very friendly people - both locally and company-wide"
good,"Approximately 60 customers per day reporting problems with account or trouble with their service. I would resolve issues and/or troubleshoot problem and if needed, dispatch tech to resolve. Hardest part was diffusing irate customers with long history of trouble with service. The best part was finding a resolution that satisfied the customer while still keeping the business profitable."
good,"pues es un trabajo en el que me gusta estar por que tengo compañerismo y la interaccion entre nos otros es muy buena, la parte mas dificil seria cuando las lineas estan saturadas de llamadas , lo que mas me gusta es que dia con dia hablo con diferentes personas de muchas partes de estados unidos y de otros paises, y eh aprendido que nunca terminare por aprender algo nuevo cada dia"
good,"Monitored Data Center Systems, Devices, and configured all new customer equipment."
good,"The experience at CenturyLink was always fast paced but the management did their best to make it fun and comfortable. There is plenty of opportunity to advance within the company, although there may be plenty of people applying for the same position. The job itself was not hard just tedious and long days. Learned a lot about what its like to work in a call center. The most enjoyable thing about the job is that the management truly rewarded the employees for jobs well done."
good,great company... great leadership... great coworkers... I wish the department didnt close down because I would still be with the company

Conduct collection and performance review analysis for management to improve employee performance. Developed and train new employees to the escalation desk. I enjoy helping customers and others with complex accounts and feeling the sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. My co workers are very positive and enjoy working with them daily. They are my extended family and I get along with everybody. I have learned all there is to learn about the consumer financial services aspect of this organization and enjoy putting my expertise to use. The hardest part of my job at times is not able to please all the customers who do request a manager. At times their requests are unattainable and I am not always able to grant them what they request. However, those that I can help bring me a sense of accomplishment and happiness. I am glad that I am able to change someones day for the better and many times give them a sense of relief and show them that we care. I also enjoy working with management and Im grateful for all the trust they put in me, and all the growth opportunities they have given me."

good,"i have worked for Centurylink for 5 years and though It is a great company to work for with competative wages. They are poorly structured which causes a poor customer experience= a lot of explaining for you to do, It feel like you have to jump through hoops to ensure that your customers are taken care of."
good,"At CTL the work conditions are ideal for advancing because there are many advanced technologies  incorporated into the system allowing engineers such as myself to learn new technologies."

good,Enjoyed working at the firm. Excellent opportunity and I fared exceptionally well in this team approach and team management style.  I look forward to returning to the firm and winning business.

good,"Great pay, amazing hours day shift only occasional on call some overtime but overall an amazing place to work. The biggest downfall is that they do layoffs and if you’re low on the totem pole you always have to worry about getting let go"
good,Hard employment but very lucrative. It took a while to learn the position but helped me with gaining sales training healthcare bonus and prepaid incentive visa cards. They took the time to train.
good,"Interning at CenturyLink was certainly an overall enjoyable experience. I was offered the opportunity to improve my technological skills and learn about new ideas by tackling and researching for our diverse projects. I was also given a taste of working in a professional environment by working a 8-5, but each day was filled with excitement. I highly recommend interning at CenturyLink."
good,"A typical day at Centurylink for me is coming into work and immediately checking my outlook calendar to see what times I have scheduled meetings. Next, I check my emails and respond to everything that came in over night. Once I go through all the emails, I open all my links I use for the day and login to see my workload for the day and make sure I get at least half of my workload finished before lunch break. After lunch break I continue to monitor and manage my emails for the day, and finish my workload up for the day. I will get phone calls and Skype messages from customer managers throughout the day that I have to check on orders and provide immediate updates per requests. My manager has an open door policy, which is fantastic, and all of my co-workers are nearby so we can talk to each other about any problems, questions, or advice we may have.  Every one on my team is knowledgeable, considerate, accountable, and helpful. The flexibility and option to work from home is the best part of my job."
good,It was fun seeing different people/meeting new people. Along with being able to see concerts and games. The down part is that there are no perks like discounts on things like even food.

good,"I honestly loved working there. If the department I was working in wouldn't have shut down I would still be there.  Even though I had to deal with people and the problems they were having with their services I always stayed positive. There was many times when some of the clients were very mad, and even though it wasn't my fault, I tried to calm them down and get them to understand what was going on and that we would do everything we could to help solve the issue."
good,Love the comfort of the job and how easy it was to make money. Applying yourself basically gets you some type of bonus or accolade. I loved the experience.
good,I worked at century link for 37 years. The job was rewarding with good benefits. I started as an engineer then I was on engineering staff then I was a District Planner and also an instructor. I was responsible for designing facilities. I scheduled meetings for vendors while working on Staff. I was responsible for the planning and budget while in planning. I conducted training classes from Ohio to Florida as an instructor.

good,"Work life balance and union for employees. Every so many month your get pay increases."

good,"My expertise was valued at Centuylink.  I was left alone and trusted with the job at hand. My contract was only for 6 months, however, Management was so pleased with my work my contract was extended 4 times, a total of 2 years. My duties varied from administration, coding, migration, upgrades and teaching WebFOCUS to Centurylink employees."
good,"a typical day at work helping customers with their bills and to upsell any products not on their accounts."
good,"Company has no clear direction.  A lot of uncertainty after the Level 3 merger. "

good,"Great company to work for.  PTO accumulates quickly, steady job, good pay, great training.   The job is very technical, but they make sure you are prepared for the challenges"
good,"It was a great place to work. Over all, I worked in the communications industry over 40 years.  Started as a Plant Reports Clerk and advanced to Technician.  The last 30 years was working in the technical arena.  Mostly testing and turning up DS0 and DS1 equipment."
good,It was a good work environment and work experience. I was able to learn how to separate all the charges in the bills and break them down for the customers.
good,Advanced with company by working hard and closing big deals as those that were successful were given opportunity for advancement and higher paying positions with more responsibilities.  Very good environment where everyone was working to try and meet quotas.

good,"Good company for work"
good,"My biggest regrets are leaving this company. Have not found one as good since. They have several call centers around the country. I worked in a call center in central pennsylvania. Our call center had all the benefits of a great workplace. Company sponsored parties, Spacious cubicles, little management oversight, open cafeteria, workout rooms, it even had a small room with a cot just in case of emergencies, or needing to sleep at the office."
good,"Answered inbound calls from customers pertaining to local land line telephone service repair "
good,"it was a great place to work you could listen to your music while getting your work done, i learned that if you put your head phones in you get a lot more work done because you are focus on the task at hand and you drawn  out the co workers"
good,"Steady work and good training . Great company to work for. progressive in the telecom industry. Great leadership and team to execute company's goals and plans. "

Management has built a culture of Unifying Principles that are great guidelines for work life.  Every job has its issues and CenturyLink is constantly striving to improve which has made me a long term employee (20+ years).  Management continually grows the company
good,"Typical day was reviewing order process and making any changes to improve, meeting with upper management to review department needs, meeting with staff to insure team environment. Responding to customer issues. Contractual reviews. This was my first implementation of the KPI system to assess and evaluate my staff. Was able to stabilize all orders both national and international from 5 days/5 months turn around to 24 hours. The challenge was personel issues. There was lots of favoritism and no recognition at all. Did a full reorganization to the department that proved very successful and developed a mutual feeling of self worth to the employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was the day ( 90 days from my start date) the VP and Director acknowledged my success for the company."
good,"I drive a company vehicle, interacting with customers to better their experience with the internet. Coordinate with other departments when there is an issue with wiring in the field or with programing issues with the business office. I help interface our equipment with the equipment of customers to connect and maintain connection to the internet. I facilitate and repair phone systems in buildings."

good,"I worked with CenturyLink for over 14yrs.  I started in the call center then moved to Retail Store.   The retail store position was the best due to the co workers became like family.  Love the customer face to face interaction, also worked events, and volunteered.  As of sept 04 2015 CenturyLink restructured and decided to close all the retail stores and only have call centers.  I was given the option to go back to call center so I cannot be to negative.  Over all great experience with CenturyLink"
good,"Was very exciting to work look forward to the day. My job was very important, a great deal of responsibility. Middle management was fantastic. Co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part was being on-call 24/7. The most enjoyable was the independence."

good,It was a great place to work. I loved my job and the people I worked with. The only reason I'm not working there anymore is the company moved the work to South Dakota and there are not a lot of openings in Seattle.

good,"Although I didn't agree with sales tactics in some realms, I really enjoyed my time with this company.  Everyone was family and the supervisors really cared about you and did everything they could to assist you."
good,Great place to work but hard to meet the quota for assessment. The managment is the best I have ever seen in a call center!

good,I liked cetruylink because of the work environment and the opportunity to make unlimited commission.
good,"This position requires the ability to adapt to customers demands, the company's evolving procedures and products and everyday issues to arise.  I love the hands on approach of this job, working with customers, different departments within the company and senior management to resolve issues and create new opportunities. I am responsible for inventory management, training contractors about our IPTV service and DSL service, working on Chronic issues affecting our customers, and working with vendors to fix and test equipment needed to complete our daily tasks. I am still responsible for completing the daily task placed behind me while completing projects assigned to me as well. The most enjoyable part of the work day is figuring out a customer's problems and seeing their reaction once their issue is resolved. CenturyLink has a very tight niche team that works wells together to install or repair products our residential and business customer have. Management tries to accommodate each technician's lively occurrences while addressing the customer's demands. They try to make our jobs easier and most of us see and appreciate their involvement."

good,CenturyLink is growing each day with many job opportunities.
good,"My previous experience at Qwest was fulfilling knowing that I was doing what I wanted to be doing. I was working with people who became life friends and I still speak with today. The customer contact skills I learned are invaluable, even pertaining to daily life. I enjoyed working in an office setting with several people working together toward one goal and in an environment which everyone can learn. Management was fully trained and capable of stepping in with assistance when needed. Going to work everyday and being with people I could teach new things to, or learn from, was the reason I looked forward to going back each day. The only thing that was hard to adjust to was a changing work schedule that occurred with daylight savings time."
good,Wonderful company to work for. Great management on the sales side of the house.
good,"A typical day consisted of me starting up my computer, and checking in with my supervisor and co-workers via email."
good,Managed a team of 20 sales reps

good,"Learning opportunities Work Life balance Cafeteria is good Good culture"
good,enjoyed my time with the company but had to re-sign due to medical reasons but they have great benefits and is family friendly.  Management is the best I've had in a long time very down to earth and open to suggestions if any issues came up. Always had incentives and family fun days if traffic was really bad due to accident or weather they let you make your time up. Offers overtime in other departments and you don't work on weekends.
good,All of my reviews were rated from mid to high. I am the only person I know of who was able to port over 500K telephone numbers without error over a four and a half year period of time.
good,"Sales job, so you get out what you put in. If you follow the process and do your job, you'll yield great results! Great Management but benefits are a bit expensive and frat boy sales culture"
good,"Until Level3 merged in."
good,"Wonderful place to work, great money. Down side some of the management is fake. But others is true blue and really cares about your success. Insurance is not good. Would not pay for simple scripts. But over all I would recommend working there. Meet a lot of great people."
good,This is better then a lot of call centers i have previously been at. they are very strict with tardiness but if you show up on time all the time no worries!
good,"I worked for U S West for 8 years, I was hired by Qwest and was able to bridge my time with U S WEST.  My career experience continued to grow and I received a few promotions.  I had a great career, build great customer relationships.  i was laid off in 2010, however I wanted to continue to work, as there were others who were retirement eligible."
good,I enjoyed my time with Centurylink. It was a great job with great benefits. The management chain is superb. I want to relocate to south Florida. That's the only reason im leaving.
good,One of the best places that I have ever worked at. The managers were very understanding. The employees were like family. The hours are good for those with children. The pay is pretty competitive.
good,Working in the call center is tough sometimes and fast paced but it is rewarding when you hit your goals. The new leaders in Small Business have really made a difference in the culture. I like the company and hope to grow into bigger roles.
good,"this is not working, i am not going to write a review at this time, I am not sure why it wont let e stop typing at this time it should just let me finish"
good,The company overall is a good place to work but the way things are done is very poorly. You will always have the opportunity to change your work but you have to be careful to make sure this is a postions that is going to last

good,A typical day started around 8am getting the day organized.

good,I enjoyed working at Centurylink because it didn't matter who the manager was or the different backgrounds we all came from the only thing that mattered was what you know and are you willing to learn.
good,"A typical day at work was logging into various platforms at start time."

good,"The day starts 15 minutes prior to clock in, to allow computer systems to load up and to log into system. Once all systems are ready, we ingage customers either by phone call or electronic mail. To substain customer relationships and increase company revenue through sales partnerships with consumer."
good,"Century Link is a very good place to work. However, My department which is new to CenturyLink underpays its employees. Other than that it is a great place to work."

good,"Centurylink is a company that is growing and has distinguished itself as a leader in the Industry."
good,This was already recorded on last sheet.  Overall. Great company.  Great management.  Great environment.  I had to relocate and move with spouse to LA.

It had an employee union, which provided me job security and outstanding benefits.  I worked with the biggest and best companies in Omaha to provide the most sophisticated fiber optic service available to speed their communication needs.  I had a lot of overtime, due to equipment failures, etc."
good,You get to learn a lot of stuff. But that is if you have time due to huge work load! You also get to work with a lot of great people that you feel very comfortable with.
good,"working at CenturyLink was a great experience, I acquired more experience in sales, by learning how to identify the customers needs, asking questions to get to the main point of what the customer wants, listening carefully every word the customer said so I could use it as an empowerment for the customer to buy. It was a great experience after all."
good,Was a good place to work.  No complaints.  My normal day I was allowed to come and go as I pleased and I was never micro managed.  I enjoyed that as I have a busy home life also and they were all about work life balance.
good,"I was part of a year long project that was interesting to work on and the people there were great.   In the end, management did an about face and ended the project in favor of an outside vendor -- this didn't make sense to anyone and the management team that made this decision was subsequently replaced."
good,Really loved working here. Great money. Great advancements. The only downfall is they are so sales driven that if you dont meet quota youre booted out and terminated.

good,"Worked over 21 years in Customer Service and enjoyed working, the pay was substantial enough to take care of my family.  However, my sadness moment was when my position outsourced."

good,Management genuinely cares about the advancement of it's employees. Free lunches and open PTO make it for a excellent place of employment. Salary is quite low though. Will be finding other employment if salary does not increase with the cost of living
good,"Work is cyclical feast or famine and can lead to stress if not properly prepared for the increases. Highly technical, detail intensive and helps if you have a base of knowledge associated to IT local networking. You can really excel if you work well with teams and are willing to go above and beyond your assigned duties. Best is to seek to know how your work relates to others related tasks so you can develop alliances with other teams. Seek to give others help or make it easier for them to complete their workload."
good,Great telecom to work for. Management is very fair and rewards high performers. Work life balance is good with a fair PTO policy and opportunities for advancement are there for people willing to work for them.

We logon to at least 10 programs every morning."
good,Management is supportive and easy to get along with. If you call off sick it is not a problem. It can sometimes be a problem to schedule time off but that is because uppermanagement will not allow them to higer more people so their hands are tied.
good,"Multinacional de grande porte, líder no mercado de Telecomunicações. Possui uma robusta infraestrutura de Data Center e grande variedade de produtos e serviços oferecidos aos Clientes."
good,"CenturyLink is a great place to work if you have a strong sales back ground. They have a fantastic environment that is very friendly. The management staff is absolutely wonderful and will go above and beyond to ensure you have a strong transition into the company. They offer many benefits including a 401k, Life insurance, Vision, Dental and Health insurance. I do have to say that has been to worst part of my entire experience at CenturyLink though. The Health benefits are ridiculous and excessively expensive. They do offer a medical expense card to help with the out of pocket cost but it still leaves you with a lot of cost that you are solely responsible for even after all that you pay for the insurance. I would biggest getting another insurance provider if you can. Other wise this is a Fantastic! company to work for. If you are looking for a company to retire from you would be hard set to find any other place that treats their employees more like family."

good,"I 'grew up,' professionally speaking, at USWEST (merged with Qwest). I went from remedial to management and worked my way through college. I truly valued USWEST and was devastated when my time ended. I worked with union represented employees, management, and executives. I worked with a wide diversity of people. Appreciate them all!!

On March 15, 2005, seven former Qwest executives were sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission., accused of a ""massive"" $3 billion financial fraud between 1999 and 2002.

Time management is critical as well as the ability to coordinate with different departments and organizations to ensure timely results."
good,">Empowering place to work at. "
good,"I'll like to work there again, because they've a lot of resources available to make your job better every day.  The continuous process of innovation of learning in all the organization helps to be an excellent professional."
good,Nice workplace with a very good management where we can learn new things every day. The employee are professional and it was always fun to have them around.
good,"Check email and voicemail.  Scrub orders submitted by the customer prior to submitting to provisioning.  Escalations, conference calls, scheduling, supping orders, submitting change order, etc."
good,Centurylink was a wonderful company to work for as I learned much from my team and management on how to apply my skills and become better at using them. A typical day would just be logging into the system and taking back to back calls from potential and existing customers on our services. They allowed me to learn different techniques on how to sell and understand the needs and wants of different customers from different backgrounds. Management was great as they always gave feedback on what can be improved and what I was doing well. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers and trying to find a way around their anger. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to be home.
good,"I say its a great place to work, since i have been there for over five years. it can be a demanding job and fast pace, but the people make it a great place to work."
good,"I loved my job,  it was competitive in a fun way. I would strive to hit sales goals because we were offered bonuses for sales. "
good,CenturyLink has an extremely professional atmosphere. The company offers great pay and benefits to it's employees. The training received at this company was excellent.
good,"I believe this is a job you have to WANT to be at. You definitely have to be a people person, meaning you can carry a conversation with people in all moods. You have to be able to adapt to change and really really try to understand how the service works because it will make your job so much easier. Use your resources. There is so much to know, it's crazy to expect you to know it all, you have a handbook that is basically CenturyLink Google. I dont care what anyone says, sales quota is VERY reasonable. I'm far from one of the top sellers but I have no problem reaching over 100% each month and I barely have to try. If you are amazing at customer service, you have basic computer skills and you are wanting and willing to learn how this company operates. It truly pays off. The benefits are unbelievable. The compensation is a whole extra paycheck a month. And the incentives are endless. I won an air fryer most recently. But they give TVs. Grills, roombas,  paid vacations, gift cards its unreal how much you are rewarded. This isnt a job you should get just to get.  But if you are wanting a Monday through Friday, set schedule and you are willing to learn, the days go by quickly. You get an hour lunch and you get to spend your whole day talking to people around the us. How cool is that? Seriously!"
good,"I literally grieved when I had to move out of the CenturyLink service area and had to quit.  The pay was good, the bonuses are awesome.  People would call in to start service and you could get commission for that. I hate selling and refuse to do it but I got commission for people calling in to buy a service without having to do anything but put in the order.  UPS lived at my house delivering bonus prizes, including a swimming pool!"
good,"There is always something to do....very rewarding career. I have been with the company 19 years, traveled the country, good salary, it is what you put into the job."
good,"Management was very helpful."
good,CenturyLink is the best place i have ever worked at. The most conducive working environment with much love and respect for all. Management very understanding and collaborative with everyone. Team work is the talk of every team.
good,"I would recommend this job to a friend. Great people , great culture! They always invested time to help me build my skills. I really enjoyed working for Century Link"
good,"Great pay and benefits. Very  relaxed place to work. Since merger with Level 3, there have been a lot of layoffs and uncertainty as to the security of jobs."
good,"I never had any issues at CenturyLink, I really enjoyed working there. It was especially fun being one of their top sellers and winning most of their prizes!"
good,The last year has been challenging. It will be better once all of the changes stop. The morale is pretty low now. I am ready for the changes to settle.
good,"Was lucky to work for great managers."
good,"I currently work at the boise Id location. The salary is only 15,00 an hour , but if you can sell the bonus program is amazing ! I made over 2k in bonus cash  last month and I have only been there a few months. You have  to have a strong work ethic, Show up on time etc. You only work Monday-Friday with evenings and weekends off. Paid Hollidays off and lots of Paid time off. The position is called Customer Service Rep.  but make no mistake it is sales and pays like a great sales position. Its a union job with a pension plan and great Benefits !"
good,"I have worked at CTL for 6 months. My Team is outstanding in the Boise office! You are supported, encouraged and coached by Management. I was welcomed by Team Members in a fun, quick paced and productive environment (never a dull moment.) Benefits are on par with the majority of large companies in the Boise area, however, work life balance is far superior. Balanced work week Mon-Fri with normal business hours, ample time off and compensated Holidays off as well. I would encourage anyone with a strong work ethic who enjoys a challenge to apply! The only con is no company provided parking .. the benefits however far out way the inconvenience of paying for parking."
good,Would definitely work here again. Met a lot of cool people & learned more about the tech world.                                                  Job location is great too.
good,"I loved working for this company. The employees are amazing and the culture is one of the best. I spent almost a decade here, and would work here again in a heart beat. I will say though, you get what you put in. If you are willing to put in the effort to move up in the company you will go far."
good,"Fast paced can be stressful if you get an upset customer but you have coaches readily available to help. "
good,Awesome job and great pay with commission as well . will not work around my school schedule this semester because it is hard to accommodate. plan to come back after graduation May 2019
good,"Great place to work, stips were great, and loved weekends off there were always thing to win, and we had mandatory meetings monthly to figure out what could be done better"
good,I had 44 years with the communications company.  They provided good pay and great atmosphere.  I am sorry I retired.  The management was great to work with and the coworkers were more like family.
good,"Good Work environment. Option for advancement early within career. Friendly workplace, Great benefits, Good communication between employee and management. Hires at young age, No experience needed with decent pay. Schedules go by seniority, no choice/options for schedule flexibility"
good,"At Qwest each day involved differing tasks, from meetings to the solitude of software development and design.  We needed to be able to function independently as well as with in differing teams."
good,Great company and benefits. Promotes primarily from within. Would highly recommended company to work for. Great team atmosphere with company activities and perks.
good,"They had an incredible training program before I began working, and the work environment was outstanding. I really respected and trusted my co-workers and managers."
good,most enjoyable  part of the job was getting to interact with the customer the satisfaction of knowing that you had the pleasure of assisting some one with something that improves the balance of their lives. The gratification of getting the opportunity to meet someone's demands and enjoying every moment of it.
good,"As Level 3 took over the remaining assets of ICG, we were excited by the opportunities presented while joining this world-class leader in carrier services. The focus was instead on consuming the remaining fiber assets of the company and offering third party access into substantial end-user locations."
good,"CenturyLink is a great place to work. The people are some of the best that I have ever worked with. It really feels like a family. The only downside is the lack of job security from the recent changes in company focus from telecommunications to cloud services. With the acquisition of Qwest, the company started going down hill and they have steadily been laying off people from the Local telephone section of the company."
good,"Work environment is ok, cubicle/pod life to the max.  There are days that calls are never ending and then days were it is kind of relaxed and low-key.  Managers or Supervisors are awesome to work with, always available for feedback or talks if you have concerns or questions."
good,"This is a continuance of same Job, Reported to work at Casino, managed my own self, rarely saw my boss, unless there was a need to contact him I worked directly with Casino Manager and managed all work"
good,A typical day at work consisted of taking calls and working through issues with customers while attempting to sell CenturyLink products and service to them. Weekly and monthly meetings with supervisors and managers. My supervisor was a great boss for a little over two years. There was consistent competitive culture in the building with sales quotas which drove many of the individuals that I worked with. The job itself was very easy which was enjoyable but the hardest or least enjoyable to say the least was dealing with irate customers.
good,"Day to day customer service skills required.  "
good,"Helpful people, good management, great benefits.  Highly recommend working here.  Was brought in as a temp and hired on direct after several months.  Only reason I left was to pursue management position somewhere else b/c no management position was available there at the time."
good,"If your strong suit is sales, GO FOR IT- AWESOME COMMISSION!"
good,The company offered a very competitive package and the money is very good but keeping up with the sales was very nerve racking and I stressed and strangled too much
good,"My reasons for wanting new employment is family loss related. As I have been working from home for the last six years, I was used to seeing my wife in the morning and evening and weekends. She did not survive this years flu season and now I am in this house alone at all times. I need to get out and the only option for me with CenturyLink is to move to St Louis, not going to happen. Otherwise I would stay with the company."
good,It was a great place to work. I had a great team and we all worked together to reach the ultimate goal of satisfying the customer. This company is family-oriented and has good benefits.

good,"Century-link is a fast paced, fun job. i would recommend to someone who has a full schedule available and is willing to dedicate a lot of their time and day to this job."
good,"This company with my upper manager was where I received my great experience.  I was well trained in people skills both to customers and employees, t I think is the most important asset."
good,"Each day I spoke to customers that wanted to cancel their services. My job was to convince them not to cancel, and to sell them additional products. It sounds miserable. This company set us up for success and made it enjoyable!"
good,"This company can and will kick start a career if you be equal effort into the role! I soared though the roles starting from Advance System Team, Small Business Retention Member to Offline Member doing Process flows, Technical Sheets and much more!"
good,I really enjoyed my time working at Qwest. The company employed great people that were highly intelligent and motivated. I still remain in contact with a lot of my coworkers from Qwest.

good,"Came in set up my day by seeing what accounts I was going to call on for a meeting . Look thru emails , Leads talk to my boss and review my activities for the day. I sold Long Distance Service via Phone and Conferencing to business ACCOUNTS in Manhattan. Tough job in sense since then competition was very aggressive with pricing. I enjoyed the job for many reasons. I made a lot of money won incentives to go on trips for free because company paid for them.  There compensation plan was fantastic. the health Benefits were very good as well. Hardest thing about the job was losing out on price when u know the customer wasn't getting everything he needed from the competition"
good,Great Company to Work For. Have built great relationships with senior leadership  as I delivered successfully on all high visibility projects. Environment is very fast paced and project requirements span form moderately complex to complex.

Training was little confusing, but job itself is easy. so you will learn quickly. Best Call Center I have every work with. Outstanding benefits.Only reason I left was that  started  full time school, and they don't have any part time position available at CenturyLink. "

good,"Processed Orders"
good,The job was simple and the managers left you along. I didn't really have a manager at night and we would go  out and eat or order lunch and could go out and pick it up.
good,Level 3 provided a new challenge each day.  I really appreciated the opportunity to learn about fiber optic technology and the equipment that was used to provide high speed fiber connections.  I provided graphic art work for Level 3 to depict their world-wide fiber network and for customer presentations.  The most difficult part of the job was learning the new systems and tools from multiple acquisitions.  My co-workers were an absolute joy to be associated with.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being trained on and utilizing fiber optic networks to a higher degree than in past carriers.
good,"A very good company.  This is a company people stay because they believe in the company. Fair wages , fair time off / vacation time."
good,Enjoyed my time at work and the people I worked with.  Management was always available when needed and were very supportive.

good,"My typical day at Qwest would start at 6am and end at 2:15pm-4pm. I learned how to run 4 out of 5 OPEX machines. Each machine served a different purpose for the mail (bill payments). Typically half the day would consist of running one of the machine and the other half would be 10-Keying payments into the computer to get them ready for the bank. If I was asked to run a machine after 10-Keying it would be getting the bank deposits ready to be picked up. I enjoyed all my co-workers and didn't have any problems with that but I was the youngest one there (I started when i was 16 years old) and everyone else was 30+. I loved my manager she was very friendly and easy to talk to and she listen to everything I had to say. The hardest part about my job I believe was learning all the machines and the codes / shortcuts for 10-keying, though I picked it up fairly quick and continued on to receive multiple awards for highest output with few errors. The part I enjoyed must about my job was working in an office setting but working alone.Which allowed me to focus only on what I was doing but being part of a group effort to get things done. I also enjoyed That I was off early enough to still do daily errands."

good,"Best company I have ever worked for. Fantastic vice president to work for. Encouraged and fostered learning and advancement. Co-workers really challenged you and worked well as a team. Most enjoyable part of the job was the industry and the professional level gave me responsibilities I thrive on.

good,I had a great management team to work with and for. I loved being able to help support them and the call center employees. I maintained reports to help the management staff to know where their team members were with their numbers. I maintained payroll for the management staff and myself.

good,"This is a call center but management makes it an extremely fun work environment. "
good,"I worked primarily with business-markets sales teams and product marketing management.  My goals were always to improve revenue, educate and enthuse the sales teams, and provide accurate reporting and ROI results to management.  My co-workers rocked!

There was plenty of space for my computer and 3 more if I needed. Surfing the internet was okay as long as it was job related. Which showed a huge sign of trust from the company itself when it came to the employees. Majority of the management teams did very well at their jobs and I really liked working there. Wish I would never have left. Very large breakrooms. Vending machines on every floor.

good,Spoke to over a 100 people by phone regarding their television and cable services.  I learned that if you take time to listen to an irate person you can achieve much more than you could imagine. The entire management team was and still is awesome.  I couldn't ask for better co-workers.  The hardest part was listening to people use terrible language when they were angry due to no fault of yours.  Talking to over 100 people everyday was most enjoyable.
good,Order circuits for Wholesale Customer for Voice and Data and Toll Free. 
good,the best company i have ever worked for.  Great pay with great benefits
good,"Days are full of excitement and challenges who keeps you awake to opportunities and rewards."
good,Centurylink is a good place to work for someone who likes to work in the office setting. I have learned to multitask and become a very intentive listener. The hardest part of the job is the sales quotas. Otherwise I love the customer service field.
good,"The culture is great. In a competitive sales environment the incentives and contest made it so fun. A lot of times a sales environment can cause tension between individuals but everyone on all the teams was so friendly and made work fun. The benefits, pay, and incentives was great. The goals were actually attainable. The only downfall was that due to service agreements and working in a phone center there was strict rules and work schedules to adhere to. This made getting to work through traffic/weather conditions tough. Unexpected time off was also hard to get approved."

good,"working for this organization was awasome great company,just loved the job all the way around"
good,A typical day at work for me is to first of all arrive on time. Then set my agenda for the day and most of the time that is done the day before. I am verify organized. I am a worker that has to get the things finished. I have very stong work ethic. Having coworkers to me give a management a chance to guide them in the growth of the company and help them to be as successful as they can be.

I answered phone calls and took care of customers that came into the business office answering questions and taking requests for service for telephone and cable tv. I was the only one in the front office with my supervisor coming out of Baraboo, WI. There were challenges of selling our products to customers. I took payments and posted them to their accounts and made daily deposits. I sorted out the mail to those in the office. I did monthly inventory on the cellular service that we offered. Selling to the customers with different languages was a challenge which made the job hard at times. Meeting my goals monthly was a challenge also as we had to push our products and it was hard to do in our small community. The enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers as I miss not being around them after 23 plus years."

Typical day for myself would start at 6am, loading jobs to our qualified technicians and balancing workloads, all done before a group phone call would take place two hours into my shift with all of the Area Plant Supervisors in the area of Colorado I helped manage. Working with these area plants supervisors (APS's) we would continue to work together throughout the day to ensure each technicians load was fair and balanced to maximize the amount of customer we would be able to help every day. "
good,Awesome place to work and learn. The employees are a wealth of knowledge who are encouraged and expected to share and grow entry level employees to assist them to find their place in the network structure.
good,"It is a creative, productive work place, but the management did not seem to have a very good vision as to how to thrive in the competitive environment. That is one main reason that caused the company to disappear"
good,"I spent a very short amount of time at Centurylink but in that time I got a good taste of the culture. The management is incredible, everyone works really hard to make sure the agents have everything they need to perform their jobs. Most of the agents were top notch, as with all places there were a handful of agents who weren't, they were easy to ignore however. In the time I spent, there was a cost of living raise that was petitioned for from the bottom up. The union worked hard to make sure we were paid what we deserved. The office itself was kept immaculate, a lovely crew of ladies working every hour to keep all the common areas spotless. The only gripe I had about CLink was the training. You're set in front of a computer to ingest article after article. It's a style of learning that only works for a select few."
good,"Once I got to work and logged on, I would begin my day by following up on past accounts I worked to verify I had corrected the billing issues on the customer account. Once that was complete, I would then enter the list of new accounts with billing issues and begin to go through the list fixing billing issues, until all issues were corrected or until the end of the work day. I also worked tax related billing issues and found where usage belonged that had nowhere to bill or wrote it off. There were a lot of different scenarios I worked as far as billing issues. Some where the same problem showing up on several different accounts, but there was also a large variety that had its own individual uniqueness that took some effort to figure out. I loved being able to challenge myself, the sense of empowerment I had over my career, and the pride I felt about my work."

They also answered all of your questions. My co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was driving all of the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to travel all over the state.
good,"Fast paced, incoming call-center environment, taking calls from business customers to determine their needs, solved their requests, complaints, general inquires all related to their phone bills, phone products & services.   Our office had an open-door policy with managers and all fellow employees worked well as a team, a real plus in an office.   Sometimes half the battle was trying to determine what exactly is the customer asking from us, then following through. I enjoyed taking calls from customers, very satisfying."

good,"Typical day at work would be pulling up about 11 different screen's everyday. Nice workflow and call center environment. I learned that everyday is a new day what you offered and sold one day and the next day it's a new grind a new hustle to get into.  The hardest part of the job is when you don't meet your 90% or above goal for that month and so forth by the third month you at risk of loosing your job. On the bright side there are your good times when you do get rewarded with daily incentives, cash prizes, and other rewards at the job."

good,"one of the best company's i have ever worked for great people and supervisors, learned allot about sales within a company while i worked for them."
good,"U S WEST was a terrific place to work with a variety of career experiences and opportunity for advancement.  When more responsibility was given, more commitment was expected.  I started as a Customer Service Representative when telephone records were on paper and stayed until years after the Bell System divestiture.  Training was provided by the company for every new communication innovation and for working through changes in the business.  Benefits were also outstanding and management was usually worthy of respect and loyalty.  Working as a manager in a bargained-for (union) environment was a valuable experience and helped me develop the ability to work toward a win-win result.  During my thirty years of service, I never considered working elsewhere, and many of my colleagues remain friends today."
good,"While working at CenturyLink my day to day job was to be on time, and answer phone calls. Each phone call was different. I had to address the customers concern, weather it be reviewing there bill or diagnosing the issue with there service. No matter how upset a customer was my job was to change there opinion of CenturyLink through my customer service, and transition into a ""top-down selling model"". I learned a vast amount of knowledge through this company. I learned that no matter how upset a customer is, they can still be sold too. It enhanced my customer service and sales ability beyond measures. My management team was the very best. Always showing concern for there employees, and providing help when it was applicable. As far as my co workers, they were all the same. By that I mean they showed up took calls, not a lot of time to interact with anyone but a customer on the phone. The hardest part of the job was the hours they had you work, it was called mandatory over time. I do not mind working earlier and getting paid more. It just conflicted with my school schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to receive acknowledgment for my ability. I always hit my sales numbers, and was the very best at what I did. It was a shame to have to resign from my position."
good,great place to work if you like call centers good hours but you take a lot of calls management was great to work with never had any complaints
good,"I worked for the WAH (work at home) Call Center part-time. CenturyLink provided great flexible hours with good benefits and plenty of room to make some extra money. They offered base pay + commission and incentives. Very fast paced environment with the luxury of working in your own home office. Although working from home, you never were alone. Management teams are always a phone call away with the option to always call the Help Desk for extra assistance or via instant message. Overall, GREAT company to work for!"
good,"A typical day for me, first thing get coffee, check email, get on the daily conference call to see if there were any after hour database issues or system outages. Basically busy all the time, especially when we had database releases coming up, which seemed to be all the time."
good,Cold calling and presented customers on competitive values to win business. I learned how to sale in a consultative manner and work with internal departments to win customers and close business. Management was supportive and provided coaching to grow and improve individual skill sets. The hardest part of the job was not having the ability to change pricing on certain products to drive sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was the compensation plan provided a great opportunity to increase income potential.

good,"The wages were great, my supervisors were the best!!"
good,"Excellent management and a great work environment. I would give this company a perfect rating if the pay was higher. However, I would rather work for a stable company that I enjoy going to everyday than make an extra dollar or two working for a company with a less enjoyable atmosphere. The people that I work with are great and I have made friends for life at this company."
